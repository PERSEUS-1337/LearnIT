    "content": "The Supreme Court has distinguished between protecting religious beliefs and actions based on those beliefs since 1879. The government can regulate actions stemming from religious belief but not the belief itself. The First Amendment prohibits laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting free exercise. In 1990, the Court reinterpreted the Free Exercise Clause in Employment Division v. Smith. The Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith lowered the level of constitutional protection for religious exercise. Laws that do not specifically target religion are not subject to heightened review under the First Amendment, making it less likely for individuals with religious objections to argue successfully for constitutional protection. The Court emphasized that legislatures are free to consider exemptions for religious exercise through the political process, even if not required by constitutional law. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) reinstated heightened protection for religious exercise after the Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith. RFRA requires a compelling governmental interest and least restrictive means for laws burdening religious exercise. State legislatures have also enacted similar protections. RFRA's legal protection is statutory and can be changed by future Congresses. The First Amendment aims to prevent government interference with religious institutions and beliefs, allowing them to address internal matters independently. The government's involvement could lead to unconstitutional probing into religious doctrine, as the Court upholds the freedom to believe without judgment on the veracity of those beliefs. Congress and the Court have refrained from defining religion specifically to avoid such entanglements. Courts avoid defining religion specifically to prevent government interference with religious beliefs. The Supreme Court uses a subjective test to determine if a belief qualifies as religious, based on sincerity and consistency. Legislative definitions of religion often use the word itself to define it, such as in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides exemptions for religious institutions, defining religion broadly to include beliefs, observances, and practices. Courts and legislatures avoid specific definitions of religion to prevent favoritism towards certain sects. General exemptions for individuals or entities with sincere religious beliefs conflicting with requirements are more likely to meet legal standards. The exemptions in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 accommodate religious objections to legislative mandates, avoiding preferential treatment and infringement on religious exercise. These exemptions serve as examples of how Congress and the courts have addressed religious objections. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It requires employers to accommodate employees' religious practices but includes exemptions for religious entities to consider religion in hiring decisions. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes exemptions for religious entities to consider religion in hiring decisions, such as for educational institutions owned or supported by a particular religion. The parameters of the exemption are not clearly defined, leading to uncertainty in some cases. Lower courts generally agree on factors relevant to deciding if an organization qualifies for exemption under Title VII, including the purpose, ownership, requirements, and extent of religious practices. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provided a standard for exemption based on religious purpose, primary engagement, public representation, and limited exchange of goods or services for money. The contraceptive coverage requirement under ACA has sparked debate over which organizations qualify as \"religious\" for legal protection. It mandates coverage for contraceptives without cost-sharing, aiming to improve public health and distribute costs equitably. Courts consider factors like purpose, ownership, religious practices, and profit motive when deciding exemption eligibility under Title VII. Some employers object to contraceptive coverage requirement due to religious beliefs. Regulations provide exemptions and accommodations for religious employers and entities with objections. Non-exempt employers must include contraceptive coverage in group health plans. Religious employers are defined as nonprofit entities exempt from providing contraceptive coverage to employees. Religious employers, defined as nonprofit entities with objections to contraceptive coverage, may qualify for an accommodation where the cost of contraceptive services is covered by the health plan issuer. To qualify, the organization must have religious objections, be organized as a nonprofit entity, hold itself out as a religious organization, and self-certify its eligibility. Entities seeking to avoid compliance with the contraceptive coverage requirement must be nonprofit organizations with religious objections, self-certifying their eligibility. Challenges have been raised by for-profit entities excluded from the regulations due to religious objections. Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, such as hotels and restaurants, with federal protection applying to entities connected to interstate commerce. Some states have broader protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodations, unlike Title II which only covers race, color, religion, or national origin. Entities with religious objections to same-sex relationships have raised concerns about lack of exemption, particularly in contexts like same-sex marriage ceremonies. Objections to equal treatment of same-sex families have also been seen in adoption, medical services, and housing. States recognizing same-sex marriage may include religious exemptions for clergy. Some states have provided religious exemptions for clergy in same-sex marriage ceremonies, but not for other officials or organizations involved in weddings. Entities with objections to serving certain sexual orientations may limit services to avoid violating public accommodations laws. For example, denying a same-sex couple access to wedding services could violate these laws. The controversy arises when entities try to exclude a particular group for the same purpose, potentially violating public accommodations laws. The U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed the eligibility of secular, for-profit corporations for religious protection, leading to a split among federal circuits. Recent cases involving contraceptive coverage mandates have brought secular entities' religious freedom rights into question. The Supreme Court is reviewing key cases on whether secular corporations can challenge religious freedom under the First Amendment or RFRA. Questions include considering for-profit status for legal protection, if owners' religious rights extend to the corporation, and if owners can pursue separate legal challenges. These questions are crucial before assessing if the contraceptive mandate imposes a burden on religious exercise. The Supreme Court is reviewing cases on whether secular corporations can challenge religious freedom under the First Amendment or RFRA. Courts have granted preliminary injunctive relief to parties seeking exemption from contraceptive coverage requirements to avoid financial penalties during litigation. This relief is based on the likelihood of success on the merits and protection of religious exercise rights. The Supreme Court is considering cases where secular corporations are seeking exemptions from contraceptive coverage requirements under RFRA. Some courts have granted preliminary injunctive relief based on the burden imposed by the mandate and the lack of compelling interest achieved by the least restrictive means. The owners of these closely held corporations operate their businesses according to their religious principles, even though they are not religious organizations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a closely held corporation founded by owners with Christian beliefs could not qualify as a religious organization under Title VII. The court stated that the religious exemption was not intended to cover businesses like the manufacturing company in the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a closely held corporation founded by owners with Christian beliefs could not qualify as a religious organization under Title VII. The court emphasized that corporations would qualify for protection under the statute's exemption only if their purpose and character were primarily religious. The company's for-profit status and production of secular products indicated its secular identity, despite the owners' religious activities. The court also recognized the owners' Free Exercise rights, which Title VII could not affect. The court found that the owners' Free Exercise rights may be affected under Title VII, but such limitation was justified by the overriding governmental interest. Owners must adjust their free exercise rights to accommodate employees' Title VII rights, allowing employees with objections to be excused from religious-based requirements within the business. The Townley decision highlights the difference in religious exemptions between religious and secular organizations. Statutory exemptions are specific to each statute, and courts have the discretion to interpret them accordingly. Congress can limit the scope of exemptions as it sees fit. The scope of statutory exemptions is determined by courts, with secular corporations challenging governmental mandates that infringe on their religious beliefs. The rights of corporations to assert legal challenges under RFRA and Free Exercise jurisprudence vary among circuit courts, with some rejecting the \"passed through\" theory. RFRA prohibits governmental burdens on \"a person's exercise of religion\" without defining person under the statute. The Dictionary Act provides guidance on the meaning of \"person\" in legislation, including corporations and individuals. Courts have ruled that secular companies cannot \"exercise religion\" and therefore cannot claim protection under RFRA, even if they challenge contraceptive coverage mandates. Secular companies are not protected under RFRA as they are not considered \"persons\" under the statute. The Sixth Circuit's interpretation of the Dictionary Act excludes corporations organized for profit from RFRA protections. The court clarified that RFRA was meant to restore free exercise protections for individuals, not corporations pursuing secular profit. The Tenth Circuit issued a surprising decision in June 2013 regarding this matter. In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court ruled that secular, for-profit corporations could be considered \"persons\" protected under RFRA, a decision supported by the Seventh Circuit. The courts found that these corporations could qualify for religious exemptions under RFRA, despite previous exclusions of secular companies from such protections. The courts rejected the argument that only religiously affiliated, nonprofit entities could claim religious exemptions. The Seventh and Tenth Circuits interpreted RFRA broadly, allowing secular organizations to seek protection for religious exercise. The Tenth Circuit suggested that some secular businesses may not qualify for RFRA protection, despite recognizing closely held companies' religious practices. The Hobby Lobby decision was limited to smaller, family-owned, closely held corporations that could demonstrate adherence to religious beliefs. The Tenth Circuit's interpretation of RFRA included both religious and secular corporations, but the eligibility of secular businesses for RFRA protection remains undecided. The eligibility of secular corporations for free exercise protections remains uncertain, as courts have not focused solely on a corporation's for-profit status but rather on its status as a secular or religious entity. The Third and Sixth Circuits have treated the characterizations jointly, finding that companies can be both for-profit and secular. The Tenth Circuit held that for-profit, secular corporations can exercise religion through religious activities. Nonprofit religious corporations are recognized for their religiously motivated activities. The Seventh Circuit noted that for-profit status does not impact a corporation's ability to claim free exercise protection. The Supreme Court has never decided if a for-profit entity's status affects its ability to claim free exercise protections. Courts have upheld free exercise rights in employment discrimination cases related to wages. The Seventh Circuit referenced a case where merchants challenged Sunday-closing laws, showing profit-making alone does not disqualify a claim. The Court's decision in United States v. Lee is also relevant. The Seventh and Tenth Circuits have both recognized that for-profit entities can claim free exercise protections, regardless of their corporate status. This was demonstrated in the case of United States v. Lee, where an Amish man sought an exemption from paying social security taxes for religious reasons. The courts emphasized that the analysis does not depend on corporate status but rather on the compelling-interest test. Religious associations can incorporate to gain legal protections while retaining Free Exercise rights. Profit-status and commercial activity are considered in eligibility for exemption under certain statutes, but for RFRA cases, the focus is on the entity's ability to practice religion. The critical inquiry is the nature of religious exercise, where for-profit status may not affect the analysis if the entity can express religious values. The for-profit status of an entity may not impact the analysis if it aligns its business with religious values. However, if the religious aspect is only aspirational and not reflected in operations, it may be argued that the business is not exercising religion. Courts would need to determine if religious beliefs are sufficient for protection under the law, a complex issue. The contraceptive coverage requirement is seen as a neutral law not targeting religious practice, potentially not subject to First Amendment protection. In 2010, the Supreme Court expanded First Amendment protection to corporations in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The decision recognized Free Speech rights of corporations but did not address the application of the religious clauses to corporations. The Tenth Circuit's decision in Hobby Lobby raised questions about the scope of First Amendment protections for secular entities. The court in Hobby Lobby relied on Citizens United to show that corporations can engage in religious expression as protected by the First Amendment. The companies' purchase of newspaper ads promoting religious beliefs was considered a form of protected religious exercise. The Supreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby applied the First Amendment logic of Citizens United to recognize a corporation's right to express political and religious beliefs. The court's ruling was based on the theory that corporations can exercise religion and qualify for protection under RFRA, without delving into the constitutional rights involved. The Seventh Circuit also supported this interpretation, focusing on statutory analysis of RFRA and avoiding a definitive definition of constitutional rights. The Tenth Circuit avoided defining the parameters of constitutional rights involved in RFRA. Other circuits disagreed, stating that the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses are distinct legal protections with separate precedential history. The Third Circuit rejected the idea that the clauses must be interpreted jointly, emphasizing the lack of historical free exercise protection for corporations. The D.C. Circuit also held that secular corporations cannot exercise religion under RFRA or the First Amendment. The D.C. Circuit ruled that secular corporations cannot exercise religion under RFRA or the First Amendment, as free exercise rights apply to individuals and religious bodies, not to companies. Companies challenging the contraceptive mandate have sought relief under the pass-through theory of corporate rights. The D.C. Circuit ruled that secular corporations cannot exercise religion under RFRA or the First Amendment. The court held that a for-profit corporation does not have rights under the Free Exercise Clause independent of its shareholders and officers. The company was seen as an extension of the beliefs of its owners, and therefore, it does not possess any free exercise rights. The D.C. Circuit ruled that a for-profit corporation does not have rights under the Free Exercise Clause independent of its shareholders and officers. Other courts have rejected the pass-through theory of corporate standing, stating that a secular organization cannot exercise religion. The Third Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's rationale on corporate standing, emphasizing that incorporation creates a distinct legal entity with separate rights and responsibilities from its owners. The court stated that any penalties from the contraceptive coverage mandate are the company's responsibility, not the owners of closely held corporations. The Third and Sixth Circuits emphasized the distinction between corporations and owners as separate legal entities, rejecting owners' ability to challenge mandates on behalf of their companies due to separate sets of legal rights. Standing to assert legal claims requires party to be injured by the challenged action. The Sixth Circuit explained that owners of a company cannot assert legal claims on behalf of the corporation, as their actions are considered those of the corporation itself. Other courts have recognized owners' rights to assert claims related to their operation of their corporations, but the D.C. Circuit held that secular organizations cannot exercise religion and therefore cannot pursue legal claims to protect such rights. Shareholder standing rules are used to determine if owners can assert free exercise claims in their individual capacity. The D.C. Circuit ruled that shareholders of secular corporations can assert claims separate from the corporation if they are injured in a way distinct from the corporation. Shareholders generally give up certain rights in exchange for the benefits of incorporation, but if the corporation cannot exercise a particular right, it would be unjust. The court ruled that shareholders of secular corporations can assert claims separate from the corporation if they are injured in a way distinct from the corporation. It would be unjust to refuse the owner's analogous right if the corporation cannot exercise a particular right. The court emphasized that a person's statutory rights under RFRA do not depend on the form of business operation chosen. Of the five circuit courts that have considered contraceptive coverage cases, some rejected the ability of parties to challenge free exercise rights, while others found at least one party had standing to pursue the claim. Some courts found that the contraceptive mandate imposed a substantial burden on religious exercise, with penalties for noncompliance considered significant. The government defended the mandate, arguing that it did not burden objecting employers. The government argues that the contraceptive coverage requirement does not burden objecting employers' religious exercise, comparing it to compensation. However, courts emphasize deference to religious objectors' beliefs and objections, citing the Supreme Court's stance on not evaluating the reasonableness of religious beliefs. The Seventh Circuit emphasized the deference owed to corporations regarding the burden of providing contraceptive coverage. The court focused on the employer's objection to paying for coverage, not the employees' use of it, in line with Supreme Court jurisprudence. The courts do not evaluate the reasonableness of religious beliefs in determining the burden on objecting employers. The courts found that the government's justifications for the contraceptive coverage requirement were not sufficiently compelling, as the stated interests of public health and gender equality were too vague. The Tenth Circuit noted that specific exemptions were not provided, in violation of Supreme Court precedent. The Tenth Circuit and D.C. Circuit criticized the government's vague justifications for the contraceptive coverage requirement, stating that the interests were not compelling and lacked specificity. The courts highlighted the exclusion of specific exemptions and the lack of a clear nexus between the mandate and public health goals. The Seventh Circuit also echoed these criticisms, suggesting that the government's general statements guaranteed the mandate's failure to meet the necessary test. The government's vague justifications for the contraceptive coverage requirement were criticized by the Tenth and D.C. Circuits, stating that the interests were not compelling and lacked specificity. The Seventh Circuit also echoed these criticisms, suggesting that the mandate would fail to meet the necessary test due to the high level of generality in stating governmental interests. The courts noted that there were less burdensome ways to promote public health and gender equality, and that the government had granted many exceptions to the mandate, making its arguments against exempting companies with religious objections unsustainable. The D.C. Circuit pointed out that the government could provide access to free contraceptive services without burdening objectors through other methods. The Tenth and D.C. Circuits criticized the government's vague justifications for the contraceptive coverage requirement, suggesting that exemptions could be granted without undermining the mandate. The D.C. Circuit noted that the government could provide access to free contraceptive services without burdening objectors through alternative methods. The Supreme Court reviewed the challenge to the social security tax program in States v. Lee, concluding that granting the exemption requested would undermine the program's effectiveness. In the contraceptive mandate case, the D.C. Circuit suggested that religious objectors could opt out without making the preventive-care statute unworkable. The Court agreed to review Conestoga and Hobby Lobby Stores, consolidating the cases to address constitutional and statutory questions regarding the ACA's contraceptive coverage requirement. The Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutional and statutory questions raised by ACA's contraceptive coverage requirement, with potential implications for free exercise rights of secular, for-profit corporations. Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged also raised religious objections to the requirement, seeking an accommodation but refusing to sign the self-certification form. In January 2014, the Court enjoined the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the requirement. In January 2014, the Court enjoined the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the contraceptive coverage requirement against Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged pending final disposition by the Tenth Circuit if it informed the HHS Secretary in writing that it was a nonprofit organization with religious objections to providing contraceptive services. The organization did not have to use the self-certification form prescribed by the federal government."
