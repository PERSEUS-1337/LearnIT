    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 1999\". The Police Athletic League aims to increase academic success, promote a safe environment under law enforcement supervision, improve school attendance, reduce juvenile crime, offer alternatives to drugs and gangs, and foster positive interactions. The Police Athletic League, with 1,700 facilities and 320 chapters nationwide, serves 1.5 million youths aged 5 to 18 in urban areas. PAL aims to create positive interactions between youth and law enforcement, prepare youth for the workplace, and has a 55-year history of being a positive force in communities. Today's youth face increasing risks, with statistics showing higher chances of violence between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. PAL chapters, despite being sponsored by law enforcement, rely heavily on private sector support. They have been successful in balancing public funds with private donations and maximizing community involvement. Many distressed areas in the United States are underserved by PAL chapters, despite the increasing risks faced by today's youth. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources for existing PAL chapters to expand services and establish new chapters in underserved areas, including those with a majority Native American population, by fiscal year 2005. In this Act, key definitions include the Assistant Attorney General, distressed area, PAL chapter, and Police Athletic League. The Act aims to support PAL chapters in underserved areas, including those with a majority Native American population, by fiscal year 2005. The curr_chunk defines \"public housing\" and \"project\" as per the United States Housing Act of 1937. SEC. 5. GRANTS AUTHORIZED. The Assistant Attorney General will award grants to the Police Athletic League for establishing PAL chapters in public housing projects and distressed areas, and expanding existing chapters to serve more youths. To be eligible, PAL must submit a long-term strategy for establishing 250 additional chapters and areas where they will be expanded in the next fiscal year. The Assistant Attorney General will review and take action on PAL's application for grants to establish new chapters and expand existing ones within 120 days of submission. The plan must include details on increasing the total number of PAL chapters to 570 by January 1, 2003, coordinating with communities for new chapters, and ensuring chapters can operate without additional federal funding once assistance is discontinued. SEC. 6. USE OF FUNDS. The Police Athletic League uses grant funds to establish new PAL chapters in public housing projects and distressed areas, or expand existing chapters. Each new or expanded chapter must offer at least 4 programs during nonschool hours, including mentoring, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. The Police Athletic League (PAL) uses grant funds to establish new PAL chapters in public housing projects and distressed areas, or expand existing chapters. The programs offered include drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, cultural and social programs, conflict resolution training, anger management, peer pressure training, job skill preparation activities, and Youth Police Athletic League Conferences or Youth Forums. PAL chapters are required to use volunteers from various organizations to serve as mentors or assist in other ways. To support the Police Athletic League (PAL) programs, volunteers are needed to mentor youth, involve the community in designing activities, conduct outreach creatively, request donations, and coordinate with local agencies to avoid duplicating funded activities. The Police Athletic League must submit reports on grant usage to the Assistant Attorney General annually. The Assistant Attorney General must report to Congress by May 1 each year on the progress of establishing PAL chapters and the effectiveness of programs in reducing drug abuse, school dropouts, and juvenile crime. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Police Athletic League is set at $16,000,000 annually from 2000 to 2004. Funding allocation includes percentages for research, technical assistance, and program administration. The Act will be effective starting October 1, 1999."
