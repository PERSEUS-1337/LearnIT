The \"Housing Our Heroes Act\" establishes a pilot grant program for homeless veterans, where the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will award grants up to $1,000,000 to eligible entities like veterans service agencies to purchase and renovate abandoned homes for homeless veterans. The \"Housing Our Heroes Act\" sets up a grant program for homeless veterans. Eligible entities like veterans service agencies can receive grants to buy and renovate homes for homeless veterans. To apply for a grant, entities must show financial stability and experience in housing development for homeless veterans. Priority is given to communities with the greatest need. The Secretary prioritizes awarding grants to eligible entities serving communities with the greatest need for homeless services. Geographic distribution is also considered to ensure a fair allocation among homeless veterans in different regions. The Secretary gives preference to eligible entities that have agreements under section 2041 of title 38, US Code. Grantees can use funds to purchase or renovate abandoned homes, with maximum amounts set based on geography. The US does not have ownership in homes purchased with grant funds. Each grantee must ensure that veterans residing in homes purchased or renovated using grant funds make monthly payments not less than 85 percent of fair market rent. Grantees decide if these payments are treated as rent or mortgage. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, determines payment requirements for grantees. Grantees must pay at least 80% of received payments to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary may audit grantees to ensure compliance. A Veterans Homelessness Grant Fund is established in the Treasury, with payments collected by the Secretary deposited into the Fund. The Secretary may use amounts deposited into the Fund to carry out the pilot program without further appropriation. The pilot program will last for three years, and the Secretary can consult with nongovernmental entities in its development. Annual reports on the pilot program must be submitted each year. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress detailing the grants awarded, amounts awarded, progress of home purchase and renovation, and number of tenants paying rent towards homes. $25,000,000 is authorized for the pilot program. A \"homeless veteran\" is defined as a veteran eligible for housing assistance under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 or receiving such services.
