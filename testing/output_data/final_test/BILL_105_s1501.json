    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Workers' Pension Protection Act\" and includes provisions for minimum guaranteed benefits in multiemployer plans. The \"Workers' Pension Protection Act\" amends Section 4022A(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to increase certain benefit amounts and make conforming amendments. The effective date for these changes applies to benefits payable after the enactment date, excluding plans that have received financial assistance. The \"Workers' Pension Protection Act\" amends Section 4022A(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 within a 1-year period ending on the enactment date. TITLE II--TREATMENT OF ASSET DEFICIENT MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS\n\nSEC. 201. FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSET DEFICIENT MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. Amends ERISA to add restrictions on asset deficient multiemployer plans. The trustees of a multiemployer plan cannot increase benefits if the plan is asset deficient. For plans not asset deficient, benefit increases are limited to maintain a funded current liability percentage of at least 90 percent. Interest rates play a role in determining these limitations. The rate of interest for determining current liabilities of a multiemployer plan is based on a specified percentage, which is calculated based on a weighted average. The rate of interest for determining current liabilities of a multiemployer plan is based on a specified percentage, which decreases annually from 1999 to 2003. The mortality table used before the first plan year with new tables is prescribed by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor determines current liability for multiemployer plans based on prevailing mortality tables. Benefits refer to all benefits for participants and beneficiaries under the plan. The term 'current liability' in a multiemployer plan refers to all liabilities to participants and their beneficiaries. 'Unfunded current liability' is the excess of current liability over the value of plan assets. The Secretary of Labor may allow for reductions in certain cases. The funded current liability percentage is defined as the percentage of the current liability under a multiemployer plan. An asset deficient plan is one with a funded current liability percentage of 95 percent or less. A conforming amendment was made to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. SEC. 202 amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regarding accrued benefits. SEC. 203 requires notice of funding status for multiemployer plans. SEC. 203 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires trustees of multiemployer plans to provide participants, beneficiaries, and contributing employers with notice of the plan's funded current liability percentage and the limits on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's guarantee in case of insolvency. The notice must be understandable to the average plan participant. These amendments apply to plan years starting after December 31, 1998. TITLE III--ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\nSEC. 301. INTEREST RATE AND MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS FOR WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY. Section 4213(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to change the interest rate and mortality tables used to determine an employer's withdrawal liability for plan years beginning after December 31, 1998. The interest rate will be determined under section 308(c) and the mortality table will be determined under section 308(d) for current liability calculations. The amendments made by this section, effective for plan years starting after December 31, 1998, will apply to determine current liability under section 308(d). TITLE IV--ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nSEC. 401. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\nAmends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to allow employers contributing to a multiemployer plan to seek injunctions or equitable relief for violations of specific sections.\n\nSEC. 402.
