    "title": "AB 1371",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California emphasizes the importance of parents and teachers in ensuring quality education for all schoolchildren. Tax relief for those who support the common good is seen as beneficial public policy. Parents often bear the cost of essential educational resources for their children. State education tax relief can help low- and middle-income families take better care of their children's learning needs. A new section, 17052.5, is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code. Section 17052.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows a deduction for qualified education-related expenses for dependent children attending grades K-12 in California. The children must meet specific requirements to qualify for the deduction. The deduction for qualified education-related expenses in California is available for dependent children under 21 years old who meet specific IRS code requirements and are claimed as dependents on the taxpayer's return. The qualified amount is limited to specified education expenses. Qualified education-related expenses in California include costs such as textbooks, school supplies, educational equipment, school uniforms, computers, college course fees, psychoeducational evaluations, and special education services for dependent children. Qualified education-related expenses in California cover special education and related services, out-of-school enrichment programs, tutoring, summer programs, and transportation for pupils under 21 years old. The expenses must not be used for trade or business purposes. A qualified taxpayer must reside in California when paying for these expenses. The household income limit for eligibility is 250 percent of the federal guidelines. The total deduction allowed for qualified taxpayers is $2,500 per year for dependent children. The total deduction allowed for dependent children shall not exceed $2,500 in a taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board may establish rules to carry out this section. This section will be in effect until December 1, 2021, and then repealed. Section 17072 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to align with the Internal Revenue Code, except for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers. Section 62(a)(21) of the Internal Revenue Code regarding attorneys fees for whistleblowers is not applicable. Section 62(a) is modified to allow deductions under Section 17052.5 for adjusted gross income. The Legislature intends to meet the findings required by Section 41 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. This act establishes a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
