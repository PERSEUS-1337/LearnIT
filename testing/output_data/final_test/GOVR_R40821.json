    "content": "H.R. 3200, America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, proposes sweeping reforms to the U.S. health insurance and healthcare system. It contains three major Divisions, 18 Titles, 51 Subtitles, and 284 Sections, including 34 Medicaid sections. The bill was referred to multiple House Committees for consideration and amendments were made by some committees before being reported. H.R. 3200 contains 18 Titles, 51 Subtitles, and 284 Sections, including 34 Medicaid sections. The three major components are Divisions A, B, and C, focusing on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, and making modifications to Medicare and Medicaid. Division B also introduces technical changes to improve quality of care. Division B of H.R. 3200 introduces technical changes to improve quality of care and expand Medicaid eligibility for traditional and non-traditional beneficiary categories up to 133\u2153% of the Federal Poverty Level. Division C focuses on amending and expanding health professions and nursing workforce programs. The report provides a discussion of the Medicaid provisions in the bill, covering eligibility, benefits, financing, waste, fraud, abuse, payments to territories, demonstrations, and pilot programs. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program with categorical and financial eligibility requirements. States operate it within federal guidelines, setting asset and income limits for participation. These limits vary across states and population groups. Medicaid has approximately 50 different eligibility pathways, with some being mandatory and others optional for states. Mandatory groups include pregnant women, children under age six with family income below 133% of the federal poverty level, and poor individuals with disabilities or over age 64 receiving cash assistance. Optional groups include pregnant women and infants with income exceeding 133% FPL up to 185% FPL, and \"medically needy\" individuals with income up to 133% of the maximum payment amount under states' former AFDC programs. H.R. 3200 introduces changes to Medicaid eligibility, including adding new mandatory and optional eligibility groups, modifying existing groups, and implementing outreach and enrollment provisions. One new mandatory group includes individuals under 65 not eligible under current categories with income up to 133\u2153% of the federal poverty level. The new \"traditional\" group under H.R. 3200 would consist of individuals under age 65 who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid but do not meet income standards. Their upper income limit would be set at 133\u2153% of the federal poverty level, with services fully financed by the federal government. Services provided to individuals covered under Medicaid waivers and those receiving coverage paid for with state funds would be fully financed by the federal government, with the federal medical assistance percentage at 100% for 2013-2014 and decreasing to 90% in 2015. Medicaid eligibility for certain newborns would be extended to include children born in the U.S up to the first 60 days of life without acceptable coverage. The federal government would also fully finance benefits for these children, with the federal medical assistance percentage decreasing to 90% in 2015. States would need to demonstrate the capacity of managed care entities before enrolling non-traditional Medicaid eligibles. H.R. 3200 includes a provision for state Medicaid agencies to coordinate with the Health Choices Commissioner to ensure Medicaid eligible individuals are enrolled in acceptable coverage without further determination. States must accept enrollment of traditional and non-traditional Medicaid eligible individuals determined by the Exchange, with the option to conduct redeterminations as outlined in the MOU. States must provide Medicaid coverage during a period of presumptive eligibility and promptly determine eligibility based on income information provided by the Commissioner. If a state Medicaid agency can determine eligibility for health insurance affordability credits, they must do so for Exchange-eligible individuals upon request. The state Medicaid agency must determine eligibility for health insurance affordability credits for Exchange-eligible individuals upon request. If a child born in the United States is not covered under acceptable coverage, they will be deemed non-traditional Medicaid eligible and enrolled in Medicaid. The state must provide Medicaid eligibility determination for such children promptly. Children born in the United States without acceptable coverage will be enrolled in Medicaid if they do not obtain coverage within a specified period. States cannot impose stricter eligibility standards than those in effect as of June 16, 2009, for Medicaid or CHIP programs. No asset or resource tests can be applied for certain Medicaid eligibility groups. The Medicaid benchmark or benchmark equivalent coverage must meet the minimum benefits and cost-sharing standards of a basic plan offered through the Health Insurance Exchange. Once the Exchange is operational, CHIP maintenance of effort requirements would end, and CHIP eligibles would receive coverage through the Exchange. States can still impose limitations, such as accepting applications or creating waiting lists. The Secretary may waive MOE provisions for dental-only separate CHIP programs to limit expenditures. Waivers can be granted for states with Medicaid or CHIP Sec. 1115 demonstration waivers that extend coverage to childless individuals for health insurance subsidies. States can amend their 1115 waivers for more restrictive eligibility without regard to Medicaid and CHIP maintenance of effort requirements. H.R. 3200 would add new optional eligibility groups to Medicaid, allowing states to amend waivers for more restrictive eligibility without regard to maintenance of effort requirements. The provision in H.R. 3200 would create new optional eligibility groups in Medicaid for pregnant women under Medicaid or CHIP state plans and certain individuals under Section 1115 waivers for family planning services. States could use \"presumptive eligibility\" to enroll individuals for a limited time before full Medicaid applications are processed. This would cover family planning services, supplies, medical diagnosis, and treatment services. The new optional eligibility groups in Medicaid would cover family planning services and supplies for pregnant women and individuals with HIV infection. States cannot provide Medicaid coverage through benchmark plans unless they include family planning services. The federal government's share of expenditures for these groups would be based on the enhanced FMAP created under H.R. 3200. The FMAP created under H.R. 3200 provides coverage for traditional and non-traditional Medicaid beneficiaries up to 133\u2153% of FPL. States must continue Medicaid benefits for certain low-income families through transitional medical assistance (TMA). Work-related TMA requires states to provide at least six months of coverage, with the option for up to 12 months. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extends work-related TMA through December 31, 2010, and H.R. 3200 would further extend it through December 31, 2012. Certain low-income individuals eligible for Medicare can have their Part B premiums paid for by Medicaid under the Medicare Savings Program. Eligible groups include QMBs, SLMBs, and QIs with specific income and asset limits. The QI program, part of the Medicare Savings Program, provides assistance to individuals with incomes between 120% and 135% of poverty who are not eligible for Medicaid. H.R. 3200 aims to extend the QI program through December 2012, with the federal government covering 100% of the costs. State allocation limits would no longer apply. H.R. 3200 would require states to provide Medicaid application processing at specified outstation locations for all applicants, including those applying for affordability credits. H.R. 3200 mandates Medicaid application processing at designated locations for all applicants, including those seeking affordability credits. States are not obligated to terminate Medicaid eligibility for inmates, but most do so. The bill requires states to maintain Medicaid coverage for certain youth during incarceration in public institutions and establish a process to prevent federal matching funds for their services. States must ensure that youth in public institutions receive Medicaid services with federal matching funds available. Medicaid enrollment for these youth must be completed before their release. Under CHIP, states can enroll low-income children in a Medicaid expansion or a separate CHIP program. CHIP eligibility must be re-determined every 12 months. Continuous eligibility allows children to remain enrolled. H.R. 3200 as amended would require separate CHIP programs to provide 12 months of continuous coverage for children in families with annual income less than 200% of the federal poverty level. States can use various factors to determine eligibility for beneficiaries, but they cannot deny coverage based on preexisting medical conditions or apply waiting periods for targeted low-income families. H.R. 3200 would prevent states from imposing waiting periods on children under two years old, those who lost coverage due to job loss or reduced work hours, or families where health insurance costs exceed 10% of income. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) included provisions for outreach and enrollment grants to facilitate access to Medicaid and CHIP. $100 million in grants were authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013, with 10% allocated to a national enrollment campaign and 10% for Native American children. The remaining 80% would go to state, local governments, and community-based organizations for outreach campaigns focusing on rural areas and underserved populations, addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. CHIPRA requires state plans to describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers to enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP. H.R. 3200 would require the Secretary to issue guidance on best practices for outreach and enrollment, targeting vulnerable populations. The Secretary is required to implement targeted outreach programs for vulnerable populations, including those with mental health disorders, substance abuse issues, and HIV/AIDS. The Secretary may collaborate with relevant entities to facilitate program implementation. Additionally, the Secretary must review and report to Congress on progress in implementing outreach, enrollment assistance, and administrative simplification methods for underserved populations. The PRWORA limited access to federal benefits for noncitizens. H.R. 3200 would make citizens of the Freely Associated States eligible for full Medicaid coverage without the five-year bar restriction for qualified aliens. Citizens of the Freely Associated States can qualify for full Medicaid coverage without the five-year bar restriction for qualified aliens if they are lawfully residing in the United States. Medicaid covers outpatient prescription drugs as an optional benefit, with states required to cover certain low-income individuals like pregnant women, children, families, the elderly, and people with disabilities. States can also extend coverage to individuals meeting these criteria but with higher income levels. State Medicaid programs can establish nominal service-related cost-sharing requirements for most beneficiaries and services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 provided a state option for beneficiary cost-sharing under Medicaid based on income levels. Cost-sharing for individuals in families with income below 100% FPL cannot exceed nominal amounts, while those with income between 100 and 150% FPL are limited to 10% of the cost of the service. Individuals with income above 150% FPL have a cost-sharing limit of 20% of the service cost. Under H.R. 3200, states have the option to disregard certain income when determining eligibility for individuals with high prescription drug costs. Eligibility for this special disregard requires being otherwise eligible for Medicaid without it. Individuals with high prescription drug costs must have exhausted all available coverage and have a health insurance plan with a minimum lifetime limit of $1 million. Under H.R. 3200, states can disregard income for individuals with high prescription drug costs. Eligibility requires exhausting all coverage, incurring annual costs for orphan drugs over $200,000, and having family income below 75% of drug costs. States may apply income disregards up to $200,000 in 2009 or 2010, adjusted for inflation. Cosmetic drug expenses are not included. Under H.R. 3200, states can disregard income for individuals with high prescription drug costs, including expenditures for orphan drugs used by the applicant. States would be required to apply Medicaid's nominal cost-sharing rules to these beneficiaries, with the option to apply additional cost-sharing up to a maximum amount specified by the Secretary. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for Medicaid and CHIP, but may be eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage for emergency conditions. H.R. 3200 specifies that unauthorized aliens are ineligible for Medicaid and CHIP but may be eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage for emergency conditions, including labor and delivery for pregnant women. Medicaid benefits cover a wide range of medical care and services, such as eyeglasses, prosthetic devices, family planning services, and pregnancy-related services. Providers can still obtain Medicaid reimbursement for emergency care provided to certain unauthorized aliens. Medicaid provides a wide range of medical services, including family planning and pregnancy-related services, through qualified medical providers participating in Medicaid. States must offer mandatory services like inpatient hospital care and physician services, with the option to include additional services like rehabilitative services and nursing facility care for individuals under 21. Medicaid also covers premium payments for managed care and provides support for Medicare premiums for dual-eligible individuals. H.R. 3200 proposes changes to Medicaid benefits, including adding new mandatory preventive services and optional benefits like nurse home visitation. It also clarifies coverage for existing optional services and makes services by podiatrists and optometrists mandatory. Medicaid covers a range of services, with some mandatory and others optional, including preventive services for beneficiaries under 21. H.R. 3200 proposes changes to Medicaid benefits, including adding new mandatory preventive services for all beneficiaries recommended by the Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services or CDC, clarifying coverage for vaccines under the VFC authority, and prohibiting cost-sharing for preventive services. The proposed changes to Medicaid benefits in H.R. 3200 include adding new mandatory preventive services for all beneficiaries recommended by the Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services or CDC, clarifying coverage for vaccines under the VFC authority, and prohibiting cost-sharing for preventive services. Physician services under Medicaid are defined by the Medicare statute and can be provided in various settings. Optional benefits for most Medicaid groups include prescribed drugs and services from other licensed practitioners. H.R. 3200 proposes expanding Medicaid benefits to include physician services from podiatrists and optometrists, effective January 1, 2010. It also adds optometrist services as a mandatory benefit under Medicaid, starting 90 days after the bill's enactment. Additionally, the bill clarifies coverage for vaccines for low-income children under the VFC program. H.R. 3200 aims to expand Medicaid benefits to include physician services from podiatrists and optometrists, with optometrist services becoming a mandatory benefit under Medicaid. The bill also clarifies coverage for vaccines for low-income children under the VFC program, including allowing public health clinics to administer vaccines. Federal regulations require state Medicaid plans to provide necessary transportation for recipients to and from providers, with a previous rule attempting to eliminate Medicaid reimbursement for school-based administrative costs and transportation to and from school. The final rule did not include transportation of school-age children between home and school. A moratorium was imposed on further action until June 30, 2008, preventing CMS from imposing stricter restrictions. The moratorium was extended twice until July 1, 2009, when the Obama Administration announced the rescinding of the final rule on school-based administration and transportation. H.R. 3200 would add non-emergency transportation to medically necessary services. The federal Medicaid law allows states to exclude coverage of certain drug classes, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines. However, states have the option to still cover these excluded drugs. Medicare Part D, implemented in 2006, covers prescription drugs for dually eligible individuals, but excludes barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required Medicare prescription drug plans to include certain Medicaid-excluded drugs. Under current law, Medicaid programs may cover tobacco cessation counseling services for pregnant women as an optional benefit. H.R. 3200 would remove tobacco cessation products from Medicaid's excluded drug list as of January 1, 2010. States can seek federal reimbursement for home visitation services under Medicaid administrative case management. H.R. 3200 proposes new options for Medicaid coverage, including nurse home-visitation services for first-time pregnant women or children under age two. States can seek Medicaid reimbursement for care coordination and case management through home visitation services under EPSDT benefits. Federal and state governments share costs based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes. The federal matching rate for administrative expenditures in Medicaid is generally 50%, but certain functions have a higher rate. States can cover language translation services as a benefit, with a 75% matching rate provided under CHIPRA for children of non-English speaking families. H.R. 3200 extends this rate to all Medicaid beneficiaries for translation and interpretation services starting in 2010. H.R. 3200 proposes adding an optional benefit for freestanding birth center services under Medicaid, including services provided by licensed birth attendants at facilities outside of hospitals for planned childbirth away from the pregnant woman's residence. The provision in H.R. 3200 allows licensed birth attendants to provide healthcare during childbirth within their legal scope of practice, regardless of supervision. Troubled youth are placed in structured environments for positive behavior through Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC), which is not specifically addressed in Medicaid law but considered rehabilitative services. States have the option to cover rehabilitation services under Medicaid. Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) is debated as a medical treatment covered under Medicaid. H.R. 3200 clarifies that states can cover TFC for Medicaid eligible children in out-of-home placements, providing specialized services to parents and children. The current Medicaid law does not specifically address adult day health care services, which are often classified as rehabilitative services. There is debate over whether these services should be considered medical treatment or more custodial in nature. CMS issued a proposed rule in 2007 to clarify the distinction between rehabilitative and habilitative services. The 1989 law prohibited CMS from penalizing states approved for habilitative services until regulations were issued. A proposed rule would withdraw prior approval of habilitative services in grandfathered states. Congress imposed a moratorium on administrative action until April 1, 2009. ARRA included a provision against promulgating a final rule for rehabilitative services. H.R. 3200 would prevent the Secretary from denying federal reimbursement for certain adult day health care services. The Secretary would be prohibited from withdrawing federal approval for certain adult day health care services under a state's Medicaid plan. Medicaid financing is shared by the federal government and states, with reimbursement rates based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). FMAPs range from 50% to 83%, with some services receiving higher federal match rates. In February of this year, states received temporary enhanced FMAP rates for nine quarters. States control Medicaid spending levels by tailoring eligibility, covered services, and provider reimbursement rates. States submit quarterly expenditure reports to CMS for federal payment. The Medicaid financing provisions in H.R. 3200 aim to reduce federal and state healthcare expenditures by affecting Medicaid purchases of prescription drugs, DSH payments, and GME payments. These changes are outlined in two Subtitles of the bill. Medicaid statute requires states to make DSH adjustments for hospitals treating uninsured individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries based on a specified formula. H.R. 3200 aims to reduce Medicaid DSH payments by $10.0 billion over three years, with the Secretary required to report to Congress on the impact of provisions aimed at reducing the number of uninsured. States must define DSH hospitals and payment formulas in their Medicaid plans, following federal criteria. In 2005, total state and federal Medicaid payments for Graduate Medical Education (GME) were estimated to be nearly $3.2 billion, representing 7% of total Medicaid inpatient hospital expenditures. CMS proposed a rule in 2007 to eliminate federal reimbursement for GME under Medicaid, but subsequent laws have placed a moratorium on this. ARRA included a provision against finalizing a GME payment rule. H.R. 3200 would authorize GME payments under Medicaid, requiring states to provide detailed information on annual GME payments for monitoring purposes. This includes reporting on institutions eligible for funding, payment calculations, supported education fields, funding goals, and state progress towards meeting these goals. H.R. 3200 authorizes GME payments under Medicaid, requiring states to report detailed information for monitoring purposes. This includes data on institutions eligible for funding, payment calculations, supported education fields, funding goals, and state progress towards meeting these goals. Additionally, the bill mandates that reported information is shared with an Advisory Committee on Health Workforce Evaluation and Assessment for review. The Secretary must issue rules on program goals for Medicaid GME payments and usage of GME funds by December 31, 2011. States have the option to make hospital GME payments under Medicaid, with these provisions taking effect upon enactment of the bill. The DRA limits states' use of provider-specific taxes to fund Medicaid, with three rules to qualify for federal matching dollars. The tax must not exceed 25% of the state's share of Medicaid expenditures, cannot guarantee return to providers, and must be broad-based. This provision applies to all Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) and was effective as of February 8, 2006. H.R. 3200 extends the effective date of the DRA MCO provider tax rule from October 1, 2009 to October 1, 2010 for states with provider taxes based on the prior Medicaid provider tax classification. This change would be effective as if included in DRA. H.R. 3200 would amend the definition of Medicaid medical assistance to include payment for care and services covered under the program. States would be required to set Medicaid payments for primary care services at 80% of Medicare rates. The provision in H.R. 3200 would gradually increase Medicaid payments for primary care services to match Medicare rates, starting at 80% in 2010, 90% in 2011, and 100% in 2012. This would apply regardless of payment method, with the federal government fully financing any increases above June 2009 rates. The state Medicaid plan must ensure efficient, economical, and quality care by setting payment rates for primary care services that align with Medicare rates. States must submit annual amendments detailing payment rates to comply with statutory requirements outlined in H.R. 3200. The Medicaid plan amendment (SPA) outlines payment rates and additional data for Medicaid managed care payments. States must comply with requirements or submit a revised amendment. Outpatient prescription drugs are an optional Medicaid benefit, with states purchasing drugs from manufacturers on behalf of beneficiaries. Medicaid law requires drug manufacturers to provide their \"best price.\" The best price provisions in Medicaid require drug manufacturers to enter rebate agreements with the Secretary on behalf of states. Manufacturers must provide rebates for drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange for coverage of all drugs by state Medicaid programs. In 2004, 550 manufacturers participated in the Medicaid drug rebate program, reporting average manufacturer prices and lowest transaction prices to CMS. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to report the lowest transaction price for drugs sold to certain private buyers. This price serves as a reference point for rebate obligations, which include a basic rebate of 15.1% of AMP or the difference between AMP and best price. An additional rebate may apply if a drug's price exceeds inflation-adjusted levels. H.R. 3200 aims to require prescription drug manufacturers with Medicaid pricing agreements to submit AMP pricing information to the Secretary within 30 days of each month of a rebate period. This legislation would prevent manufacturers from avoiding additional rebate obligations by making slight alterations to existing products. H.R. 3200 would change Medicaid rebate requirements for extended release versions of single source drugs, effective after December 31, 2009. The Secretary would still disclose weighted AMP prices on a public website, eliminating the need to update outpatient drug sales made at nominal prices. H.R. 3200 would increase the basic minimum rebate for single source and multiple source prescription drugs purchased under Medicaid rebate agreements from 15.1% to 22.1%. Medicaid law also requires the Secretary to establish an upper limit on the federal share of payments for prescription drug acquisition costs, known as federal upper payment limits (FULs) to promote the use of lower-cost generic drugs over brand-name drugs. CMS calculates and publishes FULs for aggregate state expenditures on each drug. Under the DRA provision, CMS sets FULs for Medicaid generic drugs based on AMP, which manufacturers report to CMS. National pharmacy associations challenged this rule in 2007, leading to an injunction prohibiting FULs based on AMP. The injunction stands, but HHS can share AMP data with GAO for study. MIPPA imposed a moratorium on using AMP for FULs until October 1, 2009 for Congress to consider amendments. Under H.R. 3200, FULs for Medicaid generic drugs would be calculated at 130% of the weighted average of monthly AMPs, excluding certain discounts and payments. Drug manufacturers must report total units used in calculating monthly AMPs within 30 days after a rebate period. The Secretary has authority to expedite regulations clarifying upper payment limits and AMP requirements. States receive federal financial participation for multiple source drug purchases under upper limits in effect on December 31, 2006. Service delivery mechanisms for Medicaid beneficiaries range from full-risk capitation agreements with managed care organizations to fee-for-service. MCOs under full-risk capitation agreements are paid a fixed amount for all care and are responsible for costs exceeding the fixed payments. Drug manufacturers pay states rebates for Medicaid drug purchases, excluding certain purchases. H.R. 3200 would require prescription drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs purchased for beneficiaries covered under Medicaid managed care contracts, similar to the rebates required in the FFS component of Medicaid. States can claim manufacturer rebates for drug purchases excluded from Medicaid MCO contracts. H.R. 3200 would require states to report quarterly on rebates received from prescription drug manufacturers for Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care, starting July 1, 2010. It also mandates annual state reports on Medicaid payment rates, including specific data on payment rates, methods used, justification, and opportunities for review and comment before finalization. The federal and state governments share the cost of Medicaid benefits based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) formula, which provides a minimum matching rate of 50% and a maximum of 83%. H.R. 3200 would require a new study on federal matching payments to state Medicaid programs and recommendations to Congress. The GAO would conduct a study on Medicaid programs and make recommendations to Congress regarding changes to the FMAP formula. The study would assess the impact of reducing the 50% floor or 83% ceiling, revising the formula to better reflect state fiscal capacity, and studying the administration of Medicaid by HHS and state agencies. States must create a state plan for their Medicaid programs, detailing administrative functions and expenditure amounts funded with federal dollars. The plan covers various program elements such as eligibility, covered benefits, provider reimbursement, and beneficiary cost sharing. States must adhere to federal rules and guidance, updating their plans with any program changes through a state plan amendment subject to CMS approval. Participation requirements and reimbursement rules for providers delivering services to Medicaid beneficiaries are established in the state plan. Program integrity activities in Medicaid and CHIP focus on combating fraud, waste, and abuse by providers and beneficiaries. The federal government shares costs with states for Medicaid services and administration, including efforts to reduce improper payments. The federal government provides the majority of Medicaid spending to combat fraud and abuse through various program integrity activities, including the operation of Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) and state Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCU). Congress allocated $75 million annually for the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) to fund audits, identify overpayments, and ensure payment integrity and quality of care. The DRA allocated additional funding for Medicaid activities, including $25 million annually for the HHS Office of Inspector General and $60 million for the Medi-Medi data match project. Improper payments are a measure of fraud and abuse under Medicaid, with federal agencies required to identify and report on overpayments. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated FY2008 Medicaid and CHIP composite error rates, with Medicaid at 10.5% ($32.7 billion) and CHIP at 14.7% ($1.2 billion). Improper payment measures focus on payments made in error, not fraud, which is often undetected. States establish their own payment policies for Medicaid providers. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates health care fraud losses at 3% to 10% of paid claims. Medicaid provider rates must be sufficient to ensure services are available, similar to the general population. In Medicare, hospitals are reimbursed under a prospective payment system based on diagnosis and procedures. Each admission is classified into a Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis-related group with a predetermined reimbursement amount. Patients are paid the same regardless of length of stay or treatment required. Starting in FY2008, Medicare implemented a Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) program to prevent additional payments for complications acquired during patient admissions. Hospitals were required to report certain conditions upon admission, and if these conditions were present at admission, they would not be considered acquired during the hospital stay. Additionally, in January 2009, CMS issued national coverage determinations to prevent Medicare from paying for preventable medical care errors. H.R. 3200 would require state Medicaid agencies to deny payment for Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HACs) for both dual eligible beneficiaries and other Medicaid beneficiaries, aligning with Medicare's policies on preventing payment for preventable medical care errors. Unlike Medicare, the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) did not specifically apply the HAC initiative to Medicaid. H.R. 3200 would mandate state Medicaid programs to deny hospital payments for HACs and certain preventable medical errors not covered by Medicare. States can also designate other health-care acquired conditions for non-payment. These programs must be implemented for hospital discharges starting January 1, 2010. The Medicaid Integrity Program under DRA allows the Secretary to contract entities for program integrity activities, including reviewing Medicaid service providers for potential waste, fraud, or abuse. The Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) under DRA mandates state Medicaid programs to deny hospital payments for certain preventable medical errors. It establishes conditions for entities eligible to provide MIP services and requires the Secretary to follow specific contracting requirements. The law also requires the Secretary to establish a comprehensive plan for ensuring Medicaid program integrity over five fiscal years and hire additional employees dedicated to program integrity activities. Additionally, eligible entities are required to report on MIP fund expenditures and achievements to Congress annually. H.R. 3200 mandates eligible entities to conduct periodic evaluations of their MIP contract activities and submit annual reports to the Secretary. State Medicaid plans must require compliance programs for participating providers and suppliers, including written policies, designated compliance officers, fraud training, and a mechanism for reporting. The bill mandates compliance programs for providers and suppliers, including training, reporting mechanisms, disciplinary guidelines, monitoring, and corrective action initiatives. The Secretary can impose penalties for violations and pilot test the compliance program requirement. The bill mandates compliance programs for Medicaid providers and suppliers, with the Secretary able to pilot test the requirement on high-risk categories first. Sanctions can be imposed for non-compliance, including termination from Medicaid participation or civil monetary penalties. States have 60 days to recover overpayments before federal payment adjustments are made. H.R. 3200 extends the period for states to repay overpayments to one year for fraud cases. Medigap insurance policies help cover items not included in Medicare, with minimum medical loss ratios required. Some states also impose medical loss ratios on insurers in certain markets. H.R. 3200 would require that federal Medicaid and CHIP payments to states for certain Medicaid managed care organizations be contingent on meeting specific requirements, such as maintaining patient encounter data and written policies for adult enrollees. The bill would mandate that Medicaid and CHIP payments to states for Medicaid managed care organizations are dependent on meeting requirements, including maintaining patient encounter data and written policies for adult enrollees. MMCOs must have a medical loss ratio of at least 85% and report patient encounter data as specified by the Secretary. Providers convicted of certain criminal offenses related to healthcare delivery would be excluded from Medicare or Medicaid program participation. Providers convicted of felony offenses related to healthcare fraud, theft, embezzlement, breach of fiduciary responsibility, or controlled substance violations may be excluded from Medicare or Medicaid participation. The Secretary can also exclude individuals involved in prohibited acts like program-related convictions or license revocation. H.R. 3200 requires states to terminate federal financial support when provider participation is terminated for specified reasons. H.R. 3200 would require states to exclude providers from Medicaid and CHIP participation for specified reasons, such as unpaid overpayments or affiliation with suspended entities. States must operate an automated claims processing system to administer Medicaid plans, meeting various requirements such as compatibility with Medicare systems and providing timely data. H.R. 3200 would mandate states to submit new data elements for detecting waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid. The Secretary requires providers under Medicaid to disclose ownership information for entities with 5% or more interest. This is to detect waste, fraud, and abuse. The Secretary must establish a process for enrolling providers of services and suppliers, requiring Medicaid agents to register with the state and the Secretary. Failure to register will result in denial of Medicaid federal financial participation. States must deny Medicaid assistance payments in specified circumstances, such as reimbursement for non-covered expenses. Under H.R. 3200, the Secretary would deny payment for litigation expenses with sanctions for misconduct. CMS processes Part B Medicare claims using correct coding initiative to ensure accurate reimbursement. Medicare contractors use automated edits to detect incorrect information in claims. H.R. 3200 would require Medicaid claims to incorporate methodologies compatible with Medicare's National Correct Coding Initiative to detect and prevent improper coding for federal reimbursement. The Secretary would need to identify CCI methodologies compatible with Medicaid claims and notify states on how to incorporate them into their processing systems. A report to Congress would be required to include the notice given to states and analysis supporting the identification of CCI methodologies for Medicaid claims. Medicaid in states is an individual entitlement with no federal payment limits, while territories have annual spending caps leading to service suspensions when caps are reached. Federal share for Medicaid costs is determined by FMAP based on state income levels. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) is set between 50% and 83% for states based on income levels. Territories typically have a 50% FMAP. Territories were given a choice under ARRA for FMAP increase or spending cap increase. American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands operate under Section 1902(j) waivers since 1983 and 1989, respectively. The provision in H.R. 3200 aims to increase spending caps in territories for FY2011 through FY2019, with a requirement for a transition plan by October 1, 2013 to achieve full parity in financing with states by FY2020. The plan includes details on modifying existing Medicaid programs and FMAP rates for each territory. The Secretary would apply the formula to states and make recommendations on increasing mandatory ceiling amounts for territories before FY2020. Per capita income data for territories would be used to calculate FMAP percentages, with recommendations on parity with states starting in FY2020. Subsequent reports to Congress in 2015, 2017, and 2019 would track progress on achieving these actions. The governments of each territory have made efforts to achieve Medicaid parity in financing transition plans. FMAP rates for territories would be set at the highest applicable to any state for fiscal years 2011-2019. Waiver authority under Section 1902(j) would be extended to all territories starting in FY2011. Technical assistance would be provided to upgrade computer systems for reporting requirements. The concept of a medical home involves a holistic model of care centered around a primary care physician (PCP) who supervises and coordinates patient care. This model includes basic care, specialty care coordination, and reimbursement for non-billable services. CMS is conducting a chronic care coordination project focusing on medical homes. The Medicare Medical Home Demonstration project, mandated by TRHCA, aims to provide coordinated care to high-need Medicare beneficiaries through 400 practices as medical homes. Medicaid has limited experience with medical home programs, but some federal programs support the creation of medical homes in Medicaid through HIT infrastructure funding. The creation of medical homes in Medicaid is supported by Medicaid Transformation Grants and the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) initiative, which provide funding for information technology infrastructure and enhance Medicaid Management Information Systems capacity. Despite federal funding, most medical home activity in Medicaid is state-initiated and state-funded. The National Academy for State Health Policy identified 34 medical home programs in 31 states for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries. H.R. 3200 proposes a five-year medical home pilot program for high-need Medicaid beneficiaries, with $1.2 billion in federal funds allocated. The pilot would utilize specified medical home models or others approved by the Secretary. H.R. 3200 proposes an accountable care pilot program under Medicaid, with increased matching percentages for administrative expenditures. The program would apply models from the Medicare program to encourage care process redesign and reward high-quality, efficient physician practices. Qualifying accountable care organizations would include certain physician groups, and an evaluation of the pilot program would be conducted by the Secretary. The Medicaid ACO project proposed in H.R. 3200 aims to test payment incentive models for qualifying ACOs, including physician groups, hospitals, and providers. A best practices network would be established for sharing strategies on quality improvement and care coordination. The project would last five years, with increased federal matching rates for administrative services up to 90% for the first two years and 75% for the remaining three years. An evaluation report on the impact of the payment model would be submitted to Congress and made public. Medicaid does not reimburse for treatment in institutions for mental disease (IMD), except for patients under 21 and over 65. IMDs are defined as facilities primarily treating mental diseases. Hospital-based IMDs with emergency departments must provide medical screening exams for individuals requesting treatment. If a medical emergency is found, appropriate care must be provided. The hospital-based IMD must provide medical screening exams for individuals to determine if a medical emergency exists. If so, they must provide further treatment or transfer the individual to another facility. H.R. 3200 proposes a Medicaid demonstration project to reimburse certain IMDs for services provided to Medicaid eligibles in need of medical assistance for stabilizing emergency medical conditions, with defined criteria for what constitutes an emergency medical condition. The Secretary would establish a mechanism for in-stay review. The Secretary would establish a mechanism for in-stay review to determine stabilization of patients with emergency medical conditions. Eligible states would manage benefits under the project through utilization review and medical necessity criteria. Up to $75 million would be appropriated for FY2010, allocated quarterly based on availability and the FMAP formula. The Secretary would allocate funds quarterly based on availability and the FMAP formula for the demonstration project. Annual reports to Congress on the project's progress and impact on health services and Medicaid enrollees are required. The final report must include data on increased access to inpatient mental health services, lengths of stays, and reduction in emergency room visits. Recommendations will also be provided. The final report for the demonstration project must include a recommendation on its continuation and expansion nationally. Federal assistance is provided to low-income individuals to help with Medicare Part D costs. To qualify for the Part D low-income subsidy, beneficiaries must meet income and resource limits set by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The Commissioner of Social Security conducts outreach efforts to identify individuals eligible for assistance under MSP and LIS programs. Starting January 1, 2010, data from the LIS application is transmitted to state Medicaid agencies to initiate MSP benefits applications. States are required to accept transmitted data. H.R. 3200 clarifies that the date of electronic transmission of low-income subsidy program data to the state Medicaid Agency constitutes the date of filing for benefits under the MSP. States must process Medicaid applications promptly. H.R. 3200 clarifies that the date of electronic transmission of low-income subsidy program data to the state Medicaid Agency constitutes the date of filing for benefits under the MSP. The law prohibits federal funding for individuals not lawfully residing in the United States. Section 1115 waivers are considered part of a state's Medicaid or CHIP plan for federal reimbursement. The provision in H.R. 3200 clarifies that Medicaid coverage under a Section 1115 demonstration waiver is part of the state plan. CHIPRA aimed to improve care quality for children under Medicaid and CHIP by developing health measures and reporting formats. Grants were provided for evidence-based measures in pediatric care. H.R. 3200 mandates the development of quality measures for maternity care and services for adult Medicaid beneficiaries aged 21-64. Standardized reporting formats will be required for managed care entities, providers, and practitioners to report these measures to the Secretary. The Secretary would develop quality measures for maternity care and services for adults aged 21-64 under Medicaid and CHIP, consulting with academic institutions and stakeholders. A report on data availability and recommendations for improving care would be submitted to Congress annually starting in 2013. $40 million would be appropriated for these activities over five years starting in FY2010."
