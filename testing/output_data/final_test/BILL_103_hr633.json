    "content": "The text introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing deductions for home health care and adult day and respite care expenses for individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related brain disorders. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows deductions for home health care and adult day respite care expenses for individuals with a qualified dependent in their household. A qualified dependent is defined as an individual who resides in the taxpayer's principal residence for more than 180 days and is a member of the taxpayer's household. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows deductions for home health care and adult day respite care expenses for individuals with a qualified dependent in their household. A qualified dependent must be a member of the taxpayer's household, dependent on the taxpayer, and physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves due to Alzheimer's disease or a related brain disorder. Qualified expenses include household services for the dependent. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows deductions for home health care and adult day respite care expenses for individuals with a qualified dependent in their household. The taxpayer can deduct reasonable and necessary expenses for household services and care of the dependent if they are incapable of caring for themselves. The term 'physician' is defined as per the Social Security Act, and special rules apply for maintaining a household. The deduction for home health care and adult day respite care expenses can be claimed if half the household maintenance cost is provided by the individual or the individual and their spouse. If married, a joint tax return must be filed. A physician's certification of Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and the individual's incapacity to care for themselves is required. Coordination with other sections of the tax code is necessary. The deduction under this section applies if the taxpayer elects its application and the amount cannot be used for other credits or deductions. The deduction is allowed in arriving at adjusted gross income according to Section 62(a) of the tax code. The deduction for qualified home health care and adult day and respite care expenses is allowed by inserting a new paragraph after paragraph (13) in the tax code. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code. Sec. 220 allows for deductions for home health care and adult day/respite care expenses for dependents with Alzheimer's or related brain disorders. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 1992."
