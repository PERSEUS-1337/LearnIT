The \"CONNECT Act\" authorizes grants for collaboration between state child welfare and juvenile justice systems to address challenges faced by dual status youth. The \"CONNECT Act\" authorizes grants to enhance collaboration between state child welfare and juvenile justice systems for programs addressing the needs of dual status youth. Grants are awarded from available funds for a period of 2 to 5 fiscal years, extendable upon application. The \"CONNECT Act\" allows for grant extensions of up to 2 fiscal years upon request. States must submit an application detailing a leadership collaboration group to be eligible for a grant under this subsection. The curr_chunk discusses the need for states to address practices to improve outcomes for dual status youth, including identifying these youths, individuals at risk of becoming dual status, common characteristics, and prevalence in the state. The state aims to screen and assess dual status youths for risks and treatment needs, provide targeted services, and enhance information sharing while maintaining confidentiality. The State must maintain confidentiality and privacy protections under State and Federal law. They must also involve local governments in the development of policy reforms for dual status youths. Any funds received should supplement, not replace, existing State expenditures on these youths. The State child welfare and juvenile justice agencies must submit a joint report to the Secretary and the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention detailing activities conducted under the grant, including information on the dual status youth population and evidence-based practices used. The agencies must submit a report detailing activities and procedures used for dual status youth, including data collection and analysis. The report must include information on case processing timelines, case management, targeted services, placements in foster care or juvenile justice system, and their impact on educational attainment for dual status youths. The Secretary may support State child welfare agencies and State juvenile justice with training and technical assistance to improve outcomes for dual status youths, such as fewer delinquency referrals, shorter stays in restrictive placements, and other identified outcomes. The program offers training and technical assistance to State child welfare and juvenile justice agencies to enhance collaboration and work effectively with Federal agencies and agencies from other States. The Secretary and the Attorney General must submit a report every 3 years to the Committee on Finance. The program provides training and assistance to State child welfare and juvenile justice agencies for collaboration. A report on grants must be submitted to specific Senate and House committees. Definitions for \"dual status youth\" and \"leadership collaboration group\" are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the involvement of various agencies and organizations in collaboration efforts, including the State juvenile justice agency and State child welfare agency. The State juvenile justice agency is responsible for administering grant funds under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, while the State child welfare agency administers programs under subpart 1. The curr_chunk amends sections of the Act by specifying the responsible agency for administering programs."
