    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit Act\" and introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the Carbon Sequestration Investment Credit. The Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit Act introduces a credit for eligible taxpayers investing in approved carbon sequestration projects. The credit is based on the amount of carbon sequestered in the project and the percentage of total investment attributed to the project. The Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit Act offers a credit to eligible taxpayers for investing in approved carbon sequestration projects. The credit is based on the investment attributable to the taxpayer and is limited to 50% of the total investment. There is also an annual limitation on the total credit allowable for all eligible taxpayers investing in the project. The Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit Act limits the credit dollar amount allocated to projects approved by the implementing panel to $200,000,000 per calendar year. Allocation must be made by the end of the year when the project proposal is approved. Eligible taxpayers can claim the credit for investing in approved carbon sequestration projects.

A taxpayer must not have elected the application of certain sections of the International Carbon Conservation Act for the project to be eligible. If a recapture event occurs during the 30-year period of a project, the tax for that year will be increased by the credit recapture amount. The credit recapture amount is determined by a percentage based on when the recapture event occurs during the project's 30-year period: 100% in the first 10 years, 66 2/3% in the second 10 years, 33 1/3% in the third 10 years, and 0% thereafter. The recapture event for a carbon sequestration project can occur if the taxpayer violates project approval terms, adopts defeating practices, or disposes of ownership interest linked to the project. The implementing panel can attribute recapture events to the project unless they determine it won't harm the carbon sequestration project. Events beyond the taxpayer's control, as decided by the panel, are not considered recapture events. Special rules apply to tax benefits from credits used to reduce tax liability. Unused credits will adjust carryforwards and carrybacks. No tax credits against tax increase under this subsection. Basis of investment in carbon sequestration project reduced by credit amount.
