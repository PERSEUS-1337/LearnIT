    "content": "The new section 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code allows for estate tax deferral if real property is managed under a habitat conservation agreement. The executor can elect to apply a section allowing a deduction for qualified real property in the taxable estate for estate tax purposes. Qualified real property is defined as property with an agreement to maintain it according to habitat conservation concerns with the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Commerce, or a State environmental agency. The owner must maintain the property according to habitat conservation agreements approved by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce. If the owner disposes of the property or breaches the agreement, an additional tax is imposed. The additional tax imposed on property disposition or breach equals the difference between the estate tax amount and what would have been imposed if the excluded real property value was included in the gross estate. The additional tax imposed on property disposition or breach is calculated based on the difference between the estate tax amount and what would have been imposed if the excluded real property value was included in the gross estate. If the disposition, breach, or termination occurs within 2 years of the decedent's death, interest is applied on the tax amount using the underpayment rate established under section 6621. The owner can avoid additional tax by transferring property to a transferee who agrees to assume obligations, liabilities, and notify the relevant authorities. The transferee must assume obligations and liabilities to avoid additional tax. The statute of limitations for assessing additional tax shall not expire before 3 years from notifying the Secretary of the tax liability.
