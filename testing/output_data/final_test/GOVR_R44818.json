    "content": "The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs reported the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 1181) introduced by Representative David P. Roe. The bill clarifies conditions for veterans and survivors under the Gun Control Act of 1968. The House passed H.R. 1181 by a vote of 240 to 175. The FBI established NICS for background checks on gun buyers, querying databases for criminal history. The Brady Act authorizes the Attorney General to obtain information on individuals prohibited from owning firearms. ATF assists in implementing information sharing. The ATF defined \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" to include individuals deemed dangerous or lacking mental capacity by a court. Since 1998, the VA has provided records to the FBI for the NICS Index on beneficiaries with appointed fiduciaries. The VA appoints a fiduciary for beneficiaries deemed \"mentally incompetent\" under veterans law, making them \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" under the GCA. The VA notifies the beneficiary of the proposed rating and their right to appeal, but did not always inform them of the impact on firearms eligibility. Since 2007, the VA has been required to notify beneficiaries of mental incompetency determinations and potential loss of gun rights, providing an avenue for appeal and rights restoration. The 21st Century Cures Act codified VA procedures related to mental incompetency and gun rights. Since 2008, some Members of Congress have criticized VA procedures for mental incompetency determinations and gun rights, particularly the criteria for firearms ineligibility. Various proposals were considered in Congress from the 110th to the 113th Congresses, with related amendments in the 114th Congress following mass shootings. In the 115th Congress, a measure was passed to vacate a final rule by the SSA on NICS referrals for Social Security disability. Under H.R. 1181, the VA would be prohibited from determining beneficiaries with fiduciaries as \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for gun control unless ruled a danger by a judicial authority. Supporters argue VA procedures are insufficient to justify restricting Second Amendment rights. Supporters of H.R. 1181 argue that VA procedures unfairly restrict Second Amendment rights, as beneficiaries must meet a higher standard to regain gun rights than to be deemed mentally incompetent. Opponents claim the VA complies with federal laws and protects public safety through NICS referrals to the FBI. The VA procedures aim to protect beneficiaries from potential harm related to firearms due to mental incompetency. Supporters of H.R. 1181 argue that the bill's provisions are only prospective, while opponents fear it could allow mentally ill VA beneficiaries access to firearms in the future. Supporters of H.R. 1181 argue that the bill would require a judicial ruling to find seriously mentally ill VA beneficiaries a danger to themselves or others for future determinations and NICS referrals. They believe existing VA procedures unfairly stigmatize the mentally ill as perpetrators of violence, despite research showing they are more often victims. The bill may raise oversight issues for Congress, as the Attorney General would still need to obtain prohibiting records from federal agencies under the Brady Act and NIAA. The bill H.R. 1181 raises questions about how the VA would handle NICS referrals for mentally ill beneficiaries. FFLs initiate background checks through NICS, and only they can use the system after completing ATF Form 4473. This bill sets a precedent for other federal agencies providing disability benefits. The FFL verifies the identity of customers using government-issued ID documents and both parties attest to the truthfulness of information on ATF Form 4473. Providing false information on the form carries criminal penalties. The GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms or ammunition, including those convicted of crimes, fugitives, and unlawful drug users. The Gun Control Act (GCA) prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms or ammunition, including those convicted of crimes, fugitives, and unlawful drug users. Additionally, there are specific categories of prohibited persons, such as those adjudicated as \"mental defective,\" unauthorized immigrants, persons dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces, and individuals under court-order restraints related to domestic violence. It is also illegal to sell or dispose of firearms or ammunition to these prohibited persons. The Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms or ammunition, including those convicted of crimes, fugitives, and unlawful drug users. The Act also prohibits the sale of firearms or ammunition to prohibited persons. Prohibited individuals can petition the Attorney General for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore their firearms eligibility, but a policy rider has prevented funding for processing such petitions since FY1993. As a result, the only way for a person to regain firearms eligibility is to have their civil rights restored or criminal records expunged. Over a 16-year period from 1999-2014, there were over 202.5 million NICS transactions, resulting in over 167.5 million background checks for firearms transfers or licenses. There were over 2.5 million initial denials, with about one-third of denials appealed and one-in-seven of those overturned. The NICS Section completed nearly 93.5 million background checks, resulting in nearly 1.17 million initial denials, or 1.2% of total checks. In a 16-year period from 1999-2014, there were over 202.5 million NICS transactions, resulting in 2.5 million initial denials, with 16,669 based on mental health-related issues. The percentage of denials based on mental health concerns has increased in recent years due to federal efforts to enhance information sharing between the FBI and state/local authorities. In 2014, there were 90,895 denials, with 3,557 based on mental health issues. In 102,468 denials, 3,134 were based on mental health involuntary commitments or adjudications, accounting for 3.1% of total denials. The ATF led discussions in 1996 and 1997 to define \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for gun control purposes, resulting in a final rule on June 27, 1997. This rule includes criteria such as being a danger to oneself or others, lacking mental capacity, or being found insane in a criminal case. The term \"committed to a mental institution\" refers to a formal court or lawful authority commitment of a person to a mental institution involuntarily for mental defectiveness, mental illness, or other reasons. It does not include voluntary admissions or admissions for observation. \"Mental institution\" encompasses various facilities providing diagnoses of mental retardation or mental illness by licensed professionals. The ATF's final rule included VA beneficiaries deemed \"mentally incompetent\" in the definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" The VBA provided disqualifying records for 88,898 VA beneficiaries to the FBI for NICS implementation in November 1998. The VA provided disqualifying records for 88,898 beneficiaries to the FBI for NICS implementation in November 1998. VA beneficiaries were considered \"mentally incompetent\" if they lacked the mental capacity to manage their own affairs. The VA used these determinations to appoint a fiduciary to manage their benefits. Beneficiaries were notified of the proposed rating and had the right to request a hearing and submit evidence. The VA did not inform beneficiaries of the potential loss of gun rights due to a determination of mental incompetency. The Veterans Health Administration rarely submitted disqualifying records to the FBI for inclusion in NICS, especially for reasons like PTSD. Veterans with PTSD or other conditions who were involuntarily committed to a VA facility are ineligible to possess firearms under federal law, but the VHA does not consistently make referrals regarding this issue. The VA did not inform beneficiaries of potential loss of gun rights due to mental incompetency determinations. While the VHA does not consistently refer disqualifying records to the FBI, they did submit VBA records on \"mentally incompetent\" veterans to the NICS mental defective file in 1999 and 2000, sparking controversy. Critics argued that veterans were unaware of losing their Second Amendment rights, while VA spokespersons cited compliance with the Brady Act as the reason for providing these records. In response to criticism, VA spokespersons defended their actions, stating they were required by law to provide records to the FBI. The controversy resurfaced in 2007 after a mass shooting at Virginia Tech, where the assailant had previously been evaluated for mental health issues. Virginia state law at the time only referred \"inpatient\" court orders for mental health treatment to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index. Following the Virginia Tech mass shooting, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) to encourage states to provide records related to individuals disqualified from acquiring firearms, including those with mental health adjudications. The act establishes incentives for states to share these records with the Attorney General. The NIAA allows the General to waive grant match requirements or reduce law enforcement assistance grants based on a state's compliance with bringing firearms-related disqualifying records online. Gun rights advocates opposed the act, fearing veterans with PTSD could permanently lose their gun rights. Congress included a provision in NIAA requiring agencies to inform individuals beforehand if they could lose their gun rights due to mental incompetence. Agencies were also required to establish a firearms disabilities relief program. The Bureau of Justice Statistics awarded $109.8 million in NICS improvement grants to state and local governments from FY2009 through FY2016. There were 298,571 prohibiting records related to mental incompetency in the NICS index as of January 1, 2007, with state and local authorities contributing 53.4% of those records. By December 31, 2016, there were 4,658,676 active prohibiting records on mental incompetency in the NICS index. State and local authorities contributed 96.3% of the 4,487,573 records in the NICS index as of December 31, 2016. The number of records contributed by state and local authorities increased by 2,715% from 2007 to 2016. Federal agencies, mainly the VA, contributed 171,083 records to the NICS index by December 2016. The SSA established a program similar to the VA's, but had not referred any records to the FBI before Congress vacated its rule. NIAA included provisions for federal departments to submit disqualifying records to the FBI for NICS inclusion. The NIAA amends the Brady Act to require federal departments and agencies to provide information on individuals prohibited from possessing firearms to the FBI for inclusion in NICS. It mandates quarterly updates and corrections to maintain record accuracy, with the Attorney General submitting an annual compliance report to Congress. The NIAA requires the Attorney General to ensure accuracy and confidentiality of information in NICS, develop electronic systems with states for court order notifications, and prohibits sharing mental health records unless certain conditions are met. The NIAA requires that individuals who have been found to no longer suffer from a mental health condition or have had their adjudication based solely on a medical finding of disability, without a hearing, can apply for relief from the disability that makes them ineligible to possess firearms. The NIAA allows individuals with mental health conditions to apply for relief from firearm possession disability within 365 days, triggering judicial review if unresolved. Relief and review standards are outlined in 18 U.S.C. section 925(c). Persons granted relief are deemed to have no underlying events for mental health records. The NIAA allows individuals with mental health conditions to apply for relief from firearm possession disability within 365 days, triggering judicial review if unresolved. The VA has contributed the bulk of federal records in the NICS index related to individuals adjudicated as mentally defective, leading to restrictions on purchasing firearms. The VA has the authority to determine the competency status of beneficiaries receiving VA benefits and appoint a fiduciary for those deemed incompetent. Beneficiaries determined to be incompetent are reported to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS, based on the VA's definition of a \"mentally incompetent person.\" The VA can determine the competency of beneficiaries and appoint a fiduciary for those deemed incompetent. A \"mentally incompetent person\" is defined by the VA without considering violence propensity. The VA must have clear medical evidence or a definite expression of incompetency to make a determination. Federal regulations require that a beneficiary be notified by the VA about the agency's proposed determination of incompetency, with information on the impact on firearm rights. Beneficiaries can contest the determination and inclusion in the NICS. VA's determination of incompetency follows due process and appeals procedures. The VA's determination of incompetency follows due process and appeals procedures, including notice, the opportunity for a hearing, presenting evidence, and being represented by counsel. Dissatisfied beneficiaries have the right to a hearing before the Board of Veterans Appeals. The VA's determination of incompetency allows for a hearing before the Board of Veterans Appeals and judicial review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Beneficiaries can also seek relief from the VA's decision to report their name to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS, with the burden of proof on the beneficiary. The VA must consider various evidence when deciding on a veteran's request for relief from being reported to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS. Relief can be denied if there is clear evidence of danger, but can be granted if there is evidence showing the beneficiary is not a threat to the public. The VA's decision to deny relief can be reviewed by a U.S. District Court. The Senate and House considered proposals regarding gun control and mental incompetency for veterans. Amendments were blocked, but a provision addressing VA procedures was included in an enacted bill. On December 3, 2015, an amendment was proposed during Senate consideration of a bill to amend veterans law and prohibit the VA from sharing records of mentally incompetent veterans with the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index without certain notification and review conditions being met. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs would have been required to notify beneficiaries deemed mentally incompetent for VA purposes about the implications of such a determination. The Manchin-Toomey amendment proposed the establishment of a board by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to review the firearms eligibility of VA beneficiaries deemed mentally incompetent. This board would consider factors like honorable discharge or decoration in determining if an individual can safely possess firearms. The Manchin-Toomey amendment proposed the establishment of a board by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to review the firearms eligibility of VA beneficiaries deemed mentally incompetent. A beneficiary who received a determination from the board would have been permitted to seek judicial review in federal court. If a beneficiary did not request review within 30 days, they would have been considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for firearms eligibility purposes. This would have implications on the Secretary's ability to make a NICS referral during this period. The Manchin-Toomey amendment required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide written notice to VA beneficiaries deemed mentally incompetent, allowing for administrative review and appeal within 90 days of enactment. Policies and procedures for determining mental incompetence were to be reviewed and revised to ensure individuals voluntarily turning over financial affairs to a fiduciary were not considered \"adjudicated mentally defective\" for firearms eligibility. The Manchin-Toomey amendment aimed to prevent individuals voluntarily turning over financial affairs to a fiduciary from being considered \"adjudicated mentally defective\" for firearms eligibility. The amendment was introduced in the 113th and 114th Congress but was blocked on procedural grounds. In the 114th Congress, Senator Christopher Murphy and Senator Charles Grassley offered amendments related to the ATF's definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" in firearms legislation. The Senate blocked Murphy's amendment, while Grassley's amendments aimed to replace the term with \"mentally incompetent\" and provide new definitions in the Gun Control Act. During the 114th Congress, Senator Grassley submitted an amendment regarding NICS referrals to the FBI, but it was blocked. Another amendment aimed to prohibit the VA Secretary from making NICS referrals without a judicial order, but it was not voted on. Congress later included provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act related to the VA's actions. Congress included a provision in the 21st Century Cures Act that amended 38 U.S.C. to prohibit the VA Secretary from making certain determinations of mental competency about VA benefits claimants without notifying the claimant, providing an opportunity for a hearing, allowing the presentation of evidence, and the right to be represented by counsel. The 21st Century Cures Act amended 38 U.S.C. to give VA benefit claimants the right to contest mental incompetency determinations with evidence and counsel at an administrative hearing. Following the Newtown shooting, the DOJ required SSA to report certain beneficiaries with a representative payee due to mental impairment. SSA implemented the NIAA on December 19, 2016, specifying conditions for reporting. The final rule issued by SSA on December 19, 2016, specified conditions for reporting Social Security or SSI disability beneficiaries' disqualifying records to the NICS. It outlined the notification process for affected individuals and the appeals process for relief from federal firearms prohibitions. Compliance was required by December 19, 2017. The ATF proposed regulations to further clarify individuals falling under this definition, but it has not been finalized. The NICS index is not meant to be a registry of all individuals with mental illness. The legislative history shows Congress overturning a SSA rule on firearms restrictions for certain individuals. The House and Senate passed a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 40) to block the rule, which was signed into law by President Trump (P.L. 115-8). This effectively vacated the SSA rule. Efforts were made to collect electronic records on individuals adjudicated as mentally defective or committed to mental institutions for gun control purposes to implement the Brady Act and develop NICS. The ATF defined \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" in consultation with the VA and the Department of Justice. VA procedures for determining mental incompetency were considered substantive for this purpose. The SSA initially deemed procedures for determining mental incompetency not substantive enough for gun control purposes. After the Newtown shooting in 2012, the White House directed the SSA to reconsider. The 21st Century Cures Act codified VA procedures related to mental incompetency determinations for gun rights. The SSA published a final rule in December 2016 establishing procedures for determining mental incompetence for certain disability compensation beneficiaries, which differed slightly from VA procedures. The SSA rule would have tied mental incompetence to diagnosed mental impairments and included age limits for NICS referrals, making it less inclusive than VA procedures. The SSA final rule differed from VA procedures in determining mental incompetence for disability compensation beneficiaries. Congress vacated the SSA rule with H.R. 1181, questioning the criteria for making mental incompetency determinations for gun control. The VA and SSA may need to establish new policies and procedures for mental incompetency determinations for gun control purposes. Questions arise about placing cases before a magistrate or judicial official and the obligations of the SSA under the GCA. The enactment of H.R. 1181 and the vacated SSA rule add complexity to the issue. The VA and SSA may need to establish new policies and procedures for mental incompetency determinations for gun control purposes. Questions arise about whether other federal departments should contribute records to NICS for mentally incompetent beneficiaries. It is unclear how existing VA procedures or the possible enactment of H.R. 1181 would impact state and local governments submitting records. The possible enactment of H.R. 1181 could impact state and local governments submitting records on mentally incompetent individuals for gun control purposes. There is a lack of consensus on the criteria for including such records on the NICS Index. Similar proposals have been reported in previous Congresses. In the 110th Congress, Senator Richard Burr introduced the Veterans' 2nd Amendment Protection Act, which aimed to prevent veterans, surviving spouses, or children who are mentally incapacitated from being considered mentally defective for gun control purposes without a judicial finding of danger. This language was later included in the Veterans' Medical Personnel Recruitment and Retention Act of 2008 but was not further considered by the Senate. Senator Burr reintroduced his proposal (S. 669) in the 111th Congress to change the impact of being determined mentally incompetent on firearm eligibility under federal law. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee reported the bill on June 16, 2009, including details about VA beneficiaries deemed mentally incompetent. The evidence gathered under VA regulations informs a judgment on a beneficiary's ability to manage VA benefit payments, not on their danger to themselves or others. Beneficiaries are entitled to a hearing before VA personnel, not an independent authority. VA has shared information with NICS on over 116,000 individuals with appointed fiduciaries, but updated information on additional names added or removed since October 2007 was not provided. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee approved a proposal to amend a draft bill in 2010, but Senate leadership did not further consider it. VA beneficiaries make up the majority of individuals referred to the FBI by the Federal government. The Boozman amendment was included in the reported version of the bill (H.R. 6132). The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 allows veterans to appeal if their names are added to the NICS list due to needing a fiduciary appointed. In the 112th Congress, a bill regarding veterans, mental incompetency, and firearms eligibility was passed by the House but not enacted. Representative Denny Rehberg introduced the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act in 2011. Denny Rehberg introduced the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 1898) to prevent the VA from determining mental incompetence for gun control without judicial authority. The bill was successfully added as an amendment to H.R. 2349 in 2011. The full committee reported the bill (H.Rept. 112-241) including testimony from the Reserve Officers Association. The Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs hearing on July 7, 2011, highlighted concerns about VA assigning labels of \"mentally incompetent\" to veterans without due process, leading to their placement on the NICS list. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 1898) was introduced by Denny Rehberg to address this issue and prevent the VA from making such determinations without judicial authority. The Committee is concerned about a process that allows non-judicial authorities to label individuals seeking help from the VA as threats without proper evaluation. Legislation has been introduced to address this issue, such as the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, but further action has not been taken. H.R. 602, introduced by Representative Jeff Miller, aims to prevent individuals receiving disability compensation from being deemed mentally incompetent for federal firearms eligibility without a judicial order. Senator Burr reintroduced a similar bill (S. 572), which faced opposition from the Administration. The bill, S. 572 and H.R. 602, aims to exclude VA determinations of incompetency from the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. VA opposes the bill, stating that current statutory authority provides adequate protections for Veterans deemed incompetent. Individuals determined incompetent by VA can have their firearms rights restored through a process outlined in the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. VA has relief procedures in place for individuals adjudicated incompetent to have firearms rights restored if they pose no threat to public safety. The reliance on an administrative incompetency determination for prohibiting firearm possession is not unique to VA or Veterans. The bill would exempt certain VA mental health determinations from prohibiting individuals from possessing firearms under Federal law, creating a different standard for Veterans. Amendments regarding veterans and firearms were proposed during Senate consideration of the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, but were ultimately rejected. The Manchin-Toomey amendment, rejected by a recorded vote of 54-46, would have required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify mentally incompetent beneficiaries of their firearms eligibility implications. This amendment had more specific requirements than the Burr amendment, which was also rejected. The Grassley amendment (S.Amdt. 725) aimed to substitute the term \"mentally incompetent\" for \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" in certain laws, potentially narrowing the scope of individuals referred by the VA to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file. This change could have required the VA to revise its policies regarding NICS referrals for mentally incompetent veterans. The Grassley GOP substitute amendment, aimed at changing the term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" to \"mentally incompetent\" in laws, was rejected by a recorded vote: 52-48 (Record Vote Number: 98). It is uncertain if this amendment would have had a wide effect on state procedures, as a comprehensive review of state NICS referral procedures for mentally incompetent persons has not been conducted by any federal agency. Few states may have adopted administrative procedures similar to VA's regarding mental incompetency and NICS referrals."
