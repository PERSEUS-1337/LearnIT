    "content": "The challenge of learning disentangled representation through variational auto-encoder methods has been heavily influenced by randomness and hyper-parameter choices. This work builds upon previous frameworks but focuses on improving reconstruction performance, network capacity, and training steps to achieve effective disentanglement. The success of unsupervised learning relies on effective disentanglement of real-world data. The key idea is to find representations that are independent of each other and align with the ground truth factors. This involves building the best disentangled model through competition and ensuring a one-to-one mapping to the ground truth disentangled factor. Recent works in disentanglement representation learning focus on enforcing independence of representations and aligning them with ground truth factors. Various metrics like FactorVAE, Mutual Information Gap, DCI metric, IRS metric, and SAP score have been proposed to evaluate disentanglement performance. However, these methods are influenced by randomness and hyper-parameter choice. Instead of designing a new regularization term, the approach is to use FactorVAE while improving reconstruction performance. The approach aims to enhance the reconstruction performance of FactorVAE by increasing the capacity of the encoder and decoder networks, leading to improved alignment with ground-truth factors. Additionally, increasing training steps resulted in significant improvements in evaluation metrics. The final FactorVAE architecture is detailed in Figure 1, building upon previous work but with different settings. The contribution includes emphasizing the importance of reconstruction performance for learning disentangled representations and achieving state-of-the-art results in the competition. In this section, different disentanglement learning models are explored, including BottleneckVAE, AnneledVAE, DIPVAE, BetaTCVAE, and BetaVAE with 30000 training steps. The experiment focuses on the role of capacity in disentanglement, with the hypothesis that larger capacity leads to better reconstruction and reinforcement of disentanglement. The performance of various VAEs is presented in stage 1 of the competition, with FactorVAE achieving the best result at 30000 training steps. In the experiment, FactorVAE was chosen as the base model and achieved the best result at 1000k training steps. Increasing model capacity led to better disentanglement performance. A study on the effectiveness of latent variables showed positive results with FactorVAE and the DCI metric as latent variables increased. The importance of choosing an appropriate number of latent variables was highlighted. In an empirical study on disentangled learning, experiments were conducted with different methods, selecting FactorVAE as the base model. Performance was improved by increasing model capacity and training steps. Results were competitive, with VAE maximizing evidence lower bound to approximate distributions. Lower bounds of variant VAEs consist of Reconstruction Loss + Regularization, with details provided in Table 4."
