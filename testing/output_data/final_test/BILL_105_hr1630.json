    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ferry Intermodal Transportation Act\" and pertains to ferries. The Congress finds that ferries are a critical transportation component in many communities, providing vital services for passengers and vehicles where other alternatives are insufficient. Ferries offer alternatives to modes facing capacity constraints, require less costly infrastructure, reduce single-occupancy vehicle traffic, and are flexible in their operations. Ferry transportation is vital for communities, offering innovative and successful operations in urban areas. The Department of Transportation emphasizes promoting modes of transportation that align with national interests such as clean air and energy reduction. It is an important component of the national transportation system that should be supported in applicable communities. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study of ferry transportation in the United States and its possessions to identify existing ferry operations, including locations, routes, vessels, funding sources, and economic impact, as well as potential domestic ferry routes. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study to identify potential domestic ferry routes in the United States and its possessions, including locations, routes, capacity estimates, capital and operating costs, economic impact, and potential for high-speed ferry services. A report on this study will be submitted. The Secretary will submit a report on the study results to the relevant committees. Following this, they will meet with metropolitan planning organizations to discuss the study findings and available resources for ferry services. Funding details are outlined in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act authorizes $18,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for ferry services until 2002. Amendments allow for private ownership and leasing of ferries. The Secretary of Transportation may guarantee the payment of obligations for ferry operations in the transportation of passengers or passengers and vehicles in the United States and its possessions under standards equivalent to those of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936.
