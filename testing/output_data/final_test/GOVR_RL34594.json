    "content": "The 2008 farm bill, known as the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, became law despite President Bush's veto. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is now implementing the new law, which includes farm commodity programs for major crops like wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and soybeans. The bill also introduces important policy changes compared to prior legislation. The economic rationale for these programs is to address market imbalances caused by consumers not responding efficiently to price changes. Imbalances in food demand and supply contribute to volatile farm income, leading to inadequate resource adjustments by farmers. Federal commodity programs aim to stabilize farm incomes but are criticized for distorting production and favoring larger producers. Federal commodity programs aim to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting risks to the government, focusing on short-term market price instability and longer-term capacity adjustments. These programs began during the 1930s Depression-era to raise farm household income and have evolved into direct income support payments for specific farm commodities. Critics acknowledge the challenges in achieving stability for agriculture due to underlying economic conditions. The current programs for agriculture are criticized for distorting world production and trade, with high subsidies that raise production costs and benefit only a few commodities on large farms. Initially aimed at stabilizing farm incomes, these programs have not adapted to the changing landscape of farming, where farmers now make up less than 2% of the population. In recent decades, farming has changed significantly with fewer farmers making up less than 2% of the population. Most agricultural production is now concentrated in fewer, larger, and more specialized operations. About 8% of farms generate 75% of farm sales, with 175,000 farms averaging over $1 million in sales. Many of the country's 2 million farms are part-time, and operators often rely on off-farm jobs for income. Supporters of commodity subsidy programs acknowledge criticisms but highlight the need to address distorting subsidy programs and trade barriers in other nations. Landowners and rural communities are concerned about potential negative impacts on rents, wealth, and the real estate tax base if subsidies are reduced. Large farms receive most production-linked subsidy payments, arguing that lower input costs and marketing efficiencies make them more efficient than small farms in producing bulk commodities. The USDA operates farm commodity programs under three permanent laws, including the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, the Agricultural Act of 1949, and the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act of 1948. Congress typically amends these laws through multi-year omnibus farm bills to address market conditions and budget constraints. If a new farm bill is not enacted, we would revert to the permanent laws for commodity programs. Eligible commodities would be affected under permanent law. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) supersedes previous commodity programs and suspends relevant price support provisions of permanent law. Federal support exists for about two dozen farm commodities, with five crops accounting for 90% of payments. About 66% of payments go to 10% of recipients, with \"covered commodities\" being the primary eligible crops. Farmers receive payments for \"covered commodities\" such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and others. Direct payments are tied to historical production, while counter-cyclical and marketing loan payments help when market prices are low. Dairy prices are supported through federal purchases of nonfat dry milk and butter. The 2008 Farm Bill provides support for dairy prices through federal purchases of nonfat dry milk, butter, and cheese. Producers also receive a MILC payment when prices fall below a target price. Sugar support is indirect through import quotas and domestic marketing allotments, with no direct payments made to growers and processors. Meats, poultry, fruits, vegetables, nuts, hay, and nursery products do not receive direct support in the commodity title of the farm bill. The bill defines a producer as an owner-operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper who shares in the risk of producing a crop. The federal regulations define \"actively engaged in farming\" as providing capital and labor, complying with conservation and planting rules, and sharing in the crop produced. Modern farming involves owned and rented land, with common rental arrangements being cash rent and share rent. Landlords under cash rental contracts receive fixed rent and bear no production risk. The tenant bears all production risk, receives harvest and government subsidy. Under share rental contracts, tenant supplies labor and machinery, landlord supplies land. Both share risk, harvest, and government subsidy. Government payments often pass to landlords, raising land prices. About 60% of government program acres are rented. The 2008 farm bill includes commodity programs with three types of payments: Direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing assistance loans. These payments are subject to limits and income eligibility requirements. The bill continues the framework of the 2002 farm bill with some modifications. The 2008 farm bill includes modifications to commodity programs, such as direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan programs for the 2008-2012 crop years. It introduces a pilot revenue-based counter-cyclical program (\"ACRE\") and adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities. The law also revises payment limitations, creates a pilot program for planting flexibility, and eliminates benefits for farms with fewer than 10 acres of program crops. The 2008 farm bill introduces modifications to commodity programs like direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan programs for the 2008-2012 crop years. It includes a pilot revenue-based counter-cyclical program (\"ACRE\") and adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities. The law also revises payment limitations, creates a pilot program for planting flexibility, and eliminates benefits for farms with fewer than 10 acres of program crops. Regarding trade classification, the United States, as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), made agricultural policy commitments under the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture. All WTO members must submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the WTO, subject to specific limits. The United States has a total spending limit of $19.1 billion per year for trade-distorting programs at the WTO. Direct payments, amounting to $5 billion annually, are fixed payments based on historical production for eligible commodities like wheat, corn, and soybeans. Farms receive direct payments based on their \"base acres.\" Direct payments to farms are fixed based on historical production for eligible commodities like wheat, corn, and soybeans. Each farm has base acres and a direct payment yield for each commodity, allowing planting flexibility without the obligation to grow the covered commodity. This flexibility aims to respond to market signals and reduce government intervention in production. Direct payments to farms, classified as \"green box\" subsidies, help countries comply with trade agreements by not counting against subsidy ceilings. However, challenges have been raised regarding planting restrictions on fruits and vegetables, questioning the program's green box status. Despite calls for revision during the 2008 farm bill debate, direct payment rates per commodity remained the same as in the 2002 bill, with a 2% reduction for crop years 2009-2011. The law includes a 2% reduction in direct payments for crop years 2009-2011 by changing the ratio of base acres. Advance direct payments will be eliminated starting in the 2012 crop year, resulting in budget savings of about $1.1 billion in FY2012. Participants in the ACRE counter-cyclical program will still receive direct payments, but the amount will be reduced by 20%. The 2008 farm bill introduces the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program as a revenue-based counter-cyclical option for farmers. It aims to provide support during years with natural disasters when yields are low and prices are high. ACRE makes payments when actual revenues fall below a market-based revenue guarantee, offering an alternative to traditional price-based programs. Eligible commodities include wheat, corn, and grain. The 2008 farm bill introduces the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program as a revenue-based counter-cyclical option for farmers. It aims to provide support during years with natural disasters when yields are low and prices are high. ACRE makes payments when actual revenues fall below a market-based revenue guarantee, offering an alternative to traditional price-based programs. Eligible commodities include wheat, corn, grain, sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, peanuts, soybeans, and other oilseeds, plus four new pulse crops beginning in 2009. Traditional counter-cyclical payments compensate for the difference between a crop's target price and a lower effective market price. The United States has classified them as \"amber box\" when reporting agricultural. The 2008 farm bill introduces the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program as a revenue-based counter-cyclical option for farmers, providing support during low-yield, high-price years. It includes new commodities and adjusts target prices, with some receiving increases and others remaining unchanged. The cotton target price decreases, new crops are added in 2009, and target price increases are delayed until 2010. The 2008 farm bill introduces the ACRE program as a revenue-based option for farmers, offering support during low-yield, high-price years. Participants can choose between traditional counter-cyclical payments or ACRE starting from the 2009 crop year. ACRE participants receive reduced direct payments and lower loan rates. Once enrolled in ACRE, farmers cannot switch back to traditional payments for the duration of the farm bill. The ACRE program in the 2008 farm bill offers revenue-based support for farmers during low-yield, high-price years. It is available for the same crops as traditional counter-cyclical payments but is based on planted acres. ACRE may be preferred by farmers in high-price environments and states with larger yield increases or more variable yields. Two triggers need to be met to receive an ACRE payment. To qualify for an ACRE payment, two conditions must be satisfied: the state revenue for a supported crop must be below the state-level revenue guarantee, and an individual farm's revenue for the crop must be lower than the farm's benchmark revenue. This ensures that payments are only made to farms that have experienced a significant loss. The revenue guarantee amounts are calculated based on guaranteed prices and production levels, with benchmark yields determined by Olympic averages over five years. Price guarantees are based on the higher of the marketing year price or the marketing loan rate. The revenue guarantee is set at 90% of the average benchmark yield. The ACRE program provides a revenue guarantee of 90% based on benchmark yield and price guarantee. Payments are triggered when state revenue falls below the guarantee and individual farm revenue is lower than benchmark revenue. Payments are calculated based on the difference between actual and guaranteed revenue, multiplied by a percentage of planted acreage. The maximum payment rate is 25% of the ACRE guarantee. The House-passed farm bill (H.R. 2419) introduced a state-level pilot revenue counter-cyclical program, which differs from the national-level program. State-level payments are more frequent due to smaller areas being more likely to fall below average production. The moving average revenue guarantee may lag behind market changes, potentially leading to higher outlays if market prices decline. The ACRE program has faced criticism for incorporating historically high market prices into its guarantee, potentially resulting in large payments to farmers if prices decrease from current record highs. The Administration is considering using prices from 2006 and 2007 instead of 2007 and 2008 for the ACRE program in 2009, causing debate with Congress over congressional intent and potential lower revenue guarantees to reduce federal outlays. The CBO used years to score the farm bill. The final outcome of the ACRE program dispute is pending due to missing regulations. Marketing loans offer interim financing for farmers by using harvested commodities as collateral. Loan deficiency payments provide cash options for selling grain based on market signals. Marketing loans guarantee minimum prices on actual crop production. The United States classifies direct or counter-cyclical payments as \"amber box\" subsidies tied to historical bases, dependent on current production and market prices. National-level loan prices are set by the farm bill and adjusted to reflect local market differences. Commodities eligible for marketing loans include those for direct and counter-cyclical payments, plus ELS cotton, wool, mohair, and honey. Sugar assistance is provided through commodity loans under a separate provision. The 2008 farm bill continues the nonrecourse marketing loan program with changes in loan rates for various commodities. Participants in the ACRE counter-cyclical program remain eligible for marketing loans and LDPs, but loan rates will be reduced by 30% as required. Loan rates for the 2008 crop year remain the same as under the 2002 farm bill, with increases not occurring until the 2010 crop year. The farm bill maintains the beneficial interest rule, allowing farmers to lock in their LDP at low market prices and sell at a higher price later. Advocates argue that if farmers can sell above the support price, government support may be unnecessary. The LDP determination is now tied to when a farmer loses beneficial interest. The loan repayment rate is calculated using a 30-day average of market prices to reduce market timing strategies. The 2008 farm bill introduces an \"economic adjustment assistance\" payment for domestic users of upland cotton. The 2008 farm bill introduces an \"economic adjustment assistance\" payment for domestic users of upland cotton, set at 4 cents per pound from August 1, 2008, to July 31, 2012, and 3 cents per pound thereafter. Payment limits exist for farm commodity programs, including a maximum amount per year and an adjusted gross income (AGI) limit added in the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill makes changes to payment limits. The 2008 farm bill introduces changes to payment limits, including tightening the limits by reducing the AGI limit, eliminating the \"three-entity rule,\" and requiring \"direct attribution\" of payments. Limits are relaxed by eliminating any limit on marketing loans. These new rules do not take effect until the 2009 crop year and address questions about farm size, payment distribution, and regional impacts. South and West regions have more large farms and are more affected by payment limits, especially cotton and rice farms. Supporters of tighter limits argue that large payments lead to farm consolidation, higher land prices, and disadvantage smaller family farms. Tighter limits could indirectly benefit smaller farms by reducing expansion incentives and helping new farmers access land. Critics believe large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly. Critics and supporters debate farm payment limits, with urban lawmakers increasingly in favor of limits. Advocates for smaller farms argue against large payments to farms, while critics believe all farms need support, especially during market price declines. The 2008 farm bill sets an annual limit of $105,000 for direct and counter-cyclical payments combined, with $40,000 for direct payments and $65,000 for counter-cyclical payments. The 2008 farm bill allows for payments to be doubled to $210,000 for a sole proprietor's farm by having a spouse. Corporations, partnerships, and trusts are eligible for payments, but must be attributed to a living person by the fourth level of ownership. Marketing loan gains and LDPs are unlimited in the 2008 farm bill, with separate limits for peanuts. Both the House and Senate bills chose to eliminate limits on marketing loans altogether in response to concerns from cotton and rice growers. The 2008 farm bill terminates the use of commodity certificates for repaying marketing loans after the 2009 crop year. It eliminates the limit on marketing loans and introduces a $210,000 limit for payments, allowing spouses to double a farm's payment limit. The bill also removes the \"three-entity rule\" for doubling payments. The 2008 farm bill allows spouses to double a farm's payment limit by dividing income for the AGI test. It replaces the \"three-entity rule\" with \"direct attribution\" for payment limits, attributing payments to living persons based on ownership shares in entities. The 2008 farm bill introduces new measures for AGI limits, including adjusted gross non-farm income and adjusted gross farm income. If a three-year average of non-farm AGI exceeds $500,000, no program benefits are allowed, and if farm AGI exceeds $750,000, direct payments are not allowed. The 2008 farm bill sets AGI limits for program participants, with \"hard\" caps on income sources. For example, farmers with non-farm AGI over $500,000 lose program payments, while those with AGI between $750,000 and $1.25 million can still receive benefits if income is split to stay below caps. Married couples can combine AGI limits up to $2.5 million. The 2008 farm bill sets AGI limits for program participants, with \"hard\" caps on income sources. Married couples can combine AGI limits up to $2.5 million, but the allocation of income between spouses and by types of income needs to be legitimate. Data on the effects of payment limits are scarce, but a report from the Payment Limits Commission showed that 1% of producers were affected by the $40,000 limit on direct payments in 2000, resulting in a reduction of $83 million. The 2008 farm bill introduced AGI limits for program participants, with \"hard\" caps on income sources. Data showed that 1% of producers were affected by the $40,000 limit on direct payments in 2000, resulting in a reduction of $83 million. California and Texas accounted for 36% of the reduction, with only a few hundred farmers affected by the AGI cap. Reorganizing farms could legally avoid these limits, with about 20% of rice farmers doing so in 2007. The 2008 farm bill aimed to lessen reorganization for avoiding payment limits by eliminating the three-entity rule and applying direct attribution to living persons. The 2008 farm bill introduced AGI limits for program participants to prevent reorganization of farm businesses to avoid payment limits. USDA data indicated that a small percentage of farm operator households had AGI over $200,000 and received farm program payments, with higher percentages for rice and cotton farms compared to corn and soybean farms. Supporters of the AGI proposal argued that farmers could manage income taxes to keep taxable farm income lower using tax incentives and rules. The 2008 farm bill introduced AGI limits for program participants to prevent reorganization of farm businesses to avoid payment limits. Supporters argued that farmers could manage income taxes to keep taxable farm income lower using tax incentives and rules. There have been multiple votes on payment limits since 2002, with proposals for further tightening, but none successfully enacted into law. The Administration also proposed a major tightening of payment limits in its 2007 proposal for the farm bill. The Administration proposed a $200,000 AGI cap in the 2007 farm bill. Various bills and amendments by Senators Dorgan, Grassley, and Klobuchar aimed to revise payment limits, with some receiving floor votes since 2002. Representative Kind also included payment limits in his floor amendment for the commodity title. Grassley/Dorgan introduced an amendment to the 2008 Senate farm bill regarding payment limits. In 2007, Grassley/Dorgan and Klobuchar introduced amendments to the Senate farm bill to lower payment limits. Despite receiving majority votes, they did not reach the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster. Representative Kind's amendment to revise commodity programs and tighten payment limits failed in the House 2007 farm bill. The amendment to tighten payment limits, including a $250,000 cap for everyone and $125,000 unless 66% of AGI came from farming, failed by a vote of 117-309. Various attempts to tighten payment limits in previous farm bills and budget reconciliation efforts have not been successful. The 2008 farm bill eliminates direct and counter-cyclical payments to farms with fewer than 10 base acres, except for socially disadvantaged or limited-resource farmers. The restriction aims to prevent payments to non-farmers, particularly hobby farmers who receive most of their income from non-farm jobs. The 2008 farm bill restricts payments to farmers with fewer than 10 base acres, excluding non-farm landowners of larger farms. Implementing this provision may reduce recipients of farm programs and increase average payment size. Policy differences have emerged regarding combining farm parcels before the 10-acre rule is enforced. The statute does not explicitly mention aggregating acreage, leading to differing interpretations between Congress and the Administration. The USDA strictly interprets the statute on aggregating acreage for farm payments, disregarding the conference report language that allows for aggregation of farms with 10 base acres or less. This has led to some farmers being denied participation in commodity programs due to regulations prohibiting reconstitutions of farms under 10 acres unless under the same ownership. The USDA's strict interpretation of farm payment aggregation rules has caused issues for farmers with 10 acres or less. Producers are prohibited from receiving payments if their farms have 10 acres or less, and farm combination reconstitutions are not approved for such farms. Congress has addressed this issue with bill H.R. 6849 to suspend the 10-acre requirement for the 2008 crop year. The bill H.R. 6849, passed by both the Senate and the House on September 29, 2008, awaits the President's signature. It suspends the 10-acre requirement for the 2008 crop year, allowing farms with less than 10 acres to receive payments. The enrollment period for the commodity program is extended beyond the original deadline of September 30, 2008, until November 14, 2008, or 45 days after enactment. The $9 million cost is offset by reducing funds for information technology upgrades supporting the crop insurance program. H.R. 6849 reduces funding for the new permanent disaster program for FY2011 by $6 million. Changes include treating minor acreages and grazing land, establishing a minimum loss threshold of 10 percent for crop payments, and preventing payments solely due to price reductions. The bill suspends the 10-acre requirement for one year, with plans for a longer-term fix in the next Congress. The House Agriculture Committee reported an earlier version of H.R. 6849 on September 19, 2008, which aimed to suspend the 10-acre provision for two years. A similar bill, S. 3538, was introduced in the Senate on September 23, 2008. The House offset the cost with reductions to the information technology account for crop insurance, while the Senate bill had no offsets. The bill would have added a third exception to the 10-acre requirement for farms that combine with others operated by the same person. The 2008 farm bill included a 10-acre restriction that was estimated to save $88 million over 10 years. However, H.R. 6849 would reduce the number of farms excluded by this requirement, potentially eliminating the savings. The definition of \"farm\" in USDA regulation and implementation practices plays a significant role in the impact of the 10-acre minimum requirement. Farmers can adjust their farms based on various actions, affecting the provision. The use of terms like aggregation in the report language for the 10-acre provision also influences the policy differences. The USDA's definition of a \"farm\" under Farm Service Agency regulations involves one or more tracts of land considered a separate operation, with tracts not needing to be contiguous. Multiple tracts can be treated as one farm if they have the same operator and owner, allowing one producer to operate several \"farms\" by renting or owning land in different tracts. This practice is more common with cash rental arrangements than share rental agreements. The USDA defines a \"farm\" as one or more tracts of land considered a separate operation, with the same operator and owner. Reconstitution is the process of combining or dividing tracts for commodity programs, minimizing the number of farms per operator. Aggregation, not used by USDA, is either a synonym for reconstitution or another means of combining acreage without formal reconstitution. The USDA defines a \"farm\" as one or more tracts of land considered a separate operation, with the same operator and owner. Reconstitution is the process of combining or dividing tracts for commodity programs, minimizing the number of farms per operator. Aggregation, not used by USDA, is either a synonym for reconstitution or another means of combining acreage without formal reconstitution. Congress may be allowing USDA to create a new way to combine farms without triggering reconstitution, affecting a small number of base acres. The estimated savings from this provision are up to $9 million per year, totaling $88 million over 10 years, which is less than 0.1% of expected commodity title outlays. The 2002 farm bill defined 1.9 million \"farms\" with base acres, but only 1.3 million \"producers\" were found, indicating some farms were combined into single operations. The 2002 and 2008 farm bills show little change in the number of producers on farms. There are 2.1 million farms based on agricultural sales, but only 531,000 received non-conservation farm payments in 2002. The 1.9 million farms with base acres in FSA's definition suggest aggregation of farms into operating units. Some farms with less than 10 acres may be growing fruits and vegetables without subsidies, indicating potential exclusions if broader reconstitution is allowed. The planting restriction on fruits and vegetables under the direct payment program may exclude some farms if broader reconstitution is allowed for farms under 10 acres. This restriction aims to protect unsubsidized growers from competition but may impact the classification of direct payments as non-distorting. The WTO has deemed restrictions on direct payments for fruits and vegetables as inconsistent with minimally distorting subsidy rules. The 2002 farm bill led to a shortage of acres for growing fruits and vegetables due to soybeans' eligibility for direct payments. Growers and processors proposed \"farm flex\" to allow flexibility in growing fruits and vegetables without penalties. The 2008 farm bill introduced a pilot program for planting flexibility for fruits and vegetables for processing. The 2008 farm bill introduces a pilot program for planting flexibility for fruits and vegetables for processing in seven Midwestern states, allowing farmers to temporarily plant base acres in specific crops like cucumbers, green peas, and tomatoes. This program results in lower direct and counter-cyclical payments for the year but restores base acres for the next crop year. The pilot program introduced in the 2008 farm bill allows planting flexibility for fruits and vegetables in seven Midwestern states, reducing direct and counter-cyclical payments for the year. However, it does not address concerns over WTO compliance and restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables remain outside the pilot program. The Administration had proposed eliminating fruit and vegetable planting restrictions completely. The 2008 farm bill addresses concerns about farm programs making payments to non-farmers by requiring USDA to reconcile program recipients' social security numbers with a database. This provision aims to prevent non-farm homeowners from receiving farm commodity payments for land not in production, such as residential developments on land with rice base acres. The bill eliminates base acres for land developed for non-agricultural uses, ensuring that payments are directed towards active farmers. The USDA will reconcile social security numbers of program recipients with a Social Security database twice a year to ensure beneficiaries are alive and estates do not continue to qualify indefinitely. Regulations will specify how long a deceased person's estate may qualify for benefits, with a previous two-year limit in place. The 2008 farm bill provision aims to address payments to deceased farmers or their estates beyond the two-year regulation, increasing enforcement to prevent misuse of farm commodity programs. Commodity program outlays have varied significantly from 1981 to 2007, ranging from $3.3 billion to $27 billion annually. The average outlay was $11.1 billion per year, with forecasts for 2008-2017 at $7.4 billion annually due to high commodity prices. The new provisions in the 2008 farm bill are expected to result in five-year savings compared to the 2002 farm bill. The new provisions in Title I of the farm bill are expected to result in a five-year savings of $1.726 billion and a 10-year savings of $1.658 billion. The total expected cost of Title I is $41.628 billion for FY2008-2012 and $85.521 billion over 10 years. The largest savings come from a shift in the timing of direct payments, with about $1.1 billion of payments being shifted into a later fiscal year. The new provisions in the farm bill aim to save money by reducing direct payments, changing payment timing, and implementing new ACRE payments. These changes are offset by costs for ACRE payments, economic assistance for cotton users, and higher target prices for certain commodities. The total savings over five years are estimated at $1.726 billion, with a 10-year savings of $1.658 billion."
