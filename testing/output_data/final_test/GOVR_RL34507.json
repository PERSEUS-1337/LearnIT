    "content": "The DD Act provides federal financial assistance to support community-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities. Its programs aim to maximize work potential, promote independent living, and protect legal rights. Coordination among SCDDs, independent living centers, and P&A programs is encouraged to advocate for individuals with DD. The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) aims to coordinate services, advocate for individuals with developmental disabilities, and protect their legal rights. The federal agency overseeing DD Act programs is the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD). The DD Act was originally part of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963, renamed in 1978 and reorganized in 1984. The Act was last reauthorized in 2000 (P.L. 106-402), with appropriations expiring in FY2007. Reauthorization legislation has not been introduced in the 111th Congress. The term \"developmental disability\" now refers to functional limitations that appear before adulthood. The DD Act defines it as a severe, chronic disability attributable to mental or physical impairments, manifesting before age 22, likely to continue indefinitely, and resulting in substantial limitations in major life activities. The DD Act defines developmental disability as a severe, chronic disability attributable to mental or physical impairments, appearing before age 22, resulting in substantial limitations in major life activities. It emphasizes the need for lifelong or extended services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities to achieve independence and economic self-sufficiency. This report outlines programs authorized under Title I of the DD Act to provide services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities, including health care, education, employment training, and civil rights protection. Federal funds are used to assist state governments, local communities, and private organizations in offering these services. Funding history and allotments for programs are detailed in tables and appendices. Each state and U.S. territory receives federal funding to establish a SCDD, which develops a comprehensive statewide plan for delivering services to individuals with DD and their families. SCDD members are appointed by the governor and must be representative of the state's population. SCDDs have the flexibility to use funding for advocacy activities promoting independent living and social integration. The SCDDs receive federal funding to establish a comprehensive statewide plan for individuals with DD. Funding can be used for advocacy activities promoting independent living and social integration, with minimum allotments for states and territories based on population and financial need. The SCDDs receive federal funding for advocacy activities to protect the rights of individuals with DD. Minimum allotments for states and territories are based on population and financial need, with matching funds required on a federal-state basis. P&A programs investigate abuse and neglect incidents and have the authority to defend the rights of individuals with DD. The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-230) mandate protection and advocacy for individuals with DD. P&A systems in the United States receive funding based on state, territory, and tribal allocations. Minimum allotments are set at $200,000 for states and $107,000 for territories. Other federal laws also mandate P&A programs for vulnerable populations. The DD Act mandates protection and advocacy for individuals with developmental disabilities. P&A programs receive funding based on state, territory, and tribal allocations. University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service provide training, technical assistance, and engage in research to meet the needs of people with DD. They facilitate the flow of research findings and disability-related information. University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service (UCEDDs) educate policy makers, employers, and community leaders about opportunities for persons with disabilities to live independently and lead productive lives. UCEDDs receive discretionary grants for five years, with existing centers having priority for funding. There are 67 UCEDDs in the U.S. and territories, receiving $542,000 annually. The program aims to enhance the independence, productivity, and social inclusion of people with developmental disabilities through grants to public nonprofit institutions. Projects of National Significance (PNS) funded by ADD focus on emerging areas of concern for individuals with developmental disabilities. These projects may include support services for families, data collection, advocacy, and research on issues like racial disparities in access to services or the transition from school to work. PNS grants in FY2010 supported various activities such as youth programs, family support, data collection, evaluations of DD Act programs, and initiatives addressing emerging issues. The DD Act of 2000 authorized new programs including grants for family support programs and scholarships for direct support workers. In FY2002, funding was allocated for SCDDs, P&A programs, UCEDDs, PNS, and scholarships. The DD Act of 2000 authorized funding for various programs including UCEDDs, PNS, scholarships, and staff development curriculum grants. Funding for the family support program, known as Family Support 360, has been allocated since FY2003. Total funding for DD Act programs has increased from $134.5 million in FY2002 to $168.4 million in FY2010. The DD Act of 2000 authorized funding for various programs, including SCDDs and P&A programs. The DDPIE project was developed to assess the effectiveness of these programs, with Phase One involving the development and testing of evaluation tools with input from stakeholders. Funding for DD Act programs has increased from $134.5 million in FY2002 to $168.4 million in FY2010. The DDPIE program involved stakeholders like families, advocates, and researchers to review draft materials. A working group of DD program representatives was established to incorporate input and address concerns. Phase One evaluation activities, guided by CDC's Framework for Program Evaluation, included identifying key functions and developing measurements. SCDDs, P&A programs, and UCEDDs piloted these evaluation measures. Several findings emerged from Phase One evaluation activities, including recommendations on benchmarks, data collection logistics, and utilizing existing data from DD Act programs. The National Council on Disability has initiated a one-year project to evaluate the effectiveness of services under the DD Act and make recommendations for improvements. This project will assess how the ADD administers, supports, monitors, evaluates, and holds accountable programs and services authorized under the DD Act. In the 110th Congress, legislation related to the DD Act was considered but not enacted. H.R. 2839 and H.R. 3995, introduced by Representative Barney Frank, aimed to amend the DD Act to require authorization from individuals or their legal guardians before pursuing legal remedies. H.R. 3995 would have allowed individuals to \"opt-out\" of class action lawsuits and required notice to Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded named in the lawsuit. The proposed rule by the ADD sought to modify regulations for the DD Act, focusing on the process of class action lawsuits for individuals with developmental disabilities. HHS requested feedback on criteria for including individuals in a class, handling disagreements between individuals and guardians, but final rules were never issued. The notice of proposed rulemaking for the DD Act closed in 2008 without final rules being issued. Concerns were raised about federally funded DD Act programs, with advocacy organizations like Voice of the Retarded arguing that P&A organizations have been complicit in neglect and death of individuals with severe mental retardation through class action lawsuits. VOR suggested that P&A programs should have required approval from families or guardians before filing such lawsuits. Advocacy groups like ADAPT oppose the \"opt-in\" provision in H.R. 2839 for class action suits against ICFs/MR, arguing it would protect facilities providing substandard care. They supported the substitution of H.R. 3995 by Representative Frank. Additionally, the Expanding the Promise for Individuals With Autism Act of 2007 aimed to provide grants to UCEDDs for services and unmet needs. In the 111th Congress, additional grants were awarded to UCEDDs to provide services for individuals with autism and their families, fund P&A programs for individuals with autism and other emerging populations with disabilities, and establish a national technical assistance center for autism services. Representative Doyle introduced the Training and Research for Autism Improvements Nationwide Act (H.R. 5756) to provide grants for interdisciplinary training. H.R. 5756 would award grants to UCEDDs for interdisciplinary training, continuing education, technical assistance, and information to improve services for individuals with autism and their families. H.R. 911 aims to prevent child abuse in residential programs serving children with emotional, behavioral, or mental health issues, alcohol or substance abuse problems. H.R. 911 aims to prevent child abuse in residential programs by establishing public websites, a national hotline for complaints, civil penalties for violations, and a review process for complaints. Advocates also highlight the need for expanded funding for UCEDDs to support individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. There is an increased recognition of the impact of early life experiences on individuals with developmental disabilities who are living longer. Long term planning for these individuals is becoming more important, including the transition from pediatric to adult care services. Recommendations include reauthorization of the DD Act, increased funding for SCDDs, community-based employment for individuals with DD, and appointing officials with knowledge of DD. No bills to reauthorize the Developmental Disabilities Act have been introduced in the 111th Congress. Appendices include allotments for State Councils on Developmental Disabilities and Protection and Advocacy Programs, current Projects of National Significance, and an Acronym Glossary."
