    "content": "Rising food prices, especially in low-income developing countries, have increased significantly according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The price of wheat, corn, and rice has surged since 2000, leading to concerns about food security and civil unrest. The impact is most severe on the poor due to their higher proportion of spending on food. Low-income consumers in poor developing countries are heavily impacted by high food prices, with food representing 60%-80% of their total expenditure. This has led to social unrest and food riots in various countries, including Egypt, Cameroon, and Haiti. Popular discontent over food price inflation even caused the fall of the Haitian government. Governments in countries like Pakistan and Thailand have deployed troops to prevent food seizures. The escalation of food prices in more than 33 countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, is pushing over 100 million people into poverty. Market analysts predict a rebound in global grain and oilseed supplies in 2008, but food prices are expected to remain significantly higher. This has led to a shortfall in funding for international emergency food aid and calls for increased focus on food security and agricultural productivity in developing countries. The escalation of food prices in over 33 countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, is pushing over 100 million people into poverty. Droughts and poor weather conditions in various regions have reduced global stocks of corn, wheat, and soybeans to historically low levels. Some attribute these harsh climatic shocks to climate change, while others question if it is a one-time event or part of a more systemic change. Countries, especially Asian rice-producing ones, have introduced export restrictions to address high food prices. Rising oil and energy prices have impacted food production and marketing, leading to higher food prices. Export restrictions aim to increase domestic supplies but worsen food supply in importing countries. Rising fuel costs also increase the expenses of transporting food aid to developing nations. Additionally, higher demand for food commodities in emerging markets like China and India contributes to the increase in food prices. The strong demand for food commodities, meat, and processed foods, along with higher prices in world markets, is driven by increased demand for food and energy in emerging markets. This structural change is expected to impact food and feed supply and demand in the future. Competition between crops for food and fuel may affect food supply and prices long-term, leading to calls for reconsidering biofuel subsidies and mandates. Some countries have restricted food exports in response to rising prices. Countries have restricted food exports in response to rising prices, which can impact domestic farmers' incentives and reduce supplies to importing countries. Some food importing countries have reduced import duties and introduced price controls while increasing subsidies for farmers. Others have expanded social safety net programs to help mitigate the effects of global price increases, but many low-income countries lack the resources to implement such programs. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization is monitoring developing countries' efforts to address the impact of rising food prices. In response to global price increases, Asian countries like India, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Thailand have implemented various measures such as banning rice exports, setting minimum export prices, releasing rice stocks at subsidized prices, and increasing agricultural subsidies. In North Africa, Egypt has also banned rice exports and increased the supply of subsidized bread by ordering the army to bake bread. In response to global price increases, African countries like Senegal, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and South Africa have implemented measures such as subsidizing wheat flour, suspending import duties on essential foodstuffs, continuing export bans on corn, implementing input subsidy programs, and maintaining import controls on grains. The government of South Africa has increased disability and old age payments, social grants for poor families. Ethiopia announced wheat and fuel subsidies, increased wheat ration for low-income residents, raised cash wage rate, and plans to increase imports of sugar, wheat, and cooking oil. Tanzania authorized duty-free imports of corn and banned exports of agricultural commodities. Mexico removed quotas and tariffs for food imports, negotiated agreements to increase corn imports, and reduce retail food prices, along with announcing food production support measures. Mexico has announced food production support measures and will reduce fertilizer prices by a third. El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras canceled import duty on wheat flour for 2008. Argentina imposed taxes on grain and oilseed exports and may reduce fertilizer prices by 20%. Brazil removed import tariffs on non-Mercosur wheat. Peru revoked its tariff on grain imports and started a food distribution program for the poorest. Ecuador increased the subsidy on wheat flour. Bolivia allowed tariff-free imports of various food products but banned exports of grains and meat. The rise in global food prices has led to a funding shortfall for international food aid. The United Nations World Food Program and USAID are experiencing funding gaps due to high food and fuel prices. The WFP made an urgent appeal for an additional $500 million to address the shortfall, which has now increased to $755 million for 2008. Without additional funds, feeding operations for 73 million people in 80 countries would have to be scaled back. The World Food Program (WFP) provided $2.7 billion of food aid to 70 million people in 80 countries in 2007, with the United States contributing 44% of this amount. Other major donors included the European Union, Canada, and Japan. The WFP purchases 80% of its food locally to maximize commodity value and mitigate costs. In 2007, the World Food Program (WFP) purchased 80% of its food locally, amounting to $612 million in developing countries. USAID anticipated needing an additional $200 million in FY2008 for emergency food aid due to rising food and fuel prices. In FY2007, the Title II emergency program provided 1.5 million metric tons of emergency food aid at a cost of $1.4 billion to meet needs in 30 countries. 20% of the aid was used for non-emergency development projects, totaling 594,840 metric tons valued at $348 million. The congressional appropriation for Title II food aid was $1.2 billion, with an additional $460 million in emergency supplemental funding. For FY2008 and FY2009, the President requested and Congress appropriated $1.2 billion for P.L. 480 Title II food aid. The Administration requested $350 million for FY2008 supplemental appropriations for Title II, with $200 million released from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust to address food aid funding shortfalls. Congress is considering an emergency supplemental appropriation for food aid. The President requested an additional $770 million in FY2009 for the international food situation. These requests are part of war funding supplementals. The White House directed the Secretary of Agriculture to draw down on the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust to provide $200 million in emergency food aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development. This aid would address rising commodity prices and meet unanticipated food aid needs in Africa and other regions. The Emerson Trust is a reserve authorized under the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust Act of 1998 to meet humanitarian food needs in developing countries. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust Act of 1998 authorizes the holding of up to four million metric tons of grains, with wheat being the only commodity ever held. Replenishing the Trust can be done using funds from P.L. 480, limited to $20 million per fiscal year. Emergency supplemental appropriations have been used in the past for this purpose. Before a recent release, the Trust held 915,000 metric tons of wheat and $117 million. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Kansas City Commodity Operations Office sold 260,371 MT of wheat stocks for $80 million, which will be placed in the Trust for purchasing commodities under P.L. 480 Title II. The House and Senate versions of a new farm bill address the reauthorization of the Emerson Trust, with the House extending it until 2012 and the Senate making changes to allow cash reserves. The Administration did not propose any enhancements for the Trust in its farm bill proposals. Congress is considering a $350 million supplemental appropriation for P.L. 480 Title II food aid. In six out of ten years since 1999, emergency supplemental appropriations for P.L. 480 Title II food aid have been requested and passed by Congress. The major issues for an FY2008 emergency supplemental would be its size, allocation between emergency and non-emergency programs, and the Emerson Trust. Some private voluntary organizations have called for a larger supplemental than proposed by the Administration. Catholic Relief Services and Senators Casey and Durbin propose additional funding for emergency food aid in the FY2008 supplemental. The Congressional Black Caucus advocates for prioritizing Haiti in U.S. food aid programming. Amendments in the House and Senate call for adding $500 million each to the President's request for P.L. 480 Title II funding. President's request for $770 million in emergency food aid due to rising food prices in developing countries is part of a FY2009 bridge supplemental appropriation for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The requested amount for emergency food aid in the FY2008 supplemental is $395 million, with additional funds allocated to disaster assistance and agricultural development assistance. Some Members of Congress have criticized the President's proposal, suggesting that more funds may be needed prior to FY2009. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are working to increase the amount of supplemental funding for food aid and disaster assistance. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are considering increasing FY2008 supplemental funding for P.L. 480 by $500 million instead of waiting for FY2009. Policy options being debated in the reauthorization of food aid programs could change how the US provides emergency food aid, including purchasing non-US commodities and earmarking aid for development. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposals recommended giving USAID the authority to use up to 25% of funds for emergency aid. The Administration proposed giving USAID the authority to use up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional commodity purchases to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of food aid responses. This would save on transportation costs, allow for quicker delivery of supplies, and support local economic development. The Administration proposed allowing USAID to use up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional commodity purchases to improve food aid responses. The House-passed farm bill did not endorse this proposal but allocated $40 million for famine prevention and relief. The Senate version of the farm bill includes a pilot program for local or regional procurement of food in emergency situations. The Administration proposed allocating funds for local or regional purchase in the 2007 farm bill food aid recommendation. This proposal faced opposition from various groups involved in food aid distribution. The conference report accompanying the FY2006 agriculture appropriations act addressed the issue of converting P.L. 480 commodity food aid into cash. The President's FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests proposed allowing the use of up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchases of commodities in food crises. The Senate report accompanying the FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill rejected this proposal. The Administration's proposal aims to shift 25% of the Public Law 480 Title II program to USAID for direct cash purchases of commodities. Proponents acknowledge risks of local market absorption and quality/transport issues. Studies show manageable risks with local purchases being 66% cheaper than direct shipments. 60% of food aid is locally procured. The volume of Title II commodities for emergencies has increased. The House and Senate versions of the farm bill include hard earmarks for development food aid, ensuring a minimum amount of aid for non-emergency projects. The House-passed bill specifies that at least $450 million annually must be allocated for non-emergency food aid from P.L. 480 Title II funds, with waivers requiring approval from the USAID Administrator and subsequent law enactment. The House and Senate versions of the farm bill include hard earmarks for development food aid, ensuring a minimum amount of aid for non-emergency projects. The Senate bill establishes a minimum of $600 million for development food aid that would not be subject to waivers. The Administration prefers the status quo with waivers for emergency situations. The House bill provision opposed by OMB could result in a $100 million decrease in emergency food aid. Food aid donors had pledged $613.4 million to the WFP appeal, with a confirmed amount of $40.4 million. Public announcements by donor countries for the WFP appeal total $221.6 million, with confirmed contributions of $40.4 million. The European Commission has pledged $181 million, and individual countries like Japan, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Norway have also announced contributions. The FAO has allocated $17 million for increasing local food production and is assisting four African countries with inputs. A meeting in Rome from June 3-5, 2008, will focus on mobilizing short-term solutions to food price increases. The meeting in Rome from June 3-5, 2008 will address short and long-term solutions for world food security. The World Bank is providing policy advice and financial assistance to countries affected by rising food prices, including a $10 million grant for Haiti. Burkina Faso is considering increasing Development Policy Loans, and the Bank is reviewing scaling up financing for safety net and agricultural programs. The World Bank is providing a $10 million grant to Haiti to cover food provision for vulnerable groups and create jobs through public works. The IMF is exploring additional financing options for countries affected by higher food prices, focusing on targeted social assistance and temporary measures like tax cuts on food products. The IMF is providing support measures, including financing instruments and stand-by arrangements, to help countries overcome food-related balance of payments strains. Aid agencies are focusing on medium- and long-term efforts to enhance food security and agricultural productivity, especially in low-income countries. Calls have been made to increase resources for agricultural development in Sub-Saharan Africa to address long-term structural changes in the world market for food and fuel. Official development assistance for agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa has been declining since the 1980s. World Bank data shows a decrease in lending to agricultural projects, with the share of agricultural development assistance in total Official Development Assistance dropping significantly. U.S. aid for agriculture has also decreased in relative terms over the years. The percentage of U.S. agricultural development assistance from DAC member countries decreased to 2.3% by 2006, with aid for agriculture declining from 20% in 1980 to 3% in 2006. Despite a decrease in total aid for agriculture, there has been a relative increase in the proportion going to Africa. U.S. assistance to African agriculture increased between 2000 and 2004. The World Bank and USAID are promoting agricultural development in low-income countries. Two aid agencies are focusing on promoting agricultural development in low-income countries, particularly in Africa. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $353.8 million for various agricultural activities in Africa in FY2006. A report by the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa highlighted key factors affecting USAID's agricultural development assistance to Africa from 2000-2004. The Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa identified two main factors influencing USAID's allocation of resources to agricultural development in Africa from 2000-2004: competing priorities and congressional earmarks, and institutional factors affecting resource scale and effectiveness. USAID faces challenges in translating priorities into budget allocations due to influence from other executive branch institutions and Congress. Agricultural development funding competes with allocations for health, education, and humanitarian assistance in Africa. Funding for health-related assistance in Africa has increased significantly through USAID and presidential initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Congressional earmarks restrict the flexibility of agricultural development assistance at the country level, limiting the effectiveness of programs. The Partnership found that USAID's agriculture funding in Africa from 2000 to 2004 was spread across 24 countries and four regional programs, averaging about $6 million per year per country. The Partnership questions the lasting impact of USAID's agricultural projects in Africa, which receive an average annual funding of $6 million per country. They raise concerns about the competition for resources based on short-term results, potentially disadvantaging projects with longer-term impacts. Coordination of agricultural development assistance within USAID and other U.S. agencies is also questioned. The Partnership highlighted the lack of coordination in agricultural development assistance within USAID and other U.S. agencies, as well as with other donors and multilateral institutions. Improved coordination could reduce costs and increase effectiveness by integrating priority setting and resource allocation. Additionally, the Partnership raised concerns about the higher costs of U.S. development assistance due to tying aid to procurement from U.S. sources. The Initiative to End Hunger in Africa (IEHA) is a U.S. assistance initiative focused on increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes in Africa. It is linked to the U.N. Millennium Development Goal of reducing hunger by 2015 and has projects in several African countries. In FY2006, IEHA received $47 million in funding from USAID. The Initiative to End Hunger in Africa (IEHA) focuses on improving agricultural productivity in Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia. USAID allocated $14.2 million to agricultural development in Ghana and $10.4 million in Mali in FY2006. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was established in 2004 to provide U.S. foreign assistance. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was established in 2004 to provide U.S. foreign assistance, aiming to fulfill the U.S. commitment to the U.N. Millennium Development Goals by reducing poverty, eliminating hunger, and fostering sustainable development. The president pledged $5 billion annually by FY2006 to the MCC, which supports countries with market-oriented, pro-growth policies, good governance, and investments in health and education. The MCC has potential importance for agricultural development in Africa due to its significant resources for development assistance. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was established in 2004 with significant funding allocated annually. Half of the eligible low-income countries for MCC grants in 2007 were in Africa, with compacts signed with 8 African countries. Agriculture is a key sector for MCC funding, emphasizing investments to raise productive potential and integrate economies into global markets. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) focuses on key areas such as agricultural development, education, enterprise, governance, health, and trade capacity building. Most U.S. food aid to Africa is for emergency needs, but some aid is used for development projects, with a significant portion allocated to agriculture. Non-emergency food aid projects receive the largest funding for promoting food security in Africa under USAID. The USAID portfolio of projects in Africa focuses on food security, with plans to reduce the number of countries receiving food aid and integrate projects into overall agricultural development assistance programs. The World Bank President calls for a \"New Deal for Global Food Policy\" to address food security challenges in poor countries, emphasizing the need for attention to energy, yields, and climate change. Immediate food needs should be met, but a higher priority on food security is necessary, especially in poor countries. The World Bank President emphasizes the need to meet food needs while also focusing on reducing global hunger and malnutrition by 2015. He suggests shifting from traditional food aid to broader food and nutrition assistance, including cash or vouchers instead of commodity support. Purchasing commodities from local farmers and supporting emergency measures to help the poor meet their food needs are also recommended. The World Bank identifies key elements for fostering growth in developing country agriculture in its 2008 World Development Report. The World Bank President highlights the importance of meeting food needs and reducing global hunger by 2015. Key elements for fostering growth in developing country agriculture are outlined in the 2008 World Development Report, including improving producer incentives, providing quality public goods, strengthening institutions, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources. The World Bank plans to double its lending to agriculture in Africa from $400 million to $800 million by 2010."
