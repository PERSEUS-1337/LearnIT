Establishment of an expedited driver's license suspension or revocation system for persons who operate motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol. This system requires that when a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe a person has committed an alcohol-related traffic offense and is determined to have been under the influence of alcohol while operating the vehicle, or refuses to submit to a chemical test, their license can be suspended or revoked. Additionally, individuals who knowingly permit someone with a revoked or suspended license for an alcohol-related offense to operate their vehicle can be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. The officer can serve a person with a notice of suspension or revocation of their driver's license if they refuse a test for alcohol influence while operating a motor vehicle. The notice must include information on the administrative procedures for license suspension or revocation and the operator's rights under those procedures. The state must provide these administrative procedures for license suspension or revocation. The law enforcement officer must report relevant information to the State entity responsible for driver's licenses after serving notice and taking possession of a driver's license. This is part of the administrative procedures for license suspension or revocation, ensuring due process of law. Upon receiving a report from a law enforcement officer, the State entity responsible for driver's licenses will suspend the license of an individual found to be driving under the influence of alcohol or refusing a chemical test. The suspension period is at least 90 days for a first-time offender within a 5-year period, and at least 1 year or revocation for subsequent offenses. The graduated licensing program for drivers under 21 includes an instructional license where the driver must be accompanied by a full license holder in the front passenger seat. The graduated licensing program for drivers under 21 includes a provisional driver's license that requires passing written and road tests. A full driver's license is issued after holding a provisional license for at least 6 months with a clean driving record. The Secretary will determine conditions for suspending provisional driver's licenses to prevent fund transfers. Provisional license holders will face stricter driver control actions than full license holders, including warnings and suspension at a lower point threshold. State laws meeting certain requirements will be recognized by the Secretary. The Federal share of project costs under section 402 is 100 percent when funds are transferred. The Secretary allocates obligation authority for Federal-aid highways projects based on transferred funds. The limitation on obligations for highway safety programs under section 402 does not apply to funds transferred for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs. SEC. 4.
