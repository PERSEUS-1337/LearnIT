    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural and Urban Health Care Act of 2005\" and includes requirements for the admission of H-1C nonimmigrant nurses. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to specify qualifications for alien nurses coming to the US, including having a nursing license and passing an examination recognized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or having a state license to practice nursing. Alien nurses must be fully qualified and eligible to practice professional nursing in the State of intended employment, including meeting temporary licensing requirements. They are authorized to work as registered nurses immediately upon admission to the United States, with the opportunity to take the state licensure examination up to twice after entering the country. Alien nurses must pass the state licensure examination within two attempts upon entering the United States. The examination failure will result in termination of nonimmigrant status and departure from the country. The absence of a social security number does not affect eligibility for the examination. The attestation for employment at a facility ensures that the alien's work will not harm the wages or working conditions of registered nurses at the facility, and they will be paid the same wage rate. Alien nurses employed at a facility must not be involved in a labor dispute, layoffs, or election influence. The facility must notify the bargaining representative or registered nurses about the visa petition filing. The facility must inform registered nurses about visa petition filings and must not authorize alien nurses to work at other sites or penalize them for ending employment early. The facility must inform registered nurses about visa petition filings and must not authorize alien nurses to work at other sites or penalize them for ending employment early. An attestation must be filed with the Secretary within a specified timeframe, reviewed for completeness, and if accurate, certification will be provided within 7 days. The attestation expires after a 3-year period or the end of the alien's admission period. The facility must file petitions for nonimmigrant nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) with the Secretary of Labor. The attestation must be filed within a specified timeframe and must state compliance with conditions for each petition filed during a 3-year period. The Secretary of Labor will compile a list of facilities that have filed petitions, along with a copy of the facility's attestation for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary will establish a process for investigating complaints regarding a facility's failure to meet attested conditions or misrepresentation of material facts. Complaints can be filed by any aggrieved party, and investigations will be conducted if there is reasonable cause to believe a facility willfully failed to meet conditions. This process applies regardless of whether an attestation is filed. The Secretary will investigate complaints of facilities failing to meet attested conditions or misrepresenting facts. If a basis is found, a hearing will be provided within 60 days. If willful failure or misrepresentation is confirmed, the Secretary will notify the Attorney General and may impose administrative remedies. The Secretary may impose administrative remedies, including civil penalties, on facilities found to violate conditions such as payment of nurses at prevailing wage rates. Additionally, back pay may be required to comply with the conditions. The Secretary may impose a filing fee on facilities submitting an attestation, not exceeding $250. The collected fees will be deposited in a fund for this purpose. The period of admission for an alien under a specific category shall not exceed 3 years initially, with a possible extension up to 6 years. The total number of nonimmigrant visas issued for nursing services shall not exceed 195,000 annually. Facilities must provide fair wages and working conditions for nonimmigrant nurses and cannot prevent them from joining a union. The term 'facility' includes hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and employers of registered nurses in home settings. The term 'lay off' for a worker means causing loss of employment, excluding certain situations like voluntary departure or being offered a similar job with the same employer at equal or higher compensation. The Secretary of Labor will promulgate regulations within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, in consultation with other relevant departments. The amendment will take effect regardless of the presence of these regulations. SEC. 3. Increase in waivers of two-year foreign residence requirement to 40 upon requests by state agencies."
