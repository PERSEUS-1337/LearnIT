    "content": "The National Guard will provide support for border control activities. Operation Jump Start mandates the deployment of at least 6,000 National Guard personnel along the US-Mexico border until the Federal Government achieves operational control. These personnel are exempt from end strength and active duty limits. Support for border control activities is authorized under Chapter 1 of title 32, United States Code. The Secretary of Defense may provide funding assistance to State Governors for border control activities through the National Guard, including personnel pay, equipment maintenance, and procurement of services and equipment. The Secretary of Defense can fund State Governors for National Guard border control activities, including equipment leasing. The procurement limit is $5,000 per item unless approved by the Secretary of Defense. National Guard personnel can be ordered for full-time duty for border control under specific regulations. National Guard duty under orders authorized under paragraph (1) includes training required under section 502(a) of this title. Pay, allowances, and benefits during training are the same as duty for border control activities. Appropriations for the Department of Defense can be used for training costs and must be reimbursed. To ensure National Guard units' training and readiness are not compromised during State border control activities, certain requirements must be met. Activities must not affect training quality or military functions, and personnel must not degrade their skills. State border control activities plan requirements include specifying the use of National Guard personnel in support of US Customs and Border Protection, conducting operations when not in Federal service, and ensuring participation is additional service. The State border control activities plan must certify that engineer-type activities will be performed by National Guard units, include a certification from the State Attorney General or equivalent official, and have approval from the Governor or designated law enforcement official. The Governor has determined that activities in the plan carried out with Federal law enforcement agencies serve a State law enforcement purpose. Before funds are provided, the Secretary of Defense will examine the plan's adequacy in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The plan may allow the National Guard to assist in transporting aliens who violated Federal immigration law. End Strength Limitation applies. At the end of a fiscal year, the National Guard is limited to 6,000 members on duty for border control activities. The Secretary of Defense can increase this limit by up to 20% if deemed necessary for national security. Deployed National Guard personnel for border control activities are not included in the compliance calculation. The Secretary of Defense shall submit an annual report to Congress on assistance provided and activities carried out under this section. The report includes the number of National Guard members excluded from end strength calculations, descriptions of border control activities conducted under State plans, and an account of funds provided to each State. The annual report to Congress includes details on funds provided to each State and the impact of using National Guard units for State border control activities. Nothing in this section limits the State National Guard's authority to perform law enforcement functions as authorized by State laws. The Governor of a State can request support from the National Guard for Customs and Border Protection activities, including construction, search and rescue, intelligence gathering, surveillance, communications, maintenance, and logistics support. The term 'Governor of a State' refers to the Commanding General of the National Guard in the District of Columbia. The term 'State' includes the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories or possessions. Border control activities."
