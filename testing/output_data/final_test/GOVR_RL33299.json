    "content": "Child nutrition programs, including the WIC program, are governed by The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. This law covers various programs such as School Lunch, Child and Adult Care Food, Summer Food Service, after-school programs, food commodity support, training, compliance, and general provisions for multiple child nutrition programs. The Child Nutrition Act, enacted in 1966, provides authority for various programs including the School Breakfast program, WIC program, and Special Milk program. Section 32 of the act provides funding for child nutrition subsidies and food commodities distribution. The 1998 William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act made comprehensive amendments to child nutrition and WIC law. Significant laws affecting these programs were enacted in the 106th and 107th Congresses. The next review of child nutrition and WIC programs was scheduled for 2003. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-265) was the only significant law enacted in the 108th and 109th Congresses, renewing authorizations for child nutrition programs and the WIC program. Congress began considering reauthorization in 2003 but took no action due to budget concerns. In 2003, a short-term extension of expiring authorizations was enacted (P.L.108-134), pushing expiration dates to March 31, 2004. The House passed a child nutrition-WIC reauthorization bill (H.R. 3873) with estimated net new mandatory spending of $235 million through FY2009. Another stopgap law (P.L. 108-211) extended expiring authorities through June 30, 2004. Senate committees did not take formal action. The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, along with the Administration, discussed a final bill from March to June 2004. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (S. 2507) was passed by the Senate on June 23, 2004, and by the House on June 24, 2004. The bill included House and Administration proposals, resulting in $232 million in new mandatory spending through FY2009. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-265) was enacted on June 30, 2004, with $395 million in new spending through FY2009. Funding for new initiatives or program expansions was a key debate, with limited mandatory money available. Legislators had to use savings from changes within child nutrition programs to fund new initiatives or expansions. Alternatively, they could authorize appropriations for new initiatives or establish pilot projects. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 included $395 million in new spending through FY2009, financed by $163 million in savings from revisions to the system for certifying eligibility for school meals. Congress focused on addressing \"overcertification\" concerns, leading to amendments in the law to improve program integrity. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 included changes to certification and verification rules for school meal programs, upgrades in administration, and new technical assistance. Few changes were made to school meal operations, such as expanding eligibility for certain groups and loosening rules for higher subsidies. Major issues included nutrition, health, childhood obesity trends, and rules for milk offerings and food safety. Some proposed increasing income eligibility limits for free school meals, limited to a pilot project. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 made significant changes to school meal programs, including the establishment of \"wellness policies\" to address obesity and nutrition issues. It also expanded the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetables and made important changes to food safety rules. Additionally, small changes were made to the Summer Food Service and Child and Adult Care Food programs. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act made various changes to programs, including expanding coverage for summer programs, loosening eligibility requirements for for-profit child care centers, and implementing new rules for food costs in the WIC program. The law extended authorizations through FY2009 and made significant revisions to child nutrition and WIC laws. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act made changes to child nutrition and WIC law, including program integrity in school meal programs, certification and verification of eligibility by Local Educational Agencies, and requirements for descriptive materials and communications with families. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act mandates that communications with families for eligibility determination be in an understandable format. It grants permission for Internet applications and requires direct certification of eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals. This mandate is phased in through the 2007-2008 school year. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act allows direct certification for various groups of children, mandates verification of a sample of applications, and requires direct communication with families for eligibility determination. The sample size for verification is larger than before, and direct verification is conducted as part of the process. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act mandates verification of a sample of applications, with direct verification being conducted first before contacting families. For families not directly certified or verified, LEAs must conduct verification through contact with the family, including written requests and phone contact if necessary. If families do not respond, LEAs must make additional attempts to obtain information. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act mandates verification of applications through direct verification and contact with families. Nonresponse results in disqualification. Funding is provided for direct certification, verification activities, and program integrity in school meal programs. Additional administrative reviews are required to ensure accuracy. State agencies conduct special administrative reviews of local agencies with high risk for errors in meal programs. Failure to meet criteria results in corrective action plans and potential financial penalties. Training is required for local agency personnel, with funding provided by the Agriculture Department. The curr_chunk discusses funding for administrative reviews and training in child nutrition programs, the use of technology to improve program integrity, and grants for purchasing/upgrading technology. It also mentions increased appropriations for compliance and accountability reviews of school meal program agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the automatic eligibility of homeless, runaway, and migrant youth for free school meals, duration of eligibility, military housing allowances, and subsidies for the \"severe need\" school breakfast program. The curr_chunk discusses expanding eligibility for free school meals, conducting evaluations of child nutrition programs, funding for best practices in the School Breakfast program, and requirements for local wellness policies in school meal programs. The curr_chunk discusses implementing nutrition policies in schools, including goals for education and physical activity, guidelines for food available on campus, measuring policy implementation, and involving various stakeholders. The Agriculture Department is mandated to provide support and funding for this initiative. The curr_chunk discusses authorizing funds for nutrition education programs, grants for obesity prevention activities, recommendations for school meal programs based on Dietary Guidelines, grants for healthy school environments, and rules for offering milk and substitutes. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for offering milk and milk substitutes in schools, including requirements for fluid milk varieties, flavored options, lactose-free milk, and non-dairy alternatives for students with dietary restrictions. It also addresses the waiver of using \"weighted averages\" for nutrient analysis in school meal programs and increases in food safety inspections. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for food safety programs in schools, including audits, HACCP compliance, and procedures for irradiated food products. It also mandates appropriate labeling, information provision, and alternatives for irradiated foods in school meal programs. Additionally, it requires state child nutrition plans to include information on using state administrative grants for information management systems. The curr_chunk discusses funding for technology and information systems to monitor meal nutrient content, grants for purchasing/upgrading technology, and programs for free fresh fruits and vegetables in schools. It also mentions reducing the state match for the WIC Farmers' Market Program. The curr_chunk discusses changes to the WIC Farmers' Market Program, including reducing the state match to 30% of administrative costs, increasing the federal share of benefits to $30 per participant per year, and allowing roadside stands to participate. It also authorizes funding for the Agriculture Department to promote purchasing locally produced foods in schools through grants and technical assistance for farm-to-cafeteria projects, procurement from small- and medium-size farms, school garden programs, and farm-based nutrition education projects. The curr_chunk discusses authorizing the Agriculture Department to provide technical assistance and grants for school garden programs and farm-based nutrition education projects. It also authorizes grants to evaluate including fruit and vegetables in the WIC Program and makes rules permanent for the Summer Food Service Program. Additionally, it creates an option for schools to administer summer food service using regular school meal program rules. The curr_chunk establishes and funds four pilot projects to improve summer meal programs, including easier qualification for free meals in rural areas, innovative transportation approaches, modified eligibility criteria for low-income children's camps, and subsidizing meals for local governments and nonprofit organizations in California. The curr_chunk discusses the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and its provisions for for-profit day care centers, emergency homeless shelters, and a management support initiative. It includes details on eligibility criteria, age limits, and funding for training and technical assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the CACFP Pilot Project in rural Nebraska, paperwork reduction, and changes to the WIC Program eligibility for breastfeeding women and infants under eight weeks old. The curr_chunk focuses on changes to the WIC Program, including periodic reviews of food packages, rounding up to ensure infants receive full benefits, allowing vouchers to be used at any authorized store, and implementing cost containment policies. The curr_chunk discusses cost control measures for vendors participating in the WIC Program, including restrictions on pricing for WIC items and limits on alliances for bidding on infant formula contracts. It also mandates the use of contracted infant formula as the primary option and separates bids for milk-based and soy-based formulas. Additionally, it requires a cent-for-cent decrease in rebates received. The curr_chunk outlines cost control measures for WIC vendors, including cent-for-cent adjustments in rebates based on formula prices, accelerated approval for vendor applications, notification of violations, and maintenance of lists of approved infant formula providers for the WIC program. The curr_chunk outlines cost control measures for WIC vendors, including cent-for-cent adjustments in rebates based on formula prices, accelerated approval for vendor applications, notification of violations, and maintenance of lists of approved infant formula providers for the WIC program. It also mandates that vendors purchase infant formula from approved retailers for the WIC program and prohibits the imposition of costs related to EBT systems on vendors. Additionally, it requires earmarked funding of $64 million a year for program infrastructure, special projects, management information systems, and nutrition education activities. The limit on the proportion of nutrition services and administration component of WIC grants that state agencies may spend in the following fiscal year is increased from 1% to 3%, and the Agriculture Department is mandated to establish and maintain a national universal product code (UPC). The Agriculture Department is required to establish a national universal product code (UPC) database for states to use in the WIC program. Minimum state grants for child nutrition program administrative expenses are increased. The Food Service Management Institute (FSMI) is mandated to provide technical assistance in areas such as HACCP implementation, emergency readiness, food recalls, and food bio-security training. Funding for technology and school breakfast expansion is also increased. The Agriculture Department provides technical assistance and training for procurement in child nutrition programs, including compliance with \"Buy American\" requirements and safe food procurement. An information clearinghouse is reinstated to assist nongovernmental groups supporting low-income individuals with food assistance. Nongovernmental groups assist low-income individuals and communities with food assistance and self-help activities to reduce reliance on government agencies. Permanent Authority makes two pre-existing commodity support authorities permanent. Several minor changes to laws and policies governing child nutrition and WIC programs have been enacted in the 108th and 109th Congresses.
