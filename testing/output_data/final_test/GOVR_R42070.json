    "content": "The largest sources of federal funding for elementary and secondary education are the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In FY2014, the ESEA provided approximately $23.0 billion in funding for education, with Title I being the largest program supporting disadvantaged students. The ESEA focuses on promoting educational standards and accountability to ensure all students meet state standards. The IDEA, with a budget of $12.5 billion in FY2014, ensures students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education through individualized services from preschool to high school. It emphasizes accountability to ensure state compliance. The IDEA accountability system focuses on state compliance with provisions of the law and reporting on performance indicators for students with disabilities. Approximately 6 million students receive special education under Part B of IDEA, with 65% spending over 80% of their time in general education classrooms. Students with disabilities often have similar educational experiences as their non-disabled peers. Students with disabilities have unique educational experiences, including individualized education programs (IEPs) and instruction from special education teachers and related service providers. They may take alternate assessments in reading and mathematics instead of the general state assessment. These experiences are guided by policies set forth in the ESEA. The ESEA and IDEA impact the education of students with disabilities, aiming to improve outcomes. While both laws have similar goals, they support students differently. ESEA focuses on holding all students to the same standards, while IDEA emphasizes individualized learning goals and progress monitoring. The ESEA and IDEA have different approaches in supporting students with disabilities. ESEA expects general education teachers to teach to grade-level standards, while IDEA requires special education teachers to teach individualized goals. This difference can create challenges in aligning education plans for students with disabilities. The report highlights issues of alignment and misalignment between the ESEA and IDEA laws regarding high school graduation requirements. It explores potential consequences of implementing both laws simultaneously. The report discusses the challenges of aligning the ESEA and IDEA laws for high school graduation requirements, noting that some ESEA provisions have been modified for states with approved flexibility packages. The U.S. Department of Education established four principles for the ESEA flexibility package, including college- and career-ready expectations for all students. As of March 5, 2014, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico had their applications approved. If Congress works on ESEA reauthorization, final provisions may override the waivers and principles established. The report focuses on the alignment of statutory and regulatory provisions of the ESEA and IDEA, highlighting potential issues arising from the ESEA flexibility package. It discusses education policy issues such as standards, assessments, accountability, and teachers, emphasizing the interrelation between them in the ESEA accountability system. The report discusses education policy issues such as standards, assessments, accountability, and teachers in relation to the ESEA and IDEA alignment. It examines the implications of \"highly qualified\" teacher requirements on meeting the needs of students with disabilities and the increasing emphasis on teacher effectiveness. Background information on relevant statutory and regulatory language is provided, along with a discussion on alignment and potential areas of misalignment for Congress to clarify during the ESEA reauthorization debate. Appendix A includes a glossary of selected acronyms. Standards in education refer to expectations for student skills and knowledge at specific grade levels. Federal policies support standards-based education for equity. State academic standards ensure all students, including those with disabilities, access and progress in the general curriculum. Individualized goals in IEPs serve as personalized standards for students with disabilities. The curr_chunk discusses academic content and achievement standards in the ESEA and IEP goals in the IDEA for students with disabilities. Title I-A of the ESEA requires states to develop standards in mathematics, reading, and science for all public schools. These standards specify what students should know and be able to do. The academic achievement standards required by the ESEA must specify what children are expected to know and be able to do, contain rigorous content, and encourage the teaching of advanced skills. These standards are aligned with academic content standards and describe different levels of achievement. While initially intended for all students, subsequent regulations have allowed states to develop separate achievement standards for some students with disabilities. Current regulations allow states to develop alternate achievement standards for students with disabilities with the most significant cognitive disabilities. States must use a validated process to ensure alignment with academic content standards and promote access to the general curriculum. There is a limit to the number of state assessments based on alternate achievement standards that can be counted as proficient in a state's accountability system. Modified achievement standards may also be developed for students with disabilities. Modified achievement standards may be developed for students with disabilities who cannot achieve grade-level proficiency as demonstrated by state assessments. These standards must align with academic content standards, be challenging yet less difficult, include at least three achievement levels, and involve stakeholder input in the development process. There is a limit to the number of state assessments based on modified achievement standards that can be counted in the state's accountability system. Under IDEA, a student with a disability is taught according to his or her IEP, which includes details about the student, special education services, and annual academic goals set by the IEP team. IEP goals are individualized for students with disabilities and may address academic, social, behavioral, physical, or other educational needs. Goals are set annually, must be measurable, and document the student's progress. Academic goals often focus on reading and math, while social goals aim to improve peer relationships and behavioral goals target problem behaviors. Physical needs like fine-motor skills may also be addressed in the goals. The IEP goals for students with disabilities are individualized, measurable, and track the student's progress. Academic, social, behavioral, and physical needs are addressed in the goals. The annual goals must be included in the IEP, with progress reported periodically. Standards in the ESEA and IEP goals in the IDEA serve different purposes for tracking student achievement. ESEA standards are for federal accountability, while IEP goals are not used for accountability. Teachers use data on IEP goal achievement to monitor student progress. Data on whether students are meeting their IEP goals is used to refine special education services. If goals are not met, the IEP team can revise goals, services, or discuss alternative placements. Some students' IEP goals align with state standards. High-achieving students may have goals similar to grade-level standards. In such cases, general education with support services may be sufficient. The alignment of IEP goals with state content and achievement standards is crucial for students with disabilities. If there is a lack of alignment, confusion may arise regarding what to teach and the expected level of mastery. For example, a student reading at a second grade level in fifth grade may have IEP goals focused on basic literacy skills to progress. Meanwhile, the general education teacher would continue teaching fifth grade content standards. The education of a student with a disability may be disjointed as the general education teacher teaches state content standards while the special education teacher focuses on below-grade-level skills. Federal guidance on alignment between content and achievement standards in the ESEA and IEP goals is limited. Regulations specify that IEP goals for students assessed against modified achievement standards must be based on grade-level content standards. There is no similar requirement for students taught to alternate standards. There is a lack of alignment between IEP goals and state academic content standards for students with disabilities. Congress may need to consider how IDEA provisions regarding IEP goals align with state standards. ESEA allows for alternate achievement standards for students with disabilities, but there is a push for alignment with state achievement standards. Congress could authorize the use of alternate achievement standards or modified achievement standards for students with disabilities to align with current practice. If Congress includes these standards in the ESEA reauthorization, regulatory language developed by ED could be used as a starting point. Failure to authorize these standards may result in more schools and LEAs facing consequences for not meeting grade-level standards. Alignment of IEP goals with state content and achievement standards may vary for students with disabilities. Some students may have goals below grade-level standards, while others may align more easily. Demonstrating alignment for students with significant cognitive disabilities can be challenging. Aligning IEP goals with state standards for students with disabilities can be challenging, especially for those with significant cognitive disabilities. Congress could require alignment with alternate achievement standards for these students, while for others, alignment with grade-level state standards could be mandated. This alignment would help ensure consistency in education across general and special education settings. Aligning IEP goals with state standards is crucial for consistency in education across general and special education settings. If aligned, both teachers can provide instruction on academic content assessed on state assessments, leading to better student performance. Educational assessment involves data analysis to support decision-making and evaluate academic programs. Federal education legislation has emphasized this alignment in recent years. In recent years, federal education legislation has focused on assessment in elementary and secondary schools, particularly for students with disabilities under the ESEA and IDEA. Both laws require students with disabilities to participate in state assessments for federal accountability. The IDEA also mandates assessments for determining disabilities and monitoring progress towards IEP goals. This section provides background on student assessment in the ESEA and IDEA, highlighting differences in assessment purposes between the two laws. Title I-A of the ESEA requires states to develop high-quality annual academic assessments in math and reading for grades 3 through 8 and high school. Results are used to determine if schools are making adequate yearly progress. States must also create alternate assessments for students with disabilities to ensure all students are included in the assessment process. The ESEA requires states to develop alternate assessments for students with disabilities to ensure their participation in state assessment systems. There are five options for assessing these students: general state assessment, general state assessment with accommodations, alternate assessment based on grade-level standards, alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards (AA-AAS), and alternate assessment based on modified achievement standards (AA-MAS). Scores from the last two options have restrictions on how they can be counted in AYP determinations. The IDEA requires students with disabilities to participate in all district and state assessments, including various assessments not included in the ESEA. LEAs must assess students for special education eligibility using a variety of assessment tools. The IDEA requires students with disabilities to participate in assessments to measure progress towards IEP goals. State assessment systems must provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities to enable them to demonstrate their true level of achievement. Accommodations are changes in testing material or procedures to remove the influence of a student's disability. The IDEA requires accommodations for students with disabilities in assessments to measure academic achievement. States must provide guidelines for appropriate accommodations to remain eligible for funding. IEP teams must select accommodations that do not invalidate assessment scores. The ESEA and IDEA require students with disabilities to participate in state assessments. ESEA offers two options for alternate assessments, while IDEA only mentions one. The timing of regulations explains the difference in references to alternate assessments. After the 2004 reauthorization of the IDEA, regulations issued by ED outline requirements for alternate assessments for students with disabilities. The current Administration supports the use of AA-AAS for students with significant cognitive disabilities but not AA-MAS for other students. ED proposed regulations to eliminate AA-MAS, but final regulations have not been published. This issue may be addressed during the ESEA reauthorization by Congress. The IDEA requires specific assessments for students with disabilities, which are different from those required by the ESEA. These assessments serve different purposes, such as accountability under the ESEA and identification/instructional purposes under the IDEA. They are not necessarily conflicting or duplicative. In terms of accommodations for students with disabilities on state assessments, there are areas of alignment between the ESEA and IDEA, but also potential misalignment that Congress may need to clarify. The IDEA regulations place additional restrictions on the use of accommodations that do not invalidate state assessment scores, which could be seen as a point of misalignment with the ESEA. Accommodations on state assessments can create conflicts between student needs and the collection of comparable achievement data for accountability. The ESEA regulations require accommodations to be \"appropriate for the state assessment,\" not just for the student. This can complicate the selection of accommodations for students with disabilities, as accommodations must be suitable for both the assessment and the student to be allowed. When selecting accommodations for state assessments, what is appropriate for the student in the classroom may not be suitable for the state assessment. Students with disabilities may have to participate in the assessment without their usual accommodations, leading to concerns about the accuracy of their achievement representation. Non-standard accommodations, such as reading tests aloud for students with visual impairments or learning disabilities, may be used but are considered not appropriate for the assessment. Impairment or learning disabilities may require accommodations for state assessments, such as reading tests aloud. However, using non-standard accommodations like reading aloud can lead to invalid scores and students being labeled as \"nonparticipants\" in the federal accountability system. This has caused issues for states and LEAs in meeting participation requirements, resulting in consequences for schools. Congress may need to consider ESEA provisions on assessments and alternate assessments. The ESEA regulations and IDEA statute outline requirements for alternate assessments for students with disabilities. To align with IDEA, ESEA reauthorization should include language mandating states to maintain at least one alternate assessment. Congress may need to include explicit statutory language on the development and use of alternate assessments to ensure alignment. If Congress agrees with the Secretary's proposal, fewer students with disabilities would be eligible for alternate assessments. This could impact how their scores are included in the accountability system, potentially leading to more schools facing consequences for not meeting achievement targets. Increasing the number of assessment scores may be one alternative if AA-MAS is discontinued. One alternative to discontinuing AA-MAS is to increase the number of assessment scores from AA-AAS counted as proficient, allowing more students with disabilities to participate. States may need statutory guidance from Congress to define appropriate accommodations for state assessments, including when non-standard accommodations can be used. The reauthorization of the ESEA could include IDEA regulatory language to define \"appropriate accommodations\" for state assessments. Congress may need to consider allowing non-standard accommodations to ensure accurate representation of students' abilities in typical classroom conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated funds for competitive grant programs, including the Race to the Top Assessment Program. This program supports the development of common assessments in English and math to measure student achievement, including those with disabilities. The reauthorization of the ESEA may involve Congress deciding on the adoption of common assessments and the development of a list of allowable accommodations. Congress could mandate the development of a list of \"common accommodations\" for assessments, but without consistent implementation across states, results for students with disabilities may not be comparable. Monitoring by the Department of Education may be necessary to ensure consistent use of accommodations. Federal education policy has been shifting towards measuring student achievement for school accountability. The focus on student achievement for school accountability is increasing in federal education policy, as seen in the ESEA and IDEA laws. These laws measure student outcomes and use data for state accountability systems. The ESEA assesses schools and LEAs on reading and math achievement, academic indicators, and student participation in assessments. The IDEA system monitors states on academic and compliance indicators to ensure law implementation. The IDEA accountability system monitors states' progress directly, while states are required to monitor their own LEAs using the same system. Consequences for not meeting requirements are targeted at the state level, with states also implementing consequences at the LEA level. The IDEA accountability system monitors states' progress directly, with consequences at the state and LEA levels. Title I-A of the ESEA requires states to develop a state accountability system based on academic standards and assessments, with rewards and sanctions for public schools based on student performance. The ESEA requires states to establish outcome accountability requirements for public schools based on student performance, with a focus on AYP determined by academic achievement, student participation rates in assessments, and performance on academic indicators like graduation rates. Each state plan sets annual measurable objectives for reading and math assessments under Title I-A. The ESEA requires states to set annual measurable objectives (AMOs) for reading and math assessments under Title I-A. Schools must meet threshold levels of performance on indicators for all students and subgroups like economically disadvantaged students, LEP students, students with disabilities, and major racial and ethnic subgroups to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). AYP identifies schools with inadequate performance for targeted improvement. Consequences are applied to schools and LEAs with inadequate performance, ranging from support and school choice to corrective action and restructuring. If any subgroup or \"all students\" group fails to meet AYP targets for two consecutive years, statutory consequences apply. IDEA requires monitoring of FAPE provision and supervisory authority at the state level. Under IDEA, states must monitor LEAs based on three priorities: provision of FAPE, general supervisory authority, and addressing disproportionate representation in special education. States establish measurable targets for 20 indicators, a combination of compliance and performance measures. Compliance indicators ensure adherence to processes like timeliness of evaluations, while performance indicators measure outcomes. The Secretary evaluates states' implementation of IDEA based on performance indicators measuring student outcomes like graduation rates and participation in state assessments. Consequences for not meeting requirements include advising technical assistance or withholding funds. The ESEA and IDEA have separate accountability systems with distinct goals. The ESEA aims for all students to be proficient in reading and math by 2013-2014, while the IDEA ensures children with disabilities receive FAPE. Both systems report achievement levels for students with disabilities. The IDEA indicators for students with disabilities align with the ESEA accountability system, focusing on graduation rates, dropout rates, and performance on state assessments. States must report data for accountability purposes under both IDEA and ESEA Title I-A. The ESEA and IDEA accountability systems do not overlap except for IDEA Indicators 1 through 3. The remaining indicators measure IDEA implementation and do not conflict with ESEA goals. Misalignment may occur with IEP goals not always aligning with state academic standards required by ESEA. Misaligned IEP goals can create dual academic expectations for students with disabilities, causing difficulty for teachers in providing appropriate instruction. ESEA requires teaching grade-level content, while IDEA expects teaching based on IEP goals. Another area of misalignment is the high school graduation rate calculation under ESEA regulations. The graduation rate calculation under ESEA regulations may not fully account for the educational experiences of students with disabilities, who may take longer than four years to complete high school or work towards alternative diplomas. Several organizations propose aligning IDEA and ESEA accountability systems by including IEP goals in ESEA. This would allow states to count students with disabilities as meeting AYP if they complete their IEP goals, providing flexibility for individualized education plans. However, focusing on IEP goals for AYP may lower expectations for students with disabilities. Including IEP goals in the ESEA accountability system may lower expectations for students with disabilities, as IEP goals cover a broad range of individualized needs beyond academic standards. This could be inconsistent with the original intent of increasing access to the general education curriculum and improving achievement for students with disabilities. If Congress increases the role of IEPs in the ESEA accountability system, statutory language would need to be altered. Graduation rates are a concern as the \"four year\" rate may not fully account for students with disabilities who can receive FAPE through age 21. States may apply for an \"extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate\" for accountability purposes. The state may give schools credit for students who graduate in more than four years with a regular high school diploma, but not for specific student subgroups like students with disabilities. Congress could consider allowing the use of extended-year graduation rates to align with high school completion under IDEA. This could result in more students with disabilities being included in the graduation rate calculation, holding schools accountable for a broader pool of students. If states do not use extended-year rates, there may be less incentive in the ESEA accountability system. Some students with disabilities may pursue alternative forms of high school completion, impacting graduation rates reported for ESEA and IDEA accountability systems. Decisions made by IEP teams under IDEA can influence schools' ability to meet graduation rate targets in ESEA systems. Some argue that Congress could allow other forms of high school completion to be reported alongside the ESEA graduation rate to include more students with disabilities in the accountability system. However, this may lead to lower graduation goals for these students. The focus of ESEA and IDEA is to improve academic outcomes for all students, dependent on quality instruction. Improving academic outcomes for all students depends on the quality of instruction from teachers. Students with disabilities spend a significant amount of time in general education classrooms and are taught by both general education and special education teachers. The quality of both types of teachers can impact the achievement of students with disabilities. Collaboration between general education and special education teachers may also contribute to student achievement. The ESEA and IDEA outline teacher requirements to support student success. The ESEA and IDEA outline teacher requirements for student success, including the definition of a \"highly qualified\" teacher. Teachers of core academic subjects must have full state certification, a baccalaureate degree, and demonstrate subject matter expertise. New teachers must show knowledge and skills in reading, writing, and mathematics. Teachers must demonstrate subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of the elementary school curriculum by passing a state test. New middle or secondary school teachers must show a high level of competency in academic subjects through passing a state test, completing an academic major, graduate degree, or equivalent coursework, or obtaining advanced certification. Experienced teachers can meet the \"highly qualified\" criteria through a \"high objective uniform state standard of evaluation\" (HOUSSE). The IDEA also defines \"highly qualified\" teachers for special education teachers in elementary and secondary education. The term \"highly qualified\" for special education teachers under IDEA requires full state certification, no emergency waivers, and a minimum of a baccalaureate degree. It also includes additional requirements for teachers of core academic subjects to students with significant cognitive disabilities or teaching multiple core subjects to students with disabilities. Teachers who exclusively teach core academic subjects to students with disabilities, including those with significant cognitive disabilities, have various options to meet the \"highly qualified\" definition under the ESEA. This includes demonstrating competence on HOUSSE for elementary teachers and showing subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction for middle and secondary school teachers. Teachers who teach multiple core subjects exclusively to students with disabilities also have options to meet the requirements. The \"highly qualified\" definition for special education teachers under the ESEA includes meeting requirements for core subjects taught, using the HOUSSE option for experienced teachers, and allowing new teachers two years to meet the definition for other subjects. The IDEA definition aligns with the ESEA but broadens requirements for special education teachers. The IDEA and ESEA definitions of \"highly qualified\" teachers are aligned, with IDEA stating that a teacher meeting its criteria is also considered \"highly qualified\" under ESEA. However, a potential misalignment arises in the implementation of these requirements at the school level, where ESEA outlines requirements for general education teachers and IDEA for special education teachers. This creates two tracks to become \"highly qualified,\" implying that students without disabilities are taught by general education teachers and those with disabilities by special education teachers, which is not always the case as both types of teachers often share the responsibility for educating students with disabilities. Many students with disabilities spend the majority of their time in general education classrooms taught by teachers who may lack specialized training in special education. Certification requirements vary among states, with 28 states mandating coursework in special education for general education teachers. In 28 states, general education teachers are required to have coursework in special education, while 11 states do not have this requirement and 12 states did not report. There is a potential misalignment in teacher policy regarding the shift towards \"teacher effectiveness\" and the focus on improving teacher performance in the classroom. Efforts to improve teacher performance include programs like Race to the Top (RTTT) grant program, which promotes teacher evaluation systems based on teacher effectiveness. These systems measure teacher output, with a focus on student achievement. The ESEA flexibility package also promotes teacher evaluation systems that differentiate performance and support continual improvement of instruction. States and LEAs must commit to developing and implementing these systems to receive waivers. Teacher evaluation systems based on teacher effectiveness aim to improve instruction by differentiating performance levels, using multiple valid measures, evaluating teachers regularly, providing timely feedback for professional development, and informing personnel decisions. However, there is a concern about how special education teachers would be included in these systems due to the challenge of linking student achievement data to multiple teachers responsible for instruction. General education and special education teachers share responsibility for educating students with disabilities, but it is unclear who would be held accountable for student achievement. Both types of teachers may be accountable, but dividing responsibility could complicate teacher evaluation systems. There are challenges in measuring student achievement, as students with disabilities take different state assessments. Congress is considering ESEA provisions on teacher preparation and recruitment. As Congress considers ESEA provisions on teacher preparation and evaluations, advocacy groups are calling for specific requirements for general educators teaching students with disabilities. The Learning Disabilities Association of America recommends that general education teachers be able to deliver research-based instruction and modify curriculum for students with disabilities. NASDSE suggests adding language to ESEA requiring teachers to have knowledge and proficiency in working with all types of students. The ESEA requires teachers to have knowledge and proficiency in working with diverse students, including those with disabilities. The quality of instruction by general education teachers impacts the learning and performance of students with disabilities. Collaboration between general and special education teachers is crucial for meeting AYP targets. Education disability advocacy groups prioritize increasing collaboration between general education and special education teachers. The Council for Exceptional Children recommends ESEA reauthorization to support mentoring and induction programs for this purpose. Collaboration can lead to more successful teaching for students with disabilities and better accommodations. The Council of Administrators of Special Education also advocates for promoting collaboration to ensure appropriate instruction in the least restrictive environment. Special education teachers should be included in teacher evaluation systems to measure effectiveness. Collaboration between general and special education teachers can lead to better instruction for students with disabilities. This collaboration is advocated for by education disability advocacy groups and can result in more successful teaching and accommodations. Teacher evaluation systems may face difficulties in determining the effectiveness of general education teachers, especially when including special education teachers. It can be challenging to link student achievement data to specific teachers, particularly for students with disabilities who are taught by multiple teachers in different settings. Incorporating student achievement from alternate assessments into teacher evaluations can also be problematic due to varying measurement standards. It may be difficult to assess teacher effectiveness, especially for special education teachers. One approach could be evaluating special education teachers based on whether their students achieve their IEP goals, but this may complicate teacher evaluation systems. IEP teams may set lower goals for students with disabilities to make them seem more attainable, potentially hindering achievement. Special education teachers being part of the IEP team could create a conflict of interest if they influence goals they will be evaluated against."
