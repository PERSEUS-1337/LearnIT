    "content": "The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act is amended to include the acquisition of projects and removal of dams in section 3. The Secretary will acquire the Elwha Project and Glines Project for $29,500,000, with a release from liability for obligations and liabilities to the United States upon title transfer. The United States will not assume liability to Indian tribes. After acquiring the Elwha Project, the Secretary will remove the Elwha dam as soon as practicable after funds are appropriated. Before taking any steps to alter the water flow, necessary actions will be taken to protect the water supply. The Secretary will take necessary actions to ensure the continued availability of water for Port Angeles, Dry Creek Water Association, industrial water users, and other Elwha River water users after the dam is removed. Actions include design and construction. The Secretary will bear the cost of actions related to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of water treatment facilities and mitigation of any harm to fisheries or water quality resulting from the Elwha dam removal. During the Elwha dam removal phase, the Secretary will evaluate the impact on fish runs and compensate Clallam County with $150,000 per year for 12 years to recover lost revenue, with a requirement to allocate 50% of the payment to studying the river system. The Secretary's prior efforts to assess environmental impacts of dam removal are deemed compliant. The impacts of dam removal must comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. The Glines Canyon dam will continue operating after the Elwha dam is removed, pending funding availability for engineering and design evaluations. The Secretary will conduct an engineering study to reconfigure transmission lines for the Glines Canyon dam and assess the impact on hydropower operations. Additionally, annual restoration work plans for fisheries enhancement will be developed. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant entities, will develop an annual work plan outlining requirements for achieving ecosystem restoration goals. This plan will detail engineering and environmental studies for dam removal, water supply, power reconfiguration, and river restoration. It will also include a schedule of activities, milestones, and performance criteria. The Secretary appoints an Independent Scientific Review Panel of eleven members to assess progress in restoring the Elwha River ecosystem post-dam removal. Panel members are chosen from a list of 20 scientists provided by the National Academy of Sciences, with a focus on Pacific Northwest experts in fish, wildlife, and ocean studies. The Secretary appoints an Independent Scientific Review Panel of eleven members to assess progress in restoring the Elwha River ecosystem post-dam removal. Panel members are chosen from a list of 20 scientists provided by the National Academy of Sciences. Appointments in subsequent years require nominations from the Academy within 90 days, or the Secretary may appoint members as deemed appropriate. Panel members may be compensated and are subject to conflict of interest standards. The Panel, appointed by the Secretary, reviews the annual work plan for Elwha Ecosystem Restoration in consultation with various stakeholders and makes recommendations. Expenses are covered by the Secretary, and the Panel is not considered an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Panel reviews the annual work plan for Elwha Ecosystem Restoration and provides recommendations to the Secretary by June 15 each year. If recommendations are not received by this date, the Secretary can proceed with the work plan using the best available information. Recommendations must be based on sound science principles, benefit fish and wildlife, have a clearly defined objective with monitoring provisions, and employ cost-effective measures. The Panel, with assistance from various stakeholders, reviews prior year expenditures annually. The Panel evaluates the contribution of Elwha Dam removal to the restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem annually, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, and provides recommendations to the Secretary based on its evaluation. The Panel evaluates the Elwha Dam removal's impact on the Elwha River ecosystem annually and provides recommendations to the Secretary. The Panel submits recommendations on the removal of the Glines Canyon Dam to the Secretary for public review and comment. The Secretary must consider the Panel's recommendations when implementing the work plan. The Secretary must consider the Panel's recommendations when implementing the annual work plan. If the Secretary does not incorporate a recommendation, they must provide a written explanation. If recommendations are found inconsistent with the Act, the Secretary must notify the Panel within 30 days. The Panel will make final recommendations to Congress for appropriations to implement the work plan. The Secretary will remove the Glines Canyon Dam upon receiving a recommendation from the Panel. The cost limitation for this provision is $1,000,000 in 1998 dollars, and it will expire 20 years after enactment. The Secretary is required to procure services from private sources for planning, engineering, design, and construction to comply with the Act. The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act is amended to require the Secretary to take necessary actions for the removal of the Elwha dam. Services from private sources are to be procured for planning, engineering, design, and construction to comply with the Act. The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act is amended to remove the Elwha dam. Certain sections are revised to specify the removal of the dams in the Elwha Project. SEC. 4. COLUMBIA-SNAKE RIVER HYDROELECTRIC SYSTEM PROTECTION. Under no circumstances shall removal of dams on the Elwha River set a precedent for other rivers. Dams on the Columbia River or Snake River may only be removed with Congressional approval for safety or necessary repairs."
