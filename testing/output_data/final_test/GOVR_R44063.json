    "content": "The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget request for the Department of Transportation (DOT) was $93.7 billion, a $22 billion increase from FY2015. The request included restructuring accounts and funding sources in several DOT sub-agencies, with $24 billion coming from discretionary budgetary authority. The discretionary funding allocation for FY2016 was $55.27 billion, $1.5 billion higher than the previous year. The House THUD subcommittee recommended a FY2016 funding of $55.27 billion, $1.5 billion higher than FY2015. The Senate THUD allocation was $55.646 billion, $376 million more than the House level. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased the overall FY2016 discretionary budget authority for nondefense accounts by $25 billion. The House and Senate are negotiating differences in transportation authorization legislation, with funding levels for FY2016 not significantly higher than FY2015. Most of the Department of Transportation's funding comes from trust funds and is passed through to state and local governments. The annual funding mainly comes from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The Department of Transportation's funding mainly comes from trust funds, with roughly three-fourths of it being mandatory budget authority from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Discretionary funding is mingled with the general fund of the Treasury. The Department of Transportation's funding primarily comes from trust funds, with most of it distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The reauthorization of federal aviation and surface transportation programs, which are set to expire in FY2016, is crucial as it impacts the allocation of budget authority from these trust funds. The Department of Transportation's funding primarily comes from trust funds, distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak as grants. Reauthorization of federal aviation and surface transportation programs set to expire in FY2016 may affect their structure and funding levels. DOT's nonemergency annual funding peaked in FY2010 at $82.7 billion and has been declining since. Congress passed a revised budget agreement (P.L. 114-74) to reauthorize surface transportation programs, setting funding levels for FY2016 and subsequent years. The revised budget agreement (P.L. 114-74) passed by Congress in October 2015 increased budget authority for nondefense accounts by $24.6 billion for FY2016. This additional funding may allow for increased funding for transportation programs. Roughly three-fourths of the Department of Transportation's budget comes from mandatory budget authority derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which was extended to maintain solvency. The FY2016 budget request for the Department of Transportation totals $93.7 billion, with a $22 billion increase from FY2015. The funding includes significant boosts for highways, transit, and intercity rail. Concerns about the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund, which provides most of DOT's funding, persist due to expenditures surpassing revenues in recent years. The Highway Trust Fund faces a shortfall due to stagnant federal gas tax since 1993, leading to a projected revenue of $39 billion in FY2015 against outlays of $52 billion. Congress transferred over $62 billion from the Treasury's general fund to maintain solvency. The fixed gas tax per gallon has been eroded by inflation and increased fuel efficiency, reducing its purchasing power. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increased fuel efficiency offsetting more miles driven. This leads to a shortfall in highway trust fund revenues, with annual estimates falling short of authorized expenditures. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding structure. The TIGER program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by providing grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance in various modes on a competitive basis. However, funding has mostly gone towards projects of regional and metropolitan significance due to congressional intent. The TIGER program, funded by Congress, aims to distribute grants equitably across geographic areas and transportation modes. It is the main discretionary grant program for surface transportation, heavily oversubscribed with $10.1 billion in requests. The TIGER grant program is oversubscribed, with $10.1 billion in requests for $500 million available in FY2015. The selection process has raised concerns about integrity, as lower-ranked projects sometimes receive grants over higher-ranked ones without explanation. DOT states that project rankings are based on transportation criteria but must consider other factors like geographic balance. Critics argue that TIGER grants favor urban areas over rural areas. The TIGER grant program funding allocation process has been consistent over the years, with the Administration requesting more than Congress provides, leading to reduced funding. The House proposed a cut and a decrease in federal matching share, while the Senate suggested maintaining the matching share at 80% and allocating at least 30% of funding to rural areas. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008 due to airline route reductions, leading to new communities being added. Changes in 2012 included capping subsidies per passenger, limiting subsidies for communities close to hub airports, and allowing smaller planes for communities with few passengers. Supporters argue that the program fulfills Congress' commitment to maintain airline service in small communities after airline deregulation in 1978. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program was established in 1978 to maintain airline service in small communities that may be economically unviable for airlines. Critics argue that the subsidy cost per passenger is high, some airports have very few passengers, and some are close to major airports. The program is funded by a mandatory annual authorization of $108.4 million in FY2016, collected from overflight fees on international flights. The Administration requested $175 million for the EAS program in FY2016, with additional mandatory funding of $108 million for a total of $283 million. The House bill proposed $155 million in discretionary funding and $263 million overall, while the Senate-reported bill supported the requested $283 million. An Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, resulting in 8 deaths and over 200 injuries. The incident was attributed to the train traveling at nearly twice the prescribed speed for that section of track, with officials stating it could have been prevented with positive train control technology. In 2008, Congress mandated railroads to install positive train control (PTC) on certain segments of the national rail network by the end of 2015. Amtrak had the necessary equipment installed but had not activated it. Freight railroads have spent billions to meet this requirement, but most tracks will not be compliant by the extended deadline of 2018. Congress provided $50 million in FY2010 for PTC installation grants. The Administration's FY2016 budget request included $875 million for positive train control implementation on commuter railroad routes. The Senate-reported bill recommends $50 million for rail safety grant programs. States are directed to prepare railroad-highway grade crossing safety action plans to improve safety at high-risk crossings. The Senate committee recommended an increase of $1.9 million to improve passenger rail safety and $10 million for additional safety measures. The FY2016 budget request included funding for passenger rail risk reduction programs, highway-rail grade crossing safety grants, and a National High Performance Rail System program with grants for existing and new intercity passenger rail projects. Funding would come from a new transportation trust fund. The Administration proposed discretionary funding for Amtrak in FY2014 and FY2015. H.R. 2577 provides grants to Amtrak following the existing FRA structure. The Senate-reported bill suggests rescinding $17 million in unobligated balances for improvements to the Northeast Corridor. The 111th Congress allocated $10.5 billion for DOT's high-speed and intercity passenger rail grant program, with no additional funding provided since FY2011. California is actively pursuing a high-speed rail line with dedicated tracks for passenger trains. The Administration proposed funding for Amtrak in FY2014 and FY2015. California received $3.6 billion in federal funding for a high-speed rail line, but the total cost is estimated at over $70 billion. Amtrak requested $2.0 billion for FY2016, while the House-passed bill would provide $1.148 billion and the Senate-reported bill recommended $1.39 billion. Financing for the high-speed rail project is uncertain. Amtrak's FY2016 operating grant request totals $732 million, with projected losses on state-supported and long-distance routes. It anticipates a $367 million profit on the Northeast Corridor but plans to use it for capital investment due to significant capital needs. The budget request also includes $556 million for matching grants to states for NEC infrastructure, which could offset some capital needs. Comparing Amtrak's budget request to the House bill funding can be confusing. Amtrak's budget request includes funding for state and local transit agencies through various programs, with a focus on the Capital Investment Grants program. This program funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. In 2012, Congress added a third component, Core Capacity, to the program. In 2012, Congress added Core Capacity to the Capital Investment Grants program, which funds expansions to existing fixed-guideway systems. The program provides funding to large projects over multiple years, with a significant portion allocated to existing New Starts projects. The Administration requested $3.25 billion for FY2016, while the House-passed bill proposed $1.92 billion, which would fully fund projects with existing grant agreements and allocate funds for new projects. The Senate-reported bill recommends $1.585 billion for New Starts projects, 25% below the FY2015 level. The House-passed bill lowers the maximum federal share to 50%, while the Senate-reported bill directs FTA to prioritize projects requesting a lower federal share. Critics argue that this provision makes it harder for projects to secure federal funding compared to highway projects. The provision requiring a higher local match for New Starts funding aims to make highway projects more appealing for communities addressing transportation issues. Advocates believe this encourages careful cost estimation and reduces the risk of cost overruns. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital projects, matched by funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. WMATA, serving the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, has faced challenges including maintenance backlog, fatal incidents, and mismanagement of federal funds. FTA audit in 2015 led to safety practice recommendations and FTA assuming oversight from Tri-State Oversight Commission. Richard Sarles was WMATA's general manager since January 2011. The House-passed H.R. 2577 would provide $100 million for WMATA in FY2016, $50 million less than previous years. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $150 million. Richard Sarles retired in January 2015, and a new manager was appointed in November 2015 after other candidates backed out. An amendment adding $25 million to WMATA funding was approved during committee markup. Both House and Senate bills would increase the length of trucks permitted on the Interstate. The House and Senate bills propose increasing the maximum length of twin trailers on the Interstate System and National Network from 28 feet to 33 feet. DOT's study found that this configuration could cause road damage and higher bridge maintenance costs, but reduce enforcement costs and truck miles traveled. Safety impacts are uncertain due to limited current usage. Trucking industry supports the change for increased productivity. The House and Senate bills aim to increase the maximum length of twin trailers on the Interstate System and National Network from 28 feet to 33 feet for improved productivity. This change would suspend portions of commercial driver hours-of-service rules, allowing drivers to haul larger loads. Drivers are required to take a 34-hour rest period after working for 60 hours in a seven-day period, with restrictions on when this restart can be taken. The 2013 change in hours-of-service rules aimed to reduce driver fatigue by limiting the 34-hour restart period to once in a seven-day period, preventing drivers from working excessively long hours without adequate rest. The 2013 change in hours-of-service rules limited the 34-hour restart to once in a seven-day period, capping drivers at 70 hours of work. The restart period covering two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods allows for more restorative sleep. A provision in a House bill prohibits enforcement of the new requirement unless a study shows significant safety improvements. The Senate-reported bill (\u00a7134) introduced a provision looking for \"statistically significant net safety benefits\" in relation to the 2013 change in hours-of-service rules. Critics argue that the impacts of the change were underestimated by FMCSA despite their cost-benefit analysis showing it to be beneficial."
