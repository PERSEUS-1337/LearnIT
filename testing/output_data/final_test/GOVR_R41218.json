    "content": "Burma is set to hold its first national parliamentary elections since 1990 in 2010. The ruling military junta is promoting the election as a step towards \"disciplined democracy,\" but opposition groups are skeptical that the junta will maintain its power through legal restrictions. The elections may also challenge the Obama Administration's policy towards Burma, which includes political and economic sanctions. The US announced a new policy towards Burma, maintaining sanctions but willing to engage in high-level discussions with the SPDC. Previous administrations had avoided such talks. Burma's past plebiscites showed challenges for democratization, with the military junta refusing to relinquish power in 1990 and holding a controversial referendum in 2008. The 2010 elections in Burma had over 92% of voters in favor of adopting the constitution, which was seen as fraudulent. The outcome of the elections could influence political change in the country, with potential calls to scale back sanctions if the elections are perceived as free and fair. If the elections are manipulated or biased, Congress may increase pressure on Burma's ruling military junta. The path to the 2010 elections can be traced back to Burma's prime minister announcing a roadmap to democracy in 2003. The SPDC announced a seven-step roadmap to democracy in 2003. Between 2004 and 2008, they progressed through the first three steps despite opposition. The National Convention reconvened in 2004 after an eight-year break, completing the second step in 2007. A new constitution was drafted and completed in 2008. The opposition to the National Convention and the SPDC's \"roadmap to democracy\" in Burma stems from the military's response to the 1990 parliamentary elections, which led to the 8888 Uprising. The military coup in 1958 ended a brief period of civilian rule after World War II, and Burma lived under military rule for the next 30 years. The SLORC assumed power in 1988 after a brutal crackdown on opposition groups and protesters. In 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) took power in Burma and promised democratic elections. Despite suppression, the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi won a landslide victory in the 1990 elections, with NLD winning 392 seats in the new parliament. Following the 1990 elections in Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders urged SLORC to transfer power to the new parliament. In response, SLORC arrested many opposition leaders and imposed restrictions on civil liberties. The SPDC announced a national referendum on its draft constitution in May 2008, along with plans for multi-party democracy elections in 2010. A new law was released by the SPDC, barring certain groups from voting and allowing for the postponement or dissolution of a vote. The SPDC announced a national referendum on its draft constitution in May 2008, with the date set for May 10, 2008. Cyclone Nargis hit Burma on May 2, 2008, causing widespread devastation. Despite the disaster, the SPDC decided to proceed with the vote as planned. The SPDC announced a national referendum on its draft constitution in May 2008, with the date set for May 10, 2008. The vote proceeded as planned in most of Burma, but was delayed until May 24, 2008, for some townships. There were objections from opposition groups and other nations. Conflicting reports emerged about the referendum turnout and irregularities. The SPDC reported a high turnout and few irregularities, while opposition groups claimed lower turnout and various irregularities. The SPDC declared the new constitution ratified with 92.48% in favor. The 2008 constitution establishes a democratic system with three equal branches of the State.

The constitution also prohibits dual citizenship and having close relatives who are foreign nationals from holding public office. Chapter VIII of the Burmese constitution outlines the rights and duties of citizens, protecting various human and civil rights with some limitations. For instance, freedom of religion can be restricted for public welfare or reform purposes, and the abuse of religion for political gain is prohibited. The constitution also allows for the suspension of certain civil liberties during times of war or insurrection. Chapter IX governs elections and suffrage.

The military in Myanmar holds veto power over constitutional amendments, requiring over 75% approval from parliament. The 2010 election laws have been criticized by opposition groups. The new election laws in Burma have faced criticism from opposition groups and the international community. These laws are similar to those from before the 1990 election but include modifications from the 2008 constitution. Controversy surrounds provisions in the law on political parties and the Union Election Commission. The laws also impact the possibility of holding free and fair elections in Burma, requiring political parties with 15 or more members to register with the Union Election Commission. The new election laws in Burma require political parties to register with the Union Election Commission and promise to uphold the integrity of the country, its constitution, and laws. Failure to register within 60 days makes a party ineligible for the election. Parties must also contest in at least three constituencies and are prohibited from using state resources for support.

The Amyotha Hluttaw has 12 regional/state representatives and 56 appointed by the commander-in-chief. The Pyithu Hluttaw has 330 elected seats based on townships and 110 appointed by the commander-in-chief. Region/State Hluttaw sizes are determined by representatives from townships, elected members from national races, and commander-in-chief appointments. The voting eligibility criteria for parliamentary elections in Burma require individuals to be Burmese citizens, at least 18 years old, listed on the electoral role, and have resided in Burma for a minimum of 10 continuous years. Age requirements vary for different Hluttaw bodies, with representatives for the Amyotha Hluttaw needing to be 30 years old or older, and for the Pyithu Hluttaw and Region or State Hluttaws, the minimum age is 25. Residency exemptions are available for government officials residing overseas, and candidates must have both parents as Burmese citizens.

Leading political parties, including the NLD, decided not to participate due to provisions barring opposition figures like Aung San Suu Kyi. Overseas residents in the last 10 years are also excluded from running for office. Buddhist monks and nuns from the 2007 protests are not allowed to join political parties or vote. The election laws in Burma are criticized for restricting the participation of key groups like nuns and opposition parties. Political parties that violate restrictions may be declared illegal, and the high cost of registration may deter the poor from participating. The laws also favor the military, with military personnel being the only government employees allowed to form political parties, vote, or run for office. The Union Election Commission Law in Burma has faced criticism for potentially allowing the military to influence election results. Political parties must submit registration materials to the UEC to participate in the 2010 elections, leading some parties to opt out. The NLD decided against participating in the elections. The NLD committee unanimously voted against participating in the 2010 elections on March 29, 2010, following disagreements among the leadership. Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD filed an appeal to Burma's Supreme Court to annul provisions in the Political Party Registration Law for the 2010 elections, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case on May 6, 2010. The NLD's decision not to register for the 2010 elections may impact the credibility of the election. Other political parties, like the Mon National Democratic Front, followed suit and decided not to participate. This has left a significant void in representing the political views of a large segment of the population. The NLD's decision not to register for the 2010 elections has created a void in representing the political views of a substantial segment of the Burmese electorate. There are signs of a campaign to boycott the election led by Buddhist monks and university students. Members of the NLD are reminding voters of their right not to vote. The USDP, including ex-military officers, has submitted its application to the UEC. The USDP, consisting of 27 ex-military officers, including Prime Minister General Thein Sein, has applied to form a political party. It is uncertain if their resignations from the military are enough to comply with the Political Party Registration Law. If successful, this move could increase the military's control in parliament. The US has expressed support for military officers transitioning to civilian politics. The UEC in Burma is reviewing political party registration applications to determine if they meet the necessary requirements. Some ethnic-based parties, like the Kachin State Progressive Party, are facing delays in the review process, leading to concerns about the fairness of the UEC's decisions.
