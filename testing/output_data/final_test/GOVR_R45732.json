    "content": "A plaintiff injured by a defendant's wrongful conduct may file a tort lawsuit to recover money. The tort system aims to deter people from injuring others and compensate those who are injured. Employees and officers of the federal government can commit torts. Historically, sovereign immunity prevented suing the United States for tortious actions by federal officers and employees. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) was enacted in 1946 to allow plaintiffs to file tort lawsuits against the United States for financial compensation. This includes cases ranging from minor accidents on federal property to more serious allegations of government misfeasance, such as the infamous Tailhook Convention in 1991. In 1991, women used the FTCA to sue the United States for officers' attacks. Family members of those killed in the 1993 Waco fire also sued under the FTCA. The First Circuit affirmed a $100 million award against the U.S. for FBI misconduct leading to wrongful incarceration. Allowing plaintiffs to sue the U.S. ensures compensation for injuries by federal employees, but comes at a cost. The government's immunity from tort litigation has a significant cost, with the U.S. spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually on tort claims under the FTCA. The Department of Justice handles thousands of tort claims filed against the United States each year, potentially influencing government officials' decisions to reduce civil liability. The FTCA aims to balance these concerns by limiting circumstances for plaintiffs to obtain damages against the United States. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) restricts certain tort lawsuits against the United States and limits the types and amount of damages plaintiffs can recover. It also imposes procedural requirements before filing suit. The FTCA waives the government's immunity from specific tort claims, with exceptions and limitations on monetary damages. This report discusses the background, purpose, and operation of the FTCA in addressing sovereign immunity and tort claims against the government. The report discusses legislative proposals to amend the FTCA and the ability to recover monetary damages under the FTCA. It explains that individuals injured by federal employees' tortious activity can sue either the employee or the federal government, but suing the employee is often not feasible due to legal protections and financial constraints. Suing the United States for monetary damages is often preferred due to the government's financial resources, but plaintiffs may face obstacles due to sovereign immunity. This legal doctrine historically prevented citizens from suing the federal government for torts committed by its officers or employees. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) was enacted in 1946 to allow citizens to sue the United States for tort claims, waiving sovereign immunity for certain cases. This provided an alternative to the previous system of relying on private bills passed by Congress for relief from injuries caused by federal employees. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows citizens to sue the United States for damages caused by federal employees' negligence or wrongful acts. It aims to compensate victims of governmental wrongdoing and deter tortious conduct by federal personnel. The FTCA transfers the responsibility for deciding tort claims from Congress to the courts and incentivizes the government to supervise its employees carefully. The FTCA waives the United States's sovereign immunity from certain claims under state tort law, making the government liable in tort as a private individual would be. However, the waiver is not complete, as the FTCA also provides important protections and benefits to address concerns about the impact of extensive litigation on government officials' ability to perform their duties. The FTCA provides important protections and benefits to the United States, limiting where tort suits can be litigated and shielding federal employees from personal liability. Cases are typically tried by the court without a jury, and only authorize lawsuits against the United States itself. The FTCA makes the remedy against the United States exclusive, protecting federal employees from personal liability for torts committed within the scope of their employment. Congress aimed to prevent personal tort litigation for the entire Federal workforce. The individual employee remains immune from tort liability even if the FTCA limits recovery of monetary damages from the United States. Determining if the FTCA applies to a tort case involves two key questions: whether the individual was a federal employee and if the tort was committed within their scope of employment. The FTCA only covers torts by government employees, including federal agency officers, military members, and National Guard on duty. This shields federal employees from personal liability for torts, making the remedy against the United States exclusive. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) applies to federal employees, including military members, National Guard on duty, and certain individuals acting on behalf of a federal agency. The FTCA waives the government's immunity from torts committed by these individuals, but does not protect nonemployees from personal tort liability. This allows a plaintiff injured by a nonemployee's tortious action to potentially sue the nonemployee individually. The FTCA waives the government's immunity for torts committed by federal employees, but not for nonemployees. Independent contractors hired by the government are excluded from FTCA coverage, making the government not liable for their torts. Courts use various factors to determine if a defendant is an independent contractor or a government employee under the FTCA. The FTCA determines government liability based on the control over contractors' performance. Courts consider factors like supervision and control to classify individuals as employees or independent contractors under the FTCA. For example, certified registered nurse anesthetists working for federal hospitals are often deemed employees due to their lack of independent judgment in anesthesia administration. Courts generally consider physicians working at federal facilities as independent contractors, not employees for FTCA purposes. This distinction means that plaintiffs injured by the actions of a federal contractor may seek compensation directly from the contractor. However, pursuing tort claims against a federal contractor can still pose challenges, as highlighted in the Supreme Court's 1988 decision in Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. United Technologies Corp. is immune from state law tort claims as a government contractor if it would conflict with federal policy or frustrate federal legislation objectives. Boyle immunity does not extend to nonmilitary contractors. FTCA applies only to torts committed by federal employees within their scope of employment. If an employee acts outside their scope, a state-law tort action can be filed against the employee. The plaintiff can potentially file a state-law tort action against an employee who committed a tort if they were not acting within the scope of their employment. Courts determine this by applying the law of the state where the tort occurred. The scope of employment inquiry considers if the employer hired the employee for the act in question and if the activity was done to promote the employer's interests. Cases involving vehicular mishaps illustrate how this inquiry is conducted. The driver of a government-owned Humvee military truck, returning from a work assignment, injured a passenger when the truck hit a dip in the trail. The court determined that the driver, engaged in Army National Guard training at the time, was acting within the course of his employment as a federal officer. In a separate case, a special agent collided with a motorcyclist while driving home from work in a government vehicle after a verbal altercation, brandishing a firearm, and sharply careening into the motorcycle. The court ruled that the agent, driving a government vehicle, was not acting within the scope of his employment when he collided with a motorcyclist after a personal confrontation, as his actions were not related to his work duties. The court ruled that the agent's conduct, involving personal travel and a personal confrontation, was not within the scope of his employment when he crashed into a motorcyclist. As a result, the district court correctly dismissed the motorcyclist's claims seeking compensation from the United States. In cases where a plaintiff sues an individual without realizing they are a federal employee, the FTCA allows the Attorney General to certify if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment. If certified, the lawsuit is considered an action against the United States, with the government substituted as the defendant in federal court. The FTCA allows the United States to substitute itself as the defendant in federal court cases involving federal employees. This effectively protects employees from liability and shifts the burden of defense to the government. The Attorney General's certification of an employee acting within the scope of their employment can impact the plaintiff's chances of success in the lawsuit. The FTCA shields both the United States and its employees from liability for tortious actions, leaving some victims without a remedy. Plaintiffs may contest the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification to preserve their lawsuits against federal employees. The plaintiff may argue that a government employee was not acting within the scope of his employment, allowing the lawsuit to proceed against the individual. If the employee was acting within the scope of employment, the suit becomes an action against the United States under the FTCA. However, if the court disagrees with the Attorney General's determination, the suit can proceed against the government employee personally. Plaintiffs may choose to litigate against the United States if the employee lacks sufficient assets to satisfy a judgment. If a plaintiff successfully obtains a judgment against the United States based on the tortious conduct of a federal employee, the government may not subsequently sue the culpable employee to recover the amount of money the government paid to the plaintiff. This aspect of the FTCA is particularly favorable for government employees, as it may relieve them from all civil liability for their allegedly tortious actions. The Attorney General can refuse to certify an employee's actions within the scope of employment. The employee can then petition a federal district court for certification. If approved, the case proceeds against the Government; if not, it can proceed against the employee personally. The FTCA limits tort lawsuits against the United States to prevent judicial intrusion into governmental operations. The FTCA limits tort lawsuits against the United States to prevent judicial intrusion into governmental operations and policymaking. Section 2680 establishes exceptions preventing private litigants from pursuing certain categories of claims against the United States. The FTCA limits tort lawsuits against the United States, with exceptions for specific claims such as those related to federal employee acts, quarantine imposition, intentional torts, fiscal operations, combatant activities during war, foreign country claims, Tennessee Valley Authority activities, Panama Canal Company activities, and activities of certain federal banks. The discretionary function exception under Section 2680(a) preserves the federal government's immunity from tort claims when an employee's acts involve the exercise of judgment or choice. This exception is one of the most frequently litigated exceptions to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity and has been successfully invoked in cases involving exposures to radiation, asbestos, Agent Orange, and HIV. The discretionary function exception under Section 2680(a) of the FTCA aims to prevent judicial second-guessing of legislative and administrative decisions and protect the government from liability that could hinder efficient operations. It shields the government from liability for employees' discretionary actions. The discretionary function exception under the FTCA aims to protect the government from liability for employees' discretionary actions, preventing second-guessing of policy decisions and ensuring efficient operations. This exception marks the boundary between imposing tort liability on the United States and safeguarding certain governmental activities from exposure to lawsuits by private individuals. Courts determine the applicability of this exception by examining the conduct of federal employees. In FTCA cases, courts assess if federal employees' conduct was discretionary and policy-driven. If so, government's sovereign immunity is not waived, and plaintiff's claim fails. If the conduct lacks discretion or involves different discretion, the exception does not bar the claim. Conduct must involve judgment or choice by the employee. In FTCA cases, the discretionary function exception does not protect the government from liability if employees act against specific statutes or policies. Even if a law exists, actions may still be considered discretionary if the language used is permissive. The discretionary function exception in FTCA cases may bar a plaintiff's claim if a government agent's obligation involves judgment calls. Even if some provisions are mandatory, governmental action is still discretionary if decisions involve judgment or choice. The Fourth Circuit's decision in Rich v. United States illustrates how courts assess discretionary conduct by federal employees. The FTCA suit in Rich v. United States involved the Bureau of Prisons' discretionary decision not to separate an inmate from gang members. The court ruled that this decision fell under the discretionary function exception, unlike in Berkovitz v. United States where the exception did not shield the government from liability. The manufacturer must submit data showing how the product matched up against safety standards, as required by federal law. After a plaintiff contracted polio from a vaccine, they sued the United States under the FTCA. The Court held that the discretionary function exception did not bar the plaintiff's claim, as decisions exceeding constitutional bounds are not shielded by the exception. Some courts believe government decisions must adhere to the Constitution, while others think the discretionary function exception protects actions based on discretion, even if unconstitutional. The courts must determine if the conduct was discretionary and influenced by policy considerations. The discretionary function exception protects governmental actions based on public policy judgments, requiring decisions to balance competing interests. Courts apply an objective standard, not examining whether policy considerations were actually considered, as long as the decision is susceptible to policy analysis. The discretionary function exception applies to governmental actions based on public policy judgments, regardless of the level of the government official involved. The nature of the conduct challenged, not the status of the actor, determines the applicability of the exception. If the challenged conduct involves the exercise of discretion in furtherance of a policy goal, claims under the FTCA are foreclosed. The discretionary function exception under the FTCA applies to governmental actions based on public policy judgments. Courts presume that if the first element is satisfied, the second element is as well. Government agents' actions are presumed to be grounded in policy when exercising discretion. Plaintiffs can rebut this presumption if the actions are not policy-based. Courts use a case-by-case approach to assess the exception's applicability, which can be challenging due to the fact-intensive nature of the inquiry. In the Rich case, the court held that governmental actions related to prisoner placement and security are susceptible to policy analysis. Factors like resources, inmate classification, and security levels are inherently policy-based. The court ruled that the decision to house the plaintiff with inmates who attacked him was shielded by the discretionary function exception. Conversely, decisions driven by laziness or carelessness do not fall under this exception. Courts have ruled that decisions motivated by laziness or careless inattention do not qualify for the discretionary function exception, as they lack the considered judgment grounded in policy. For example, a decision to take a smoke break instead of inspecting a machine, or allowing toxic mold to grow on food served at a naval base, are not shielded by this exception. The intentional tort exception under the FTCA allows plaintiffs to sue the United States for intentional acts that cause harm, such as battery or false imprisonment. This exception preserves the government's immunity for claims related to assault, battery, false arrest, and other intentional torts, with some exceptions. The intentional tort exception under the FTCA allows plaintiffs to sue the United States for intentional acts that cause harm, such as battery or false imprisonment. The list of exempted torts includes those that may arise from negligent conduct. The legislative history of the FTCA shows Congress exempted these torts due to concerns about government liability and the potential dangers of exposing the public fisc to certain torts. The intentional tort exception under the FTCA shields the United States from liability for serious acts of misconduct by federal officers, such as in the case of women allegedly sexually assaulted by naval officers at the 1991 Tailhook Convention. The intentional tort exception defeated the plaintiffs' claims as the alleged sexual assaults were intentionally tortious acts, but there is a \"law enforcement proviso\" that makes the United States liable for certain intentional tort claims by law enforcement officers. The \"law enforcement proviso\" under the FTCA allows private citizens to sue the United States for intentional tort claims committed by investigative or law enforcement officers. This provision was added in 1974 in response to abuse of powers by federal law enforcement officers. The proviso covers torts such as assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution. It only applies to half of the intentional torts listed in the exception, waiving immunity for claims typically asserted against criminal officers. The \"law enforcement proviso\" under the FTCA allows private citizens to sue the United States for intentional tort claims committed by investigative or law enforcement officers. The proviso waives immunity for tort claims typically asserted against criminal law enforcement officers, while preserving immunity for other tort claims asserted against federal employees. The court must determine if the alleged tortfeasor qualifies as an \"investigative or law enforcement officer\" empowered to execute searches, seize evidence, or make arrests for violations of Federal law. This waiver applies only to intentional torts committed by criminal law enforcement officers, not federal employees conducting administrative searches like TSA screeners. The United States remains largely immune to claims from intentional torts committed by federal employees who are not criminal law enforcement officers. The waiver of sovereign immunity for law enforcement officers applies to acts or omissions within the scope of their employment, regardless of their specific activities at the time. The intentional tort exception under the FTCA may not apply to federal employees, such as correctional officers, even if they were not specifically engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity at the time of the alleged assault. The \"foreign country exception\" preserves the United States' sovereign immunity against claims arising in a foreign country. The \"foreign country exception\" under the FTCA preserves the United States' immunity against claims arising in a foreign country. This exception bars all claims based on injuries suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act occurred, to prevent excessive liability under foreign laws. The recent case of S.H. ex rel. Holt v. United States illustrates how this exception is applied in practice. The foreign country exception under the FTCA preserves the United States' immunity against claims arising in a foreign country. In the recent case of S.H. ex rel. Holt v. United States, a USAF base in Spain with substandard medical facilities led to a premature birth and subsequent cerebral palsy diagnosis for the daughter. The court ruled that the foreign country exception applied, barring the family's FTCA claim, as the daughter's injury occurred in Spain. The combatant activities exception under the FTCA preserves the federal government's immunity for certain torts arising from military activities during wartime. The purpose is to preempt state or foreign regulation of federal wartime conduct and free military commanders from civil suits. In the case of Clark v. United States, a U.S. army sergeant serving in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm was affected by this exception. The U.S. army sergeant conceived a child with birth defects after serving in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. His lawsuit against the United States was barred by the combatant activities exception due to wartime activities. The Feres doctrine also limits the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity. The Feres doctrine, named after the 1950 case Feres v. United States, grants immunity to the government from tort claims by active duty servicemembers. The Supreme Court dismissed claims of negligence in cases involving unsafe barracks, a towel left in a patient's stomach, and negligent medical treatment. The Feres doctrine grants the government immunity from tort claims by active duty servicemembers, barring them from suing for injuries related to military service. This doctrine is not explicitly codified in the FTCA but is justified by the Supreme Court to maintain military hierarchy and discipline. The Supreme Court upholds the Feres doctrine, granting government immunity from tort claims by active duty servicemembers to maintain military hierarchy and discipline. Despite debates, the Court has reaffirmed or expanded Feres on multiple occasions, most recently denying a petition to overrule it for certain medical malpractice claims. The FTCA limits compensation for medical malpractice claims against the federal government, restricting damages recoverable by plaintiffs. This includes barring punitive damages, prejudgment interest, and most attorney's fees. Congress has the power to amend the FTCA to change these limitations, but has not done so yet. The FTCA limits damages recoverable by plaintiffs, with exceptions for intervening facts or newly discovered evidence. Congress has also established procedural limitations on pursuing tort lawsuits against the United States. The FTCA imposes procedural requirements for filing a tort lawsuit against the United States, including statute-of-limitations and exhaustion provisions. Plaintiffs must first present their claim to the appropriate federal agency and have it finally denied before filing a lawsuit. These requirements aim to encourage settlement of disputes within administrative agencies to reduce court congestion. The FTCA encourages settlement of claims within administrative agencies to reduce court congestion and save time and costs. Claimants have two years to notify the federal agency of their claim, which must sufficiently describe the injury for investigation. Failure to submit a claim within the time limit bars any tort claim against the United States. The FTCA requires claimants to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. If an administrative settlement is reached, no further litigation occurs. If no settlement is reached, the claimant can file suit in federal court. The FTCA requires claimants to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit in federal court. Claimants typically have six months from the date of denial to initiate an FTCA lawsuit against the United States. Failure to file within this deadline will result in the claim being forever barred. If a federal agency does not promptly decide on a claim, constructive exhaustion can be used after six months to deem it as a final denial for the purpose of the FTCA's exhaustion requirement. Section 2675(a) of the FTCA allows a plaintiff to file a lawsuit against the United States before the agency formally denies their administrative claim. The Supreme Court has been hesitant to change long-standing FTCA doctrines without congressional action, suggesting that legislative changes may be needed if current legal principles are disapproved. Some have proposed modifications to the FTCA, but recent legislative proposals to alter it have not been successful. Recent legislative proposals have suggested changes to the FTCA, including carving out certain claims, expanding or narrowing the definition of \"employee,\" and amending exceptions to the federal government's waiver of sovereign immunity. These proposals raise policy questions for Congress to consider, as broadening the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity could increase the number of victims seeking recourse in federal courts. Recent legislative proposals have suggested changes to the FTCA, including narrowing the immunity waiver which could result in cost savings for the United States and decrease potential judicial interference with federal operations. One proposal gaining attention is abrogating or narrowing the Feres doctrine, which shields the federal government from liability for injuries to servicemen. Opponents argue that this doctrine inappropriately bars accountability. Opponents of the Feres doctrine argue that it unjustly prevents servicemembers from seeking recourse for their injuries, particularly in cases of medical malpractice or sexual abuse. Some advocates, including Members of Congress and legal commentators, propose eliminating or narrowing the doctrine to allow servicemembers to pursue tort claims under the FTCA. In contrast, supporters of Feres argue that abolishing it could lead to disruptive intra-military lawsuits that would harm military order and effectiveness. Supporters of the Feres doctrine argue that allowing servicemembers to sue the United States would disrupt military order and increase the government's liability. They suggest that injured servicemembers may still have remedies under other federal statutes. Congress has periodically reviewed the Feres doctrine, with the most recent hearing held in April 2019. If Congress decides to authorize servicemembers to file tort lawsuits against the United States, it has various options to consider. Congress has options to authorize servicemembers to prosecute tort lawsuits against the United States, such as abolishing Feres entirely or allowing suits for certain injuries. Alternative compensation mechanisms could also be created to provide relief to injured servicemembers. Congress has periodically introduced bills proposing to modify the Feres doctrine, including the Sfc. Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019 (H.R. 2422) which would allow members of the Armed Forces to bring claims against the United States for medical negligence. Additionally, Congress can enact private legislation to compensate individual tort victims who are unable to seek recourse under the FTCA. Some suggest that Congress should pass private bills to compensate injured persons who lack recourse under the FTCA, as Congress still has the authority to do so despite the FTCA's existence. Congress has provided compensation in situations where the FTCA waiver of immunity does not apply."
