    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The Act is named the \"Christopher Bryski Student Loan Protection Act\" or \"Christopher's Law.\" Congress finds that private educational lenders' promissory notes lack clear descriptions of borrower and cosigner responsibilities in cases of disability, incapacitation, or death. The CFPB received 2,900 private student loan complaints in less than seven months, with cosigners expressing concerns about discharge options in such situations. The complaints received by the CFPB regarding private student loans include issues such as improper payment application, delays in resolving errors, and difficulty contacting the right personnel during hardships. There is a lack of clarity on discharge options for cosigners in cases of disability or death. Private student loans in default amount to over $8 billion, with more than 850,000 individual loans affected. Borrowers often lack awareness of the differences between federal and private loan protections. Private education loan borrowers are not required to designate an alternate contact in case of death or disability. Traumatic brain injuries affect around 1,700,000 people annually, with older adolescents being more at risk. In the United States, there are approximately 12,000 new cases of spinal cord injuries each year, leading to permanent disability. A significant percentage of students borrow money from private lenders for higher education. In 2009, the cosigned private education loans increased from 66 percent. In 2009, cosigned private education loans increased from 66 percent to 84 percent of all private education loans. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL STUDENT LOAN PROTECTIONS. Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include additional protections for borrowers and cosigners of private education loans. Lenders must clearly describe cosigner obligations in case of death, disability, or inability to work, ensuring a reasonable understanding of the obligations. The cosigner for a private education loan must designate someone to act on their behalf in case of death, disability, or inability to work. Lenders are required to provide comprehensive information on loan terms and borrower responsibilities to both the borrower and cosigner. The Bureau will publish a model form for describing a cosigner's obligations for a private education loan. The definition of 'death, disability, or inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity' for borrowers and cosigners will be based on specific conditions outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Bureau will interpret regulations to align with those set by the Secretary of Education to prevent fraud and abuse. Definitions in the Truth in Lending Act are amended to include the term 'cosigner' as an individual liable for another's obligation without compensation. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will issue regulations within a year to implement section 140(g) of the Truth in Lending Act, which includes defining the term 'cosigner' as an individual liable for another's obligation without compensation. SEC. 3. FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS. Information on loan discharge due to death, disability, or inability to work is added to the Higher Education Act. Private education loan borrowers may still be obligated to repay the full amount, even in the event of borrower's death or disability. The Higher Education Act now includes details on loan discharge in case of death, disability, or inability to work. It outlines repayment, refinance, deferment, and forgiveness options for borrowers and cosigners in such situations. Additionally, a designated individual can act on behalf of the borrower as per the amendment. The amendment to the Higher Education Act allows students to designate someone to act on their behalf for loans in case of death, disability, or inability to work."
