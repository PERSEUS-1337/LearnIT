    "content": "The Trump Administration has focused on reviewing and potentially modifying or repealing Clean Air Act regulations issued under the Obama Administration. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting these reviews as part of the Administration's regulatory reform initiative, directing federal agencies to evaluate existing regulations for replacement, repeal, or modification. Executive Order (E.O.) 13783 has also directed EPA and other agencies to review regulations that may burden domestically produced energy resources and to suspend, revise, or rescind them as necessary. The EPA is reviewing regulations under the Clean Air Act, focusing on rules for greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, cars, and the oil and gas sector. The agency's authority to regulate GHGs comes from the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, with the Supreme Court affirming EPA's ability to set standards for GHG emissions. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court ruled that GHGs are air pollutants and must be regulated if they endanger public health. EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009, and in American Electric Power, the Court upheld EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions. In 2009, EPA made an endangerment finding regarding GHG emissions. The Supreme Court ruled in American Electric Power, Inc. v. Connecticut that corporations cannot be sued for GHG emissions under federal common law as the CAA delegates regulation to EPA. EPA's GHG regulations focus on six gases linked to climate change, with carbon dioxide being the most prevalent, accounting for about 80% of annual emissions. EPA has promulgated GHG emission standards for power plants, oil, and gas sectors. The EPA has implemented GHG standards for power plants, the oil and gas industry, trucks, and light-duty vehicles. These regulations aim to reduce CO2 emissions, with the electricity sector historically being the largest emitter. The agency is currently reviewing and proposing changes to these rules. In 2017, the electricity sector accounted for 27.5% of total U.S. GHG emissions. In 2017, the electricity sector accounted for 27.5% of total U.S. GHG emissions. EPA finalized GHG emission standards for fossil-fueled power plants in 2015, primarily affecting coal-fired units. The Clean Power Plan sets state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from existing power plants based on improved efficiency at coal-fired power plants. EPA received over 4 million public comments on the proposed standards, making it the most commented rulemaking in the agency's history. The Clean Power Plan sets state-specific emission reduction goals based on efficiency improvements at coal-fired power plants, substitution of natural gas generation, and increased renewable energy use. These goals will be phased in starting in 2022, with final targets to be met by 2030. The electric power industry has already seen significant changes since the plan was proposed in 2014, with coal plants being retired and replaced by cleaner sources like natural gas and renewables. This shift has led to a decrease in CO2 emissions from the sector. Emissions of CO2 from the electric power sector have declined faster than required by the Clean Power Plan (CPP) due to factors like cheap natural gas, incentives for wind and solar power, and tighter EPA standards. The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants, introduced alongside the CPP, faced controversy for relying on costly and unproven carbon capture technology to reduce emissions from coal-fired units. Critics argued that this would hinder the construction of new coal plants. The NSPS would have effectively prohibited new coal-fired plants as no commercial U.S. power plant was capturing and storing CO2 at the time. The implementation of the Clean Power Plan has been stayed by the Supreme Court since February 2016. Challenges to the rule were filed by over 100 parties, including 27 states, and consolidated into a single case, West Virginia v. EPA. The D.C. Circuit has not issued a ruling as of now. The Clean Power Plan and NSPS have faced legal challenges, with the Trump Administration proposing to repeal the CPP and replace it with the ACE rule. The ACE rule aims to apply a narrower interpretation of emission reduction measures. The ACE rule proposes on-site heat rate improvements for existing coal-fired units as the best system of emission reduction (BSER), without establishing a numeric performance standard. It also includes revisions to CAA Section 111(d) regulations and modifications to the NSR applicability test for certain power plants. The EPA proposed revisions to the NSPS and NSR regulations for power plants, replacing the BSER for coal-fired units with on-site heat rate improvements to promote energy efficiency. The agency cited high costs and limited availability of CCS as reasons for the change. The EPA's legal basis for the 2015 NSPS rule was based on the endangerment finding that GHGs endanger public health and welfare. In the rule, EPA concluded that a separate endangerment finding under Section 111 for power plants was unnecessary as they had already been listed previously. The EPA argued that an additional endangerment finding for a new pollutant emitted by power plants was unnecessary as they had already been listed under Section 111. The agency also noted that electric generating units would meet the endangerment requirement due to significant CO2 emissions. The 2018 NSPS rule did not propose to reconsider the endangerment finding but requested comments on the issue. EPA also asked for feedback on regulating CO2 emissions from new coal-fired units and whether an endangerment finding is required once for a source. The EPA is considering whether an endangerment finding is required once for a source category or for each additional pollutant regulated. The NSPS revision and CPP repeal are still in the proposal stage, with public comment and judicial review processes involved. Stakeholders, including some states, may oppose the changes. Congress could potentially intervene through legislation regarding the CPP. The EPA finalized New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in 2016 to control methane emissions from oil and gas production. Congressional action to overturn the CPP or NSPS is unlikely due to filibuster threats. Oversight hearings are expected as EPA finalizes actions on the ACE rule and NSPS. The Obama Administration implemented a rule to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40%-45% from 2012 levels by 2025. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential more than 25 times greater than carbon dioxide. EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions shows that over 25% of methane emissions in the U.S. come from oil activities. The EPA projected that new standards for oil and gas production would reduce methane emissions by 510,000 tons in 2025, equivalent to cutting 11 million metric tons of CO2. The rule would also decrease emissions of VOCs and hazardous air pollutants, with estimated costs of $530 million and climate benefits of $690 million. This methane rule is under review as per E.O. 13783 signed by President Trump in 2017. On March 12, 2018, EPA made revisions to the 2016 NSPS, removing the requirement to repair leaking components during shutdowns and implementing separate monitoring for Alaskan North Slope well sites. On October 15, 2018, EPA proposed further amendments to decrease monitoring frequency, repair schedules, expand technical provisions, and amend professional engineer requirements for pneumatic pumps. The EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 NSPS, including infeasibility provision for pneumatic pumps and changes to professional engineer certification requirements. The agency also mentioned addressing broader policy issues related to greenhouse gases in a separate proposal. The comment period for the amendments closed on December 17, 2018. The EPA, DOT, and California established \"One National Program\" for GHG emissions and fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. The second round of standards for model years 2017-2025 aims to reduce GHG emissions by 50% compared to 2010 levels and increase fuel economy. The auto industry supported national standards to avoid state-by-state regulations. The EPA, DOT, and California established \"One National Program\" for GHG emissions and fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. The second round of standards for model years 2017-2025 aims to reduce GHG emissions by 50% compared to 2010 levels and increase fuel economy. EPA conducted a Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) for the MY2022-2025 standards in 2018, determining that the standards remained appropriate and no changes were warranted. The EPA Administrator made a final determination to retain the MY2022-2025 standards as originally promulgated, accelerating the timeline for the Mid-Term Evaluation. EPA emphasized the importance of regulatory certainty for the automotive industry, despite criticism from some industry groups. The Trump Administration reopened the Mid-Term Evaluation in March 2017 and on April 2, 2018, EPA released a revised final determination stating that the MY2022-2025 standards should be revised due to outdated information. EPA and DOT proposed amendments to fuel economy and GHG emission standards on August 24, 2018, offering eight alternatives. The agencies' preferred alternative is to retain existing emission standards through MY2020 and freeze them at this level through MY2026. The proposed standards would result in an estimated average fuel economy of 37 mpg for MY2020-2026 vehicles, leading to a projected increase in fuel consumption. The agencies project a net benefit from revising the standards, considering compliance costs, fatalities, and injuries. The proposed standards were open to public comment for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. The EPA and DOT proposed to retain existing emission standards through MY2020 and freeze them at this level through MY2026. They aim to withdraw California's CAA preemption waiver for its vehicle GHG standards applicable to MYs 2021-2025. DOT argues that state laws regulating tailpipe CO2 emissions can be preempted under EPCA. Comments on the proposal were accepted until October 26, 2018. EPA and DOT also established joint GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The EPA and DOT finalized new GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks on August 16, 2016. The Phase 2 standards cover MYs 2018-2027 for certain trailers and MYs 2021-2027 for various types of vehicles. These standards are expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons, save $170 billion in fuel costs, and decrease oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels. The total cost of implementing these standards is estimated at $29-$31 billion over the lifetime of MY2018-2029 trucks. The cost of a long haul tractor-trailer could increase by $13,500 in MY2027. The EPA and DOT finalized new GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, expecting to reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons and save $170 billion in fuel costs. The cost of a long haul tractor-trailer could increase by $13,500 in MY2027, but the buyer would recoup the investment in fuel-efficient technology in less than two years through fuel savings. The truck standards have been well received, with the American Trucking Associations cautiously optimistic and the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association highlighting collaboration between EPA and DOT. The EPA and DOT collaborated to issue a final rule for greenhouse gas reductions and fuel efficiency improvements for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association and Racing Enthusiasts and Suppliers Coalition were the only challengers. EPA requested a review of the rule, which was granted by the D.C. Circuit Court. Certain requirements for trailers were stayed pending judicial review, while the rest of the rule remains in effect. The EPA proposed a repeal of emission standards for heavy-duty glider vehicles, engines, and kits, based on a CAA interpretation. Efforts to expedite the proposal have faced resistance from states, environmental groups, and trucking stakeholders. EPA's fall 2018 agenda categorizes the glider rulemaking as a \"long-term action.\" Air quality has improved significantly since the Clean Air Act (CAA) was passed in 1970, with emissions of key pollutants decreasing by over 70%. Despite this progress, challenges remain in achieving clean air due to evolving scientific knowledge leading to stricter EPA standards. Congress mandated the EPA to review and revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) every five years to keep up with evolving understanding of air pollution's effects on public health. Studies have linked air pollution, particularly ozone and fine particles, to premature deaths and illnesses. The EPA conducts Integrated Science Assessments (ISAs) and Risk Analyses to inform NAAQS reviews, with the most recent ISA for particulate matter confirming a causal relationship with health issues. The EPA's review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) found a causal relationship between air pollution and total mortality. As of March 31, 2019, millions of people lived in areas classified as \"nonattainment\" for ozone and fine particulate matter NAAQS. The EPA's reviews of these standards are ongoing and may be contentious, with minimal requirements set by the Clean Air Act for the agency's conduct. The EPA intends to streamline NAAQS reviews and obtain CASAC advice on background pollution and compliance strategies. In 2018, the agency disbanded pollutant-specific review panels, relying on CASAC for ozone and particulate matter NAAQS reviews. Some CASAC members have raised concerns about this approach. Since 2018, the EPA has relied on CASAC for ozone and particulate matter NAAQS reviews, disbanding pollutant-specific panels. Concerns have been raised about CASAC's expertise for the ozone review, with recommendations for reappointing previous panel members. Controversy has surrounded the NAAQS for ozone since 2008, with stricter standards implemented in 2008 and 2015. The 2015 revision of the ozone NAAQS set more stringent standards than the 2008 standards, lowering both primary and secondary standards from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. EPA identified 52 nonattainment areas with a combined population of 124 million where air quality exceeds the 2015 NAAQS. EPA's analysis showed that most nonattainment counties could reach attainment by 2025 with the new standards. EPA estimated the cost of meeting a 70 ppb ozone standard in all states except California at $1.4 billion annually in 2025, with separate cost estimates for California ($0.8 billion in 2038). These estimates are lower than industry sources. EPA faces a deadline of October 2020 to review the ozone NAAQS. EPA declined to convene a scientific review panel specific to ozone and intends to seek CASAC advice on potential adverse effects from NAAQS compliance strategies. The agency completed a review of particulate matter NAAQS in 2012, focusing on regulatory costs and potential impacts on economic growth and industry operations. Congressional deliberations also raised concerns about the impact of more stringent standards on employment and consumers. In 2014, EPA began the current review of particulate matter standards. In October 2018, EPA submitted a draft ISA to CASAC for review. CASAC found the ISA lacking in comprehensive assessment and recommended substantial revisions. EPA has not yet responded to these recommendations. EPA is reviewing various regulations, including air toxics rules for power plants and NSPS rules for particulate matter from wood heaters. The agency aims to complete the particulate matter NAAQS review by December 2020. Additionally, Congress may be interested in the Renewable Fuel Standard program and its management. EPA is directed by the CAA to establish emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act establishes National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for major sources, known as Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards. EPA is required to review and revise these standards every eight years. The 2015 MACT standards for brick, structural clay, and ceramic clay kilns set limits for mercury, particulate matter, acid gases, dioxins, and furans, with estimated annual costs of $25 million and significant co-benefits. The Brick Industry Association praised the EPA's revised proposal for MACT standards for brick kilns, expressing concerns about cost and achievability. Environmental groups and state air pollution officials criticized the EPA for setting standards under an alternative to MACT, citing carcinogenic risks of ethylene oxide. The D.C. Circuit ordered the EPA to revise the 2015 standards but did not vacate them. EPA is addressing ethylene oxide emissions, particularly from commercial sterilizers, due to potential cancer risks. The agency is reviewing NESHAP regulations for miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing and plans to propose necessary revisions by mid-2019. EPA is under a court order to complete the NESHAP review by March 2020. EPA is required to periodically review and update NESHAPs, including the MON and commercial sterilization NESHAPs, which were due for revision in 2014. Legislative proposals in the 116th Congress aim to update NESHAPs for ethylene oxide, with bills like S. 458 and H.R. 1152 directing EPA to revise these regulations within 180 days. EPA is also reevaluating the benefit-cost analysis for the MATS rule, raising questions about potential further action in 2019. The MATS rule, established in February 2012, aimed to reduce mercury and acid gases from coal- and oil-fired power plants. EPA estimated annual benefits of $37 billion to $90 billion, including avoiding up to 11,000 premature deaths. The Supreme Court remanded the rule in June 2015 due to a lack of benefit-cost analysis. EPA is now reevaluating the MATS rule, raising questions about potential further action in 2019. In June 2015, the Supreme Court remanded the MATS rule to the D.C. Circuit for further consideration. EPA prepared a supplemental finding in 2016, concluding it is appropriate and necessary to regulate air toxics, including mercury, from power plants after considering costs. The MATS rule remains in effect, with litigation on hold. In late 2018, EPA proposed to reverse the 2016 finding, but this would not revoke the emissions limits established in the 2012 rule. Some stakeholders, including Members of Congress and power sector trade organizations, oppose revoking the MATS standards proposed in 2018. However, Murray Energy Corporation supports the 2018 proposal. Murray Energy Corporation, the largest privately owned U.S. coal company, testified against the adoption of MATS and urged the EPA to rescind the 2012 MATS rule immediately. The 2018 A&N proposal reflects changes in EPA's interpretation of the CAA and excludes co-benefits from its analysis, finding that costs outweigh benefits by a significant margin. In 2015, EPA finalized emission standards for new residential wood heaters, sparking interest in areas where wood is used for heating. Concerns were raised in Congress about compliance time and air quality impacts of delaying the 2020 deadline. H.R. 1917 was passed by the House to delay implementation for three years, and EPA proposed a two-year \"sell-through\" period for new hydronic heaters and forced-air furnaces. EPA's proposal allows affected new hydronic heaters and forced-air furnaces to be sold at retail through May 2022. An advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in 2018 for new residential wood heaters, hydronic heaters, and air furnaces to improve standards and test methods. Stakeholder feedback prompted EPA to request comments on topics such as meeting emission limits, compliance dates, and certification test methods. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates a minimum volume of renewable fuel in U.S. transportation fuel, established in 2005 and expanded in 2007. The RFS increases annually, aiming for 36 billion gallons in 2022, with the EPA setting post-2022 volumes. Eligible renewable fuels include transportation fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil, meeting environmental and biomass criteria. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates a minimum volume of renewable fuel in U.S. transportation fuel, with corn starch ethanol being the predominant fuel used. Congress is concerned about RFS management, potential impacts on stakeholders, and related biofuel issues. Topics include small refinery exemptions, year-round sale of E15, compliance costs, RFS \"reset,\" and approval of advanced biofuel pathways. H.R. 104, the LEVEL Act, is a legislative proposal in the 116th Congress that aims to decrease biofuel levels in gasoline and eliminate the advanced biofuel mandate. Stakeholders involved are renewable fuel producers, agricultural producers, the petroleum industry, and environmental organizations. Legislation introduced in the 115th Congress may be reintroduced in the 116th Congress to decrease biofuel levels in gasoline and eliminate the advanced biofuel mandate.
