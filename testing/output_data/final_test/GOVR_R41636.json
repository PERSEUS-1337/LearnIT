    "content": "The apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives is determined by the U.S. Constitution, federal legislation, and legal determinations. There have been proposals to change the population basis for apportionment from \"persons\" to \"citizens.\" The report examines the impact of changing the apportionment basis from \"persons\" to \"citizens\" on House seats distribution for the 114th Congress. It also shows the apportionment using 2013 citizen population estimates. According to the 14th Amendment, Representatives are apportioned based on the number of persons in each State, excluding untaxed Indians. The 14th Amendment states that representation in Congress is based on the number of persons in each State, not just citizens. Changing this basis to citizens would likely require a constitutional amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that only actual population counts from the census can be used for apportionment in the House of Representatives, not estimates from sample surveys. The only current source for citizenship status information is the American Community Survey. Any change to base representation on citizens instead of persons would require a constitutional amendment, which would likely delay any new apportionment until 2020 at the earliest. In the 111th Congress, Representative Candice Miller introduced a constitutional amendment for apportioning House seats based on citizen population. Representative Virginia Foxx and Senator Robert F. Bennett proposed The Fairness in Representation Act to include citizenship status on the census questionnaire. In the 111th Congress, there were various proposals regarding the inclusion of citizenship status in census data for apportioning House seats. Senator David Vitter introduced an amendment to the appropriations act, but it was ruled non-germane. Representative Joe Baca also introduced a bill to prevent the Census Bureau from collecting citizenship or immigration status information. The 1990 and 2000 censuses included citizenship status questions on the long-form questionnaire, while the short form only had basic demographic questions. The 2010 census had plans for a different approach with a basic set of questions similar to the short form. The 2010 census had a different approach compared to the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form questionnaire to collect detailed information, including citizenship status. The ACS is the only source for detailed citizenship information, based on respondents' answers without verification of legal documentation. The Census Bureau does not verify citizenship status through legal documentation unless required by law. The concept of residence differs between the Census and ACS surveys, making it challenging to accurately estimate citizenship status on the census questionnaire. The Census Bureau does not verify citizenship status through legal documentation unless required by law. Differences in residence definitions between the Census and ACS surveys make estimating citizenship status on the census questionnaire challenging. The ACS is a sample survey subject to sampling error, unlike the decennial census which aims for a 100 percent count. Sampling errors for estimating the 2013 citizen population based on the ACS have been calculated and shown in tables. The decennial census collects information over many months but refers back to a single date, April 1, 2010. In contrast, the ACS samples households monthly over a year, with yearly estimates based on accumulated results. The ACS-1Yr timeframe is not a single day but a year of monthly samples. The American Community Survey (ACS) collects household samples monthly over a year, providing yearly average data unlike the census which refers to a specific date. The 2010 apportionment population includes state residents and overseas military/civilian federal employees. Table 1 displays this information for each state, along with the ratio of overseas population to residential population. The ratio of overseas military and civilian federal employees to the resident population in 2010 is used to estimate the 2013 overseas population. This ratio is applied to the 2013 resident population to calculate the estimated overseas population. The process of estimating the 2013 apportionment population for each state is shown in Table 2. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the resident population of the United States, states, counties, and Puerto Rico annually using the \"cohort components method.\" Column 3 shows state population estimates as of July 1, 2013, while Column 4 calculates the 2013 overseas population. The 2013 estimated apportionment population is obtained by adding the resident and overseas populations. Table 3 displays citizenship data from the 2013 American Community Survey. The 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) collected citizenship data by asking respondents to select one of five categories to define their citizenship status. The results are associated with a margin of error (MoE) to calculate upper and lower bounds at a 90% confidence level. The 2013 American Community Survey collected citizenship data by asking respondents to select one of five categories to define their citizenship status, including being born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. state, abroad of U.S. citizen parent(s), naturalized U.S. citizen, or not a U.S. citizen. People born in American Samoa are included in the second category. The 2013 ACS survey collected citizenship data by asking respondents to select one of five categories. Information from other household members was used to assign citizenship status. The estimated total resident citizen population for 2013 was calculated by summing values from Table 3. Table 4 displays the resident citizen population estimate, upper and lower bound populations for each state, and the estimated overseas population for each state. The apportionment population for each state is calculated by adding the resident population to the overseas population. This data is used to estimate the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. If citizen population had been used for apportionment after the 2000 census, nine seats would have shifted among 13 states, with California losing six Representatives. Florida and Texas would have gained two seats each. Based on estimated population data, if the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives were conducted today, Florida and Texas would have lost one of the two additional seats they were scheduled to receive. New York would lose an additional seat, and nine states would have gained one more Representative than they did in the 2000 apportionment. Based on estimated population data, if the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives were conducted today, Minnesota would lose a seat and North Carolina would gain a seat. The distribution of House seats among the states would change by 7 seats based on the estimated 2013 citizen population. Based on estimated 2013 citizen population data, the distribution of seats in the House would change by 7 seats among 11 states. California would lose 4 seats, while Florida, New York, and Texas would each lose 1 seat. On the other hand, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia would each gain a seat. Advocates for using citizen population for apportionment argue for changes in policy to ensure only citizen population impacts the process. The apportionment process involves determining the allocation of House seats to each state based on citizen population. Changing the term \"persons\" to \"citizens\" in the 14th Amendment through a constitutional amendment is one option, but it may be deemed unconstitutional. Following apportionment, state legislatures or redistricting commissions decide the geographic areas represented by each seat. The redistricting process determines the geographic area represented by each congressional seat within a state. While the Constitution mandates apportionment based on \"persons,\" it is silent on how district boundaries are drawn. Federal courts have set criteria for drawing districts, which may include using total population or a state's citizen population. The U.S. Census Bureau provides census information for redistricting one year after census day. The Fairness in Representation Act proposed by Representative Foxx and Senator Bennett in the 111th Congress aims to require the Census Bureau to collect citizenship status information on the 100% census form for drawing boundaries for congressional districts. States have voter registration information at the address level, which could serve as a surrogate for the citizen population in redistricting. The Fairness in Representation Act proposes using voter registration information as a surrogate for the citizen population in redistricting. This could potentially impact the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The method of apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives is determined by population size, number of seats, apportionment method, and number of states. Currently, the method of equal proportions is used, but it can be changed by Congress. Walter F. Willcox proposed the method of smallest divisors as a close simulation to using citizen population. The method of smallest divisors, also known as the Adams method, is advocated for its simplicity and persuasive theory. It aims to secure fair district populations and is based on rounding up fractional remainders to allocate seats. This method has not been used in practice for apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The method of smallest divisors, also known as the Adams method, aims to allocate seats in the U.S. House of Representatives based on rounding up fractional remainders to ensure fair district populations. This method tends to favor less populated states and areas with fewer non-citizens, potentially making it less representative than the current equal proportion method. The method of smallest divisors, also known as the Adams method, aims to allocate seats in the U.S. House of Representatives based on rounding up fractional remainders to ensure fair district populations. While the distribution of seats based on the citizen population using the method of equal proportions is not exactly the same as that based on the total population using the method of smallest divisors, the impact of using the smallest divisors method falls between the distributions using the equal proportions method on the 2013 total and citizen apportionment population estimates. Other methods of apportioning the total population could be developed to mimic the results of the equal proportion method more closely. An alternative to amending the constitution to replace total population with citizen population for apportionment purposes could be changing the apportionment method. The 2013 ACS total population is divided into five parts based on citizenship status, with the citizen population comprising the first four parts. These values are estimates subject to sampling error. The American Factfinder application produces the margin of error (MOE) for estimates at a 90 percent confidence level. MoEs have been converted to 95 percent confidence level using a specific formula. The MoE values are displayed in Table A-1. The citizen population estimate is calculated by summing responses to citizenship status questions. The citizen population estimate is calculated by summing responses to citizenship status questions, with the MOE CIT for the citizen population calculated using a specific formula. The upper and lower bounds for the estimate are determined by adding and subtracting the MOE value. The 95% upper and lower bounds for the 2013 ACS resident citizen population estimate can be found in Table A-2. The 95% upper and lower bounds for the 2013 ACS resident citizen population estimate for each state are calculated by adding and subtracting the MOE 95 value from Table A-2 to the estimated population value in Table 4."
