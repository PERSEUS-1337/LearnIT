    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2100 of the Elections Code is amended to require a certified copy of a court judgment for registration. Section 2102 is also amended. Section 2102 states that a person must register as a voter through an affidavit of registration, which should be mailed or delivered to the county elections official with all required information. The registration is effective upon receipt by the official before the 15th day prior to an election, or if postmarked by that date and received by mail. The affidavit of registration must be submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles or another designated agency, delivered to the county elections official, or submitted electronically on the Secretary of State's website before the 15th day prior to the election. A properly executed affidavit of registration is deemed effective for signature verification on various election petitions if submitted on time. The affidavit of registration must be submitted before the 15th day prior to the election and received by the county elections official on or before the filing date. The affidavit does not need to be sworn under oath but must be certified as truthful and correct by the affiant's signature, under penalty of perjury. A person who is at least 16 years old and meets all voting eligibility requirements can submit an affidavit of registration. The registration will be effective when the person turns 18 if the information is still current. If the information is not current, the person must update it with the county elections official. A person can register to vote by submitting an affidavit of registration to the county elections official. The affidavit must contain all required information and be received before the 15th day before an election. If postmarked on or before the deadline and received by mail, the registration is also deemed effective. The affidavit of registration can be submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles or other designated agencies, delivered to the county elections official, or submitted electronically on the Secretary of State's website before the 15th day before the election. It is deemed effective for signature verification on various election petitions if properly executed. The affidavit of registration must be signed before or on the same date as the petition, received by the county elections official before filing, and certified as truthful under penalty of perjury. A person aged 16 or older can submit an affidavit of registration to vote, effective when they turn 18 if the information is current. If the information is not current, they must update it with the county elections official. Individuals with disabilities can register to vote with reasonable accommodations. An individual with a disability under a conservatorship can register to vote if not disqualified. Chapter 4.5 of the Elections Code establishes the California New Motor Voter Program to address voter registration barriers. The program aims to increase eligible citizens registering to vote. The California New Motor Voter Program aims to increase voter registration opportunities for eligible citizens, with the Secretary of State responsible for determining eligibility. The Department of Motor Vehicles will electronically provide the Secretary of State with records of individuals applying for driver's licenses or identification cards, including name, date of birth, addresses, signature, telephone number, and email address. The Department of Motor Vehicles will provide the Secretary of State with records of individuals applying for driver's licenses or identification cards, including contact information, language preference, political party preference, voter eligibility attestation, and other specified information for outreach and education purposes. The Secretary must provide outreach materials in languages other than English as required by the Voting Rights Act. The Department of Motor Vehicles cannot sell or transfer information without approval, and records of driver's license applicants unable to prove legal presence will not be electronically provided. Implementation of this section must begin within one year of certification by the Secretary of State. The State complies with federal voter registration requirements and has funded the California New Motor Voter Program. Regulations have been adopted, and the Department of Motor Vehicles cannot provide records with confidential home addresses. The willful disclosure of information from the Department of Motor Vehicles is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or imprisonment. The Secretary of State must establish procedures to protect the confidentiality of this information. The Secretary of State will register a person to vote unless they declined during a DMV transaction, do not meet voter eligibility requirements, or are determined ineligible. If a registered voter does not provide a party preference, they will be designated as \"Unknown\" and treated as a \"No Party Preference\" voter. A voter registered under this chapter can cancel their registration at any time. The confidentiality of voter registration information is maintained for specific individuals, including victims of domestic violence, reproductive health care providers, and public safety officers. If an ineligible person becomes registered to vote under this chapter without violating Section 18100, it is presumed to be authorized. If they vote after registration, they are presumed to have official authorization unless they knowingly vote unlawfully. The Secretary of State will implement regulations for the California New Motor Voter Program, including canceling registrations of ineligible voters and conducting an education campaign in multiple languages as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Section 2.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 2102 of the Elections Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 589 before this bill, and both bills becoming effective by January 1, 2016. If these conditions are met, the amendments will be operative. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred due to this act creating a new crime or infraction, eliminating a crime or infraction, changing the penalty for a crime or infraction, or changing the definition of a crime."
