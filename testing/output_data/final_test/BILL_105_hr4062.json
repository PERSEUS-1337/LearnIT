    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Financial Derivatives Supervisory Improvement Act of 1998\". The Congress emphasizes the need for consistent and clear regulation of derivative instruments used by financial institutions, particularly banks and their affiliates who are key players in the derivatives markets. Regulation of these markets directly impacts the liquidity, efficiency, capital position, and safety of the banking industry and the Federal deposit insurance fund. Additionally, it has significant implications for the effectiveness of bank supervision, including the capital provisions of Federal banking agencies. The Congress calls for updating regulations on derivatives in the United States to keep pace with market changes driven by technological advances and enhance legal certainty in transactions. Interagency cooperation is desired to harmonize rules, as regulatory arbitrage is a concern. This is crucial for the stability of the international financial system and the competitiveness of US financial institutions. The competitive position of US financial institutions is at risk if foreign markets are regulated less prudently than in the US. Establishment of working group on financial derivatives.
