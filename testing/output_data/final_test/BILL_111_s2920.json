    "content": "The Act titled \"Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2009\" mandates the use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat intoxicated driving. The Act \"Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2009\" mandates the use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat intoxicated driving. Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include definitions related to alcohol concentration, driving while intoxicated, and ignition interlock devices. An ignition interlock device is a breathalyzer installed in a vehicle that prevents it from starting if the driver's alcohol concentration is above the legal limit. The term \"motor vehicle\" excludes vehicles operated on rail lines or commercial vehicles. States must enact laws requiring ignition interlock devices to meet certain requirements. The subsection requires states to enforce a law mandating the installation of ignition interlock devices for 180 days on vehicles driven by individuals convicted of DUI. The Secretary will withhold funds from states that do not comply with these requirements, with increasing percentages for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The Secretary will withhold 5 percent of funds from states that do not meet the requirements for apportionment under certain sections. Withheld funds remain available for three fiscal years, and if states comply, the funds will be apportioned back to them. If a State meets the requirements before the last day of the period, the Secretary will apportion the withheld funds back to the State. The apportioned funds will remain available for expenditure until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year in which they are apportioned, after which they will lapse. If a State fails to meet the requirements of subsection (b), the withheld funds will lapse. Sec. 167. Use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat intoxicated driving."
