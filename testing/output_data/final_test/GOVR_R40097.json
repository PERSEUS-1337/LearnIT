    "content": "Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the United States cause fatalities, property destruction, and disruptions. The federal government issues warnings and provides aid through the Stafford Act during overwhelming disasters. Agriculture programs assist farmers financially after severe weather events. Many observers note that while the number of lives lost to natural hazards in the United States has decreased, the costs of major disasters are rising due to changes in population demographics and weather-sensitive infrastructure. Americans are more vulnerable than ever to severe weather events like tornadoes, hurricanes, and winter weather. Despite improvements in detection and warning systems, outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes still cause significant damage and loss of life in the 21st century. In 2011, a series of tornado and severe weather outbreaks caused over 550 fatalities and approximately $28 billion in property damage in the United States. It was one of the top three most active tornado years since 1950, with nearly 1,700 tornadoes reported. The following years saw a decrease in tornado activity, with 70 deaths in 2012 and 45 deaths in 2010 from \"killer tornadoes.\" In 2013, tornado activity was below average until a destructive EF-5 tornado hit Moore, Oklahoma, causing numerous fatalities. The report highlights the impact of powerful tornadoes despite the majority being less severe. The report discusses forecasting severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, mitigation efforts, and the impact of climate change. It focuses on the role of the National Weather Service in communicating risks, the hazards posed by severe weather, and federally sponsored forecast and warning systems. Congress has oversight and funding responsibilities for these efforts. The federal role in supporting programs for hazard mitigation, such as the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004, is a concern for Congress. The Windstorm Impact Reduction Program expired in FY2008, and it is unclear if it met its goals. Legislation to reauthorize appropriations and make changes to the statute was introduced on April 26. Legislation (H.R. 1786) introduced on April 26, 2013 aims to reauthorize appropriations and make changes to statutes related to climate change impacts. Projections suggest a future with more intense storms, heat waves, and other extreme weather events due to global warming. The U.S. Global Change Research Program predicts increased frequency and severity of heat waves, heavy downpours, droughts, and hurricanes, highlighting the need for preparedness and mitigation measures. The National Weather Service (NWS) receives significant funding within NOAA's budget, with a focus on local warnings and forecasts (LW&F) program. Appropriations for LW&F have increased slightly more than total NWS spending over the years, but less than the overall NOAA budget. Congress may need to address the rising costs of severe weather disasters, considering changing demographics in hazard-prone areas and the potential impact of climate change on extreme weather events. The LW&F program receives a significant portion of the NWS budget each year, indicating a high priority for short-term weather prediction and warning. Recommendations suggest shifting focus towards longer-term loss reduction efforts for weather-related hazards to reduce natural disaster losses. The NWS strategic plan reflects some direction towards this shift, emphasizing the need to go beyond accurate forecasts and timely warnings. The NWS strategic plan emphasizes the shift towards \"impact-based decision support services\" to better understand and anticipate the human and economic impacts of severe weather events. It also highlights the need for scientific and technical advancements, particularly in advanced information management approaches, to interpret real-time data effectively. The NWS strategic plan focuses on collecting severe weather data to extend the preparation window for weather-dependent events. It suggests a longer-term approach in addition to the current short-term forecasting and warning emphasis, aiming to increase resilience to extreme weather events like severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. The NSTC emphasizes the need to shift from a focus on disaster response and recovery to a more proactive strategy to break the cycle of destruction. The NSTC recommends enhancing disaster resilience by implementing hazard mitigation strategies and technologies, such as advanced construction materials and nonstructural measures like land use regulations. The federal role in developing disaster-resilient materials and structures is emphasized to mitigate damages from severe weather events like thunderstorms and tornadoes. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 aimed to clarify the federal role in mitigating damages from windstorms, including tornadoes and thunderstorms. The legislation identified three primary mitigation components: improved understanding of windstorms, windstorm impact assessment, and windstorm impact reduction. However, the program's progress towards achieving major measurable reductions in losses of life and property is unclear due to lack of specific appropriations and funding information from Congress. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, established in 2004, lacks specific appropriations from Congress. H.R. 1786 was introduced in 2013 to reauthorize funding and make changes to the program, aiming to reduce losses from windstorms through a coordinated federal effort. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, established in 2004, aims to reduce losses from windstorms through a coordinated federal effort. H.R. 1786, introduced in 2013, would reauthorize funding and assign responsibilities to agencies like NIST, FEMA, NOAA, and NSF to develop mitigation measures and improve building codes and standards. H.R. 1786 would authorize appropriations for NIST, NSF, FEMA, and NOAA over a three-year period totaling $64.2 million. It would also establish an advisory committee with representatives from various sectors to improve understanding of windstorms and their impact on buildings and structures. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 320, CJ's Home Protection Act of 2009, aimed to require all manufactured homes to be equipped with NOAA Weather Radios for better tornado warning dissemination. Similar legislation was passed by the House in the 111th Congress, but the Senate did not act on it. As of May 22, 2013, no new legislation has been introduced in either chamber. The Tornado Shelters Act (P.L. 108-146) passed by the 108th Congress allows communities to use CDBG funds for tornado-safe shelters in manufactured home parks. Eligibility is based on the community size and income levels, with a requirement for being located in a state struck by a tornado in recent years. Climate change may lead to changes in weather extremes. Climate change may lead to changes in weather extremes, such as the frequency of warm nights, extreme precipitation events, and the frost-free season. However, it is unclear if severe thunderstorms and tornadoes will increase in frequency and intensity in the future. The IPCC reports have noted insufficient evidence to determine trends in small-scale phenomena like tornadoes. The number of reported tornado occurrences has doubled between 1954 and 2003, but changes in observing and reporting methods may have influenced this trend. Reports of severe thunderstorms without tornadoes increased significantly, mainly in marginally severe cases, with little evidence of a long-term trend change in severe thunderstorms. Excessive rainfall from severe thunderstorms can lead to flash floods, causing most flood-related deaths in the US. Over the last 30 years, there has been an increase in heavy precipitation events, but the relationship between these events and severe thunderstorms is unclear. Scientists also do not agree on the connection between increased precipitation and streamflow extremes. Scientists agree on the relationship between increased precipitation and streamflow extremes, such as flooding. Studies using similar data have produced different results, possibly due to human activities altering the landscape. Climate models project increased precipitation intensity with global warming. Research findings show global precipitation increased by 7.4% per degree Celsius rise during 1987-2006. Some researchers suggest a 20-year period is too short to infer long-term changes, but the link between warming and more precipitation likely holds true. It remains unclear if future precipitation intensification will be linked to other factors. The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of NOAA tracks severe weather and climate events since 1980 with a $1 billion damage threshold. Precipitation distribution is expected to become more uneven across regions, with wet areas getting wetter and dry areas getting drier. The link between intensified precipitation and severe thunderstorms or flash floods remains uncertain. The billion dollar disaster threshold used by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) serves as a proxy for counting disasters responsible for significant damage over time. Some advocacy groups use it to highlight the impact of climate change on increasing the destructive magnitude of weather-related disasters. However, questions have been raised about whether the Consumer Price Index (CPI) adequately adjusts for factors affecting changes in disaster costs over time. The study examined tornado damage from 1950 to 2011, adjusting cost estimates for inflation, wealth, population, income, and housing units. Tornado damages have declined since 1950, but the 2011 season showed potential for increased damage levels. Another study found a 5% annual increase in aggregate annual losses from 1980 to 2011, with tropical cyclones dominating damage trends. Damage from tropical cyclones is linked to variations in insurance. The study links trends in damage from tropical cyclones to variations in insurance participation rates. Increasing crop losses are complicated by the expansion of the federally subsidized crop insurance program. The report suggests an overall underestimation of average loss due to weather and climate events by 10%-15%. Some commentators believe that human-induced climate change may be linked to the 2011 tornado outbreaks. The study suggests an underestimation of average loss due to weather events by 10%-15%. Some believe human-induced climate change may be linked to the 2011 tornado outbreaks, but attributing them solely to climatic factors is challenging. NOAA's analysis aimed to determine if large-scale conditions have become more favorable for violent storms over the lower Mississippi Valley since 1979. NOAA's analysis found no discernible trend in violent storms over the lower Mississippi Valley since 1979. Tornado fatalities mostly occur in housing structures, with mobile homes being particularly vulnerable, accounting for 44% of tornado-related deaths between 1985 and 2005. The study on tornado-related deaths between 1985 and 2005 showed an increasing trend overall. Deaths in permanent homes fluctuated between 20% and 30%, while deaths in vehicles decreased to 9.9% on average. The high percentage of mobile homes in the Southeast may explain why most tornado-related deaths occur in lower Arkansas, Tennessee, and lower Mississippi River valleys. The Super Tuesday Tornado Outbreak of 2008 supported research indicating that demographics and socioeconomic factors make the mid-South regions vulnerable to tornado fatalities. NOAA observed that 63% of fatalities were in manufactured houses. The NWS has statutory authority for weather forecasting and storm warnings. They provide forecasts and warnings for severe weather events using advanced technologies like WSR-88D radar and GOES satellites. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) uses data from GOES satellites and AWIPS to make severe weather forecasts. They use numerical weather prediction models to determine atmospheric conditions that may lead to severe weather formation. The forecast process includes convective outlook, mesoscale discussion, watch, and warning stages, with forecasts issued one to two days in advance. The Storm Prediction Center issues convective outlooks to predict severe thunderstorms, with areas labeled as slight, moderate, or high risk. Mesoscale discussions provide more detailed information for forecasters to prepare for severe weather. Severe storm watches are issued when severe thunderstorms or tornadoes are likely to occur soon. The next step after severe storm watches are issued involves activating local storm spotters and closely monitoring radar imagery for severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. Local NWS offices and storm spotters use radar and visual evidence to detect severe weather threats, issuing warnings when hail, damaging winds, or tornadoes are imminent. Warnings include specific information on areas at risk, time frames, hazards, recommended protective behavior, and issuing office. The NWS communicates alerts and warnings through NOAA Weather Radio, which broadcasts weather information 24/7. The system works with the Emergency Alert System to disseminate warnings over radio, television, cable, and satellite networks. This method ensures that severe weather warnings reach the public effectively. The NWS relies on a weather warning partnership with private forecasters, news media, and emergency managers to provide consistent severe weather warnings to the public. This partnership ensures communities are prepared for severe weather outbreaks by monitoring NWS outlooks and activating preparedness capabilities.\u5171 The partnership between the NWS, private forecasters, news media, and emergency managers is crucial for ensuring accurate warning information is communicated to the public during severe weather events. Congress may consider options to reduce costs from severe thunderstorms and tornado impacts, such as improving detection systems, building resilient infrastructure, and supporting research on severe weather patterns. The influence of climate change on the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms and tornadoes is still uncertain. The influence of human-induced climate change on severe thunderstorms and tornadoes is uncertain. Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas-induced global warming may help reduce damage and injuries. Improving scientific understanding and forecasting systems can provide better information to prevent severe weather impacts. The federal government plays a substantial role in weather and climate research, forecasting, and issuing warnings. The NWS budget is the largest component of NOAA's annual budget, with other federal agencies also contributing to weather and climate research. Observers and stakeholders advocate for increased funding to improve understanding of extreme weather events and their relationship to climate change. However, even with increased funding, significant decreases in damages, injuries, or deaths from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes may not be guaranteed. Despite improvements in forecasting and warning systems, the potential for considerable loss of life and property due to tornadoes still exists, especially in highly vulnerable regions. The increasing population and migration patterns suggest that overall vulnerability and risk may amplify in the future. Implementing hazard mitigation strategies, such as developing and enforcing land-use planning and zoning laws, may help address these challenges. Federal agencies play a role in disseminating the results of federally sponsored R&D. The appendix discusses the threats of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in certain areas of the country, the role of the National Weather Service in forecasting and issuing warnings, and the impact of these weather events on U.S. citizens and communities. Severe thunderstorms, unlike annual floods, can cause widespread destruction similar to major hurricanes. These storms are smaller and shorter-lived than tropical storms but can still be dangerous, with an average diameter of 15 miles and lasting 30 minutes. Approximately 100,000 thunderstorms occur worldwide each year, with 10% being severe. Severe thunderstorms can produce lightning, high winds, hail, flash floods, and tornadoes, posing risks to people and property. Strong winds can cause damage comparable to tornadoes, while downbursts can lead to wind shear and aircraft accidents. Tornadoes are the most destructive, destroying structures and causing fatalities. Lightning is considered the most dangerous aspect of severe thunderstorms. Lightning is a dangerous weather hazard causing fatalities and wildfires, with an average of 62 deaths per year in the US. It also leads to significant damage, estimated at $4 billion-$5 billion annually. Severe straight-line winds during thunderstorms are more common than tornado damage, reaching speeds up to 100 mph and causing extensive destruction. Damaging winds exceeding 50-60 mph can cause significant damage with little warning. Microbursts, a type of damaging wind, can be hazardous to aviation and lead to wind shear, affecting aircraft near the ground. Hail storms are more common in Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming, posing a threat to crops even with relatively small hailstones. Hail greater than three-quarters of an inch in diameter is considered severe and potentially damaging to aircraft, vehicles, roofs, and landscaping. Hail damage approaches $1 billion in the United States annually and can cause injury or fatalities to humans. Flash floods, resulting from short-lived thunderstorms, can cause significant damage and fatalities within minutes or hours of excessive rainfall. Flash floods, caused by severe thunderstorms, can occur suddenly and with little warning, leading to the most dangerous types of floods. They are responsible for most flood-related deaths in the United States. Assessing the actual damage costs of flash floods each year is challenging, as estimates can vary widely. Thunderstorms are most frequent in the Southeast and Great Plains, with the most severe weather threat extending from Texas to southern Minnesota. They are most likely to occur in the spring and summer, mainly in the afternoon and evening. Thunderstorms form in various geographical regions due to different atmospheric conditions. In the Great Plains, they occur most frequently in the afternoon and at night, while in the Gulf Coast and western states, they occur mainly in the afternoon. Severe weather potential is highest in areas with warm, humid air at low levels and dry, unstable air aloft. Thunderstorms in the southern Great Plains result from the meeting of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico with a dry westerly current aloft. In Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, orographic lifting caused by the Rocky Mountains leads to thunderstorm formation. Conversely, the west coast of the United States experiences fewer thunderstorms due to the influence of cooler maritime air masses suppressing convectional uplift over land. Thunderstorms form when moist, unstable air is lifted by unequal warming of the Earth's surface, orographic lifting, or weather fronts. Severe weather can result from squall lines, multicell storms, and supercell storms. Squall lines have a well-developed gust front and can produce downburst winds, large hail, and flash flooding. A squall line can slow down or become stationary, with thunderstorms forming parallel to the line. Multicell storms consist of cells moving as a single unit, with new cells forming along the upwind edge and dissipating cells along the downwind edge. They are stronger than single cell storms but less severe than supercell storms, with each cell lasting about 20 minutes. Most flash floods occur during multicell storm events. A supercell storm is a dangerous and rare type of thunderstorm that produces strong winds, damaging hail, and can last for hours. These storms have a rotating updraft and can produce large and violent tornadoes with winds exceeding 300 mph. Tornadoes, the most violent storms on Earth, can produce winds exceeding 300 mph and are the second leading cause of convective storm-related fatalities. Damages from violent tornadoes are increasing, with single tornado events causing losses of $1 billion or more. Tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and related weather events have accounted for nearly 57% of all insured catastrophe losses in the United States since 1953. Fatalities from tornadoes have decreased since the 1930s due to improved forecasting and warning systems. Since the 1930s, fatalities from tornadoes have decreased due to improved forecasting and warning systems. However, researchers suggest the decline may have stopped, attributing it to increasing vulnerability from demographic factors. This highlights the importance of social, behavioral, and demographic factors in tornado-related fatalities. Stakeholders emphasize the need for increased investment in observations, computing power, research, and weather modeling to enhance the nation's resilience to severe weather. Only 2.1% of all tornadoes cause fatalities, with studies suggesting an increase in deaths from less violent tornadoes since the 1970s. Tornadoes are most common in North America, particularly in the United States, forming in regions like Tornado Alley and Dixie Alley. Tornadoes occur in specific regions like Tornado Alley and Dixie Alley in the United States, with approximately 1,200 tornadoes annually. They form from severe thunderstorms in warm, moist air and can occur at any time of the year. Tornadoes are narrow, violently rotating columns of air that can be extremely dangerous. Supercell thunderstorms are the most common and dangerous type of thunderstorm, with a rotating updraft essential for tornado development. Wind shear causes the updraft to rotate horizontally, which then tilts vertically within the storm, leading to tornado formation. Approximately 20% of supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes, but predicting which ones will is currently not possible. Approximately 20% of supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes, which can be non-supercell tornadoes caused by wind shear from different weather fronts. Tornado formation can occur when an updraft stretches a spinning parcel of air. This type of tornado commonly occurs in eastern Colorado due to the collision of cool air from the Rocky Mountains and hot dry air from the Great Plains. Land-falling tropical storms and hurricanes can also generate non-supercell tornadoes. The Fujita or F-scale is used to classify tornado intensity based on the degree of damage and wind intensity. The original F-scale for classifying tornado intensity was replaced by the more precise EF-scale, which uses 28 damage indicators to estimate wind speed. However, actual tornado wind speeds remain largely unknown. The EF-scale is currently used by meteorologists and wind engineers for assessing tornado damage."
