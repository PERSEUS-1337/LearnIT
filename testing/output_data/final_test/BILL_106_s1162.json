The Act, known as the \"Strengthening Families in the Military Service Act of 1999,\" aims to ensure that pregnant women, infants, and children of military families stationed outside the United States receive proper nutrition and supplemental foods to reduce birth abnormalities and promote health and growth benefits. SEC. 3. SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFITS FOR WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN OF MILITARY FAMILIES STATIONED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. Section 1060a of title 10, United States Code, is amended to establish a program providing supplemental foods and nutrition education to low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to 5 years of age of military families stationed outside the United States, as well as eligible civilians serving with the armed forces outside the United States. The program provides supplemental foods and nutrition education to low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to 5 years of age of military families stationed outside the United States. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, operates the program similar to the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children. Regulations will be promulgated to carry out the program, taking into account the need to use military personnel for program functions. The program provides supplemental foods and nutrition education to low-income military families stationed outside the US. Functions include eligibility determinations, oversight, auditing, financial management, and reporting. Participation is limited to certain military installations for efficient operations. Other factors considered include the availability of supplemental foods in foreign countries and the need to phase-in program operations in fiscal year 2000. During fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of Defense is responsible for managing and operating the program established for providing supplemental foods and nutrition education to low-income military families stationed outside the US. The Inspectors General of the Armed Forces and the Department of Defense will investigate and monitor the program's implementation. The Secretary of Defense will maintain necessary records to ensure compliance and evaluate benefits provided under the program. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, must submit a report by March 1, 2001, detailing the implementation of the program providing supplemental foods and nutrition education to low-income military families stationed outside the US. The report will include participation rates, food packages, health assessments, eligibility determinations, and management challenges. Funding for the program established under this section includes $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. The Secretary of Defense will receive and accept these funds without further appropriation."
