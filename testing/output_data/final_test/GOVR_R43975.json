    "content": "Prior to 1996, federal immigration statutes did not authorize the construction of barriers along U.S. international borders. In the early 1990s, barriers were constructed near San Diego with the assistance of the Department of Defense. In 1996, Congress passed IIRIRA, instructing immigration authorities to build barriers along international land borders to deter unauthorized migration. The IIRIRA Section 102 authorizes DHS to construct barriers and roads along international borders to deter illegal crossings, including reinforced fencing covering at least 700 miles along the southwest border. It also requires additional physical barriers and infrastructure to gain operational control of the border, with a specified amount of fencing in priority areas to be completed by December 31, 2008. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements. The IIRIRA Section 102 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive legal requirements for constructing barriers and roads along international borders to deter illegal crossings. The Secretary has discretion in determining the amount and locations of additional barriers to deploy. The IIRIRA Section 102 grants the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to construct barriers and roads along international borders to deter illegal crossings. Immigration authorities have deployed hundreds of miles of additional barriers and roads since 1996 to satisfy this mandate. The provision confers general authority to the Secretary to construct barriers and roads in areas of \"high illegal entry.\" Specific requirements are imposed by IIRIRA Section 102(b) for the deployment of fencing and barriers along specified mileage of the southwest border. The IIRIRA Section 102 authorizes the construction of roads and barriers along international borders to deter unauthorized crossings in areas of high illegal entry. The provision does not specify the form of barriers, leading to ambiguity regarding the authorized distance from the border for construction. The IIRIRA Section 102 authorizes the construction of roads and barriers along international borders to deter unauthorized crossings in areas of high illegal entry. The term \"vicinity\" in IIRIRA Section 102 has been interpreted to include land \"situated near the border,\" with some DHS regulations describing distances up to 25 miles from a location as within its \"vicinity.\" The Supreme Court has also mentioned a search occurring 25 miles from the border as within the \"general vicinity of the border,\" but there is no legal significance ascribed to this phrase. Congress did not specify a specific distance when referring to the \"vicinity of the United States border\" in the legislative history of IIRIRA. The IIRIRA Section 102 authorizes the construction of roads and barriers along international borders to deter unauthorized crossings in areas of high illegal entry. It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct reinforced fencing along the southwest border, with changes in requirements over the years. Additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors are authorized to gain operational control of the border. Delays in fulfilling the fencing project were caused by environmental concerns and litigation. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 revised IIRIRA Section 102(b) to require the deployment of at least 2 layers of reinforced fencing and additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors along the southwest border. This amendment facilitated DHS's efforts to complete a second layer of fencing along the San Diego border, removing the statutory requirement for the original San Diego fencing project authorized in 1996. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandated the deployment of reinforced fencing, barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors along specified stretches of the southwest border, covering roughly 850 miles. Deadlines were set for the completion of certain border projects, including the installation of surveillance camera systems and fencing in priority areas. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandated the deployment of reinforced fencing, barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors along specified stretches of the southwest border by December 31, 2008. The most recent revisions to IIRIRA Section 102 increased the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion on where to construct fencing, eliminating the requirement of double-layered fencing in certain areas. The 2008 Appropriations Act replaced the Secure Fence Act's specific requirements with a more general mandate for deploying fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border. It also allowed for additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to be used for gaining operational control of the border. The 2008 Appropriations Act replaced specific requirements of the Secure Fence Act with a mandate for deploying fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border, allowing for additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors. IIRIRA Section 102(b) was amended to give the Secretary discretion in deploying border security infrastructure based on operational control needs, with a new deadline for constructing fencing in priority areas by December 31, 2008. The 2008 Appropriations Act replaced specific requirements of the Secure Fence Act with a mandate for deploying fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border. Section 102(b) of IIRIRA now requires consultation with various entities to minimize impact on the environment and quality of life near construction areas. This consultation requirement does not affect legal rights. The revisions to Section 102(b) and conflicting statements by DHS officials have led to disagreements on DHS's obligations. The legislative history of the 2008 Appropriations Act's amendment to IIRIRA Section 102(b) is complex, with unclear explanations for the changes. The modifications appear to stem from a Senate floor amendment during consideration of the FY2008 homeland security appropriations bill. The FY2008 homeland security appropriations bill included a floor amendment by Senator Lindsey Graham to add the \"Border Security First Act of 2007\" division. The amendment aimed to enhance border security by deploying 300 miles of vehicle barriers and 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border within two years, as well as making changes to immigration enforcement programs and laws. Senator Graham and co-sponsors supported the amendment, with a focus on the fencing provisions. Senator Graham and Senator Jeff Sessions characterized the amendment as providing for 700 miles of border fencing. Senator John Cornyn highlighted the proposed change to IIRIRA Section 102(b) to ensure consultation with local officials and property owners. The amendment was ruled out of order for being non-germane to the appropriations bill. Senator Graham later offered a more limited amendment that did not include modifications to federal immigration and criminal statutes. The new amendment to the homeland security appropriations bill required DHS to deploy 300 miles of vehicle barriers and 700 linear miles of fencing along the southwest border within two years. It was adopted by a vote of 89-1. Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment to revise IIRIRA Section 102(b), which was approved by a voice vote. Both amendments were included in the Senate-passed version of the bill. Later in the year, 11 regular appropriations measures for FY2008 were discussed. The 2008 Appropriations Act combined 11 regular appropriations measures for FY2008, including homeland security, into an omnibus bill. It reconciled differences between House and Senate versions, amending IIRIRA Section 102(b) with significant discretion for DHS in installing fencing. The final act did not include provisions from the Senate bill imposing deadlines for fencing completion and providing appropriations for them. The 2008 Appropriations Act gave DHS significant discretion in installing fencing along the southwest border, replacing specific requirements with a general mandate for reinforced fencing. This allows DHS to decide on the number of layers needed, with the option to add more layers if deemed necessary. Disagreements have arisen over the use of \"vehicle fencing\" to meet the requirements of IIRIRA. Disagreements have arisen over DHS's use of \"vehicle fencing\" to meet IIRIRA's requirements. While some argue for fencing effective against all illegal entrants, the statute only mandates \"reinforced\" fencing without specifying type or height. This grants DHS broad discretion in choosing appropriate fencing. The DHS has discretion to choose the type of fencing for the southwest border to achieve operational control. President Trump's executive order calls for a \"physical wall,\" which includes secure and impassable barriers. While IIRIRA Section 102(b) mentions deploying fencing along at least 700 miles of the border, it does not specify the type of fencing required. The DHS has discretion to choose the type of fencing for the southwest border to achieve operational control. IIRIRA Section 102(b) prioritizes the actual mileage of the border covered by fencing, rather than just the number of miles of fencing deployed. DHS seems to only count the mileage of primary layers of fencing deployed along the southwest border when discussing its efforts to satisfy its statutory mandate. The 2008 Appropriations Act amended IIRIRA 102(b) to include two mandates regarding fencing along the southwest border. The priority fencing mandate required DHS to identify and complete construction of fencing in priority areas by December 31, 2008. The general fencing mandate requires reinforced fencing along \"not less than 700 miles\" of the border, with no deadline for deployment. DHS has discretion on where to install fencing based on operational control needs. The 2008 Appropriations Act amended IIRIRA 102(b) to include two mandates regarding fencing along the southwest border. DHS was required to identify 370 miles for priority fencing by December 31, 2008, and deploy reinforced fencing along this stretch. Despite initially planning for 670 miles, DHS revised the plans to meet the deadline. A 2010 GAO report confirmed that 370 miles of reinforced fencing had been deployed. The general fencing mandate of deploying reinforced fencing along \"not less than 700 miles\" has not been fulfilled yet. The DHS has deployed reinforced fencing along 653 miles of the border, but still needs to install additional fencing along nearly 50 miles to meet the requirements of Section 102(b) of the 2008 Appropriations Act. There are conflicting views among policymakers regarding the firmness of the 700-mile fencing mandate. The Trump Administration's plans to deploy a physical barrier along more of the border could render any dispute over the requirement moot. The rigidity of the mandate turns on the relationship between clauses in IIRIRA Section 102. The 2008 Appropriations Act requires fencing along 700 miles of the border, but allows the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in deploying resources if deemed necessary for operational control. This provision's interpretation is subject to debate. The 2008 Appropriations Act allows DHS discretion in deploying fencing along the southwest border, emphasizing agency discretion in determining the most appropriate stretches for fencing deployment. The \"notwithstanding\" proviso provides a potential response to claims of ineffective fencing placement. The \"notwithstanding\" proviso in the 2008 Appropriations Act gives DHS the discretion to determine where to place fencing along the southwest border, allowing the agency to easily defend its decisions in court. This clause could be interpreted broadly to override conflicting requirements and grants DHS the authority to choose the most practical and effective locations for fencing construction. The \"notwithstanding\" proviso in the 2008 Appropriations Act grants DHS discretion in determining where to place fencing along the southwest border, allowing flexibility in choosing practical and effective locations for construction. The proviso does not explicitly state that DHS can opt for less fencing than specified, but rather allows for decisions based on operational control needs at specific locations. The 2008 Appropriations Act grants DHS discretion in determining where to place fencing along the southwest border, allowing flexibility in choosing practical and effective locations for construction. The proviso does not explicitly state that DHS can opt for less fencing than specified, but rather allows for decisions based on operational control needs at specific locations. The interpretation of the proviso could impact the deployment of fencing along the border. The legislative history and amendments to IIRIRA Section 102(b) suggest that while DHS has the mandate to construct fencing along 700 miles of the border, they are not legally bound to install it at specific locations. The amendments were intended to ensure expeditious construction of the fencing within two years. The legislative history and amendments to IIRIRA Section 102(b) indicate that DHS is mandated to deploy fencing along 700 miles of the border within two years. While Congress enacted one amendment into law, the interpretation remains uniform in requiring DHS to deploy the fencing, with discretion on the locations. No court has definitively ruled on alternative interpretations or examined the interplay between provisions. The legislative history and amendments to IIRIRA Section 102(b) indicate a mandate for DHS to deploy fencing along 700 miles of the border within two years. DHS has shown conflicting views on the firmness of this requirement, with initial interpretations considering it a firm mandate. Secretary Napolitano stated that DHS is mandated to construct 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border, with a focus on priority areas. As of March 6, 2009, approximately 611 miles have been completed. Fencing is important for border security but is just one element of the overall strategy. There are currently no funded plans for further construction. DHS initially mandated to construct 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border, with 611 miles completed by 2009. No immediate plans for additional fencing construction. DHS later interpreted the mandate to allow for less than 700 miles if deemed appropriate for operational control. Secretary Napolitano's testimony suggested legal flexibility in the amount of fencing to be built. DHS has not publicly released its formal legal opinion on the fencing mandate. In 2011, the Department of Justice defended DHS against Arizona's legal challenge to complete 700 miles of border fencing. The DOJ argued that DHS had discretion in deciding where and how quickly to deploy the fencing. Courts typically defer to agency interpretations of laws if they are reasonable and based on legislative intent. The level of deference given to agency interpretations of statutory requirements depends on factors like thoroughness, reasoning validity, and consistency with previous pronouncements. The degree of deference to DHS's interpretation of IIRIRA requirements may vary, especially if challenged legally. The level of deference to agency interpretations of statutory requirements, under IIRIRA Section 102(b), may vary based on factors like ambiguity in the statute's text, legislative intent, and agency's modification of interpretation. The statute does not specify a deadline for deploying required fencing. In a 2011 litigation, Arizona's motion to compel DHS to complete fencing was dismissed partly due to the lack of a mandated completion deadline. The district court dismissed Arizona's motion regarding the completion of fencing and infrastructure developments, citing the discretion afforded to DHS by IIRIRA. While there is no specific deadline for the fencing requirements, the APA allows courts to compel agency action if unreasonably delayed. The court may have the power to compel DHS to complete at least 700 miles of border fence under IIRIRA Section 102(b), but it is unclear who would have standing to make such a claim. Demonstrating standing requires showing specific criteria. The court may have the power to compel DHS to complete at least 700 miles of border fence under IIRIRA Section 102(b), but it is unclear who would have standing to make such a claim. Standing requires demonstrating a concrete injury, a causal connection to the defendant's conduct, and likelihood of redress by a favorable court decision. The Secretary of Homeland Security has broad authority to waive legal requirements for barrier construction along the border, with changes made by the REAL ID Act of 2005. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements for border barrier construction, which was significantly changed by the REAL ID Act of 2005. This waiver authority has been used in the past to build fencing and infrastructure along the southwest border, but has not been utilized for large-scale projects recently. President Trump's executive order did not directly call for the use of this waiver authority, but it could be employed in the future for the construction of a border wall. In 2004, fencing along the San Diego border was delayed due to litigation and environmental concerns, despite the waiver authority granted by the REAL ID Act of 2005 for expeditious construction. The California Coastal Commission halted the project, citing inconsistencies with state policies. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended IIRIRA Section 102(c) to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive legal requirements for the construction of security barriers. This waiver authority has raised concerns due to its broad scope and limited judicial review. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended IIRIRA Section 102(c) to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive legal requirements for the construction of security barriers. The waiver authority is broad, targeting federal and state statutes, regulations, and requirements that could impede barrier construction. However, the Secretary can only waive legal requirements that hinder barrier construction under Section 102. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements for the construction of barriers and roads under Section 102. The decision to waive a legal requirement is at the discretion of the Secretary, who must provide notice in the Federal Register when invoking the waiver authority. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements for the construction of barriers and roads under Section 102, as stated in a Federal Register notice. This waiver applies to various federal statutes listed in Appendices B and C for the San Diego border fence, Barry M. Goldwater Range in Southwestern Arizona, and San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area in Southeastern Arizona. On October 5, 2007, Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club sued to halt DHS border fence construction in the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area in Arizona. A TRO was issued on October 10, 2007, due to a lack of environmental assessment. Despite this, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived legal requirements to resume construction. On April 3, 2008, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued waivers to bypass legal requirements for border construction projects in Hidalgo County, Texas, and various states, enabling DHS to resume fence construction. The Secretary of Homeland Security issued waivers to bypass legal requirements for border construction projects in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Lawsuits challenged the constitutionality of the waivers, arguing that they violated Congress's lawmaking authority and the Presentment Clause. However, federal district courts upheld the waivers as constitutionally valid. The federal district court upheld the exercise of waiver authority as constitutionally valid for border construction projects. Congress has granted DHS authority to construct barriers and roads along international land borders to deter illegal crossings. Legislative focus has been on fencing requirements in recent years, with DHS having greater discretion in determining location, layers, and types of fencing to be installed along the southwest border. The disagreement over whether DHS has discretion to construct less fencing than specified under IIRIRA Section 102(b) has led to inconsistent views. While there is support for a firm mandate for 700 miles of fencing, the agency retains discretion on where to install it. It is unclear if a court can compel DHS to install more fencing, and if Congress can challenge DHS's implementation of the mandate. Congress may need to enact legislation to modify or clarify the fencing requirements under Section 102(b) of the current statute. Even if DHS meets the mandated fencing requirements, it has the authority to construct additional barriers along the U.S. land borders. DHS can deploy extra physical barriers to achieve operational control of the southwest border, potentially installing hundreds of miles of fencing or barriers as needed to deter illegal crossings in high-entry areas. DHS has the authority to construct additional barriers and roads to deter illegal crossings in high-entry areas, even beyond the requirements of IIRIRA Section 102(b). Policymakers may need to review the scope of DHS's authority and how it is exercised. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to construct reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border to deter illegal crossings, along with additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors for operational control. Priority areas will be identified for this construction. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to construct reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border to deter illegal crossings, along with additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors for operational control. Priority areas will be identified for this construction. The Secretary must consult with various entities to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, commerce, and quality of life for communities near the construction sites. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to construct reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border to deter illegal crossings, along with additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors for operational control. Priority areas will be identified for this construction. The Secretary is not required to install resources in a specific location if deemed unnecessary for border control. The Attorney General will promptly acquire necessary easements as needed. The Attorney General will acquire necessary easements and commence construction of fences promptly. Safety features will be incorporated into the design to ensure the well-being of border patrol agents. Authorization of appropriations is provided, with funds remaining available until expended. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements to expedite construction of barriers and roads. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any claims related to the Secretary's decisions, with a 60-day time limit for filing complaints. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive legal requirements for barrier and road construction. Claims related to these decisions must be filed within 60 days and can only be reviewed by the Supreme Court upon petition for a writ of certiorari. DHS waived legal requirements for barrier and road construction in various project areas in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas."
