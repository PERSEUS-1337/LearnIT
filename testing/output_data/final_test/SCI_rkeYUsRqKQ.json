    "content": "In this paper, the phredGAN system extends the persona-based Seq2Seq neural network conversation model to multi-turn dialogues by modifying the hredGAN architecture. It includes a persona-based HRED generator (PHRED) and a conditional discriminator to capture utterance attributes like speaker identity and sentiments. Two approaches are explored for the conditional discriminator: $phredGAN_a$ passes attribute representation to an adversarial discriminator, while $phredGAN_d$ uses a dual discriminator to predict attributes. Experimental results show phredGAN outperforms the persona SeqSeq model on the UDC and TV series datasets. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly with deep neural networks, have significantly advanced natural language processing and dialogue modeling research. However, creating a conversation model that can fluently interact with humans is still in its early stages. Existing work often relies on limited dialogue history to generate responses, assuming that model parameters will capture the necessary information. The study compares the performance of $phredGAN$ on datasets with varying attribute modalities, such as the Big Bang Theory and Friends transcripts and customer-agent interactions in the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus. Recent advances in dialogue modeling research have focused on optimizing dialogue consistency. For example, the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (HRED) network architecture aims to capture long-term context within a dialogue. However, the HRED system lacks diversity and does not guarantee output quality. To address these issues, a modified HRED generator trained alongside an adversarial discriminator increases diversity and improves output quality. The HRED system lacks diversity and output quality, leading to the development of the hredGAN system with an adversarial discriminator. However, hredGAN fails to capture speaker attributes and generate persona-specific responses. Recent work introduces persona models like BID5, integrating attribute embeddings into generative dialogue models. BID7 enhances the PHRED generator with local attention attributes for conditioned responses. The BID16 model introduces a different approach to representing speaker attributes by using a set of sentences describing the speaker profile. Unlike other persona-based models, the attributes representation is not learned but the system learns how to attend to different parts of the attributes during training. However, existing persona-based models have limitations such as short and generic responses, exposure bias, and inability to generate multiple responses in a dialogue context. The proposed phredGAN systems aim to improve response quality and capture speaker attributes in conversations by using the same generator architecture with additional utterance attribute representation. This allows the model to generate more diverse and personalized responses. Injecting attributes into a multi-turn dialogue system allows the model to generate responses conditioned on specific attributes across conversation turns. The discriminator architecture differs between the two systems based on how the attribute is treated. Training and sampling both variants of phredGAN are similar to hredGAN BID8. The model is trained on customer service data like the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and transcripts from TV series for analysis of response quality. The system demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art persona conversational models. The phredGAN model shows superiority over state-of-the-art persona conversational models in dialogue response quality. It introduces two persona versions by combining with dialogue speaker and utterance attributes. The model includes a dual discriminator for word-level coherence judgment and utterance-level attribute prediction. The problem formulation involves generating responses based on a dialogue history sequence. The framework uses a conditional GAN structure to generate responses based on a dialogue history sequence. The generator is trained to produce sequences that are indistinguishable from the ground truth, minimizing cross-entropy loss. The proposed architecture of phredGAN, derived from hredGAN, utilizes a conditional GAN structure to generate responses based on dialogue history. The generator and discriminator share the same encoder and embedding representation of word tokens, with an additional input representing speaker and/or utterance attributes. The context RNN takes the source attribute as an input, and both versions of phredGAN share the same generator architecture (PHRED) but different discriminators. The context RNN in phredGAN takes the source attribute as an additional input, using attention over attribute representations. The generator decoder RNN takes the target attribute as an additional input, forcing a connection between generated responses and utterance attributes. Noise injection methods are explored, and the optimization objective is defined for phredGAN. phredGAN explores noise injection methods in its optimization objective, incorporating traditional adversarial and attribute prediction losses. The addition of speaker or utterance attributes enhances the dialogue model's ability to exhibit personality traits. phredGAN incorporates an attribute discriminator, Datt, in addition to the existing adversarial discriminator Dadv, to capture attribute modalities at the utterance level. The attribute discriminator uses a unidirectional RNN to map input utterances to specific attributes, shaping the generator outputs. The attribute discriminator's losses are expressed as part of the model training process. The generator and discriminator of phredGAN are trained using a shared encoder with specific parameters. The encoder RNN is bidirectional, while the decoder RNN is unidirectional. Both RNN units are 3-layer GRU cells with a hidden state size of 512. The word vocabulary size is 50,000 with a word embedding size of 512. The attribute embedding size is also 512, and only one attribute per utterance is used in this study. The generator and discriminator of phredGAN use attention to combine attribute embeddings. The generator decoder RNN is a 3-layer GRU cell with a hidden state size of 512. The adversarial discriminator includes a word-level discriminator RNN and an attribute discriminator RNN, both with hidden state sizes of 512. The attribute discriminator RNN is a unidirectional RNN with a 3-layer GRU cell. The final hidden state is projected to a specified number of attributes, Vc, to output a probability distribution. Parameters are initialized with Xavier uniform random initialization. Sampled softmax loss is used for training, while full softmax is used for evaluation. Parameter updates are based on word-level discriminator accuracy. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent in TensorFlow. A linear search is performed for modified noise samples. During inference, the dialogue response generation is conditioned on various inputs including encoder outputs, noise samples, word embedding, and attribute embedding of the intended responder. The generator outputs are ranked by the discriminator, and the final response is selected based on the discriminator's ranking. The performance of PHRED, phredGAN a, and phredGAN d is evaluated on conversational datasets and compared to non-adversarial persona Seq2seq models and adversarial hredGAN. Seq2seq models BID5 and adversarial hredGAN BID8 are trained on TV Series Transcripts dataset BID10, specifically on dialogue from Big Bang Theory and Friends. The corpus is split into training, development, and test sets, with speaker IDs mapped to utterances. To avoid overfitting on the small TV series dataset, models are pre-trained on the larger Movie Triplets Corpus (MTC) before fine-tuning. After pre-training on MTC, attribute embeddings in the generator are reinitialized for training on a combined person TV series dataset. The model is trained on 1.85 million conversations from the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, with two types of speaker IDs assigned to utterances: questioner and helper. The dataset includes utterances that do not fit into these speaker types. The dataset used for training the model includes utterances from questioner and helper speaker types, with some utterances not fitting into these categories. Despite the simplifying assumption of only two speaker types, the models phredGAN a and phredGAN d are still able to differentiate between them. Evaluation metrics such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, distinct n-gram, and normalized average sequence length scores are used, along with human evaluation by crowd-sourced judges ranking response quality. The study compares non-adversarial persona HRED model, PHRED, with adversarially trained models hredGAN, phredGAN a, and phredGAN d to show the impact of adversarial training. Additionally, it compares these models to Li et al.'s work BID5, which incorporates persona embeddings in a Seq2Seq framework. Li et al.'s work explores two persona models: Speaker model (SM) and Speaker-Addressee model (SAM). The study evaluates the performance of phredGAN models, determining optimal noise injection methods and variance values for best results on different datasets. Optimal noise variance values are found to be 4 and 6 for phredGAN d on UDC and TV transcripts, and 2 and 5 for phredGAN a on TV series dataset and UDC respectively. The study evaluates the performance of phredGAN models on TV series transcripts, comparing it against baselines like PHRED, hredGAN, and Li et al.'s persona Seq2Seq models. PhredGAN shows significant improvement over baselines, with persona information playing a crucial role in enhancing performance. PHRED performs worse due to limited dataset impact on persona, resulting in less informative responses. The study compares the performance of phredGAN models with other baselines on TV series transcripts. PhredGAN outperforms PHRED and hredGAN models, showing improvement in response diversity even with persona conditioning. Adversarial training helps in producing longer, more informative, and diverse responses with high persona relevance. The evaluation results are summarized in table 2, highlighting the effectiveness of phredGAN in generating diverse responses. The study shows that phredGAN outperforms hredGAN and S(A)M models in response quality and diversity, especially with persona conditioning. PhredGAN variants exhibit improvements in various evaluation metrics, with phredGAN d performing the best. The model strikes a balance between diversity and precision while capturing speaker attributes effectively in the UDC dataset. PhredGAN d is recommended for datasets with strong attribute distinction, while phredGAN a is suitable for datasets with weak attribute distinction. Human evaluation scores align with automatic evaluations, with phredGAN a performing best on TV Series. On the UDC dataset, both hredGAN and phredGAN d perform similarly, indicating a trade-off between diversity and persona. The study compares phredGAN responses to those of the Speaker-Addressee model in TV drama series datasets. PhredGAN responses are found to be more informative and diverse, exploring novel situations that the Speaker-Addressee model cannot achieve due to lack of informative responses. The study compares phredGAN responses to the Speaker-Addressee model in TV drama series datasets, showing that phredGAN's responses are more diverse and informative. The model can construct distinct attribute embeddings for each character and infer important character information about the addressee. This ability is demonstrated in both the TV drama series datasets and the UDC dataset. In this paper, two persona conversational models, phredGAN a and phredGAN d, are explored to improve response generation. These models show quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art systems and perform differently on datasets with weak and strong modality. One future direction is to utilize phredGAN d's ability to predict utterance attributes. The paper explores persona conversational models phredGAN a and phredGAN d to enhance response generation. It aims to leverage phredGAN d's capability to predict utterance attributes, potentially improving performance with weak modality through conditioning adversarial updates. The study demonstrates the benefits of adversarial training in persona generative dialogue systems, paving the way for further advancements in this field. After training phredGAN models on TV series and UDC datasets, inference was conducted on dialogue contexts. Responses and discriminator scores from phredGAN were analyzed, showing its ability to handle multi-turn dialogue, generate persona-conditioned responses, and predict attributes like speaker identity. The discriminator scores were generally reasonable. The discriminator scores of phredGAN are generally reasonable, with longer, more informative responses receiving higher scores. The model can generate persona-based responses without supervision, retaining contextual consistency in conversations. For example, in the TV series dataset, phredGAN references background information and different speakers accurately. In the UDC dataset, distinct communication styles are observed between askers and helpers. In TAB7, phredGAN suggested the asker might not be using the right driver when they couldn't hear music. Samples from PHRED generator on UDC and TV series dataset are also shown in TAB5."
