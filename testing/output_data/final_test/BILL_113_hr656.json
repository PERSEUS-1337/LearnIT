    "content": "The \"Restore our Neighborhoods Act of 2013\" is also known as the Act. It introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding Qualified Urban Demolition Bonds. The \"Qualified Urban Demolition Bond\" is defined as a bond issued for qualified projects by a qualified issuer, with 100% of proceeds used for post-enactment expenditures, in registered form, not exceeding 30 years in term, and issued within a 5-year period. Beginning on the enactment date, the maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by a State under subsection (a) shall not exceed the national qualified urban demolition bond limitation amount of $4,000,000,000 allocated among States by the Secretary. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by a State under subsection (a) shall not exceed $4,000,000,000 allocated among States by the Secretary. $2,000,000,000 is to be allocated among qualified States in accordance with a formula, and another $2,000,000,000 is to be equally allocated among all States. The limitation amount allocated to a State under paragraph (3) shall be allocated by the State to qualified issuers within such State based on the 2010 decennial census data. Unused issuance limitation may be reallocated after a 2-year period if the national qualified urban demolition bond limitation amount exceeds. The curr_chunk discusses the reallocation of excess demolition bond limitation amounts among qualified States to ensure issuance of qualified urban demolition bonds within a 5-year period. A \"qualified project\" is defined as demolition costs for approved projects, excluding operation or maintenance costs. The applicable credit rate is determined differently than under section 54A(b)(3). The applicable credit rate for an issue is based on the average market yield on outstanding long-term corporate debt obligations. An issue must spend at least 100 percent of project proceeds on qualified projects within a 5-year period to meet requirements. The qualified issuer must spend at least 10 percent of the proceeds on projects within a 12-month period. If less than 100 percent of the project proceeds are spent within 5 years, nonqualified bonds must be redeemed within 90 days. The qualified issuer must recapture credits and pay the United States if a bond ceases to be a qualified urban demolition bond. This includes the aggregate of credits allowable under section 54A and interest on the amount determined. The term 'qualified issuer' refers to a State-authorized land bank or the State itself in the absence of such banks. A State-authorized land bank is a government unit tasked with land reclamation and demolition projects under State law. The term 'qualified State' refers to a state with specific criteria related to the age of housing units and meeting certain requirements, such as legislation allowing for expedited tax foreclosure of vacant properties and the ability to enter joint ventures with other entities. The term 'qualified State' refers to a state that meets specific criteria related to vacancies, unemployment rate, foreclosure percentages, and mortgage rankings. The State ranks in the top 20 for the lowest population growth change between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Credits can be transferred without limitations through sale and repurchase agreements. Amendments include adding a qualified urban demolition bond to the Code. Amendments to the Code include adding a qualified urban demolition bond. Section 54G introduces qualified urban demolition bonds, with amendments applying to bonds issued after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the use of Hardest Hit Fund amounts for demolition activities is addressed in Section 3. The Hardest Hit Fund program under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act allows states to use allocated assistance to demolish blighted structures. If funds are not used within 24 months, 25 percent must be remitted to the Treasury. The Secretary must remit 25 percent of held and undisbursed funds to the Treasury and recapture any necessary amounts from the State or State agency."
