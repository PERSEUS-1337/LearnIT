    "content": "The \"Emergency Safeguard Act of 1996\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Congress finds that men's and boys' wool suits, sport coats, and slacks from Canada are causing serious damage to the domestic tailored wool apparel industry. NAFTA deprives US manufacturers of any remedy for surges of injurious imports from Canada. United States tailored wool apparel manufacturers and their workers are seeking safeguards from injurious import surges under NAFTA. The industry has seen a significant decline in production and employment since 1988, with several producers going out of business or declaring bankruptcy. Plants in states like Alabama, Delaware, and Florida are affected. Several plants in states such as Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia have closed or are laying off workers due to bankruptcy. Surging tailored wool apparel imports are assembled in Canada from fabric produced in Italy, Korea, Turkey, and other countries, exported at a preferential rate of duty under a program known as Tariff Preference Level (TPL) for nonoriginating goods. This tariff preference was established in the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) for Canadian exports of wool apparel items. The CFTA ensured that high-quality wool fabrics were available to apparel producers in Canada from Canadian and US producers. It also allowed for monitoring of wool apparel imports to adjust quality limitations based on producers' ability to obtain supplies. The agreement required renegotiation of the tariff preference before January 1, 1998. The NAFTA agreement deleted the CFTA's monitoring and renegotiation provisions, excluded tailored wool apparel from safeguard mechanisms, and led to Canada becoming the largest exporter of men's and boys' wool suits to the United States by 1995. Imports of men's and boys' wool suits from Canada have increased significantly since 1988, harming US wool producers. Congress did not intend for NAFTA to cause such harm to US tailored wool apparel manufacturers. Safeguard proposals are being considered. Safeguard proposals are being considered to rectify oversights in the increase of imports of men's and boys' wool suits from Canada since 1988, which have harmed US wool producers. SEC. 3. PHASED SAFEGUARDS MEASURES. Revision in Sub-Limits: Up to 50% of wool apparel assembled in Canada eligible for preferential duty treatment under NAFTA can be tailored wool apparel. Duty Snap-Back: Tailored wool apparel from Canada will be subject to the most-favored-nation duty rate. Effective Dates: - Effective Dates:\n- Subsection (a) applies to merchandise entered after August 31, 1996.\n- Subsection (c) applies to merchandise entered after February 28, 1997.\n- The President may delay or suspend subsection (b) if Canada meets certain conditions."
