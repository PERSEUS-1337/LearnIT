    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Video Choice Act of 2005\". Congress finds that cable rates are rising faster than inflation, wire-based competition in video services is limited, and where competition exists, cable rates are 15 percent lower. It is in the public interest to promote wire-based competition for greater consumer choice and lower prices. The United States aims to increase competition in the communications industry by reducing regulatory burdens on new entrants, leading to greater consumer choice and lower prices for video services. Despite falling behind in broadband deployment rates, the deployment of advanced high capacity networks is crucial for economic development in rural America and the long-term competitiveness of the country. The Communication Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section on competitive video services providers, defining them as providers with access to public rights-of-way. This aims to create a regulatory framework to increase competition and consumer choice in the video services industry. The Communication Act of 1934 is amended to allow competitive video services providers access to public rights-of-way without needing a franchise. Providers must pay fees based on gross revenues for services similar to cable. The amendment allows competitive video service providers to access public rights-of-way without a franchise. Providers must pay fees based on gross revenues for services similar to cable, with considerations on fee rates and revenue sources. The competitive video services provider must designate the portion of the subscriber's bill attributable to fees separately. They are also subject to retransmission consent provisions and must carry public, educational, or governmental channels within local franchise areas. The competitive video services provider must comply with various regulations including carrying noncommercial, educational channels, protecting subscriber information, and following consumer protection requirements set by the Commission. The competitive video services provider is not subject to certain provisions of the title and cannot deny services based on residents' income. Regulatory treatment limits the Commission and states from regulating various aspects of services provided. State and local governments retain authority over public rights-of-way and consumer protection laws. SEC. 4 amends the Federal Communications Act regarding regulation of common carriers, specifically competitive video services providers. These carriers are not subject to certain requirements of the title but instead are subject to part VI of the title. SEC. 5 addresses existing franchise agreements. SEC. 5 exempts existing franchise agreements between franchising authorities and competitive video service providers from the provisions of this Act for the duration of the agreement."
