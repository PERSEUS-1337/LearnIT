    "content": "The Act titled \"Crime Victim Assistance Improvement Act\" increases special assessments on convicted persons and extends the period of obligation for payments. It also addresses the timing of fines and restitution payments. The amendment to Section 3572(d) of title 18, United States Code clarifies that a person sentenced to pay a fine or penalty must do so in full before being released from custody, unless the court allows for delayed payment in the interest of justice. If delayed payment is permitted, an immediate installment on the criminal debt must be paid. The amendment to Section 3663 of title 18, United States Code requires defendants to make restitution payments to the court or an agent of the court, to be disbursed to the victim. Payments must be made in equal monthly installments or as specified by the court. The court may require a person to pay restitution in full before being released from custody, with the option to delay payment if unable to pay immediately. An installment on the debt must be paid immediately or as determined by the court. The court may order restitution to be paid in installments, with the option to delay payment if unable to pay immediately. This does not limit a victim's right to seek other legal remedies for injury caused by the defendant. Enforcement of a fine can be done through suspending federal benefits. The amendment adds a new subsection to Section 3572 of title 18, United States Code, allowing for the suspension of Federal benefits, defining terms like 'Federal benefit' and 'veterans' benefit'. The amendment allows for the suspension of Federal benefits for delinquent defendants, including veterans' benefits, until the delinquency is resolved or a good-faith effort is shown. The amendment allows for the suspension of Federal benefits for delinquent defendants, including veterans' benefits, until the delinquency is resolved or a good-faith effort is shown. The defendant can set a payment schedule based on what they can reasonably pay, and if they cure a delinquency, they will receive the withheld benefits without interest. The amendment will not be used to deny Federal benefits until authorized by the Attorney General. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, determines that a criminal debt payment tracking system has established communication links with Federal benefit programs to prevent unauthorized benefit denials. SEC. 5. CRIME VICTIMS FUND. Prohibition of Payments to Delinquent Criminal Debtors by State Crime Victim Compensation Programs: Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to prohibit compensation to individuals convicted of a federal offense if they are delinquent in paying fines or penalties. The paragraph (1) does not apply to deny victims compensation until a cost-effective criminal debt payment tracking system is established with communication links to ensure victims are not denied compensation. Additionally, Section 1403 of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 is amended to exclude income for means tests. Exclusion From Income for Means Tests: Crime victim compensation received shall not be counted towards income eligibility requirements for government assistance programs until fully compensating the victim for losses due to a crime."
