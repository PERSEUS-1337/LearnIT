    "content": "Disclosure provisions requiring commercial actors to convey specific information to consumers are a complex issue in First Amendment law. The right to speak and the right not to speak are protected under the Free Speech Clause, with courts generally disfavoring government actions that compel speech. While government-mandated speech is subject to strict scrutiny and must serve compelling state interests, laws requiring commercial actors to make disclosures to consumers have been accepted by the Supreme Court. Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's ability to compel certain disclosures from commercial actors, even if it involves protected speech. Commercial speech has historically received less protection under the First Amendment, allowing for more regulation. Courts have not applied strict scrutiny to commercial disclosure requirements, instead using less rigorous standards based on the nature of the requirement. The Supreme Court recently clarified its approach to analyzing such provisions. The Supreme Court has clarified its approach to analyzing commercial disclosure requirements, which may be subject to different levels of scrutiny depending on whether they target conduct or speech. Recent cases suggest that in certain circumstances, disclosure requirements may face heightened scrutiny. This report provides a background on how courts view commercial speech under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has clarified its approach to analyzing commercial disclosure requirements under the First Amendment. In 1976, the Court established that purely commercial speech is entitled to protection. Commercial speech is defined as proposing a commercial transaction or expressing economic interests. While protected, the Court also allows regulations on commercial speech. The Supreme Court allows government regulation of \"false\" or deceptive commercial speech to ensure truthfulness, as commercial speech is seen as less spontaneous and more calculated, driven by commercial interests. The Court believes regulating for truthfulness in commercial speech is unlikely to inhibit debate and may be necessary when the public lacks the ability to verify claims. The Supreme Court allows government regulation of commercial speech to ensure truthfulness and prevent deception. Commercial speech is considered to have \"lesser protection\" than other forms of expression, and the government may prohibit communication that is more likely to deceive than inform the public. The government can regulate commercial speech to prevent deception, but it must meet the Central Hudson test's intermediate scrutiny standard. This standard requires the government to prove its interest is substantial, the regulation directly advances that interest, and is not more extensive than necessary. Some argue that commercial speech should not receive less protection under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court may subject infringements on commercial speech to strict scrutiny, as it has increasingly struck down restrictions on commercial speech. Judges and scholars note a potential shift in the role of the content neutrality doctrine. Laws targeting speech based on content are subject to strict scrutiny, as stated in Reed v. Town of Gilbert. In the context of commercial speech, regulation of content is permissible, but certain regulations prohibiting commercial speech solely based on its commercial content have been struck down by the Supreme Court. Content neutrality may still be relevant in the commercial sphere, as seen in the 2011 decision in Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc. In the 2011 decision in Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a state law prohibiting pharmacies from disclosing certain pharmacy records for marketing purposes. The Court concluded that the law imposed a content-based burden on protected expression related to marketing, subjecting it to heightened judicial scrutiny. The Court did not definitively determine the level of scrutiny to apply but found the law unconstitutional even under the Central Hudson test. The Court found that commercial disclosure requirements are content-based and may face heightened scrutiny, as seen in the Sorrell case. Despite some lower courts striking down such requirements post-Sorrell, the Court did not explicitly limit the application of the Central Hudson test, indicating its continued relevance in evaluating commercial speech regulations. The Supreme Court distinguishes between laws regulating conduct and speech in First Amendment jurisprudence. Conduct-focused regulations may incidentally burden speech but are generally permissible. For example, regulating prices is allowed, but regulating the communication of prices raises First Amendment concerns. Similarly, regulations targeting conduct, like banning race-based hiring, can require employers to remove discriminatory signs without violating free speech. The Supreme Court differentiates between laws regulating conduct and speech in First Amendment jurisprudence. Conduct-focused regulations may burden speech but are generally permissible. The Court looks at the purpose of the law to determine if it targets content or speakers. Commercial speech is subject to government regulation, and the Court has stated that making conduct illegal due to language use does not violate freedom of speech. The State retains the power to regulate commercial activity that is harmful to the public, even when speech is involved. The Supreme Court has upheld regulations on professional conduct that incidentally burden speech, such as in the case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The Supreme Court upheld regulations on professional conduct that incidentally burden speech in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. In National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra, the Court emphasized that the informed consent requirement upheld in Casey was part of the practice of medicine, while a disclosure requirement in NIFLA was not tied to any medical procedure. The Supreme Court has not articulated one overarching standard for evaluating whether provisions regulating speech incidentally are constitutionally permissible. Its decisions in this area have considered various government actions burdening speech, suggesting that the standard may vary depending on the nature of the speech restriction. In some cases, the Court has indicated that the First Amendment is not implicated when the regulated conduct lacks a significant expressive element or does not single out those engaged in expressive activity. The Supreme Court has not established a clear standard for evaluating constitutionally permissible regulations on speech incidentally. In some cases, the Court has suggested that the First Amendment is not involved when the regulated conduct does not focus on expressive activity. The Court has not explicitly ruled on whether a commercial disclosure requirement can be considered a permissible restriction on commercial speech. The Supreme Court has not set a clear standard for evaluating constitutionally permissible regulations on speech incidentally. In some cases, the Court suggested that the First Amendment is not involved when the regulated conduct does not focus on expressive activity. The Court did not explicitly rule on whether a commercial disclosure requirement can be considered a permissible restriction on commercial speech. In a case involving a state law prohibiting surcharges on credit card users, the Court rejected the argument that the law regulated conduct, not speech, as it also regulated the communication of prices. The Supreme Court has been hesitant to uphold government actions that burden speech incidentally, especially in cases involving compelled disclosure requirements. The Court has left open the possibility that commercial disclosure requirements may be considered permissible incidental speech regulation in the future. In the context of commercial disclosure requirements, government actions that compel speech may qualify as permissible incidental speech regulation in the future. The First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech may trigger heightened standards of scrutiny, with the court's review depending on the nature of the government action and the speech itself. There are three possible levels of scrutiny that a court might use to analyze a speech regulation in the context of compelled commercial disclosures. Government actions compelling speech are subject to different levels of scrutiny. Strict scrutiny requires the action to be narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests. Intermediate scrutiny demands a substantial state interest and that the law directly advances that interest. Commercial disclosure requirements have a more lenient standard, where laws may still be struck down if not necessary to serve the interest. In the case of Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of state rules regulating attorney advertising, specifically regarding contingent-fee rate disclosures. The Court acknowledged the heightened scrutiny for prohibitions on commercial speech but found that the interests at stake in this case were not as significant as those in cases involving the compulsion of noncommercial speech. The Court in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel found that state rules regulating attorney advertising, specifically regarding contingent-fee rate disclosures, did not implicate the same level of scrutiny as cases involving noncommercial speech. The Court stated that in a commercial context, an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception. The Zauderer Court found that commercial disclosure requirements must be reasonably related to preventing consumer deception. It warned of First Amendment concerns but upheld a disclosure requirement for contingent-fee arrangements to prevent potential deception, even without evidence of actual deception. The Zauderer standard of review sets a lenient standard for upholding commercial disclosure requirements that are reasonably related to preventing consumer deception. This standard applies to disclosure requirements that provide factual and uncontroversial information about services and terms of payment. Subsequent cases have tested the application of this reasonableness review. In United States v. United Foods, the Supreme Court invalidated a federal statute compelling handlers of fresh mushrooms to fund advertising, stating that mandating support for government-favored speech was contrary to First Amendment principles. The Court found that Zauderer review was inapplicable in this case. In a 2010 decision, Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, the Court considered an attorney's First Amendment challenges to a federal statute that required \"debt relief agencies\" to make certain disclosures in their advertisements. The Court rejected the challenger's contention that Central Hudson's intermediate scrutiny governed the disclosure requirement. The Court in Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States rejected the application of Central Hudson's intermediate scrutiny to a disclosure requirement, instead applying the less exacting scrutiny from Zauderer. The requirement aimed to address misleading commercial advertisements regarding debt relief, mandating accurate information about the advertiser's legal status and services provided. The Court found no issue with the lack of evidence of current misleading ads, relying on congressional record evidence of deceptive advertising patterns. The Court upheld a disclosure requirement in Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, applying Zauderer's less exacting scrutiny to address deceptive debt relief advertisements. In 2018, the Court considered the application of Zauderer in NIFLA, involving disclosure requirements for crisis pregnancy centers under California's FACT Act. The Court upheld a disclosure requirement in Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, applying Zauderer's less exacting scrutiny to address deceptive debt relief advertisements. In 2018, the Court considered the application of Zauderer in NIFLA, involving disclosure requirements for crisis pregnancy centers under California's FACT Act. The Court ruled that the licensed notice for clinics to disclose information about state-sponsored services, including abortion, could not survive even intermediate scrutiny. The Court ruled that the licensed notice for clinics under California's FACT Act could not survive even intermediate scrutiny. The unlicensed notice requirement also failed scrutiny under Zauderer, as California's interest was deemed purely hypothetical. The Supreme Court found that the FACT Act's unlicensed notice requirement burdened protected speech by targeting certain speakers and compelling factual and uncontroversial disclosures related to the goods or services provided. Lower courts have disagreed on the circumstances required to apply Zauderer's reasonableness review for compelled commercial disclosures. Courts have disagreed on the type of government interest that may justify a Zauderer-eligible regulation for compelled commercial disclosures related to goods or services. The Supreme Court tied the value of commercial speech to its ability to inform consumers in the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council case. The Supreme Court tied commercial speech's value to informing consumers and upheld the requirement for attorneys to disclose factual information about fee arrangements in Zauderer. This decision emphasized the importance of accurate and reliable commercial speech, allowing governments to regulate false or misleading information in advertising. The Zauderer review requires government regulations to disclose \"factual and uncontroversial\" information, distinguishing between facts and opinions in compelled disclosures. The Supreme Court values commercial speech for its informative nature, as seen in the Zauderer case where attorneys had minimal First Amendment interest in not providing factual information. The Zauderer review distinguishes between facts and opinions in compelled disclosures, requiring government regulations to disclose \"factual and uncontroversial\" information. Commercial speech is valued for its informative nature, with the Supreme Court upholding the minimal First Amendment interest in not providing specific factual information in advertising. The Supreme Court has upheld disclosure requirements for commercial speech, including the nature of contingent fee arrangements and bankruptcy-related assistance. Lower courts have approved various disclosure regulations, such as country-of-origin information for meat and health risks of tobacco products. However, a federal regulation requiring disclosure of \"conflict minerals\" origin was deemed controversial by the D.C. Circuit in 2015. The court ruled that labeling products as \"[not] conflict free\" interferes with freedom of speech under the First Amendment. Similarly, the Seventh Circuit found that disclosure requirements for sexually explicit video games were not \"factual and uncontroversial.\" The court ruled that labeling products as \"sexually explicit\" interferes with freedom of speech under the First Amendment. The message communicated by signs and brochures about video game ratings was deemed subjective and controversial. Some courts struggle to define what is considered controversial in disclosures. Courts have debated whether disclosures can be labeled as \"controversial\" due to being inflammatory or evoking emotional responses. In NIFLA, the Supreme Court struck down a required disclosure related to abortion as it was deemed not \"uncontroversial.\" Commercial disclosure requirements under Zauderer must be related to the services provided by the speaker. In Zauderer, the Court emphasized the need for disclosure requirements to be related to the services provided by the speaker, which was a necessary prerequisite for Zauderer review. There is debate among judges on whether there is a third requirement for Zauderer review, with the Supreme Court noting in Zauderer that the disclosure requirements were intended to prevent deception of customers. The Supreme Court's decisions applying Zauderer have suggested that the review is based on whether the commercial speech is misleading or if the state's interest is to prevent consumer confusion. However, it has not been firmly established as a necessary condition for Zauderer review, with some lower courts rejecting this position. The D.C. Circuit and Second Circuit have expanded the scope of Zauderer review beyond just preventing consumer deception. The Second Circuit clarified that Zauderer is not limited to laws targeting deception and that commercial disclosure requirements of factual information are eligible for review. Under Zauderer, disclosure requirements must be \"reasonably related\" to the government's interest, with a lenient reasonableness review. However, unjustified or burdensome requirements could violate the First Amendment by chilling protected commercial speech. Lower courts have debated whether this additional inquiry is separate from the reasonableness inquiry. NIFLA did not fully resolve this issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Zauderer upheld a contingent fee disclosure requirement as being \"reasonably related\" to the government's interest in preventing consumer deception. Lower courts have struggled to define the standard for what type of government interest would suffice under Zauderer. The D.C. Circuit has not provided a clear standard, but has indicated that a substantial government interest under Central Hudson's standard could qualify. In a case upholding a disclosure requirement under Zauderer, the Second Circuit described the state's interest as \"legitimate and significant.\" Federal courts of appeals have upheld commercial disclosure requirements for various reasons such as food safety, preventing obesity, and protecting health benefit providers. However, the Second Circuit ruled that consumer curiosity alone is not a strong enough state interest to compel accurate statements. The Supreme Court in NIFLA indicated that the government must assert a concrete interest, not purely hypothetical. The State of California justified the notice requiring unlicensed clinics to disclose their status to ensure pregnant women know they are receiving care from licensed professionals. The Court found no evidence that women were unaware of this fact. NIFLA requires the government to provide evidence supporting its interest, unlike previous cases where the possibility of deception was self-evident. The Court could conclude that a particular advertisement is obviously deceptive without significant evidence. Under Zauderer, the government only needs to show that the disclosure requirement is \"reasonably related\" to its interest in informing consumers about a product trait. The D.C. Circuit stated that the government does not need to provide extensive evidence when using a disclosure mandate to inform consumers, as long as the reason for informing consumers is a valid interest. The court emphasized the tendency of disclosure mandates to ensure recipients receive necessary information, noting that many mandates have been in place for years without constitutional challenge. Lower courts often rely on government evidence to support disputed disclosure requirements, even though little evidence is required to show a requirement is related to a valid government interest. Courts often rely on government evidence to support disputed disclosure requirements, especially in cases where the government asserts an interest in preventing misleading speech. Commercial disclosure requirements may fail the rationality test if the government's interest is other than preventing consumer confusion, as seen in National Association of Manufacturers v. SEC where a provision requiring companies to disclose whether their products were \"conflict free\" was deemed a violation of the First Amendment. The government failed to demonstrate that its measure of forced disclosure would achieve its interest in decreasing revenue for armed groups in the DRC, as stated by the D.C. Circuit. The court found the theory behind the regulation to be unproven and based on speculation, leading to the striking down of the commercial disclosure requirement in Dwyer v. Cappell. The court struck down a state requirement that prohibited attorneys from using quotations from judicial opinions in their advertising, stating that providing the full text of opinions did not dispel the assumed threat of deception and was unduly burdensome. The Third Circuit ruled that a ban on advertising with judicial excerpts should be analyzed under the heightened Central Hudson standard of scrutiny. Courts may strike down disclosure requirements if they are deemed \"unduly burdensome.\" The Supreme Court in NIFLA found that an unlicensed notice requirement was likely unconstitutional as it \"unduly burdened protected speech.\" The Court highlighted a hypothetical scenario where a billboard for an unlicensed facility would have to include a lengthy government-mandated statement, potentially drowning out the original message. The Court ruled that a notice requirement in advertising could be deemed unduly burdensome if it drowns out the facility's own message. If a commercial disclosure is not factual and uncontroversial, a heightened standard of review may be applied. The Supreme Court established a four-part analysis under Central Hudson for government restrictions on commercial speech, requiring the speech to concern lawful activity and not be misleading. The Supreme Court established a four-part analysis under Central Hudson for government restrictions on commercial speech, requiring the speech to concern lawful activity and not be misleading. The Court has described the Central Hudson test as \"intermediate\" scrutiny, applying to commercial disclosure requirements that do not qualify for Zauderer review. Some lower court judges have suggested a higher standard of review for commercial disclosure requirements that do not qualify for Zauderer. The Supreme Court has suggested that some commercial disclosure requirements may be subject to stricter scrutiny than Central Hudson review. In NIFLA, the Court considered state provisions requiring crisis pregnancy centers to make certain disclosures, hinting that these requirements could be subject to strict scrutiny as content-based regulations. The NIFLA Court did not categorize the licensed notice as commercial speech, but rather as \"professional speech\" subject to different rules. The Ninth Circuit had argued that professional speech could be regulated by the state under intermediate scrutiny, but the Supreme Court rejected this idea, stating that the First Amendment does not support such a tradition. The Court rejected the idea that professional speech should be subject to lower scrutiny under the First Amendment, stating that there is no persuasive reason to exempt it from ordinary First Amendment principles. The Court suggested that professional speech may overlap with commercial speech, indicating that commercial speech should also be subject to ordinary First Amendment principles. This conflicts with prior cases that placed commercial speech in a subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values. The NIFLA Court did not categorize the licensed notice as commercial speech but as professional speech, subject to different rules. The Supreme Court did not clearly define if \"professional speech\" overlaps with commercial speech in the context of the FACT Act's requirements. While the unlicensed notice in NIFLA was considered commercial speech due to its inclusion in advertising, it was also required to be posted on-site. This led to debates on whether licensed notices involved commercial speech. In a similar case, a federal court ruled that certain pregnancy centers providing free information were not engaged in commercial speech. The Supreme Court did not clearly address the relationship between professional and commercial speech in the context of the FACT Act's requirements. Some argue that crisis pregnancy centers, even if they provide free information, are engaged in commercial activity by offering health services. The NIFLA Court's lack of direct discussion on this issue may suggest a need for heightened scrutiny regarding commercial disclosure. The Supreme Court's decision in NIFLA did not mention the commercial speech doctrine, leading to speculation that the Court may be more skeptical of commercial disclosure requirements in the future. Justice Thomas emphasized the need for caution in regulating commercial speech. The majority opinion in NIFLA, authored by Justice Thomas, highlighted the dangers of content-based regulations in professional speech. Justice Breyer dissented, expressing concerns that the majority's approach could impact securities and consumer protection laws. The NIFLA majority clarified that it did not question the legality of health and safety warnings. The NIFLA decision did not challenge the legality of health and safety warnings or factual disclosures about commercial products. Lower courts may now be more inclined to apply strict scrutiny to content-based commercial disclosure requirements, following the Court's emphasis on content neutrality in the commercial sphere. The Court's scrutiny of commercial speech restrictions has heightened, with Central Hudson still governing government actions on lawful commercial speech. Regulations must prove a \"substantial\" interest, directly advance it, and not be more extensive than necessary. Central Hudson demands more evidence of effectiveness compared to Zauderer's reasonableness standard. The Central Hudson test requires more evidence of a measure's effectiveness compared to Zauderer. Courts may uphold government actions infringing on commercial speech under Central Hudson, which is more forgiving than strict scrutiny. For example, in Spirit Airlines v. Department of Transportation, a federal regulation governing the display of flight prices satisfied the Central Hudson test by directly advancing the government's interest in ensuring accurate commercial information in the marketplace. Some scholars argue that disclosure requirements may survive strict scrutiny, with the Supreme Court allowing direct regulation of speech in certain cases. Courts may find government interest in consumer protection compelling, requiring tailored disclosures. The government can regulate harmful commercial activity, but strict scrutiny demands more proof and scrutiny. Congress has enacted various disclosure laws. Allegations of disclosure requirements in various industries, including securities, food labeling, prescription drugs, and energy efficiency, have been a subject of debate in Congress. Proposed bills in recent sessions aim to expand disclosure obligations for online platforms and public companies regarding user studies and climate-related risks. The Supreme Court is reevaluating commercial disclosure requirements, potentially moving towards stricter scrutiny. Recent cases suggest that laws regulating commercial speech may face heightened scrutiny if they discriminate based on content. This shift could have significant implications for disclosure obligations in various industries. The Supreme Court is reconsidering commercial disclosure requirements, possibly shifting towards stricter scrutiny. Recent cases indicate that laws regulating commercial speech may be subject to heightened scrutiny if they discriminate based on content. This change could have important implications for disclosure obligations in different industries. The Supreme Court is reevaluating commercial disclosure requirements, with recent cases suggesting a shift towards stricter scrutiny. Lower courts have upheld such requirements, but the NIFLA decision did not specify permissible disclosures. There is a possibility that these requirements may be subject to heightened scrutiny, leading to closer examination by lower courts. In American Beverage Association v. City & County of San Francisco, the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed a decision upholding an ordinance requiring health warnings on advertisements for sugar-sweetened beverages. The court cited NIFLA and held that the warnings were likely unjustified and unduly burdensome under Zauderer, suggesting that a smaller warning would suffice to achieve the government's goals. The court in American Beverage Association v. City & County of San Francisco found that smaller warnings would achieve the government's goals and that the warnings violated the First Amendment by chilling protected speech. When considering new commercial disclosure requirements, it is important to develop a record with evidence demonstrating a need for regulation. Courts will scrutinize the government's purpose for the legislation and the tailored nature of the disclosure requirement. Evidence may be required to support claims of misleading speech or government interest in regulation, ensuring the requirement is not unduly burdensome under intermediate or strict scrutiny. When considering new commercial disclosure requirements, courts may scrutinize the government's purpose and the tailored nature of the requirement to ensure it is not unduly burdensome. The court may also examine alternative policies that would be less restrictive of speech, closely evaluating the government's justifications for choosing a disclosure requirement under intermediate or strict scrutiny."
