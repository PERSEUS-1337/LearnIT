    "content": "The Senate approved the FY2004 consolidated appropriations bill, combining six annual appropriations measures with the spending bill for the USDA. The bill, signed into law as P.L. 108-199, allocated $80.6 billion for USDA and related agencies, with $16.9 billion for discretionary programs and $63.7 billion for mandatory programs. USDA operates through 30 internal agencies with 100,000 employees and is responsible for various activities beyond agriculture. The USDA's gross outlays for FY2003 were $81.53 billion, with the largest portion ($41.3 billion) allocated to food and nutrition programs, including the food stamp program. The second largest portion went to farm and foreign agricultural services, totaling $24.3 billion. Approximately three-fourths of USDA spending is classified as mandatory. The USDA's mandatory spending includes farm commodity support programs, food stamp and child nutrition programs, federal crop insurance, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. While these programs have mandatory status, they often receive funds through annual appropriations. The USDA budget includes mandatory spending for commodity support programs, food stamp and child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. The remaining 25% of the budget is for discretionary programs such as Forest Service programs, rural development programs, research and education programs, agricultural credit programs, WIC, international food aid program, meat and poultry inspection, and food marketing programs. Funding for discretionary programs is determined by annual appropriations acts. The annual Interior appropriations act includes service programs. The distinction between mandatory and discretionary spending involves how Congress controls spending on mandatory programs. Eligibility for mandatory programs is determined by authorizing law, while discretionary programs are funded through annual appropriations acts. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees decide funding for discretionary programs each year. The FY2004 appropriations bill for USDA was completed by the House Appropriations Committee in June 2003. The FY2004 agricultural appropriations bill (H.R. 2673) was reported and approved by the House in July 2003. The Senate completed markup of its version of the bill (S. 1427) in July 2003 and passed it in November 2003 after adopting amendments. The Senate then substituted the text of H.R. 2673 with S. 1427 and passed the amended bill. H.R. 2673 became a consolidated appropriations measure in November 2003 when the conference agreement was filed, and it was approved by the House in December 2003. Senate action was completed in January 2004. The FY2004 USDA spending bill was signed into law on January 23, 2004, after being governed by continuing resolutions until then. The enacted appropriations measure allocated $80.63 billion for USDA and related agencies for FY2004. The FY2004 USDA spending bill allocated $80.63 billion for USDA and related agencies, with $63.7 billion classified as mandatory spending for programs like food stamps and crop insurance. The remaining $16.9 billion was for discretionary programs, slightly below the Administration's request. The FY2004 USDA spending bill allocated $80.63 billion for USDA and related agencies, with $63.7 billion classified as mandatory spending for programs like food stamps and crop insurance. Discretionary spending in Division A of the measure is $963 million below the FY2003 enacted level, including supplementals. Agriculture appropriators were allocated nearly $1 billion less for FY2004 discretionary accounts than the FY2003 level, including supplementals. The conference agreement includes an FY2004 appropriation for foreign food aid that is $572 million below the FY2003 level. Provisions in the agreement limit or prohibit spending on certain mandatory conservation, rural development, and research programs, reducing spending by approximately $650 million from authorized levels. The measure did not include a Senate provision for relaxing the licensing requirement for travel to Cuba for agricultural sales. The FY2004 appropriations bill for USDA and related agencies allocated $80.63 billion, with $63.7 billion for mandatory programs. Discretionary spending was $963 million below FY2003 levels. The bill did not include provisions for relaxing licensing requirements for travel to Cuba or importing cheaper FDA-approved drugs. Senate substituted text of S. 1427 for House-passed bill H.R. 2673 before adopting the amended bill. Six other appropriations bills were included in the FY2004 consolidated appropriations bill. The FY2004 appropriations bill for USDA and related agencies allocated $80.63 billion, with $63.7 billion for mandatory programs funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The CCC can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance ongoing programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance various programs. It must repay the borrowed funds and replenish its losses through congressional appropriations to maintain its borrowing authority. Congress typically provides this funding through the annual USDA appropriation law. The CCC receives an indefinite appropriation to cover funding needs for previous and current year losses, with an estimated amount of $17.275 billion for FY2004. The final consolidated appropriations act and agriculture appropriations bills support this request. A provision in the act requires the Secretary of Agriculture to support dairy prices more diligently. The appropriations act mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to support the farm price of milk at $9.90 per hundredweight. USDA indirectly supports milk prices by purchasing surplus dairy products, but critics argue that the prices set by USDA are too low to maintain the support price. Market prices fell below the support price for eight months in 2002 and 2003, prompting USDA to evaluate the situation. The dairy price support program under the 2002 farm bill mandates USDA to set purchase prices to support the annual farm milk price at $9.90. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. Annual appropriations provide funding for RMA expenses and necessary sums for the program. The Federal Crop Insurance Fund provides funding for the crop insurance program, including premium subsidies and indemnity payments. Annual appropriations are difficult to predict and depend on weather conditions and farmer participation rates. The estimated FY2004 appropriation was $3.368 billion, with legislative enhancements in 2000 increasing federal subsidies for insurance premiums. The Federal Crop Insurance Fund's funding for the crop insurance program, including premium subsidies and indemnity payments, was greatly increased in 2000. This, along with program losses due to drought, has led to increased program costs. For the discretionary component of the program, P.L. 108-199 provides $71.42 million for USDA's Risk Management Agency, slightly below the House-passed level but above the FY2003 enacted level. The Administration had requested a 12% increase for FY2004, mainly for information technology initiatives within RMA and a proposal to limit subsidies to private insurance companies. The Administration proposed capping reimbursement for private insurance companies in the crop insurance program at 20% of premium instead of the current 24.5%. This proposal aimed to save $81 million in FY2004, but faced opposition from the Senate Appropriations Committee, which argued it could force some companies out of business. The Administration proposed capping reimbursement for private insurance companies in the crop insurance program at 20% of premium instead of the current 24.5%, aiming to save $81 million in FY2004. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 authorized $20 million annually for an Agricultural Management Assistance program, with $15 million for producers' conservation practices and $2 million for organic growers. In FY2003, the Secretary used most of the funds to subsidize crop insurance premiums. The $20 million allocated for the Agricultural Management Assistance program was mainly used to subsidize crop insurance premiums for farmers. The Secretary of Agriculture has discretion over how the funds are spent, with a push to expand the pilot livestock insurance program to more states. The Farm Service Agency administers various farmer programs funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers various farmer programs funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation, including direct and guaranteed farm loan programs, conservation programs, and food assistance programs. The FSA Salaries and Expenses account funds program administration and other functions, with a total appropriation of $988 million for FY2004. This is below the House-passed level but above the regular annual appropriation for FY2003. The final FY2004 level for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is below the total FY2003 level, which included supplemental authority for FSA to cover administrative costs for disaster assistance. The House bill instructed USDA not to shut down or consolidate local FSA offices without rigorous cost-effective analysis. The Senate committee expressed concern about FSA downsizing and directed the Secretary to consider the impact of further reductions before closing additional offices. Through FSA farm loan programs, USDA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers. The USDA provides direct farm loans and guarantees timely repayment on qualified loans to farmers. FSA farm loans finance real estate purchases, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. A loan subsidy is allocated each year to cover costs, with an appropriation of $210.7 million requested for FY2004. The FY2003 loan subsidy was $226.8 million for FSA loans. The Administration proposed a $420 million decline in requested loan authority for FSA loans in FY2004, with a $300 million reduction in unsubsidized guaranteed farm operating loans. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act provided $196.7 million to subsidize $3.26 billion in direct and guaranteed FSA loans, above the Senate-passed amount but below the House-passed amount. The final FY2004 consolidated appropriations act reduced loan authority by $200.2 million, mainly in the unsubsidized guaranteed operating loan program account. The natural resources and environment mission area in USDA is carried out by NRCS, FSA, and Forest Service. Conservation spending includes discretionary and mandatory funding, totaling just under $3 billion in budget authority in FY2004. NRCS administers all discretionary conservation programs. The final FY2004 consolidated appropriations act allocated $1.033 billion for discretionary conservation programs, with the House and Senate versions differing in funding amounts. The Administration had requested $1.241 billion, including a new line item for technical assistance. The enacted FY2004 level for discretionary conservation programs allocated $1.033 billion, with differences from the House and Senate bills and the Administration's request. P.L. 108-199 provides specific funding amounts for Conservation Operations and Watershed Surveys and Planning, differing from the House and Senate bills and the Administration's requests. P.L. 108-199 allocates funding for various conservation programs in FY2004, including $87.0 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $29.8 million for Watershed Rehabilitation, and $51.9 million for the Resource Conservation and Development Program. Earmarks are significant in Conservation Operations and Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. The FY2004 appropriations act includes earmarks for Conservation Operations and Watershed Programs, with a growing number and total value of earmarks in recent years. Concerns have been raised about the impact of increased earmarks on conservation priorities. The FY2004 appropriations act includes earmarks for Conservation Operations and Watershed Programs, with concerns about the impact on conservation priorities due to less available funding for other conservation projects. The omnibus 2002 farm bill sets funding levels for mandatory conservation programs, with the Conservation Reserve Program remaining the largest in FY2004. Outlays for mandatory conservation programs are estimated to increase from $2.86 billion in FY2003 to $2.99 billion in FY2004. P.L. 108-199 limits funding for seven programs, saving $240.6 million. Adjustments include limiting enrollment in the Wetland Reserve Program, reducing spending under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Security Program, eliminating mandatory spending on the Dam Rehabilitation Program, and reducing funding for the Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program and Wildlife Habitat. The Water Conservation Program was reduced by $9.0 million to $51.0 million, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program by $18 million to $42.0 million, and the Farmland Protection Program by $13.0 million to $112 million. The total reduction in mandatory programs under the final appropriations act exceeded the reductions in the bills passed by either chamber. Additionally, the final act allocated $14 million to conservation programs in 15 specified states, $1 million to organic certification assistance, and $5 million to financial management activities to reduce risk. The final appropriations act allocated $14 million to conservation programs in 15 specified states, $1 million to organic certification assistance, and $5 million to financial management activities to reduce risk from FY2004 through FY2007. This provision was in response to USDA channeling almost all of the authorized total of $20 million to further subsidize crop insurance premiums in FY2003. P.L. 108-199 concurred with the Administration's proposals for various conservation programs. The funding for conservation programs has increased, leading to a shortage in technical assistance funding. Attempts were made to address this issue in the 2002 farm bill, but a cap on the use of funds created a shortfall. The 2002 farm bill did not remove the cap on CCC funds, leading to a shortage in technical assistance funding for mandatory conservation programs. The Administration's proposal to create a new technical assistance line item funded at $333 million was rejected by Congress, resulting in some programs being donor programs for others. The 2002 farm bill did not remove the cap on CCC funds, causing a shortage in technical assistance funding for mandatory conservation programs. USDA estimated that four programs were donor programs, with EQIP and the Farmland Protection Program making the largest donations. Congress rejected the Administration's proposal for a new technical assistance line item. P.L. 108-199 includes provisions prohibiting the use of discretionary funds for technical assistance in support of mandatory conservation programs. The conference committee does not address the issue of mandatory programs, except for the Resource Conservation and Development Program. Earlier, the Senate defeated an amendment to prohibit technical assistance funding for the Conservation Reserve Program from four programs. Congress may need to enact freestanding legislation to prohibit funds from three mandatory programs for technical assistance. Other provisions in P.L. 108-199 waive cost-sharing requirements for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program. The Emergency Watershed Protection Program requirements are shared to repair or prevent damage to non-federal lands affected by fires. Land in the CRP planted with hardwood trees cannot be ineligible for re-enrollment. NRCS cannot reorganize regional conservationists and offices without approval. Additional provisions include establishing a conservation corridor along the Delmarva peninsula and studying cropping techniques in the Upper Midwest. Consultation with agriculture committees is required before any possible mergers involving NRCS and FSA. Division H of P.L. 108-199 also authorizes the Conservation Security Program. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act authorizes funding for conservation programs, including the Conservation Security Program (CSP) through FY2007. It removes a lifetime cap on program spending to offset disaster assistance costs, providing funds for wildfire assistance in California. This includes $150 million for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, $12.5 million for the Tree Assistance Program, and $12 million for the Emergency Conservation Program. Funding for these provisions is offset by a rescission from FEMA. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act provides funding for discretionary USDA trade programs, including P.L. 480 food aid and the McGovern-Dole international food for education program. The act also allocates funds for USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service and administrative expenses for CCC export programs. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act allocated $1.523 billion for agriculture activities in the House-passed bill and $1.487 billion in the Senate-passed bill. The difference was resolved with a $50 million appropriation for IFEP. The final appropriations measure did not impose new funding limits on mandatory agricultural trade and food aid programs but made permanent a prohibition on using USDA funds to promote tobacco products. The FY2004 appropriations act allocated $132.1 million to the Foreign Agricultural Service for international programs, less than the requested $140.8 million. The Montreal Protocol Fund did not receive the requested $5 million USDA contribution. Additionally, $500,000 was allotted for trade negotiations and biotechnology activities. Other USDA agencies also received trade-biotechnology funding. For FY2004, the Office of the Secretary received $1.165 million, APHIS received $1.0 million, and GIPSA received $150,000 in appropriations. $1.326 billion was allocated for P.L. 480 commodity sales and donations, with $1.192 billion for commodity donations under P.L. 480 Title II. The Administration was directed not to limit monetization under Title II based on sales of donated commodities. The FY2004 bill authorizes the transfer of balances to Title II from P.L. 480 Title III. The new food aid program, IFEP, receives a $50 million appropriation in FY2004 to support school and child feeding programs in foreign countries. IFEP must now be funded by appropriations, with the Secretary exploring other resources like Section 416(b) food aid. The total appropriation for food aid in P.L. 108-199 is $377.6 million. The appropriation for food aid in P.L. 108-199 is $377.6 million less than FY2003. P.L. 108-11 provided additional funding for food aid programs in Africa, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The President's budget does not estimate the value of commodities from the Emerson Trust used for food emergencies in FY2003. In FY2003, the Secretary of Agriculture announced availability of 200,000 tons of wheat for emergency relief in the Horn of Africa and 600,000 tons for Iraq from the Emerson Trust. Only 400,000 tons were used, leaving 1.6 million tons in the trust. The appropriations measure limits FY2004 funds to $20 million for replenishing the trust. Other food aid programs include Food for Progress and Section 416(b) commodity donations. The President's budget allocates $151 million of CCC funding for FFP, with additional funding from P.L. 480 Title I. USDA estimates $119 million of surplus nonfat dry milk for commodity donations under Section 416(b) in FY2004. Export programs like EEP, DEIP, and others promote exports without requiring annual appropriations. The USDA's export programs, including EEP and DEIP, provide cash bonuses to exporters of U.S. agricultural commodities to stay competitive globally. The President's budget for FY2004 allocates $28 million for EEP and $57 million for DEIP. The overall program level for CCC export credit guarantee programs is projected to be $4.2 billion, similar to FY2003. The USDA's export programs for FY2004 include $4 billion for GSM-102 short-term guarantees and $18 million for GSM-103 intermediate-term guarantees. Additionally, $125 million is proposed for the Market Access Program and $34.5 million for the Foreign Market Development Program to support export market development for U.S. agricultural products. Funding for these programs could be impacted by ongoing WTO agricultural trade negotiations. The ongoing WTO agricultural trade negotiations may affect U.S. export programs. The U.S. has proposed eliminating agricultural export subsidies, while the EU wants reductions in export subsidies tied to export credit programs and food aid. The EU and other trading partners argue that the U.S. credit program gives an unfair advantage in exporting agricultural commodities. The issue of large U.S. food aid shipments has also been raised in the negotiations. In ongoing WTO agriculture negotiations, countries have raised concerns about large U.S. food aid shipments, suggesting the U.S. is using them to bypass export subsidy reduction commitments. The U.S. argues that its food aid shipments comply with WTO rules and are provided to countries in need or for development programs. While the U.S. has agreed to establish new rules for export credit guarantees and food aid, detailed agreements have not been reached yet. For more information on negotiations, refer to CRS Report RL32053, Agriculture in WTO Negotiations. P.L. 108-199 includes funding for Hunger Fellowships honoring Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland. The bill did not relax licensing requirements for traveling to Cuba for agricultural and medical sales, in response to a Treasury Department decision. The Bush Administration opposes such efforts. The Bush Administration opposes efforts to relax restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba. Current U.S. policy exempts commercial sales of agricultural and medical products from unilateral sanctions, with ongoing debate on the scope of restrictions. Members of Congress have introduced bills to repeal Cuba-specific prohibitions. USDA's research, education, and economics function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) conducts research for USDA's regulatory agencies on national and regional issues. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) distributes federal funds to land grant Colleges of Agriculture. The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic analysis using databases and data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The agricultural research budget has remained flat for almost 30 years, with some states reducing funding due to financial difficulties. Difficulties at the state level are causing some states to reduce the amounts they appropriate to match USDA formula funds for research, extension, and education. Cuts at both state and federal levels can lead to program cuts down to the county level. Legislation in 1998 and 2002 aimed to boost competitive grants in the REE mission area by tapping into available funds from USDA's budget and the U.S. Treasury. Appropriations committees have restricted the use of mandatory funds for these purposes, but conference committees have allocated more funds for certain years. The appropriations conference committees have allocated more funding for ongoing REE programs in FY2002 and FY2004 than in the House or Senate appropriations bills. Concerns exist that higher military spending and lower tax revenues may lead to static or shrinking appropriations for the REE mission area. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations Act provides $1.15 billion for the Agricultural Research Service, representing essentially level funding with FY2003, excluding a one-time supplemental appropriation for construction. The FY2004 ARS appropriation allocates $1.1 billion for research programs and $63.8 million for modernization and construction of ARS facilities. This represents an increase in research funds but a decrease in facility spending compared to FY2003. $10.5 million is designated for laboratory security upgrades, with the rest for construction projects at various ARS locations. The House and Senate bills had different allocations, with the final allocation exceeding both. The House bill allocated $36 million for building projects, while the Senate bill allocated $46 million. The Senate bill did not include $2 million for renovations at the National Agricultural Library. The FY2004 act continued funding for all projects at FY2003 levels, rejecting the Administration's proposal to discontinue some research projects. The Administration's budget request assumed the discontinuation of earmarked projects, but the appropriators provided funding for all projects. The FY2004 act allocated $1.120 billion for CSREES, with $621.4 million for research and education funding for states. The Administration's proposal to reprogram $12 million into special initiatives on emerging diseases, global climate change, biosecurity, and genomic sequencing was included. ARS evaluates programs every 5 years and reprograms funds accordingly. Education funding for states in FY2004 is $4.65 million above FY2003, $24 million above the House bill allocation, $3.9 million above the Senate provision, and $107.2 million above the budget request. Block grants for agricultural research at 1862 land grant universities are at $180 million, while grants for research at historically black 1890 land grant institutions are at $36 million. Additional funding is provided for research at tribally controlled 1994 land grant institutions. State extension programs receive $441.7 million, a decrease from FY2003. In FY2004, funding for extension programs at 1862 land grant universities is $279.4 million, while grants for 1890 institutions are at $31.9 million. The act provides $2.9 million for extension programs at 1994 institutions. Multi-state research projects receive $50.5 million, an increase from FY2003. Additionally, there is increased funding for an outreach program for socially disadvantaged individuals. The House bill includes increased funding for outreach programs for socially disadvantaged farmers, with $6 million allocated in FY2004. The bill also includes $111.3 million for earmarked research and extension grants, and $165 million for the National Research Initiative program, maintaining level funding from previous years. The FY2004 budget for the National Research Initiative program was essentially level funded at $165 million, which was the highest in the program's history. The program had received $149 million and $180 million in the House and Senate bills, respectively. The budget request was for $200 million, but P.L. 108-199 included the Administration's request to deny funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems competitive grants program. This program, authorized at $120 million annually, had been prohibited from receiving funds in FY2002 and FY2003. In FY2004, the National Research Initiative program received $165 million in funding, with $30 million potentially available for competitive grants. The Economic Research Service (ERS) was allocated $71.4 million, a $2.7 million increase from FY2003. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) received $128.9 million in funding as proposed in the Senate bill. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act (P.L. 108-199) provides $784.5 million for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), representing a $29.7 million increase over FY2003. The act also includes language directing the agency to use the increase for hiring additional inspectors, providing more scientific training, and conducting more sampling for pathogens causing human illness. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act (P.L. 108-199) provides $784.5 million for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to enhance food safety measures, including funding for microbiological testing of meat and poultry samples. The act also addresses concerns over the validity of FSIS determinations of foreign meat and poultry inspection systems, requiring a report to Congress by March 1, 2004. The provision to prohibit USDA from inspecting downed animals was not included in the final agreement. FSIS banned downed animals from entering slaughter plants after the first case of mad cow disease in 2003. The agency receives $101 million annually from user fees for inspection programs. The President's budget proposed expanding overtime fees on industry to reduce tax-funded inspection costs, but Congress has not approved this change. The FY2004 appropriations act does not address the Administration's proposal to reduce tax-funded inspection costs. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) receives $725.6 million under the act, responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture and facilitating agricultural trade. The FY2004 appropriations act allocates $725.6 million to APHIS, with $720.6 million for salaries and expenses and $5 million for buildings and facilities. This amount is comparable to the FY2003 appropriation of $692.7 million after adjustments for the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. In FY2004, USDA expects to collect $285 million in user fees to fund agricultural border inspections, transferring $178 million to DHS. APHIS activities are divided into five program functions, with funding for pest and disease exclusion at $152.5 million and plant and animal health monitoring at $139.3 million. In FY2004, USDA expects to collect $285 million in user fees for agricultural border inspections, transferring $178 million to DHS. APHIS activities are divided into five program functions, with funding for pest and disease management rising prominently to $333 million, an increase of $15.8 million over FY2003. The increase for scientific and technical services is $13.8 million over FY2003. The funding allocation for various pest control programs in FY2004 includes $8 million for citrus canker, $4 million for Asian long-horned beetle, $4.8 million for glassy-winged sharpshooter, and $1.5 million for Emerald Ash Borer. Congress requests reports on controlling Emerald Ash Borer and Asian long-horned beetle. Funding for chronic wasting disease increases by $3.6 million. Congress encourages fund transfers for emergency eradication programs. In FY2003, $10 million of CCC funds are designated for tree replacement and indemnification for losses from citrus canker in Florida. The conferees increase emergency management systems by $640,000 to boost foot and mouth disease vaccine availability. P.L. 108-199 funds a $2 million biosecurity program for agroterrorism preparedness, along with other related funds for database development and veterinary diagnostics. Coordination between the Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security is required to assist states with agroterrorism preparedness. Diagnostic work at Plum Island should focus on agriculture. P.L. 108-199 incorporates a Senate provision prohibiting state matching of certain federal funds. The final rule required states to match federal funds, citrus canker assistance funds can be used for tree replacement. P.L. 108-199 prohibits imports of live cattle from countries with BSE. The Agricultural Marketing Service promotes U.S. agricultural products in domestic and international markets. The FY2004 appropriations act provides $94.2 million for AMS. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) received $94.2 million in FY2004 appropriations, which is an increase from the previous year's funding. The AMS budget includes funds for marketing services, payments to states and territories, and specialty market creation in Wisconsin. Additionally, AMS uses Section 32 funds for government purchases of surplus farm commodities. The Senate appropriations committee report encourages USDA to use all existing Section 32 authorities to continue the $6 million Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program authorized under the 2002 farm bill. Additionally, the report notes that USDA is required to purchase at least $200 million annually of fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops, with existing purchases being counted towards the minimum. The Senate report encourages USDA to use existing Section 32 authorities for the $6 million Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program. It also includes an additional $477,000 for the National Organic Program. The 2002 farm bill required country-of-origin labeling for various products, with implementation delayed to September 30, 2006. The House-passed bill on country-of-origin labeling for meats included a provision to prohibit the use of FY2004 funds for implementation. A Senate resolution insisted on not agreeing to the House position, with the deadline for covered commodities set for September 30, 2006. GIPSA oversees U.S. standards, inspection, and grading for grain and commodities, ensuring fair trading practices. The FY2004 appropriations act provides $35.9 million for GIPSA salaries and expenses, with the House and Senate proposing different funding levels. An additional $42.5 million is expected from GIPSA user fees, with no new user fees proposed to replace appropriations. The FY2004 appropriations act provides $35.9 million for GIPSA salaries and expenses. Approximately $5 million of proposed new fees would come from charges for developing, reviewing, and maintaining U.S. grain standards, while $24 million would be from new license fees on various entities covered by the Packers and Stockyards Act. Conferees expressed concern about a $2 million transfer in July 2003 and directed the Administration to adopt a fee structure fully funding services. No resources are provided for packer audits. The Administration requested $1 million in FY2004 GIPSA funds for a pilot program to audit the four largest beef packers and $500,000 for a comprehensive review of the PSA and its regulations. USDA noted the need for a review due to industry changes since 1921. GIPSA will clarify its views on competition, potentially leading to more investigations and recovered funds for regulated industries. The House Appropriations Committee expressed ongoing concerns. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the economic impacts of packer control on local communities and requested regular updates on a study regarding a ban on packer ownership. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed funding for GIPSA's expanded biotechnology activities. P.L.108-199 allocated $150,000 to GIPSA out of $3.3 million provided by USDA for rural development initiatives. The Agricultural Reorganization Act of 1994 established three agencies responsible for rural development: Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. The FY2004 appropriations act allocated $2.462 billion for USDA rural development programs, supporting a $11.098 billion loan authorization level. The Senate and House recommended additional funding for rural development programs. The House measures recommended significantly higher budget authority and loan authorization levels compared to the conference agreement and the Administration's requested appropriation. Provisions in P.L. 108-199 prohibit the expenditure of funds for certain mandatory rural development programs, blocking funding for these programs totaling $293 million. P.L. 108-199 prohibits $293 million in mandatory rural development spending for various programs, including the Rural Strategic Investment Program, Rural Firefighters Program, Broadband Services Access, Renewable Energy Systems Program, Rural Business Investment Program, and Value-Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants program. The Senate bill recommended no funds be spent on the Rural Business Investment Program, while the House bill did not include this provision.
