The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a provision for periodic reviews of export controls to remove requirements for validated licenses as goods and technology become obsolete. The Secretary must conduct these reviews every year to ensure the controls align with specific objectives. The Secretary must identify specific objectives of export controls for each country or group of countries requiring a validated license. This includes estimating quantities and performance for a 12-month period to defer the development of specific capabilities. The Secretary evaluates the effectiveness of export controls in achieving specific objectives by assessing availability from sources outside the US. The Secretary evaluates the economic impact of export controls on companies, including lost sales and administrative overhead, and makes changes based on review findings. The Secretary can make changes to export controls by eliminating the need for an export license, allowing delivery under a distribution license, removing performance thresholds, or increasing performance levels for individual licenses.
