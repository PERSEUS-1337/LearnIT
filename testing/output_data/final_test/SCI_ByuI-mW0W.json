    "content": "We propose a simple procedure for assessing generative adversarial network performance based on the goal of generalization. The approach involves estimating the Wasserstein distance between the generative distribution and the data distribution using a test set. This method was applied to evaluate various GAN architectures, showing sensitivity to the choice of ground metric and suggesting improvements. Attention to the ground metric in Wasserstein GAN training is recommended for better performance. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have raised concerns about generalization and overfitting. Evaluating GAN output quality is challenging, often relying on visual inspection. This paper proposes a simple GAN training framework using a finite dataset to estimate the underlying data distribution, measured by a statistical distance D. The paper proposes a method to evaluate GAN generalization using a statistical distance D, specifically the Wasserstein distance. The performance of this method depends heavily on the choice of ground metric. A novel ground metric is suggested for improved performance in Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). In this section, the paper defines the broader goal of generative modeling and introduces a notion of generalization within their framework. They assume an intractable distribution \u03c0 on a set X, with a fixed dataset X sampled from it. The setup includes the empirical distribution X DISPLAYFORM0 and the set of probability distributions on X denoted by P(X). The paper introduces the concept of generative modeling with the goal of producing a distribution in P(X) close to the intractable distribution \u03c0 on set X. The learning algorithm aims to minimize the statistical divergence D between \u03b1(X) and \u03c0. One approach is to choose \u03b1(X) = X, especially when using a metric like Wasserstein distance where D(X, \u03c0) approaches 0 as |X| increases. The paper discusses generative modeling with the goal of producing a distribution in P(X) close to the intractable distribution \u03c0 on set X. It introduces the concept of minimizing the statistical divergence D between \u03b1(X) and \u03c0, where choosing \u03b1(X) = X can help achieve this goal. The focus then shifts to GANs, outlining a general model for their operation and addressing the issue of generalization in this context. Most GAN algorithms take a distribution P as input and compute or approximate DISPLAYFORM0 for some choices of Q \u2286 P(X) and D\u0393: P(X) \u00d7 P(X). In generative modeling, the goal is to produce a distribution in P(X) close to the intractable distribution \u03c0 on set X by minimizing the statistical divergence D between \u03b1(X) and \u03c0. GANs take a distribution P as input and compute or approximate DISPLAYFORM0 for choices of Q \u2286 P(X) and D\u0393: P(X) \u00d7 P(X) \u2192 R, where D\u0393 is fixed in a GAN architecture and D is a feature of the problem definition. Q is the set of pushforward measures \u03bd \u2022 G\u22121 from a noise distribution \u03bd on noise space Z and a set of functions G: Z \u2192 X. Various choices of D\u0393 have been proposed, such as the Jenson-Shannon divergence, f-divergences, and the Wasserstein GAN. The f-GAN BID12 and Wasserstein GAN propose different objectives for G in GAN architectures. Minimizing D defines the ultimate goal, while minimizing D\u0393 guides how to achieve that goal. Even if D = D\u0393, minimizing D(\u0393(X), \u03c0) may still be necessary. GANs receive input X, not \u03c0 directly, and training involves multiple passes over a fixed dataset like CIFAR-10. The authors argue that GANs may struggle to generalize if the dataset is not representative of the true distribution. They suggest finding a better divergence function to address this issue. Popular choices of divergence may not meet the necessary conditions for effective training. The authors propose using a neural network distance DNN to address the limitations of popular divergence functions like Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance. They argue that minimizing DNN in Q can lead to small values of DNN(\u03c0, Q), but caution that this may not guarantee good generalization behavior for GANs. The authors propose using a neural network distance DNN to address limitations of popular divergence functions in GANs. They caution that minimizing DNN in Q may not guarantee good generalization behavior. The choice of \u03b1(X) = \u0393(X) is seen as an open empirical question for GAN performance. The authors aim to assess how well GANs achieve a specific task by estimating the first Wasserstein distance, which involves minimizing a distance measure to a given empirical distribution. They use the Wasserstein distance because it is sensitive to the topology of the underlying set X and metricizes weak convergence for the Wasserstein space. The authors propose a method to estimate the first Wasserstein distance using GANs. They move samples from set X to set Y, train the GAN on X to obtain \u03b1(X), and then estimate the distance using a linear program. This approach can also be used to estimate other distances and test for convergence. The authors propose a method to estimate Wasserstein distances using GANs. They split samples into training and testing sets, train a GAN on the training set to obtain \u03b1(X), and then compute the distance using a linear program. This methodology was applied to test DCGAN and I-WGAN on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with Wasserstein distances computed using 10000 samples and L2 distance as the ground metric. The study compared Wasserstein distances of GAN-generated images on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Results showed that the quality of MNIST samples closely resembled true samples, while CIFAR-10 samples were easily identified as fake. Concerns were raised about using L2 distance as a metric for GAN quality due to early discrepancies in CIFAR-10 samples. Blurring the CIFAR-10 training set improved the similarity between the blurred dataset and the generated samples in terms of Wasserstein distance. This effect was observed for various values of blurring intensity, indicating that blurring the dataset brings it closer to the generated samples. Blurring the CIFAR-10 training set improved similarity with generated samples in terms of Wasserstein distance. To address issues, L2 was replaced with a more suitable metric dX by mapping X through a pre-trained neural network \u03b7 into feature space Y. Testing the performance involved repeating the blurring experiment with \u03b7(x) scaled to 224x224 and processed through DenseNet-121 pre-trained on ImageNet. The study used a DenseNet-121 pre-trained on ImageNet to extract features before the linear output layer. The plot of W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 (\u03b2 \u03c3 (X),\u0176 ) showed a monotonically increasing curve as \u03c3 grew, reflecting declining visual quality. Results from GAN training on MNIST and CIFAR-10 showed W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 (\u00c2,\u0176 ) decreasing monotonically towards an asymptote, accurately summarizing visual quality throughout training. There was a significant gap between W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 (\u00c2,\u0176 ) and W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 (X,\u0176 ), indicating visually distinct GAN samples. The study suggests using W L p \u2022\u03b7 as a metric for comparing GAN performance and guiding future research. It shows that GAN samples are visually distinguishable from real samples, with potential for improvement using I-WGAN on MNIST. The study proposes using W L p \u2022\u03b7 as a metric for evaluating GAN performance and guiding future design. It also suggests that implementing W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 in WGAN architecture could lead to better sample quality. The study suggests using W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 in WGAN architecture to improve sample quality by optimizing over a class of (d Y , d R )-Lipschitz functions. This approach involves training a standard WGAN with the initial layers of the discriminator fixed to the embedding \u03b7. The study explores using W L 2 \u2022\u03b7 in WGAN architecture to enhance sample quality by optimizing over a class of (d Y , d R )-Lipschitz functions. Future work will focus on empirical inquiry and establishing better theoretical guarantees for the method. Recent theoretical work suggests fast convergence of empirical Wasserstein estimations, indicating potential for significant advancements in the approach. The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is a distance measure on probability distributions used for testing similarity and learning generative models like GANs. It is parameterized by a characteristic kernel and defines distance by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. MMD induces the same weak topology as Wasserstein distance and can be calculated by pushing distributions to a Hilbert space using a feature function induced by the kernel. The MMD is a distance measure on probability distributions, calculated by computing the supremum of certain functions over feature spaces. It differs from the Wasserstein distance by using a richer feature space but only considering linear functions. The MMD is a distance measure on probability distributions, calculated by computing the supremum of functions over feature spaces. Balancing acts between the expressiveness of features and functions affect the learning and testing of GAN approaches. Future research could explore the implications of these differences."
