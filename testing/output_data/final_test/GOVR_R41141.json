    "content": "In 2009, financial stress in the dairy industry led to federal support programs providing over $1 billion to dairy farmers. Additional $350 million was granted in October for supplemental payments and government purchases of dairy products. Many farmers faced pressure, leading to cow slaughter and business closures. Despite a rebound in foreign demand, financial concerns persist for farmers who lost equity due to low milk prices. The dairy industry faced financial stress in 2009, leading to a decline in the number of dairy farms in the United States. The industry and Congress are considering new policies to address fluctuations in milk prices and support dairy farmers. Congressional hearings and the USDA-established Dairy Industry Advisory Committee are part of the groundwork for the next farm bill. The USDA-established Dairy Industry Advisory Committee (DIAC) approved its final report with recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture in March 2011. The report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry, including dairy farm numbers, industry structure, history of dairy marketing and policy, and current dairy policy. It also examines options for federal dairy policy being considered by the industry and/or Congress, highlighting the impact of increased dairy cow output and advances in dairy farm technology on the reduction of dairy farms during the 1960s and 1970s. The dairy industry has seen a decline in the number of farms over the years, with annual losses slowing down to 2,000 to 5,000 farms per year. Despite this, increases in productivity have led to a steady rise in total milk production. Domestic milk demand has grown slowly, while consumption of dairy products like cheese has increased. Exports of dairy products have also reached record levels in recent years. The dairy industry has seen a decline in the number of farms, with smaller farms experiencing declines while larger farms with 1,000 cows or more increased by 20% due to lower production costs. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger farms than the U.S. average of 133 cows per farm. Cost structures also vary by state. In the dairy industry, farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger farms than the U.S. average of 133 cows per farm. Operating costs are affected by high feed costs in western states, where large dairy farms dominate, while in other parts of the country like Wisconsin, operating costs tend to be lower when grain and feed prices rise. Urban areas grew, leading to milk being sent to processors to supply these areas. In the early 1900s, dairy farmers formed cooperative associations to negotiate with milk processors, leading to the establishment of classified pricing for milk based on its use. This system, still in use today, assigns the highest value to milk for fluid use due to higher transportation and handling costs. The Great Depression caused a breakdown in the voluntary pricing system, leading to the establishment of federal milk marketing orders. The voluntary classified pricing system broke down, leading to the establishment of federal milk marketing orders to stabilize the market and equalize the market power of dairy farmers with processors. Import quotas were enacted to protect producers from foreign competition, and during World War II, demand for milk increased. The government began supporting milk prices in the late 1940s through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. Federal dairy policy now includes dairy product price support and federal milk marketing orders. The federal government supports dairy prices through various programs including the Dairy Product Price Support Program, federal milk marketing orders, direct payments under the Milk Income Loss Contract Program, the Dairy Export Incentive Program, and tariff-rate quotas on dairy imports. Additionally, the Cooperatives Working Together program can impact milk production. The Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle, a subsidized insurance policy, has helped lower costs for producers. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) aims to prevent market prices for dairy products from dropping below support levels, indirectly supporting farm milk prices. Changes in farm milk prices have increased since the mid-1990s due to reduced price support levels. The program was extended through December 31, 2012, by the 2008 farm bill. Federal milk marketing orders mandate minimum prices that processors must pay producers in milk marketing areas. Marketing orders were created in the 1930s to balance market power between farmers and milk handlers. Under Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs), processors in milk marketing areas must pay producers for delivered milk based on its end use. FMMOs regulate the farm price of two-thirds of the nation's fluid milk in 10 geographic marketing areas. Some states, like California, have their own milk marketing regulations. FMMOs are permanently authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and do not require periodic reauthorization by Congress. USDA administers the federal order system, and interested parties can petition for new orders or amendments. Minimum FMMO milk prices are set through formal rulemaking procedures. The Agricultural Marketing Service administers the federal order system, setting minimum FMMO milk prices based on wholesale dairy product prices. Prices fluctuate monthly with market changes. Classified pricing determines farmers' milk payments based on end use (fluid vs. manufacturing). Handlers pay higher prices for Class I products (fluid consumption) than for Class II, III, and IV products. FMMOs also regulate how market proceeds are distributed among producers. The federal order system sets minimum milk prices based on wholesale dairy product prices, with prices fluctuating monthly. Handlers pay higher prices for fluid consumption products compared to manufacturing products. Market proceeds are distributed among producers through pooling in federal marketing order areas, with farmers receiving a blend price based on order-wide revenue. Milk prices at the farm level reflect minimum prices paid by handlers under marketing orders, plus any premiums from local supply/demand factors, minus costs like transport and marketing charges. Retail prices are influenced by wholesale prices and competition among retailers, not FMMO regulations. The 2008 farm bill extended the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program until September 30, 2012. Participating dairy farmers receive federal payments when the minimum monthly price for Class I milk falls below $16.94 per cwt in Boston. The payment is 45% of the price difference, with a limit of 2.985 million pounds of annual production. The program is administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency. Large dairy farm operators have raised concerns about the payment limit. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) provides cash bonus payments to U.S. dairy exporters, with limits on quantity and value. Initially aimed at countering foreign dairy subsidies, the program has evolved to include market development. Total payments exceed $1 billion, with a peak in 1993 at $162 million. Reactivated in 2009 after being dormant since 2004, $19 million in bonuses were awarded. Large dairy farm operators have expressed concerns about the payment limit of the MILC Program affecting their income. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) was reactivated in 2009 with bonuses worth $19 million awarded in FY2009. Section 1503 of the 2008 farm bill extended the DEIP authority until December 31, 2012. Imports of dairy products were subject to Section 22 import quotas until 1995, excluding certain products like casein, whey, and soft-ripened cow's milk cheese. Legislation to implement the WTO Uruguay Round Agriculture Agreement amended relevant laws. The WTO Uruguay Round Agriculture Agreement amended Section 22 to prohibit import limitations on products from other WTO members. Tariff rate quotas were established for dairy products in the U.S. Importers must apply for a license for low tariff imports, while high-tier imports are subject to a higher tariff. The National Milk Producers Federation operates the Cooperatives Working Together program, which includes herd buyouts and dairy product export assistance. The program retired 276,000 cows and 5,700 bred heifers, representing 5.4 billion pounds of annual milk production. The Cooperatives Working Together program, funded by dairy producers, conducted its final herd buyout in 2010. The program aims to assist with exportation rather than additional buyouts. The Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle insurance policy helps manage price risk for dairy producers, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency. In 2010, USDA announced it would begin subsidizing policy premiums for the Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle insurance product to encourage its use. Policies are now subsidized at approximately 40% of the total premium. The Federal Crop Insurance Act limits expenditures on livestock policies to $20 million per year. USDA's changes to the dairy insurance policy have increased demand for the product, and the spending limit is expected to be reached in FY2011. Total costs of dairy programs vary widely depending on market conditions, ranging from zero in fiscal 2008 to nearly $1 billion in fiscal 2009. The MILC program is the largest component of total outlays. The federal milk marketing order system plays a smaller role than a decade ago, with projected spending for dairy programs at approximately $100 million per year. Changes in federal dairy policy and associated costs/savings may be influenced by the baseline projected costs of current programs. If a proposal costs more than the baseline, additional funding would be required from another source. See \"Dairy Policy Options\" for further discussion. The dairy industry and Congress are considering policy changes in response to financial difficulties faced by dairy farmers since late 2008. Proposed changes include supply management, market-based, and tiered-pricing approaches to stabilize milk prices and production levels. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) advocates for a combination of supply management and market-based approaches to stabilize the dairy market. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee released recommendations, with many leaning towards the market-based approach. Supply management proposals are also being considered. Two proposals are being considered to stabilize the dairy market: the Dairy Price Stabilization Program Act of 2010 (H.R. 5288) and the Dairy Market Stabilization Act of 2010 (S. 3531). These proposals aim to manage the U.S. milk supply to prevent low and volatile farm milk prices by assessing producers who increase production over specified levels. The Dairy Price Stabilization Program Act of 2010 (H.R. 5288) aims to stabilize farm milk prices by assessing producers who exceed specified production levels. Producers would be assigned a base raw milk marketing quantity and could face a market access fee if they sell more than their allowable milk marketing. The Dairy Price Stabilization Program Act of 2010 (H.R. 5288) proposes a flexible system where producers can sell as much milk as they want as long as they pay any applicable fees. The Secretary of Agriculture would work with a 30-member board to determine allowable annual growth in marketings and market access fees for excessive milk sales. The bill proposes a rate and fee schedule for milk production, with some discretion allowed for deviations with board approval. S. 3531 is similar to H.R. 5288 but mandates a supply management program, while H.R. 5288 requires producer approval before implementation. Both bills require a producer referendum within three years to continue the program. The producer board in S. 3531 consists of 15 members, compared to 30 in the House bill, with similar proportions of producers and representatives. In S. 3531, dairy producers elect board members, while the Secretary appoints them in H.R. 5288. Producers in S. 3531 can choose their initial marketing base from quarterly averages of 2007-2009 or 2009 alone, while H.R. 5288 uses the highest annual total from 2007-2009. S. 3531 includes additional factors for the Secretary to consider when deviating from specified schedules for milk marketing growth rate and market. The proposed dairy program would be self-financed, with payments to producers funded by assessments on non-compliant producers. Existing dairy programs would continue, with minimal federal costs if excess milk production is constrained. Current dairy farmers who expanded in 2007-2009 could benefit more, while new farmers may be discouraged by high market access fees or milk base costs. The proposed legislation aims to reduce farm milk price volatility and could result in more stable prices for the United States in the world dairy market. Different program parameters could impact farm prices, with potential trade impacts and the possibility of becoming a consistent dairy supplier. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) has proposed the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) to slow milk production and boost prices during low margin times. When activated, farmers would receive payment on only 98% of their base production when the national margin drops below $6 per hundredweight for two consecutive months, with the remaining 2% used for dairy product purchases and promotion activities. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program proposed by the National Milk Producers Federation would redirect a larger share of farm revenue for dairy product purchases and promotion activities when margins are low. The program would be activated on a monthly basis when margins decline to low levels, with funds collected by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. The NMPF analysis shows that margins have dropped below $6 in the past, leading to a disincentive for producers to increase milk production. The program would deactivate once the national margin rises to a certain level. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program proposed by the National Milk Producers Federation would pay producers based on milk production levels when margins are low, with the program deactivating once the national margin rises to $6 per hundredweight. The base amount of milk produced is determined by a three-month rolling average or the same month in the previous year to account for seasonality. The base can only be transferred with the farm and would be an asset, as production has no value when margins drop. The program aims to reduce constraints on production levels, with projections showing dairy market conditions expected to remain above trigger levels for the next 10 years. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) proposed by the National Milk Producers Federation aims to reduce high price periods by limiting milk production when margins decline. FAPRI analysis suggests that the DMSP, in conjunction with a margin insurance payment plan, would help reduce federal expenditures and raise dairy farm margins during market downturns like the one in 2009. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) proposed by the National Milk Producers Federation aims to raise dairy farm margins significantly during the March-December 2009 period. A report supported by the International Dairy Foods Association estimated the impact of DMSP on producer checks between 2000 and 2009, suggesting a smaller impact on producers in the Western and Southwestern regions. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) supports the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) to raise dairy farm margins significantly. Critics argue that withholdings under DMSP would be fair and beneficial for overall producer margins. The Marginal Milk Pricing (MMP) Program, proposed by Agri-Mark, aims to be more attractive to smaller dairy farms and farmers in higher-cost regions. The program's structure is similar to DMSP but with a fixed base level during operation. The Marginal Milk Pricing (MMP) Program would activate quicker as margins decline, with a national margin trigger of $7 per cwt. Farmers would receive farm revenue on 99% of base, with parameters set at $6 and 98%. For milk produced above base amounts, farmers would receive the average price minus the Class III price, making the penalty for overproduction the same for all farmers nationwide. Under the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP), farmers in higher-cost regions like the northeastern or southeastern United States would face penalties greater than the Class III price. Agri-Mark supports keeping the MILC program, which benefits small to medium-sized herds, and suggests giving producers the choice between MILC and the NMPF's margin insurance payment plan. Supporters of price stabilization and supply control argue that measures are needed to counteract incentives for overproduction, especially in the dairy industry where producers often increase production even during low prices to boost cash flow. Advocates expect market volatility to continue as the US expands in international markets. Supply management proposals could reduce milk price volatility and government expenditures. Programs like MMP and DMSP may increase demand and enhance average milk prices. The programs proposed in the 111th Congress aim to lower average prices and reduce market volatility, but experts warn that significant volatility may persist. Critics argue that supply management could harm the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry, limit innovation, raise consumer prices, and decrease demand for dairy products. Critics argue that a pricing system based on supply control and/or cost of production may reward inefficiency and make it difficult to match supply and demand. U.S. dairy farms may have less incentive to reduce production costs as their individual shares of national production are protected. Production adjustments are typically made by farmers who can no longer operate due to high costs or lack of equity. Constraints on milk production could impact dairy processors interested in expansion. Critics of supply management argue that it may impact processors looking to expand or establish new plants. They believe that program triggers reducing milk production could lead to higher prices, affecting investments in manufacturing plants and new markets. Economists warn of unintended consequences, such as higher milk prices increasing farm asset values and driving up production costs. This could also discourage the use of dairy ingredients in products and promote cheaper imported substitutes. Market-based plans are seen as an alternative to supply management. Market-based plans focus on managing price risk rather than influencing prices, addressing market transparency issues and improving dairy pricing. Proponents argue that price volatility is inherent in the dairy industry and producers should manage price risks without limiting opportunities. Critics fear that overproduction incentives will worsen the industry's financial struggles. The NMPF proposes a supply management component to address financial challenges in the dairy industry, advocating for the Dairy Producer Margin Protection Program (DPMPP) and Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) to replace existing programs they deem ineffective. They argue that current price targets are too low, price support programs create artificial demand, and production limits discriminate against large farms. The DPMPP is a new safety net for dairy farmers, protecting their margin by providing margin insurance with no payment limits. It aims to address catastrophic conditions and low margins, offering additional income until markets improve. The program shifts from price support to margin insurance to safeguard dairy farmers regardless of current price levels. Market prices will still fluctuate, but under certain conditions, a supply management program could impact milk prices. The DPMPP under the NMPF policy package offers margin insurance to dairy producers, with government-subsidized base coverage and additional coverage options. It aims to support farm revenue during low-margin periods, alongside the DMSP. Government spending would increase during times of low milk prices or high feed prices, depending on program parameters and supply management features. The DPMPP program offers margin insurance to dairy producers, aiming to support farm revenue during low-margin periods. It would be scale-neutral, with no payment limits, potentially providing more protection than current dairy programs. Small-farm advocates may argue that it could still favor larger dairies over smaller ones. The DPMPP program, in combination with the DMSP, offers larger payments during low-margin periods. FAPRI predicts minimal market impact due to expected margins above trigger levels. IDFA supports NMPF's proposal for better risk management tools and market transparency. IDFA supports NMPF's proposal for margin insurance to provide dairy producers with a more reliable income and replace outdated programs. However, IDFA strongly opposes supply management that could increase costs for processors. A market-based option is a farm savings account program, allowing producers to save income during profitable years for withdrawal during less profitable ones. The program could reduce tax liability and potentially receive government matching funds. Stabilizing dairy farm income would depend on program design and producer response. Price discovery improvements are also being considered. Efforts to improve price discovery in the dairy industry include changes to price reporting, dairy product stocks data, and federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs). The Dairy Policy Action Coalition (DPAC) advocates for improved price discovery and market transparency, calling for expanded mandatory price reporting to reflect supply and demand factors. DPAC suggests daily reporting instead of weekly, but funding constraints have hindered USDA's ability to expand reporting. This could lead to simplifying the FMMO system by reducing milk classes from four to two. The National Milk Producers Federation proposes reforming FMMOs by eliminating current product pricing formulas to create a more dynamic and transparent pricing system that compensates producers fairly. Prices for dairy products are now reported electronically on a weekly basis, with the possibility of more frequent reporting in the future. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) proposes reforming FMMOs by eliminating current product pricing formulas, arguing that the current system compensates handlers for lower-valued products and encourages overproduction. Instead, they recommend using a competitive pay price based on actual market transactions for establishing minimum prices for Class I and Class II milk products. The NMPF expects these changes to improve pricing transparency and fairness within the dairy industry. The NMPF and DPAC support FMMO changes to improve price discovery and reduce volatility in the dairy industry. Some producers prefer the current method of calculating minimum prices, while the DCMA warns that switching from the current pricing system could lower farm prices. Tiered pricing is a system that sets prices based on different milk classes. Tiered pricing is a pricing system that sets higher prices for a portion of production and lower prices for the remaining portion. This system can benefit sellers of agricultural commodities as consumers may be little affected by price changes for certain products. The FMMO system utilizes tiered pricing by setting higher minimum prices for raw milk used for fluid consumption and lower minimum prices for milk used in manufactured products. Some believe that changes in federal milk marketing orders could stabilize the milk market and increase revenue for producers. The Federal Milk Marketing Improvement Act of 2009 aims to stabilize the milk market and support dairy farmers by basing pricing on production costs. It includes provisions for USDA to reduce prices to limit overproduction. The bill would set minimum federal order prices using quarterly estimates of the national average cost of production for milk used in manufactured products. The bill allows USDA to reduce milk prices if there is excess production, based on national average production costs. Price reductions would apply to farms that increased production from the previous year, with collected funds used to offset purchasing excess milk products. The bill allows USDA to reduce milk prices based on national average production costs to address excess production. Price reductions would apply to farms that increased production, with collected funds used to offset purchasing excess milk products. The change to a cost-of-production basis implies higher prices for dairy farmers initially, helping more farms cover costs, with adjustments falling on all farmers during oversupply. Small farms, not increasing production, would benefit, and new farmers are exempt from price reductions in case of excess milk production. The bill allows USDA to reduce milk prices based on national average production costs to address excess production. Price reductions would apply to farms that increased production, with collected funds used to offset purchasing excess milk products. The long-term competitiveness and stability of the U.S. dairy industry could be at risk due to limitations on USDA to make adjustments, potentially leading to continued excess milk production. The National Farmers Organization is promoting a Cooperative Marketing Initiative (CMI) to improve farm milk prices by setting national production levels and target prices for profitable milk production. Excess milk production would incur penalties, redistributed to producers who did not exceed their allocation. The \"Ration-all Milk Pricing Program\" proposes penalties for excess milk production, which would be redistributed to producers who did not exceed their allocation. Supporters believe it would address changes in the dairy industry, while opponents argue that implementation would be challenging due to potential offsetting actions by non-cooperative producers or lax enforcement. The program, developed by a dairy nutrition consultant and supported by some farmers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, sets the farm milk price based on historical production levels and average prices, with the remaining milk priced through bids from processors. The proposed \"Ration-all Milk Pricing Program\" would set milk prices based on bids from processors, with only 10% of a producer's output based on current prices. Supporters believe this would reduce price volatility and encourage supply adjustments to match demand. Opponents argue that the blend price may not incentivize supply adjustments during times of falling prices. The Dairy Industry Advisory Committee (DIAC) approved its final report to the Secretary of Agriculture on March 3, 2011. The report offers 23 specific recommendations to address dairy farm profitability and milk price volatility issues. Members were selected from various sectors of the dairy industry. The Dairy Industry Advisory Committee (DIAC) approved its final report to the Secretary of Agriculture on March 3, 2011. The report offers 23 specific recommendations to address dairy farm profitability and milk price volatility issues. An asterisk (*) following the item number denotes dissenting votes among committee members. Recommendations include developing an information system for farm profitability assessment, reviewing federal milk marketing orders, simplifying risk management products, promoting efficient use of USDA's Farm Loan Program, and developing triggers for the Secretary's choices. The Dairy Industry Advisory Committee approved 23 recommendations to address dairy farm profitability and milk price volatility. Recommendations include developing triggers for the Secretary's choices, exploring elimination of certain programs to enhance producer safety nets, and adopting a federal growth management program. The committee was divided over the recommendation for a USDA-sponsored credit mechanism for first buyers of milk. The Dairy Industry Advisory Committee approved 23 recommendations to address dairy farm profitability and milk price volatility. Recommendations include modifying the Milk Income Loss Contract Program, creating tax-deferred savings accounts for dairy farm operators, supporting competitive marketing structures, expanding programs like the Market Access Program, and exploring the impacts of somatic cell count regulations. The Dairy Industry Advisory Committee approved 23 recommendations to address dairy farm profitability and milk price volatility, including supporting dairy descriptors only on products made from milk, increasing incentive payments for environmental practices, and phasing out the blender's credit and tariff on imported ethanol. They also recommended creating programs for value-added opportunities, eradicating bovine tuberculosis and Johne's disease, and giving dairy farmers preference in grant programs for energy audits and infrastructure development. Authorization for dairy programs will expire in 2012, except for federal milk marketing orders, which are permanently authorized. Financial stress in 2009 led to interest in addressing price volatility and federal dairy programs. Proposals in this report may be considered as dairy policy discussions continue. The fate of these proposals will depend on economic conditions, consensus among dairy interests, and budget constraints. A bill (S. 459) introduced in March 2011 aims to maintain certain parameters of dairy programs like MILC or countercyclical dairy program. The report will be updated with additional proposals."
