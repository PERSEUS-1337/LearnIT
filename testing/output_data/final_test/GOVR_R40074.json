President Clinton organized the first Summit of the Americas in 1994 in Miami, attended by all democratically elected leaders in the region except Fidel Castro. The leaders approved a Plan of Action focused on strengthening democracy and promoting economic integration through free trade. The Miami Summit in 1994 focused on promoting prosperity through economic integration and free trade in the Americas. Subsequent Summits introduced new initiatives, such as the agreement to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005. Special Summits in Bolivia and Chile addressed environmental issues and education, respectively. The Santiago Summit in 1998 focused on education and initiated negotiations over the FTAA. The Quebec City Summit in 2001 produced a commitment to democracy, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and a preliminary draft of the FTAA. The Monterrey Summit in 2004 reaffirmed the region's commitment to implementing the Quebec City Plan of Action. The Summit of the Americas process has been institutionalized by the Organization of American States. The fourth Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina in November 2005 focused on creating jobs, but debate centered around the FTAA negotiations. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela led opposition to the proposal, supported by Mercosur countries like Brazil and Argentina. They argued against U.S. agricultural subsidies and called for talks to resume after the conclusion of the World Trade Organization's negotiations. The Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina in November 2005 focused on FTAA negotiations. Talks were opposed by some countries, led by Venezuela, who argued for resuming discussions after the WTO's Doha Development Round. The Inter-American Democratic Charter was highlighted as a political achievement, affirming the region's commitment to democracy. The Inter-American Democratic Charter has been invoked in response to challenges to democracy in the region, such as the attempted coup against President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela in 2002 and the removal of President Lucio Guttierez from office by Ecuador's Congress in 2005. The Summits have also led to economic initiatives, including a commitment to reduce remittance transfer costs by 50% by 2008, resulting in a significant decrease in transaction costs and allowing more funds to reach recipient families. The United States played a key role in reducing remittance costs through promoting competition, eliminating regulations, and adopting new technology. The cost of sending remittances between the United States and Mexico has decreased by 50%, with the US partnering with countries like Guatemala to achieve similar reductions. Social programs initiated at the Summits of the Americas, such as providing anti-retroviral therapy to people with HIV/AIDS, have been successful. Funding from various initiatives has helped over 640,000 people in the region receive treatment, surpassing the initial goal set at the Declaration of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The U.S. government allocated significant funding for HIV/AIDS programs in the hemisphere between 2001 and 2007, increasing from $22 million to over $153 million. The Summits of the Americas process has faced criticism for lack of transparency and exclusivity, with civil society groups advocating for more open discussions. Many civil society groups criticize the Summits of the Americas for promoting corporate power over social welfare, environmental protection, and citizens' rights. The Summits have been faulted for producing ambitious documents with little follow-through on previous commitments, lacking criteria for measuring implementation, and lacking enforcement mechanisms. Additionally, many countries lack the capacity, will, or resources to implement the initiatives introduced. Many countries struggle to implement Summit commitments due to organizational capacity, political will, and financial resources. This has raised doubts about the effectiveness of the Summit process in achieving tangible results in the Americas. The division among countries and the rejection of proposals like the FTAA talks at the Mar del Plata Summit suggest a growing skepticism towards continuing the Summit of the Americas process. The Mar del Plata Summit showed a shift away from neoliberal economic policies in Latin America, with a majority preferring state solutions over market solutions. Analysts suggest the US focus on bilateral agreements with countries still committed to free trade. The fifth Summit of the Americas took place in 2009 in Trinidad and Tobago. The 2009 Summit of the Americas in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, was attended by all 34 democratically elected leaders of the hemisphere, including President Obama and several other leaders. The theme was \"Securing our citizens' future by promoting human prosperity, energy security, and environmental sustainability.\" Cuba, under its communist government, was the only country not invited due to its lack of democracy. The 2005 Mar del Plata Summit was marked by protests and confrontations, leading to increased isolation of the United States in the region. By 2008, only 58% of Latin Americans viewed the U.S. favorably, with Venezuela and Bolivia expelling U.S. Ambassadors. Regional bodies like the Rio Group and UNASUR gained more influence, while the OAS lost power. Ahead of the Summit, some leaders expressed disagreements with the U.S. and planned to confront President Obama. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela attended to defend regional integration. President Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela attended the Summit to defend Caribbean and Latin American integration, criticize the U.S. blockade of Cuba, and call for a new U.S. policy towards Cuba. He also hosted a meeting of ALBA countries who decided not to sign the Summit's Declaration of Commitment. Many regional leaders blamed the U.S. for the global financial crisis and called for a new approach towards Cuba. Despite divisions and low expectations, observers warned President Obama to avoid turning the Summit into a political circus. Despite challenges, analysts were optimistic about the Summit due to specific targets in the Port of Spain Draft Declaration of Commitment. President Obama's attendance was seen as a way to improve US relations in Latin America. Several leaders expressed hope for better ties with the US after his election. In July 2008, the Summit Implementation Review Group issued a Draft Declaration of Commitment for the Port of Spain Summit, which proposed 65 commitments under six themes. Negotiations continued, resulting in a final Declaration with 96 commitments, but some observers criticized it as largely meaningless. The final Declaration at the Port of Spain Summit was criticized as largely meaningless by some observers. Despite changes made in hopes of consensus, some countries refused to sign, citing issues like the international financial crisis and Cuba's reintegration. Prime Minister Patrick Manning of Trinidad and Tobago signed on behalf of all countries present. The Declaration reaffirmed support for past commitments to reduce poverty and child labor, with new goals including reducing business start-up times to 30 days by 2015. The national commitments include reducing business start-up times to 30 days by 2015, incorporating surveillance of non-communicable diseases, reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission, achieving universal primary education, increasing secondary education enrollment to 75% by 2010, and tertiary education enrollment to at least 40% by 2020. The energy security section aims to develop cleaner, more affordable, and sustainable energy systems in the Americas. The Declaration emphasizes the exchange of information, technologies, and best practices for managing extractive sectors sustainably. Countries commit to stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations and working towards a global agreement on Climate Change. The Declaration encourages strengthening domestic environmental planning and capacity building. The Declaration focuses on improving domestic environmental planning, preparing for natural disasters, and enhancing public security by cooperating to combat terrorist and criminal organizations. It reaffirms support for the Inter-American Convention against Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms and encourages a hemispheric strategy to address criminal gangs. The nations of the Americas also reaffirm commitments to regional democratic initiatives and aim to conclude negotiations on various agreements. The Declaration emphasizes the importance of finalizing negotiations on key initiatives like the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Inter-American Convention against Racism. It also calls for reforms to the Summit of the Americas process, including holding the Summits regularly every three years and providing annual progress reports. Additionally, the Declaration encourages increased participation of civil society and business to improve Summit effectiveness. President Obama proposed an \"Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas\" at the Summit, aiming to enhance regional cooperation for energy efficiency, renewable energy investment, and greenhouse gas reduction. The partnership, initially conceived during the 2008 U.S. electoral campaign, is now a flexible framework for countries to suggest cooperation ideas with the U.S. on energy issues. This aligns with goals of the Declaration of Commitment of Port of Spain and proposals in the Western Hemisphere Energy Compact. President Obama introduced a $100 million \"Microfinance Growth Fund for the Western Hemisphere\" at the Summit to help regional microfinance institutions facing finance constraints due to the international financial crisis. The fund aims to provide stable medium and longer-term finance to rebuild their lending capacities. The fund partners, including MIF, OPIC, and IIC, aim to provide $100 million in initial capital and raise a total of $250 million through public-private partnerships. President Obama announced a $30 million initiative to strengthen cooperation with Caribbean countries on security issues, including transnational crime and drug trafficking. President Obama pledged to reduce U.S. demand for drugs and stop the flow of guns and cash to the region. He declared ratifying CIFTA a priority and aimed for an equal partnership with countries in the hemisphere. The Summit of the Americas improved U.S. relations with the region, with a focus on mutual respect and cooperation with UNASUR, SICA, and CARICOM leaders. President Obama's engagement with leaders like President Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela at the Summit of the Americas was well-received in Latin America, despite criticism. The Summit was praised as the beginning of a new era in hemispheric relations, with some concrete steps taken to build on the goodwill generated. Continued engagement will be crucial to address significant policy differences. Policy differences persist, and ongoing engagement is essential for maintaining stronger hemispheric relations."
