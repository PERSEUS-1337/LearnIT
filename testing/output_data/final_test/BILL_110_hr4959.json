    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act of 2008\". The definition section is included. The Act, known as the \"Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act of 2008\", defines a \"long-term security, economic, or political agreement with the Government of Iraq\" as any commitment lasting more than one year made by the President or executive branch of the US government with Iraq. This includes basing US Armed Forces in Iraq, defending Iraq's government, providing security assurances, training Iraqi Security Forces, economic and diplomatic arrangements. Congress has the power to regulate commerce, support the military, and make rules for its regulation. The President is the Commander in Chief and can make treaties with Senate approval. The North Atlantic Treaty created NATO. The NATO treaty was established on August 24, 1949, with Senate approval for each additional country. The Mutual Defense Treaty with South Korea and the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security with Japan also had Senate approval before entering into force. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates mentioned a long-term presence in Iraq similar to the model in Korea. On November 26, 2007, President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed a \"Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America\", outlining parameters for negotiation in security, economic, political, diplomatic, and cultural spheres. The Declaration includes supporting Iraq's democratic system against threats, providing security assurances, and assisting in training and equipping Iraqi forces. On November 26, 2007, Lieutenant General Douglas E. Lute stated that negotiations under the Declaration of Principles with Iraq will not lead to a formal treaty, aiming to conclude negotiations by July 2008. SEC. 4. CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS. Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and other necessary officials will consult with specified congressional committees on potential long-term agreements with Iraq regarding security, economic, or political matters. The committees include the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations and Committee on Armed Services, as well as the House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Armed Services. Consultations with specified congressional committees, Senators, and Members of the House of Representatives are required for agreements with Iraq, ensuring transparency in security, economic, and political arrangements. These consultations must continue throughout the negotiation period. SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Congress believes that Iraqi sovereignty and control over its territories, armed forces, and institutions are crucial for the United States. Any agreement with Iraq that is not a treaty ratified by the Senate does not have the force of law. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON THE USE OF FUNDS: No funds from Congress can be used for any long-term agreement with Iraq unless it is a treaty ratified by the Senate."
