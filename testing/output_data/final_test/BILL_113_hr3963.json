    "content": "The \"Federal Leadership in Energy Efficient Transportation Act of 2014\" or the \"FLEET Act\" aims to upgrade the vehicle fleet of the United States Postal Service to improve mail delivery services, reduce costs, maximize fuel economy, and reduce emissions. It also allows the Postal Service to enter into energy savings performance contracts. Section 804(4) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include provisions for the United States Postal Service to purchase or lease low emission and fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as upgrade existing vehicles to increase fuel economy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include provisions for the United States Postal Service to purchase or lease low emission vehicles and upgrade infrastructure for electric vehicle charging stations. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include provisions for the United States Postal Service to upgrade its fleet. The Postmaster General must develop guidelines for Postal Service vehicles to comply with emissions and fuel economy standards set by the EPA and NHTSA. The standards for emissions of carbon dioxide and fuel economy set by the EPA and NHTSA apply to contracted vehicles and those purchased or leased by the Postal Service. The Postmaster General must reduce petroleum consumption by 2% annually in the Postal fleet until fiscal year 2025. A cost-benefit analysis will determine if replacing vehicles in the fleet is more beneficial than maintaining them. Delivery routes will be reviewed to assess the feasibility of replacing vehicles used on those routes. The Postmaster General must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of the Act, detailing a plan to increase fuel economy and reduce emissions in the Postal fleet. Annual reports must also track progress in meeting fuel economy targets and any changes to delivery routes or vehicle purchase strategies. The Postmaster General is restricted from reducing mail delivery frequency to less than 6 days a week, closing post offices or distribution facilities, impacting collective bargaining agreements or employee benefits, and outsourcing duties to private companies that are currently performed by bargaining unit employees.
