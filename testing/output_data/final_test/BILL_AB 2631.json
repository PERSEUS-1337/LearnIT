    "title": "AB 2631",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 11450. Aid shall be paid for each needy family, including eligible siblings and parents of the children, but not unborn children or recipients under Chapter 3. The family's income for the prospective semiannual period shall be deducted from the specified sum, adjusted for cost-of-living increases. The amount of aid paid for each month shall not exceed the specified sum. The amount of aid paid for each month shall not exceed the specified sum as adjusted for cost-of-living increases and any special needs. The maximum aid for eligible needy persons in the same home ranges from $326 for one person to $1,403 for 10 or more people. The amounts may be adjusted based on changes in government contributions, but will not be subject to further adjustments. The specified sums for aid will not be adjusted for cost of living for certain fiscal years and no further reductions will be made. Aid will be paid to a pregnant child under 18 if the family does not include a needy child qualified for aid. Verification of pregnancy is required for eligibility. A pregnant woman may receive aid if the family does not have a needy child eligible for assistance. Verification of pregnancy is necessary for eligibility. This provision is applicable only when the Cal-Learn Program is in effect. Pregnant women qualified for aid under the Cal-Learn Program may receive $47 per month to meet special needs resulting from pregnancy. County welfare departments must refer recipients to the Women, Infants, and Children program. If the payment is considered income under federal law in the first five months of pregnancy, it does not apply except for the month of anticipated birth and the three months prior. Children receiving AFDC-FC are paid an amount each month to reach a specified rate, in addition to being eligible for special needs as per departmental regulations. The family receiving AFDC-FC is entitled to an allowance for recurring special needs not common to most recipients, such as special diets recommended by a physician and unusual costs like transportation and utilities. The allowance per family per month is calculated by multiplying ten dollars by the number of eligible recipients. Additionally, after exhausting liquid resources over $100, excluding funds in a restricted account, the family can receive an allowance for special needs. An allowance for special needs is granted for clothing, household equipment, and emergency housing caused by sudden circumstances beyond the family's control. The department sets the allowance for each item, not exceeding $600 per event. Homeless families seeking shelter can receive assistance if they are eligible under this chapter. Temporary shelter assistance is available to homeless families apparently eligible for aid. Apparent eligibility is determined based on evidence provided by the applicant or available to the county welfare department. Alien applicants without verification of eligible status or women without eligible children and no medical verification of pregnancy are not considered apparently eligible. A family is considered homeless if they lack a fixed residence, stay in a shelter, or are facing eviction due to financial hardship. They must show that the eviction is due to circumstances beyond their control. Special needs benefit of $65 a day for families of up to four members for temporary shelter, with additional members receiving $15 per day. County welfare departments can increase the amount for shelter as needed. The special needs benefit for homeless families is granted immediately upon application, available for up to three days. The county welfare department verifies homelessness within three days and extends benefits for up to 30 days in one-week increments for housing search. The special needs benefit for homeless families includes documentation of a housing search form and good cause for extensions beyond the three-day limit. Good cause may involve unsuccessful efforts to secure permanent housing while receiving temporary shelter benefits. A special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance can cover last month's rent, security deposits, or rent arrearages to prevent eviction. The special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance covers last month's rent, security deposits, or rent arrearages to prevent eviction, not exceeding 80% of the family's total monthly household income. Additionally, it can also cover standard costs of deposits for utilities necessary for the family's health and safety. A family presenting evidence of permanent housing availability must receive payment or denial of housing assistance within one working day. Families affected by natural disasters are eligible for temporary and permanent homeless assistance. Eligibility for housing assistance is based on homelessness caused by domestic violence, verified medical illness excluding addiction or stress, or uninhabitability of previous residence due to uncontrollable circumstances. Verification is required by a third-party agency, except for domestic violence which can be verified by a victim's sworn statement. Recipients of domestic violence assistance must be informed of counseling services and referred upon request. The county reviews and offers additional services to recipients seeking homeless assistance due to domestic violence if they have previously received homeless avoidance services. The county welfare department must report necessary data to the department regarding all recipients of aid under this program. The county welfare departments and other entities involved in the CalWORKs program have the right to refunds from payments for permanent housing. Families can use refunds for moving costs in emergencies. Payments for temporary shelter and housing are made on behalf of families. The daily amount for temporary shelter special needs benefit can be increased if authorized by the Budget Act. The department will establish rules for statewide application of housing benefits. Applicants and recipients will be informed of available benefits through a standardized form. Payments under Section 11453.1 will not affect the payment schedule or count as income for aid recipients. Children receiving Kin-GAP will be paid a monthly amount in addition to their income. Counties must implement semiannual reporting by October 1, 2013, and provide certification to the director. This section will be effective on July 1, 2015. The section will become operative on July 1, 2015. No appropriation shall be made for this act. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
