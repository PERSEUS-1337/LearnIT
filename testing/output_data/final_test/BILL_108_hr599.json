    "content": "TITLE X--SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT. This section amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a new title for school infrastructure improvement, starting with findings. The Congress acknowledges the need for significant investment in school infrastructure, with an estimated $200 billion required for repairs and upgrades. Currently, the Federal expenditure per student is only 23 cents, but an appropriation of $22 billion would increase this to $417 per student per fiscal year. According to a 1991 survey by the American Association of School Administrators, 74% of public school buildings need replacement, with many built before World War II. Schools in poor urban areas with high minority populations struggle to secure funds for necessary repairs, impacting student health and learning. According to research, student achievement and behavior are affected by school building conditions and overcrowding. Schools in central cities and with over 50% minority populations lack modern technology and access to the information superhighway. Old buildings often have inadequate facilities like libraries and science labs. Overcrowded schools with inadequate facilities and outdated equipment negatively impact student learning. Students in crowded classrooms score lower on exams and face disruptions in classroom activities and instructional techniques. This overcrowding also leads to early lunch periods, lack of lockers, and disorderly behavior in hallways and restrooms. School modernization for information technology is crucial for education in the coming CyberCivilization. The General Accounting Office reports that many schools lack modern technology, hindering students' access to 21st-century education. Computer literacy should be viewed as essential as reading, writing, and arithmetic. Investing in school construction is vital for the national economy and security, as well-equipped schools will produce students who contribute to the strength of the American economy and ensure well-prepared Armed Forces. The shortage of qualified information technology workers is escalating, leading to the recruitment of foreign workers in America. Military manpower shortages in operating high tech equipment are acute in the Navy and increasing in other branches of the Armed Forces. The purpose of this title is to provide Federal funds for local educational agencies to finance construction, repair, and modernization of school facilities for information technology. Federal assistance is in the form of grants. The Secretary will make grants to State educational agencies for the construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization of elementary and secondary schools' information technology. The allocation of funds to each State will be based on the number of school-age children in the State compared to the total number in all States. To receive a grant for school construction projects, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with specified allocation methods and project selection procedures. The State must ensure that the construction is done economically and not extravagantly. When approving projects for funding under this title, the State educational agency considers the safety of students, the need for construction or renovation based on facility condition, the age of the facility, and eligibility for education technology assistance. In approving projects for funding under this title, the State educational agency ensures that public charter schools are eligible for assistance on the same terms as other local educational agencies. Grants to local educational agencies may cover the total cost of facility construction, renovation, or modernization for information technology. \"SEC. 10004. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\" The Secretary must ensure that laborers and mechanics on projects assisted under this title are paid prevailing wages and work no more than 40 hours per week, with overtime pay required. The Secretary has the authority to waive these requirements in certain cases. The Secretary may credit educational institutions for construction cost savings if laborers or mechanics volunteer their services without full compensation to lower costs. The text defines \"school\" as structures for teaching students and \"State\" as including US states and DC. It authorizes $3 billion for fiscal year 2003 and the following 4 years for this purpose."
