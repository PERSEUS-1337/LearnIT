    "content": "The Runaway and Homeless Youth program, established by the Runaway Youth Act, provides assistance to youth under age 23 who are homeless or have run away. It includes three components: the Basic Center program (BCP) for youth under 18, the Transitional Living program (TLP) for youth ages 16-22, and the Street Outreach program (SOP) for sexual abuse prevention. The Street Outreach program (SOP) under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act serves unstably housed youth on the streets. FY2015 appropriations totaled $114.1 million. Legislation in the 114th Congress aims to reauthorize the Act. This report discusses federal efforts to end youth homelessness and issues relevant to reauthorization, including demographic data, program effectiveness, family connections, funding access, and support for vulnerable youth. The report discusses federal efforts to address youth homelessness, including funding access, support for vulnerable populations like LGBTQ youth and sex trafficking victims, and interactions with child welfare and juvenile justice systems. It also outlines proposed accountability standards for the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was the first law to provide dedicated funding for runaway youth, establishing three programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth program to serve vulnerable youth populations. The Runaway and Homeless Youth program consists of three programs - Basic Center program (BCP), Transitional Living program (TLP), and Street Outreach program (SOP) - that target youth under 18, youth ages 16-21, and runaway/homeless youth on the streets. BCP grants are based on child population, TLP provides longer-term residential services, and SOP offers counseling and referrals. The program also includes a toll-free hotline, grants for rural communities, research, evaluations, and training. The Runaway and Homeless Youth program, administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau, includes three programs targeting youth under 18, ages 16-21, and those on the streets. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 reauthorized the program through FY2013, amending provisions on funding, grantee requirements, and program accountability. The law mandated HHS to establish performance standards for grantees and conduct an incidence and prevalence study of runaway youth. The 2003 reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act required HHS to submit an incidence and prevalence study of homeless youth to Congress. HHS must consult with USICH in developing the study, and GAO to evaluate the application process for BCP, TLP, and SOP. Efforts have been made by Congress and the Obama Administration to address youth homelessness, including reports and strategies to end youth homelessness by 2020. The report submitted to Congress in 2007 by HHS, in collaboration with USICH, highlighted the lack of research on effective interventions for homeless youth. It incorporated information from related fields on interventions for high-risk youth, emphasizing the challenges and the need for multifaceted approaches to address youth homelessness. The report emphasizes policy options to prevent and end youth homelessness, including targeted education and support services for high-risk families, enhanced services for youth transitioning from juvenile justice and foster care systems, a continuum of services from \"gateway\" to long-term housing, and coordination of programs for homeless youth. USICH is mentioned as a coordinating body for these efforts. USICH, a federal agency established by the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, is tasked with developing a National Strategic Plan to End Homelessness. The plan, titled Opening Doors, aims to end chronic homelessness by 2015, homelessness among veterans by 2015, and homelessness for families, youth, and children by 2020. In 2012, USICH amended Opening Doors to focus on improving educational outcomes for children and youth. Strategies for preventing and ending youth homelessness include obtaining comprehensive information, building evidence for effective interventions, and improving access to emergency assistance and housing for underserved youth groups. An interagency working group developed the Framework to End Youth Homelessness by 2020, focusing on data collection and capacity strengthening. The Framework to End Youth Homelessness by 2020 includes prevention strategies and a capacity strategy to improve outcomes for youth in stable housing, connections, education/employment, and well-being. The report also discusses issues relevant to the reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, such as demographic information on homeless youth and program considerations. The section provides background on federal efforts to estimate homeless and runaway youth, program outcomes, funding for the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, and serving vulnerable populations. Congress may need to assess HHS's data reporting efforts, the act's direction to HHS on data collection with HUD, and funding allocation. Estimates of homeless and runaway youth demographics are complex and rely on various factors such as counting methods and definitions used. Data on these youth populations are outdated, and there are concerns over the lack of current information. Funding may need to be reallocated for studies to improve data collection. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 addressed concerns about data on runaway and homeless youth by requiring HHS to prepare a report to Congress with estimates of the youth population and their characteristics. This includes conducting surveys and interviews with homeless youth to gather information on their socioeconomic characteristics and barriers to obtaining housing and services. The 2008 Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act required HHS to prepare a report for Congress estimating the youth population and their characteristics, including socioeconomic factors and barriers to housing and services. The act authorized funding for studies from FY2009 to FY2013, with a focus on collecting data on homeless youth through surveys and interviews. The USICH framework for ending youth homelessness includes a data strategy with components such as improving counting methods and coordinating federal data systems. USICH is working on better data collection for youth homelessness through national studies and periodic estimates to advocate for resources and tailor support to their specific needs. HUD requires communities to conduct point-in-time counts to gather information on the number and characteristics of homeless youth. HUD requires communities to conduct point-in-time counts to collect information on individuals and families experiencing homelessness on a single day in January every other year. These counts are different from HMIS data and are used to track trends in eliminating homelessness, including unaccompanied youth under 18. Since 2013, HUD has mandated that PIT counts include unsheltered youth under 25 who meet the homeless definition. CoCs must identify the number of youth aged 18-24 separately. Previously, these youth were grouped with young adults aged 18-30. PIT counts can capture data on youth in homeless programs and those who do not interact with service providers. HUD has mandated that PIT counts include unsheltered youth under 25 who meet the homeless definition. CoCs must identify the number of youth aged 18-24 separately and coordinate with various entities for a comprehensive count of children and youth experiencing homelessness. HUD mandates that PIT counts include unsheltered youth under 25 who meet the homeless definition. CoCs are encouraged to recruit homeless youth for assistance, hold \"magnet events\" with incentives, survey locations multiple times, and use social media for outreach. USICH provided technical assistance to nine communities to improve data collection on homeless youth during the 2013 PIT. The CoC agency led the Youth Count in nine communities, partnering with stakeholders including homeless youth service providers. Congress may consider specifying HHS and RHY grantees' roles in HUD's point-in-time counts during the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act reauthorization. HHS and HUD coordinated data collection systems for homeless youth programs, integrating NEO-RHYMIS with HMIS. Data on youth served in BCP and TLP, and contacts made in SOP, were collected from grantees via NEO-RHYMIS until FY2015. The data system collected information on youth demographics, services received, and status upon exiting programs. RHY grantees now report to HMIS, a data system for homeless individuals. HUD uses HMIS data to estimate national homelessness levels in the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report. The HMIS provides detailed data on individuals and households experiencing homelessness nationwide. HUD updated data elements in HMIS in 2013 and released new data standards in 2014. These standards aim to guide HMIS vendors and administrators in collecting data that meets federal program requirements, including the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. New elements include income and health insurance status. The HMIS updated data elements in 2013 and released new standards in 2014 to guide data collection for federal programs like the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. The new data elements include income, health insurance status, disabilities, commercial sexual exploitation risk, family reunification, employment status, program referrals, and transitional plans for youth. RHY grantees were required to report to HMIS by April 15, 2015. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) informed Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees about the initiative to merge HMIS and HHS data systems. Approximately half of the grantees surveyed are HUD grantees who enter data into both systems. Merging the systems may help assess youth homelessness better and reduce data input burden for grantees. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act requires BCP and TLP providers to submit information to HHS about the youth they serve. Congress may consider adding guidance on HHS and grantees' involvement in new data collection. The Federal Framework to End Youth Homelessness includes a plan for a national study to estimate the number and characteristics of homeless youth. UISCH and federal partners aim to estimate youth homelessness prevalence and characteristics over time, pending funding availability. HHS has requested funds for a national study on youth homelessness in the budget requests for FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. Legislation in the 114th Congress would authorize $2 million for the study each year from FY2016 to FY2020. The study aims to collect additional data on trafficking victimization and youth identification. S. 262 requires data collection on youth from age 12, excluding LGBT status. It also mandates data on barriers to mental health services and education. Another data collection effort, Voices of Youth Count, aims to capture unaccompanied homeless youth aged 14-24. The literature review and analysis on youth homelessness found that family conflict is a major reason for their situation. Factors such as relationships with step-parents, sexual activity, pregnancy, school problems, and substance abuse contribute to family discord. Exiting youth from programs often cite family dynamics as a significant concern, with a large number expressing this issue in FY2014. The 2007 HHS report emphasized the importance of family relationships in addressing youth homelessness. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act specifies that services should be provided as an alternative to involving youth in the child welfare system, with a focus on contacting parents or relatives for the safe return of the youth. The BCP program focuses on the return of youth to their parents' house, providing counseling and home-based services. Most youth served by BCP grantees receive preventive services like mediation and counseling, with the majority remaining at home. The TLP offers longer-term support for youth aged 16 to 21, with a small percentage returning to live with their parents. The SOP provides services for youth transitioning to independence. The SOP program provides services to youth transitioning to independence, with an emphasis on establishing permanent connections. Regulations require grantees to have plans involving the youth and their family, including contact within 24-72 hours of admission. The extent of family interventions in programs funded under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act has not been fully examined. Family interventions in programs funded under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act are crucial for preventing prolonged episodes of homelessness among youth. Early intervention is key, especially for younger youth and those experiencing their first episode of homelessness. Strategies should focus on improving communication, conflict resolution skills, and understanding adolescent development. The National Alliance to End Homelessness emphasizes the importance of family intervention in preventing and ending homelessness. The organization defines family intervention along a spectrum involving strategies like family reunification, connection, finding, and aftercare services. Examples include support groups and parenting skills classes. One approach is multisystemic therapy (MST) providing intensive, home-based services to empower parents in managing adolescent behavior. MST has shown to reduce antisocial behavior in randomized controlled trials. Another model used by Project Safe, a runaway and homeless youth provider, is promising. The Project Safe program in Washington offers phone consultation, support groups, and a resource library to prevent teen homelessness and improve family functioning. Interventions have shown a decrease in the perception of youth needing to leave home. Some models focus on supporting families with LGBT teens to strengthen family bonds. Reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act may include extending family intervention and reconnection services to participants. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to extend family intervention and reconnection services to Transitional Living Program (TLP) participants. It would allow providers to assess family engagement, reunify youth with their families, and provide counseling to homeless youth involving their families. The legislation also requires TLP applicants to provide counseling to homeless youth and encourage family involvement in counseling. The Family and Youth Services Bureau evaluates grantee programs through onsite reviews conducted by peer reviewers. The monitoring team identifies program strengths and areas needing improvement based on BCP Performance Standards. The HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on new performance standards for Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees. These standards focus on service components and administrative functions, with requirements such as maintaining a 90% exit rate to safe settings for youth. The HHS issued new performance standards for Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees, focusing on service components and administrative functions. Grantees are expected to meet specific outcomes, separate from performance standards and onsite reviews. Outcome data is reported through the NEO-RHYMIS system, with measures including maintaining youth in safe settings and increasing completion rates for TLP services. The FY2014 target for TLP youth participants engaged in community service was 37.6%, with a result of 36.7%. Efforts are being made to evaluate interventions for homeless youth, with a focus on rigorous research design by HHS and Abt Associates. HHS has contracted Abt Associates to evaluate the TLP at select grantee sites, focusing on outcomes of youth participants and identifying promising practices. The study includes an impact evaluation with youth randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The evaluation is expected to conclude in FY2017, while HHS and other federal agencies are working on disseminating an intervention model for homeless youth. The intervention model for assisting homeless youth emphasizes using valid screening tools, evidence-based strategies, culturally appropriate supports, and healing environments. Federal agencies aim to implement and evaluate the model to scale up effective interventions. FYSB has modified requirements for Runaway and Homeless Youth grantees to align with the intervention model. Grantees must use appropriate screening tools, consider youth risk factors in case planning, and receive training on effective practices. HHS grants prioritize research and evaluation in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. The reauthorization process for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act involves examining the effectiveness of programs, prioritizing certain types of projects, and evaluating the outcomes of the Transitional Living Program (TLP). Approximately one-third of youth completed the TLP in FY2014. The process may also involve considering the role of evaluations and setting goals for the program. In FY2014, one-third of youth completed the Transitional Living Program (TLP). The remaining two-thirds did not complete the program for various reasons, including other opportunities, no plans, or being expelled. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs serve only a fraction of the estimated 1 million homeless youth. The BCP serves 32,000 to 52,000 youth annually, while the TLP serves 3,000 to 4,400 youth annually. In FY2012, there were an average of 10 beds per BCP grantee, totaling 3,102 beds across all grantees. In FY2012, there were 10 beds per BCP grantee, totaling 3,102 beds across all grantees. In FY2013, there were 11 beds per TLP grantee, totaling 1,635 beds across all grantees. Between 7,000 and 11,000 young people were turned away each year from the BCP and TLP, with the most in FY2010. Advocates recommend increased funding for the Runaway and Homeless Youth program to meet the needs of this population. Advocates recommend increasing funding to $300 million for the Homeless Youth program. Funding levels for FY2011 through FY2015 are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3 displays funding trends from FY2001 through FY2014. In real dollars, funding ranged from $110 million in FY2013 to $114 million in FY2014. Providers of services to homeless youth may have limited access to funding from the Continuum of Care program. Local communities, part of Continuums of Care (CoCs), establish advisory boards to address homelessness. CoCs provide funding for homeless youth providers, covering prevention, shelter, housing, and supportive services. HUD distributes funds through annual competitions based on local priorities and strategies. CoCs receive funding based on a formula or Annual Renewal Demand (ARD) amount. Project applicants serving the homeless submit applications through the CoC lead entity. HUD sets criteria for funded projects annually. CoC funds can be used for homeless youth. Funding announcement for FY2015 allows CoCs to earn points in the application process. In FY2015, HUD introduced a priority for addressing youth homelessness in the CoC program competition. CoCs can earn points for serving homeless youth, including strategies for unaccompanied homeless youth and addressing exploitation. Points are awarded for increasing the number of homeless youth served. In FY2015, HUD prioritized addressing youth homelessness in the CoC program competition by awarding points for serving homeless youth, including unaccompanied homeless youth. CoCs must demonstrate an increase in serving homeless youth, collaborate with education authorities, and show participation in each other's meetings. The majority of CoC program funds are used to renew existing grants. The CoC program allows for reallocation of funds to benefit homeless youth, including creating new permanent supportive housing projects. HUD encourages CoCs to partner with Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees for better coordination in serving homeless youth. The CoC program emphasizes the need for collaboration with schools, child welfare agencies, and juvenile justice systems to better serve homeless youth. RHY providers can participate in the CoC process by rating local applications for funding, improving the chances of funding for youth services. Collaboration with CoC is crucial for funding youth services. Strong, collaborative applications have higher chances of winning awards. RHY providers can partner with homeless service providers to target young adults under 25. HHS encourages grantees to work with CoCs to end youth homelessness. The National Alliance to End Homelessness suggests HHS should incentivize collaboration. The HHS should encourage and incentivize coordination with CoCs to address youth homelessness, especially for vulnerable groups like LGBTQ youth, those in foster care or the juvenile justice system, and youth who are sex trafficked. Opening Doors in 2012 highlighted the importance of supporting these groups. Policymakers should consider the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to strengthen assistance for these populations. LGBTQ youth are disproportionately represented in the homeless population, with 20% to 40% identifying as gay or lesbian in studies. A survey of organizations serving homeless youth found that LGBTQ youth make up about 40% of their clients, with many running away due to family rejection of their sexual orientation or gender identity. However, 40% of providers do not offer services addressing this key factor contributing to LGBTQ youth homelessness. Efforts are being made to address barriers in serving LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness, including lack of funding, difficulty in identifying the population, and a lack of information and training. FYSB is providing funding to build the capacity of organizations in serving LGBTQ youth, focusing on developing innovative intervention strategies and culturally appropriate tools. Efforts are being made to address barriers in serving LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness, including lack of funding, difficulty in identifying the population, and a lack of information and training. HHS's proposed regulations for the program specify that grantees must provide training sensitive to the \"complex social identities\" of youth, including gender identity and sexual orientation. Congress may consider whether reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act should include provisions for LGBTQ youth issues, such as requiring nondiscrimination policies and targeted training. The model state statute developed by ABA/NN4Y aims to ensure homeless youth service providers adopt inclusive, nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ youth, including guidance on gender identity and expression. Research suggests HHS could offer more training and assistance for serving LGBTQ youth effectively, especially in areas lacking local resources. The 2014 study funded by HHS identified the need for specific models and training on LGBTQ issues for RHY providers. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to amend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to include nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This would require providers to offer comparable services to individuals who cannot participate in sex-specific programming. Runaway youth are at high risk of sex trafficking. Runaway youth are vulnerable to sex trafficking and sexual exploitation due to their lack of resources and inability to go home. A study in 1999 found that 1.7 million youth under 18 had run away, with 2.2% experiencing sexual assault or engaging in sexual activities for basic needs. The Dallas Police Department noted a strong link between sex trafficking and runaway status. Research in cities like Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco shows that many prostituted women were once runaways. The majority of prostituted women in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco were runaways. Shelter and services for trafficked victims transitioning from prostitution are limited. In 2012, organizations reported capacity to provide specialized services for 1,684 child victims and shelter for 226, but this may only reach a fraction of those in need. The President's Interagency Task Force on trafficking coordinated a strategic plan for victim services in the United States. The strategic plan for victim services in the United States includes runaway and homeless youth providers as part of the response to sex trafficking. Amendments to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in 1994 specified a role for providers in addressing youth sexual exploitation through programs like the Street Outreach program. These programs aim to offer street-based services to youth at risk of sexual abuse, prostitution, or exploitation. Runaway and homeless youth providers play a role in addressing youth sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking victims. These providers offer immediate support and longer-term placements to boys and transgendered youth. However, their capacity to respond to the needs of sex trafficking victims is limited due to lack of intensive services and time restrictions imposed by funding sources. Recognizing signs of sex trafficking and retaining victims in these settings can be challenging. The federal strategic plan calls for greater supports for Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) providers in aiding victims of trafficking. Providers need training to identify trafficking victims and provide appropriate services. HHS is working on efforts to prepare RHY providers in responding, collaborating with the FBI on initiatives to recover victims of child sex trafficking. Grantees have developed standards for working with trafficking victims and provided training and assistance to other grantees. HHS/ACF awarded funding for cooperative agreements to implement projects providing case management and victim assistance to domestic victims of severe trafficking. Case management includes service plan development, counseling, monitoring client progress, and protecting clients' rights. Direct victim assistance involves tailored service plans. Congress may consider addressing sex trafficking in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to define providers' roles in responding. Some stakeholders suggest replacing the term \"prostitute\" with a term reflecting that youth are forced into sexual acts, aligning with federal trafficking laws treating them as victims. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act expands HHS training priorities to include effects of trafficking on youth and agency-wide strategies for working with sexually exploited runaway and homeless youth. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act expands HHS training priorities to include agency-wide strategies for working with sexually exploited runaway and homeless youth, including victims of sex trafficking. Funding from a Department of Justice block grant under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act can be used to deter domestic child human trafficking. Legislation to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act would make multiple amendments. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (H.R. 1779 and S. 262) proposes amendments to address trafficking by requiring BCP and TLP applicants to develop plans for youth victims of trafficking or sexual exploitation. Youth experiencing homelessness are at higher risk for negative outcomes, and some TLP providers may struggle to serve this population effectively. Stakeholders have raised concerns about providers only serving easier-to-help youth. Stakeholders are concerned that setting high exit rate requirements for safe and appropriate settings in BCP and TLP programs may lead providers to prioritize serving lower-risk youth to meet unrealistic outcome measures, potentially leaving high-risk youth underserved. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act aims to provide services as an alternative to involving youth in law enforcement and child welfare systems. Concerns have been raised about funding and recognition for programs serving youth involved in foster care or juvenile justice. Transitioning youth from these systems are at high risk of becoming homeless. The juvenile justice and foster care systems are vulnerable to youth becoming homeless. Approximately 7% of youth in the BCP have been in foster care, and 6% have been in the juvenile justice system. Around 20% of TLP youth have been in foster care, and nearly 10% have been in the juvenile justice system. Youth who run away often have a history of involvement in the foster care system. States reported that almost 5,000 foster children had a current placement of \"runaway.\" Research suggests a connection between foster care involvement and later episodes of homelessness. Research has shown a link between youth who emancipate from foster care and later episodes of homelessness. Estimates range from 21% to 53% of homeless youth have been in foster care. A study found that over one-third of youth who emancipated from foster care experienced homelessness by age 26. Similarly, juveniles and young adults released from secure detention facilities are at risk of becoming homeless. Homeless adults also have high rates of prior incarceration, including during their youth. Challenges faced by homeless youth include family and living arrangement issues. Young people who are homeless have high involvement with the juvenile justice system. The National Network for Youth advocates for greater financial support for RHY providers. HHS proposed regulations for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program in April 2014, providing guidance on coordinating services for these populations. Grantees are not required to provide services that substitute for those provided by other systems legally responsible for youth under their supervision. The goal is to clarify the demarcation between services provided by different programs. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program faces challenges with funding and coordination with other programs. Grantees are urged to prevent cost displacement and ensure continuous service to youth. Policymakers may need to align the program with child welfare and juvenile justice agencies. CAPTA directs states to address the unique needs of homeless youth. The CAPTA-funded programs and training address the unique needs of unaccompanied homeless youth, providing access to enrollment and support services. HHS is also providing child welfare funding for grants to develop interventions for at-risk youth with a history of child welfare involvement. Grantees can use these funds to test intervention models to help young people transition successfully into adulthood. HHS issued rules specifying performance standards for entities receiving BCP, TLP, and SOP grants. The regulations were developed in consultation with stakeholders in the runaway and homeless youth policy community. A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was issued on April 14, 2014, to implement new performance standards for grantees under the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. The proposed rule includes 10 performance standards outlined in Table A-1. Grantmaking will prioritize providers with a history of demonstrating high performance. The grantmaking process will prioritize providers with a history of high performance under specified standards."
