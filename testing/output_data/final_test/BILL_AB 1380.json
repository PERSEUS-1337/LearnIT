    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10003 of the Corporations Code is amended to include requirements for the articles of incorporation, such as stating the corporation's name, the authorization of the officer forming the corporation, the location of the principal office, and the process for filling vacancies in key positions as per the denomination's rules. Section 10005 is also amended regarding the articles of incorporation. Section 10005 of the Corporations Code is amended to require the articles of incorporation to be signed and verified by the presiding officer forming the corporation and submitted to the Secretary of State for filing. If they comply with the law, the Secretary of State will file them, and upon filing, the corporation sole is formed. The corporation sole is formed upon filing the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State. If the articles do not conform to law, they can be resubmitted with a written opinion from a member of the State Bar of California. The Secretary of State will rely on this opinion to determine if the articles comply with the law. The chief officer of a corporation sole has the authority to amend the articles of incorporation, changing its name, term of existence, territorial jurisdiction, or vacancy filling process. The officer must sign and verify a statement confirming the amendment was authorized by the religious organization governed by the corporation. The corporation sole, a hierarchical religious entity, can amend its articles of incorporation by submitting the amendment to the Secretary of State for filing. The declaration of dissolution for a corporation sole must include its name, reason for dissolution, and the dissolution process. The dissolution of a corporation sole must be authorized by the religious organization governing it, with names and addresses of supervisors provided for winding up affairs. The declaration of dissolution is submitted to the Secretary of State for filing, and upon approval, the date of filing is endorsed. After filing for dissolution, the corporation sole will cease business operations, except for winding up affairs. Any remaining assets will be transferred to the religious organization, trustees, or hierarchical entity overseeing the corporation sole as per the rules of the religious denomination. Upon filing for dissolution, the corporation sole will cease operations and any remaining assets will be transferred to the religious organization or hierarchical entity overseeing it, as decreed by the superior court upon petition by the Attorney General or relevant party."
