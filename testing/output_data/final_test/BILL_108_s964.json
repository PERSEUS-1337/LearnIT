The \"Small Community and Rural Air Service Revitalization Act of 2003\" authorizes funding for the essential air service program and establishes a marketing program to increase passenger usage of airport facilities and reduce subsidy costs. The Secretary of Transportation will establish the marketing program. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a marketing incentive program for essential air service communities to increase passenger boardings and airport facility usage. Airport sponsors may receive a grant of up to $50,000 for developing and implementing a marketing plan. Non-Federal sources must cover at least 25% of the marketing plan costs. The marketing incentive program for essential air service communities aims to increase passenger boardings and airport facility usage. State or local matching contributions cannot come from Federal funds, but proceeds from bond sales can be used as matching contributions. A bonus is given for a 25% increase in usage after a 12-month marketing plan implementation. The marketing incentive program aims to boost passenger boardings and airport facility usage. If there is a 25% increase in usage, only 10% of costs need to come from non-Federal sources. A 50% increase eliminates the need for non-Federal funding. The Secretary of Transportation can provide up to $50,000 in state marketing assistance.

The Secretary of Transportation can provide technical assistance to states for increasing passenger boardings at airport facilities through a marketing incentive program with specific provisions and funding allocations. The Secretary of Transportation will establish pilot programs to improve service for communities receiving essential air service assistance if the authorized amount is fully appropriated. This includes a pilot program for up to 10 communities or consortia to forego essential air service assistance in favor of community flexibility. The Secretary will establish a pilot program for communities to forego essential air service assistance for 10 years in exchange for a grant equal to twice the annual assistance received. Grants can be used for eligible projects on airport property or to improve airport facilities for general aviation. The Secretary will also establish equipment changes. The Secretary will establish a pilot program for up to 10 communities to use smaller equipment for air service, with a focus on passenger safety. Additionally, airport sponsors can participate in alternative services under the program.

Sponsors can also use essential air service subsidy funds for airport-related projects. Additionally, sponsors may elect to terminate participation in the pilot program after 1 year. The Secretary will establish a cost-sharing pilot program for airports serving communities to share the cost of providing air transportation service beyond basic essential air service. Another pilot program will require essential air service communities near hub airports to assume 10 percent of their subsidy costs for three years. The Secretary may designate communities within 100 miles of a hub airport for essential air service subsidy costs for a 3-year period, considering travel time and relevant factors. The Secretary may designate one community per state for essential air service subsidy, with the option for communities to appeal their designation based on financial factors.

The program allows the Secretary to require air carriers to code-share. The Secretary can require air carriers to participate in multiple code-share arrangements to improve air transportation services for up to 10 communities. Essential air service providers must track changes in service, and airport sponsors must submit applications to participate in pilot programs. Community or consortium of communities must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. A conforming amendment is made to the chapter analysis for chapter 417 of the title. SEC. 5. EAS PROGRAM AUTHORITY CHANGES. Rate renegotiation may occur if essential air service providers face significantly increased costs under title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation can adjust compensation rates without contract renegotiation if costs rise by 10% or more monthly. Additionally, any excess funds returned by airport sponsors due to reduced subsidy needs will be handled accordingly.
