    "content": "On October 14, 2011, the House passed the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273) which aimed to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act. The Senate introduced the Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012 (S. 3512) on August 2, 2012. These bills would have established a framework for states to create permit programs for the management of coal combustion residuals. If states did not comply, the EPA would have been required to implement a program. The House passed H.R. 2273 to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act, while the Senate introduced S. 3512 for the management of coal combustion residuals. Both bills aimed to establish state permit programs, with more detailed provisions in the Senate bill. State permit programs for CCR disposal would differ from other programs in RCRA. Legislation addressing CCRs may be considered in the 113th Congress. The 112th Congress proposed creating state programs to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) similar to existing federal-state programs for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. EPA would establish federal regulatory criteria for MSW landfills, which states would adopt and implement through permit programs. EPA would approve state permit programs to ensure compliance with federal criteria to protect human health and the environment. This approach lacked an explicit mandate for EPA. The 112th Congress proposed state programs to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) similar to existing federal-state programs for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The approach lacked an explicit mandate for EPA to enforce regulatory criteria for CCR disposal units, making it difficult to anticipate EPA's role in the implementation of federal regulatory criteria. The 112th Congress proposed state programs to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) in response to an EPA proposal to regulate CCRs according to national waste management standards. This report provides background on EPA's determination and describes elements of RCRA Subtitles C and D relevant to the legislative proposals for state programs to regulate CCRs. It focuses on how state programs may be developed and implemented. The report discusses the development and implementation of state programs to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) in response to EPA proposals. It compares the proposed approach to the already established state programs for MSW landfills. This report provides information on existing programs to regulate MSW landfills and potential programs for regulating CCRs. It discusses state programs implemented and proposed in the 112th Congress, focusing on the term \"CCR permit program\" for state regulation. The proposed amendments to RCRA do not create a permit. The proposed amendments to RCRA do not create a permit program. Instead, states could use selected provisions to regulate CCR management. The focus is on state-based regulatory programs for CCRs, not EPA implementation. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for obtaining a permit for waste disposal facilities under state solid waste management programs. These permits outline compliance requirements and conditions for facility operators. State regulations for waste facilities vary based on the type of waste received. State solid waste management programs have tailored requirements for different types of waste facilities. A state permit program includes authorities, activities, and procedures for enforcing regulations. Each state's waste management program varies in its creation and implementation. A new permit program may be created by amending existing waste management laws to specify the entity required to operate using a permit. The authorized state agency would ensure compliance with regulations for waste disposal facilities, specifying requirements and documentation needed for facility compliance. EPA has primary authority to regulate hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. Under RCRA Subtitle D, states have primary authority to regulate nonhazardous solid wastes, with EPA's role being to promulgate criteria for sanitary landfills to eliminate open dumps. Amendments in 1984 required EPA to revise criteria for facilities receiving hazardous household wastes, defined as municipal solid waste landfills. State programs for MSW landfills involve federal regulatory criteria and EPA approval of state permit programs. Under RCRA, states have the primary authority to regulate nonhazardous solid wastes, with EPA setting criteria for sanitary landfills. State programs for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills must meet federal standards to protect human health and the environment. States have flexibility in adopting regulations based on specific conditions, but EPA approval depends on whether the state's program is deemed \"adequate\" to ensure compliance with federal standards. The regulatory program under the Constitution allows states flexibility in adopting pollution control laws to achieve a baseline standard of protection. Congress cannot compel states to adopt federal regulations, but states can choose to enforce EPA regulations or implement their own. States must meet federal standards for municipal solid waste landfills to protect human health and the environment, with EPA approval contingent on the adequacy of the state's program. States generally choose to adopt and enforce regulations themselves rather than have the EPA enforce federal criteria directly. EPA can enforce federal standards until a state adopts an approved program to enforce the criteria. EPA is authorized to use inspection and enforcement authorities under Subtitle C for this purpose. EPA promulgated MSW landfill criteria in 1991, with requirements for an \"adequate\" permit program established in 1998. States worked with EPA to develop adequate programs, and all states now have EPA-approved programs. EPA's authority to directly enforce criteria is limited to states with inadequate programs under Subtitle C. EPA has primary authority to implement and enforce federal requirements for hazardous waste facilities. States can be authorized by EPA to implement regulations for these facilities. EPA has never rescinded state authority for hazardous waste management programs. EPA has taken enforcement actions against individual facilities in states with federal requirements. EPA's authority to enforce MSW landfill criteria is limited. The EPA's authority to enforce federal landfill criteria at individual MSW landfills is limited due to all states having approved permit programs. The proposed CCR Permit Programs aim to regulate MSW landfills similarly to existing state programs under Subtitle D. The creation of a permit under the proposed amendment to RCRA would be a unique element. The proposed amendment to RCRA includes a unique permit program without explicit directives for regulatory standards. States implementing the program would apply MSW landfill criteria to owners and operators of CCR structures based on their interpretation of specified criteria. The proposed amendment to RCRA creates state permit programs for CCR disposal, with few requirements for the permit program itself. States can use statutory provisions as a framework to regulate entities needing a permit. The proposed amendment to RCRA creates state permit programs for CCR disposal with minimal requirements, potentially leading to a complex regulatory program that lacks clarity in distinguishing federal regulations from permit programs. This novel approach does not have detailed federal regulations or guidance, but it could still achieve its objective. However, the proposed bills lack a specific statement of the objective of a CCR Permit Program. The bill's preamble aims to facilitate recovery and beneficial use of CCRs. This report compares state programs for CCR disposal to existing federal-state programs for MSW landfills, focusing on elements of a state-implemented regulatory program. Differences in implementation and enforcement are highlighted, including flexibility in permit program specifications and standards of protection. The report explains federal-state programs for MSW landfills and risks related to CCR management. State regulations for CCR structures would need to meet minimum requirements and MSW landfill criteria. Ambiguities in federal laws are interpreted by EPA, while state regulations would apply to unspecified requirements in proposed CCR bills. Ambiguities or requirements not specified in proposed CCR bills would be subject to state interpretation. Criteria for CCR structures under a CCR Permit Program include MSW landfill technical criteria and groundwater monitoring. State regulations may vary in including general standards like applicability and compliance deadlines. Decisions on state regulations and compliance deadlines for existing facilities under a CCR Permit Program may impact human health protection from CCR disposal risks. State laws may determine standards for CCR structures based on potential health risks, differing from MSW landfill regulations. The EPA's oversight role in state implementation of a CCR Permit Program would be different from its typical role in overseeing permit programs. States implementing a CCR Permit Program would receive notice of deficiencies from the EPA and be given the opportunity to remedy them. The program specifications do not include a deadline for full implementation. The EPA's oversight of state implementation of a CCR Permit Program does not have an explicit deadline for full implementation. Once a state starts implementing the program, EPA could review it at any time, potentially finding deficiencies and requiring corrective action. The bills require EPA to identify deficient state program elements, which may pose challenges due to the lack of historical interpretation. The EPA is required by Congress to determine if state programs for regulating MSW landfills are \"adequate\" to ensure compliance with regulatory criteria. The term \"adequate\" has a mature understanding after decades of agency interpretation. Some argue that new bills could give EPA backstop authority to enforce state programs. \"Backstop authority\" is not formally defined but refers to EPA's ability to enforce regulations. The term \"backstop authority\" refers to EPA's explicit authority to enforce standards at individual facilities in a state authorized by EPA to implement federal standards. This authority has been mentioned in relation to RCRA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act. Despite a decline in demand, coal remains the dominant fuel for electricity generation in the United States. In 2011, electricity generating units in the United States burned over 900 million tons of coal, producing 130 million tons of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs). CCRs are a significant waste stream, with on-site disposal at power plants leading to large accumulations of dry or wet ash. A notable incident occurred in 2008 at TVA's Kingston plant when a surface impoundment breach released 1.1 billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry, causing extensive damage. The 2008 incident at TVA's Kingston plant released 1.1 billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry, causing extensive damage. Cleanup is estimated to cost $1.2 billion and continue into at least 2014. The incident highlighted the potential for catastrophic releases due to structural failures in surface impoundments. EPA found that the leaching of contaminants, primarily heavy metals, poses a common threat in CCR management, leading to surface or groundwater contamination. The management of CCRs is largely unregulated at the federal level, with gaps identified in the regulation of CCR surface impoundments. EPA noted that while many state programs adequately regulate CCR landfills, there are deficiencies in regulating existing surface impoundments. EPA proposed two options to regulate CCRs under RCRA Subtitles C and D in response to concerns over potential impacts. Industry estimates show that 80% of CCRs generated in 2011 were managed through land application, posing potential threats to human health. EPA identified conditions and protective measures for land applications of CCRs. EPA identified protective measures to minimize risks from CCR disposal, including using composite liner systems for surface impoundments to prevent contaminant leaching and structural failure. These measures are specific to CCR management and aim to eliminate potential threats to human health. Failure could be minimized by ensuring units meet design standards and are inspected regularly. CCR disposal facilities are regulated by individual states, not federally. EPA has gathered data on CCR use and disposal for over 30 years to determine if federal requirements are needed. States are regulating CCR landfills more, but many do not require protective measures for human health. Potential risks from CCR management have led to documented damages from improper disposal practices. EPA determined the need for national standards to regulate CCR management due to documented damages from improper disposal practices and concerns over gaps in state regulatory programs. Options to regulate CCRs are limited under current authorities, with two main options being considered: either applying hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C or promulgating standards for CCR landfills and surface impoundments. EPA proposed two options to regulate CCRs: under Subtitle C, listing it as a \"special waste\" with strict disposal standards, or under Subtitle D for states to enforce the prohibition on open dumping. EPA assumed power plants would upgrade facilities for compliance with tailored land disposal standards. EPA proposed two regulatory options for managing CCRs: one under Subtitle C with stricter waste management standards and higher costs, and the other under Subtitle D for states to enforce regulations on landfills and surface impoundments receiving CCRs. Each option offers a similar level of protection but differs in scope and enforcement potential. The Subtitle D option for managing CCRs would establish standards for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, with limited enforcement authority by the EPA. Industry groups, environmental organizations, and state agencies provided comments on EPA's proposed Subtitle C and D requirements. Opposition to the Subtitle C option for managing CCRs was largely due to concerns about cost, restrictions, stigmatization, and limitations on land-based applications. Concerns about the Subtitle D option included EPA's lack of enforcement authority and doubts about states adopting new standards. The report provides information on EPA's proposals to regulate CCRs, but does not discuss the reasons for national standards or opposition to the proposals. The approach to creating the permit program differs from typical federal pollution control laws. The EPA is proposing a new approach to regulate CCRs with a focus on facilitating recovery and beneficial use while ensuring proper management and disposal. The proposed CCR Permit Programs would allow states to create their own regulations with some level of EPA oversight. This program would be similar to existing state programs for enforcing standards to prevent open dumping. Based on the proposed amendment and legislative history, state adoption of a CCR Permit Program aims to regulate CCR disposal similar to MSW landfills. The evolution of federal-state programs for MSW landfills under RCRA Subtitle D is relevant. Proposed Section 4011 outlines criteria for states to create CCR Permit Programs based on existing regulatory criteria. However, it does not explicitly mandate EPA or states to promulgate regulations. Proposed Section 4011 does not explicitly require EPA or states to create regulations for CCR disposal facilities. States adopting a CCR Permit Program would need to interpret criteria listed in the program specifications to regulate \"CCR structures.\" EPA and possibly courts would provide oversight. The proposed CCR Permit Program would likely be created with minimal involvement from EPA, with states interpreting program specifications for regulating CCR structures. EPA's role in program implementation and enforcement would be different compared to other RCRA permit programs. EPA and states have previously collaborated on regulating landfills receiving MSW, with EPA revising criteria for landfill owners and operators. The EPA established minimum national criteria for MSW landfills to protect human health and the environment. States had to adopt and implement permit programs based on these criteria within 18 months. EPA ensured state programs were adequate to enforce compliance with federal criteria to prevent health risks from waste disposal. The EPA authorized direct enforcement of federal regulatory criteria at MSW landfills until states had approved permit programs in place. States were encouraged to adopt and enforce federal criteria, with EPA having limited intervention authority. A CCR Permit Program would incorporate elements of state programs but with different roles for states and EPA. The proposed CCR Permit Program would involve states notifying EPA of their adoption within six months of bill enactment and submitting certification of compliance within three years. Participating states would interpret Section 4011 and develop regulations based on their understanding, with roles and authorities delineated for EPA and states in creating, implementing, and enforcing requirements for CCR structures. The bills do not specify requirements for protecting human health under the permit program. States would determine compliance deadlines and issue permits. Participating states must certify their program within three years, ensuring effective regulations for coal combustion residuals. Compliance deadlines and program details are currently unknown. The EPA would notify states of compliance deadlines and program applicability details once states implement a CCR Permit Program. States failing to meet deadlines must inform EPA of their intentions. EPA would identify deficiencies in state programs but may not address elements outside the required specifications. The EPA may implement a permit program for states with program deficiencies if they fail to remedy them within negotiated time frames. It is unclear if the EPA would enforce state requirements or establish federal criteria for the CCR Permit Program. Roles and authorities of the EPA and states would differ in enforcing requirements for CCR structures compared to MSW landfills. The CCR Permit Programs would be implemented with roles and authorities to enforce requirements for MSW landfills. State adoption of these programs aims to regulate CCRs similar to existing state programs. Congress has the authority to create permit programs for constitutionally authorized purposes. A CCR Permit Program, created under proposed bills, would incorporate federal regulations and standards for MSW landfills and CCR landfills. This program aims to regulate CCRs similar to existing state programs for MSW landfills. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA; P.L. 98-616) amended RCRA Subtitle D to address regulations for MSW landfills, with the goal of preventing contamination associated with waste disposal. Congress required EPA to promulgate regulations applicable to facilities that may receive hazardous household wastes, including certain minimum requirements and a broad standard of protection. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA; P.L. 98-616) amended RCRA Subtitle D to regulate waste excluded from Subtitle C requirements, recognizing potential risks to human health and the environment. Congress implemented more detailed regulations under Subtitle D for waste like household waste, which is exempt from Subtitle C requirements. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) amended RCRA Subtitle D to include more detailed regulations for waste like household waste. Congress directed EPA to study the adequacy of guidelines for solid waste management facilities and revise sanitary landfill criteria to protect human health. EPA was required to report study results and recommendations to Congress within three years. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 directed EPA to revise sanitary landfill criteria to protect human health and the environment. The revised criteria required ground water monitoring, established location criteria for facilities, and provided for corrective action. States were required to adopt permit programs to ensure compliance with the new criteria. EPA promulgated the \"Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\" in response to these directives. EPA developed landfill criteria and permit program requirements over a 20-year period to address risks to human health from waste management. National criteria were established to protect human health and the environment from MSW landfill disposal risks. The EPA developed landfill criteria and permit program requirements over 20 years to address risks to human health from waste management. In 1991, the agency promulgated requirements for MSW landfills, including general standards and compliance deadlines. The EPA developed landfill criteria and permit program requirements over 20 years to address risks to human health from waste management. In 1991, the agency promulgated requirements for MSW landfills, including general standards, location restrictions, operating criteria, design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure/post-closure care, and financial assurance criteria applicable to owners and operators of MSW landfills. The EPA developed landfill criteria and permit program requirements over 20 years to address risks to human health from waste management. The MSW landfill criteria are intended for facilities that dispose of \"dry\" waste and do not address liquid waste issues. New MSW landfills must comply with standards before operation, while existing facilities must meet criteria deadlines to avoid violating RCRA's open dumping prohibition. The criteria establish federal standards for owners and operators to manage landfills in a way that protects human health. Each standard is designed for implementation by the owner or operator, with or without regulatory agency oversight. The EPA developed landfill criteria and permit program requirements over 20 years to address risks to human health from waste management. Owners and operators of regulated disposal units must comply with applicable criteria by deadlines, regardless of state adoption of federal criteria. States can have more stringent regulations, but compliance with minimum national standards aims for consistent protection from threats related to improper MSW management. States are primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing federal standards under Subtitle D, with EPA having a role post-amendments in HSWA. The HSWA created a role for EPA in state adoption and implementation of MSW landfill criteria under Subtitle D. States were directed to adopt a permit program to ensure compliance with the criteria, with EPA assessing each state program. Each state had to adopt a permit program within 18 months of EPA promulgating the criteria to avoid EPA enforcement. EPA determined if each state had an adequate program for facility compliance with the criteria. EPA's role in state adoption and implementation of MSW landfill criteria under Subtitle D involved assessing each state's permit program for compliance. The State Implementation Rule (SIR) outlines requirements for state permit program determination of adequacy, including general specifications, state program application components, and minimum permitting requirements. The EPA assesses state permit programs for compliance with MSW landfill criteria under Subtitle D, including requirements for adequacy determination and citizen action in civil enforcement. State programs must meet criteria for adequacy determination, program modification, and potential withdrawal of EPA's determination. The resulting state permit programs regulate MSW landfills in areas such as location, design, operation, groundwater monitoring, closure, post-closure care, corrective action, and financial assurance. The EPA assesses state permit programs for compliance with MSW landfill criteria under Subtitle D, including requirements for adequacy determination and citizen action in civil enforcement. State programs must meet criteria for adequacy determination, program modification, and potential withdrawal of EPA's determination. The resulting state permit programs regulate MSW landfills in areas such as location, design, operation, groundwater monitoring, closure, post-closure care, corrective action, and financial assurance. EPA's determination of state program adequacy was relevant to the agency's potential to directly enforce the MSW landfill criteria. Program adequacy was relevant to the agency's ability to enforce MSW landfill criteria. HSWA's Section 4005(c) outlined conditions for EPA to directly enforce the open dumping prohibition at MSW landfills in states with inadequate programs. EPA could use inspection and federal enforcement authorities to ensure compliance with the criteria. The EPA has approved state programs to enforce federal MSW landfill criteria, giving states primary authority to implement and enforce their own criteria for MSW landfills. EPA lacks direct enforcement authority without state approval. When the SIR was finalized in 1998, EPA intended states to continue their lead role in implementing the federal MSW landfill criteria. Currently, all states have EPA-approved permit programs, giving them primary authority to enforce their own criteria for MSW landfills. EPA lacks direct enforcement authority without state approval. State programs regulate MSW landfills based on federal criteria to address specific risks. Compliance with permits aims to protect human health. If CCR regulations mirror MSW landfill regulations, they would also focus on health risks specific to CCR disposal. The effectiveness of CCR Permit Programs in protecting human health depends on the management of CCRs and their associated risks. EPA proposed regulations to address risks specific to CCR management under Subtitles C and D of RCRA, stemming from the Bevill Amendment. The Bevill provisions excluded certain coal combustion residuals (CCRs) from Subtitle C requirements pending EPA's determination. EPA's June 2010 proposal aimed to gather data for this determination, including a study on the adverse effects of CCR disposal and use on human health and the environment. The EPA considered methods of disposal and potential danger to human health and the environment from coal combustion residuals (CCRs) in determining if they should be subject to hazardous waste requirements. Factors such as toxicity, nature of toxic constituents, and potential for migration were taken into account. The EPA determined that coal combustion residuals (CCRs) contain over 40 toxic constituents that can degrade and migrate under certain conditions, posing health and environmental hazards. Common disposal methods such as landfills and impoundment ponds have resulted in documented cases of damages causing human health concerns. The EPA identified various pathways for human exposure to toxic constituents in coal combustion residuals (CCRs), including leaching and migration off-site in unlined units, direct discharge to surface water, and structural failures like the Kingston release. The EPA found that the highest risk to human health from coal combustion residuals (CCRs) comes from contaminant leaching and migration to surface and groundwater. Risk can be reduced by using a composite liner. Owners and operators of CCR landfills and surface impoundments are likely to install liners and groundwater monitoring systems to control risks associated with CCR disposal and use. The EPA found that a significant number of CCR landfills and surface impoundments lack liners and groundwater monitoring systems. While most states regulate CCR landfills adequately, there are gaps in oversight for surface impoundments, which may fall under dam safety programs rather than solid waste management programs. The EPA found that many states do not require liners or groundwater monitoring for surface impoundments, which are essential for regulatory regimes. States also lack siting controls, inspection, and structural integrity requirements for these units, increasing the risk of structural failure. EPA's 2010 proposal aimed to establish regulations for CCR disposal and use in states with inadequate regulations. EPA's June 2010 proposal aimed to create a national standard for regulating coal combustion residuals (CCRs) destined for disposal. The proposal included standards for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, defining solid waste disposal units and specifying the types of facilities that would be subject to regulation. CCR surface impoundments are designed to hold CCRs with free liquids and are not injection wells. They include pits, ponds, and lagoons for sluiced CCRs and wastes from air pollution control devices. EPA proposed these definitions based on groundwater risk assessments and damage cases related to CCR management. The EPA drew from MSW landfill criteria to establish national standards for safe CCR disposal, balancing protection and practicality. Criteria were tailored to address human health threats specific to CCR management. The EPA integrated selected regulatory criteria from 40 C.F.R. Part 265, originally designed for hazardous waste TSDFs, into the MSW landfill criteria to address risks from contaminant spread in surface impoundments. The EPA incorporated regulatory criteria from 40 C.F.R. Part 265 into MSW landfill criteria to address risks from contaminant spread in surface impoundments. The criteria did not cover risks from liquid waste accumulation or structural integrity issues related to coal ash slurry. To mitigate these risks, proposed standards for CCR surface impoundments were based on MSHA regulations for impoundments and impounding structures. EPA's decision was influenced by MSHA's expertise and experience in implementing similar requirements. The EPA's proposed standards for CCR surface impoundments draw from MSHA regulations to prevent catastrophic releases and protect human health. Criteria include controlling contaminant leaching and addressing risks unique to CCR management. The EPA's proposed standards for CCR disposal include requirements for new disposal units to be placed above the natural water table and not located in wetlands, fault zones, or seismic impact zones. Existing facilities in unstable areas must close within five years, and all units must have a composite liner. Existing surface impoundments must have solids removed and be retrofitted with a composite liner within five years. All CCR units must comply with groundwater monitoring requirements within one year of a final rule. New units need monitoring systems before disposal. Fugitive dust emissions must be controlled. An engineer must certify run-on/runoff control system design. Surface impoundments must maintain unit information. The curr_chunk discusses the design and certification requirements for CCR surface impoundments, highlighting the differences between MSW landfill criteria and EPA's proposed standards. It also mentions the introduction of a new section in RCRA for the management and disposal of coal combustion residuals. The bills propose a framework for states to create permit programs to regulate CCR management, allowing flexibility in implementation and enforcement. The proposed bills outline provisions for states to establish CCR Permit Programs, with key details on State Actions, Permit Program Specifications, and Definitions. States must notify EPA within six months of enactment if they plan to implement a program, with EPA stepping in for non-participating states. Only states with approved MSW landfill permits or federal hazardous waste authorization can implement the program. States with approved MSW landfill permits or federal hazardous waste authorization can implement a CCR Permit Program under Section 4011. Within 36 months of bill enactment, states must submit a certification to EPA explaining how their program meets the Permit Program Specifications. The certification requires a narrative description of the state's program ensuring compliance with program specifications. The proposed amendment would not explicitly require states to promulgate regulations for waste disposal facilities receiving CCRs, but program preconditions suggest they would. Minimum requirements for a coal combustion residuals permit program include applying revised criteria to owners or operators of structures. The proposed amendment would apply revised criteria to owners or operators of structures, including surface impoundments, that receive coal combustion residuals. Specific subparts of the MSW landfill criteria and individual criteria are cited in paragraph (2) of the Revised Criteria. The criteria cover design, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure for new structures and expansions. Leachate collection system requirements do not apply to surface impoundments receiving coal combustion residuals. The revised criteria for air quality and financial assurance under 40 C.F.R. Part 258 apply to structures receiving coal combustion residuals. Minimum requirements include provisions for structural integrity related to risks of catastrophic releases from surface impoundments. EPA's proposed Subtitle D standards for CCR landfills and impoundments also include design criteria for addressing these risks. The proposed EPA criteria include detailed requirements for structural integrity, location restrictions, and wind dispersal to address risks specific to coal combustion residuals management. EPA's standards aim to mitigate contaminant spread, fugitive emissions, and groundwater monitoring. Within one year of program certification, states would enforce groundwater monitoring for regulated structures. Requirements for surface impoundments address contaminant migration risks, with standards to prevent spread and actions to be taken if contaminants migrate. EPA's proposed criteria aim to mitigate contaminant spread and ensure compliance with permit program regulations. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for states to describe their coal combustion residuals permit program to the EPA, including legal certification of effective statutes or regulations. States implementing the program would need to promulgate regulations for CCR structures based on criteria for MSW landfills and minimum requirements. The curr_chunk discusses provisions under the Revised Criteria for MSW landfill criteria, including location restrictions, operating criteria, design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure/post-closure care, and financial assurance. These provisions do not include general standards found in the MSW landfill criteria, which specify scope, purpose, compliance deadlines, and terms for program applicability. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions necessary for determining program applicability and clarifying required elements of specific criteria, such as the definition of a \"structure\" in the CCR Permit Program. Structures that may receive CCRs are defined as land-based units excluding those that receive only de minimis quantities of CCRs. The proposed definitions for CCR regulations lack details on what constitutes a \"CCR landfill\" or \"CCR surface impoundment,\" leaving it up to states to define. State regulations under the proposed bills may not need to meet federal protection standards like those under RCRA. The proposed CCR regulations allow states to set their own standards for protection, with EPA oversight and enforcement roles specified in the program. EPA's proposed definitions lack details on CCR landfill and surface impoundment, leaving it to states to define. The provisions specify elements of a state's program that EPA would review and conditions for EPA to intervene and enforce a CCR Permit Program. Differences exist in EPA's role for CCR Permit Program compared to MSW landfill criteria implementation. EPA's interpretation of directives and proposed authorities' impact on state adoption and implementation remain uncertain. Proposed Section 4011(d) would require EPA to identify and notify a state of deficiencies in specific elements of its program related to MSW landfill criteria implementation. EPA's review is limited to ensuring the state submits required information and maintains approved permit programs. EPA may intervene if the state fails to meet Permit Program Specifications. The state must meet Permit Program Specifications and maintain effective statutes for a CCR Permit Program. EPA will notify states of deficiencies and collaborate to set a deadline for correction, with a minimum of 180 days. EPA may intervene if a state fails to implement the program effectively. The EPA will notify states of deficiencies in implementing a CCR program, setting a deadline for correction. If a state fails to comply, EPA may intervene. EPA's review may occur after permits are issued or permit conditions are enforced. EPA's obligations under RCRA Section 4005 required states to develop programs ensuring MSW landfill criteria compliance. In a proposed RCRA amendment, states would be notified of deficiencies in meeting statutory specifications for CCR programs. EPA may identify deficiencies in state CCR programs based on statutory specifications. The new terminology could impact how EPA determines program adequacy. EPA may not be required to assess all program elements, such as how a state defines a landfill for CCRs. Enforcement actions against CCR structures in states with deficiencies may be limited. EPA may not enforce actions against CCR structures in states with deficiencies in their CCR programs. Proposed Section 4011(e) outlines conditions for EPA to implement a CCR Permit Program for a state if deficiencies are identified and not remedied within a negotiated timeframe. If a state declines to implement or discontinues its program, EPA would be required to step in. This mandate presents challenges for EPA in interpreting and implementing state CCR regulations. The EPA has the authority to implement a CCR Permit Program for states with deficient programs or those that choose not to implement one. This would involve using existing provisions in Subtitle D and the Administrator's authority under Section 2002 of RCRA to prescribe necessary regulations. Section 4011(e) refers to existing provisions in Subtitle D as the basis for implementing a CCR Permit Program. The legislative history suggests that state-implemented programs should mirror federal-state programs regulating MSW landfills to promote the recovery and beneficial use of CCRs. The extent to which states will adopt similar regulations for CCRs remains uncertain. The proposed CCR Permit Program would apply selected MSW landfill criteria to owners and operators of CCR structures. Differences from existing programs include potential flexibility in state program development and implementation. Each state could determine key elements related to program implementation. The proposed CCR Permit Program allows states to determine key elements related to program implementation and facility compliance, ensuring a minimum national standard of protection. However, the proposed statutory criteria are not sufficient to protect human health from risks specific to CCR disposal and use. Regulations must achieve a federal standard of protection to address this issue. Regulations for CCR structures aim to meet federal protection standards, with states having the flexibility to set their own standards. EPA's involvement in program development is limited, and there is uncertainty on whether EPA implementing a CCR Permit Program would incentivize states to comply with Section 4011 requirements. Section 4011 does not explicitly direct states or EPA to create regulations for CCR structures, but rather outlines regulatory criteria for a CCR Permit Program. The definition of \"structures\" for receiving CCRs under a CCR Permit Program is subject to varying interpretations, with states having broad latitude in defining terms like \"landfill, surface impoundment, or other land-based unit.\" This contrasts with existing EPA regulations that provide explicit definitions for regulatory applicability. The definitions provided by EPA help regulated entities determine applicable regulations for waste management activities, including risks posed by certain waste disposal facilities. EPA's proposed definitions for CCR management reflect the agency's assessment of health risks associated with CCR disposal. The EPA's definitions for CCR management reflect research on threats to human health from disposal in surface impoundments and landfills. Stakeholders debate the inclusiveness of these definitions, leaving room for state-specific regulations to determine program applicability. The regulated universe of \"owners and operators\" remains unknown until states define a CCR \"structure.\" Section 4011 lacks specific program elements and deadlines, leaving it up to states to define structures and set requirements. Once states implement regulations and permit programs, it will be determined how uniformly they apply the program elements. States have the flexibility to define program elements and set requirements for regulating CCRs under Section 4011. It is uncertain if state programs will manage CCRs similar to existing programs for MSW landfills. Compliance deadlines may vary among state regulations. The majority of the Permit Program Specifications are criteria that would be applied by the permit program. Section 4011 lacks provisions specifying required elements of the permit program itself compared to existing state programs for MSW landfills. This may be due to the belief that states with approved permit programs under RCRA have sufficient regulations in place. States with approved permit programs under Subtitles C or D of RCRA have shown capability in regulating CCRs, but some states lack effective regulatory programs for CCR disposal. Differences in interpretation between states and EPA regarding standards for human health protection may exist. Having an approved MSW permit program does not guarantee compliance with landfill regulations for CCR disposal. A state may amend its laws to apply requirements for managing and disposing of CCRs in structures. Regulations under RCRA Subtitles C or D must meet standards to protect human health and the environment. Compliance with landfill regulations for CCR disposal is not guaranteed by having an approved MSW permit program. The proposed bills do not explicitly require state regulations for CCR disposal to achieve a specific level of protection. However, achieving a level comparable to RCRA standards was considered when applying revised criteria to the permit program under Section 4011. The House report for H.R. 2273 states that new EPA regulations may not be necessary. The EPA acknowledged that the criteria for CCR disposal strike a balance between protecting human health and the environment while being practical for facilities. The legislation expects permit programs to meet these standards. State implementation of a CCR Permit Program using MSW landfill criteria as a baseline is expected to protect human health and the environment. The implementation of a CCR Permit Program using MSW landfill criteria as a baseline is expected to protect human health and the environment. The use of these criteria aims to create a permit program that meets a standard of protection, although it may not address specific risks associated with CCR structures like surface impoundment ponds or uses in construction projects. EPA's June 2010 proposal did not solely rely on MSW landfill criteria to ensure a similar level of protection for CCR disposal in landfills. EPA's June 2010 proposal included detailed criteria necessary to address risks associated with the disposal of dry CCRs in landfills and liquid slurry in surface impoundments, in addition to selected MSW landfill criteria. The bills propose provisions for a CCR Permit Program based on EPA's standards, but it is unclear if all risks identified by EPA would be addressed due to state flexibility in defining CCR disposal units. There is no explicit directive for the program to meet a specific protection standard. When implementing a state-specific CCR Permit Program under RCRA, the intent is to ensure compliance with federal regulatory criteria for waste disposal facilities. EPA's 2010 proposal aimed to fill gaps in state programs by establishing national standards for CCR regulation. EPA would analyze risk assessment data during the rulemaking process. The EPA uses risk assessment data and stakeholder input to determine regulatory criteria for CCRs. Stakeholders may disagree with EPA's criteria, but the administrative process allows for transparency and input. The technical basis for selecting requirements in the proposed CCR Permit Program is unclear. The purpose of state programs to regulate CCRs is compared to existing programs for MSW landfills. State programs for MSW landfills ensure compliance with criteria, while CCR Permit Program aims for a standard of protection. EPA defines state programs as authorities for regulating facilities. The proposed bills aim to amend RCRA to facilitate the management and disposal of CCRs through a defined permit program. Unlike state programs for MSW landfills, the proposed program may not explicitly require facility compliance with baseline protection standards. The proposed bills aim to establish a state permit program for managing CCRs, but it is uncertain if the program will require facilities to meet specific protection standards. EPA's role in overseeing the program would be limited compared to other permit programs under RCRA. EPA's role in overseeing the state permit program for managing CCRs would be limited compared to other permit programs under RCRA. The program would be implemented by states based on their interpretation of the regulations, with no formal role for EPA in the regulatory development process. The bills propose limited EPA oversight of state permit programs for managing CCRs, with no formal role for EPA in regulatory development. EPA's authority in addressing deficient state program elements is unclear, with options including implementing only deficient components or the entire program with corrections. In cases of identified deficiencies in state CCR permit programs, EPA could implement the entire program with corrections. Alternatively, EPA may promulgate its own program for CCR structures. Another option is for EPA to issue guidance to states before program implementation to avoid deficiencies. The Administrator may issue regulations under Section 2002 of the RCRA statute to address deficiencies in state CCR permit programs. EPA has already identified CCR management practices, standards, and compliance time frames in a 2010 proposal, which could guide the process of identifying deficiencies. EPA is required to promulgate regulations under RCRA Subtitle D. EPA has been required to promulgate regulations specific to waste disposal facilities under RCRA Subtitle D. State and EPA roles were established in 1976 and 1984 amendments. EPA's involvement in state programs for MSW landfills evolved in the 1990s and largely ended in the early 2000s. State MSW programs reflect various approaches but share common elements. Regulations for MSW landfill criteria are in 40 C.F.R. Part 258. Regulations for MSW landfill criteria at 40 C.F.R. Part 258 were determined by EPA to protect human health and the environment. States used federal criteria as a model for their own regulations, with variations allowed as long as they met the baseline federal level of protection. State permit programs were intended to ensure compliance with regulations for owners and operators of MSW landfills. State programs were approved by EPA to ensure compliance with regulations for MSW landfills. EPA could enforce federal criteria in states without adequate permit programs, but has not done so. Concern over EPA's potential enforcement likely motivated states to adopt and implement permit programs. EPA has the authority to withdraw approval of a state program if not implemented as described. The bills in the 112th Congress proposed a different framework for state programs to regulate CCRs, without requiring EPA to set national standards. Questions arise on how states would interpret program requirements and criteria to regulate CCR structures. EPA's role in the proposed bills remains unclear until states implement their programs. The proposed bills in the 112th Congress aim to shift the regulation of CCR structures to state programs without national standards set by the EPA. Questions remain on how states would apply program conditions to specific CCR structures and if EPA guidance would influence them. States may need to develop or revise requirements for CCR management beyond current waste management standards, with uncertainty on when new regulations would apply to owners and operators of CCR structures. States would need to determine the level of protection required for CCR structures, and EPA's role in identifying program deficiencies is unclear. The proposed bills in the 112th Congress aim to shift the regulation of CCR structures to state programs without national standards set by the EPA. Questions remain on how states would apply program conditions to specific CCR structures and if EPA guidance would influence them. States may need to develop or revise requirements for CCR management beyond current waste management standards, with uncertainty on when new regulations would apply to owners and operators of CCR structures. EPA's role in identifying program deficiencies is unclear, including when and how often deficiencies would be identified, and the influence of EPA regulations on state regulations. The proposed bills in the 112th Congress aim to shift the regulation of CCR structures to state programs without national standards set by the EPA. Questions remain on how states would apply program conditions to specific CCR structures and if EPA guidance would influence them. Some in Congress support legislation that would limit EPA's role in regulating CCR disposal while encouraging states to create programs to regulate the material according to conditions established in federal law. Supporters of state programs to regulate CCRs believe they could be as effective as federal requirements proposed by the EPA in 2010. However, critics argue that existing state programs may have gaps, allowing risky waste management practices to continue. With uncertainty about EPA's future plans, CCR legislation is likely to be considered in the 113th Congress. Consideration of legislation regarding CCR management will take place amidst concerns about current CCR facilities, changing economics for coal-fired electricity, and differing views on the roles of states and the EPA. Under RCRA Subtitle D, states have primary authority for regulating nonhazardous solid waste, such as CCRs, while EPA's role is limited in this area. EPA's role in regulating nonhazardous solid waste is limited to enforcing criteria for RCRA's prohibition on open dumping, distinguish between sanitary landfills and open dumps based on health and environmental impact. EPA's Subtitle D option in June 2010 aimed to set standards for landfills receiving CCRs. The EPA would regulate landfills and surface impoundments receiving CCRs under Subtitle D, using its authority to classify facilities as \"sanitary landfills\" or \"open dumps\" based on criteria. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 added provisions to RCRA Subtitle D, including Section 4010 and Section 4005(c), which led to the promulgation of MSW landfill criteria. The EPA's authority under Subtitle D is limited to enforcing MSW landfill criteria in states with approved permit programs. It cannot regulate nonhazardous solid waste like CCRs or require states to adopt permit programs for other types of solid waste. EPA can only expand on landfill criteria related to the prohibition of open dumping. Under RCRA, EPA and state authorities are required to enforce regulations for managing nonhazardous solid waste. Criteria to protect human health and the environment are determined based on specific waste disposal facilities. Regulatory standards have been developed over 30 years through public rulemaking processes. The EPA has developed regulatory standards over 30 years through public rulemaking processes for waste management. Necessary protections involve identifying common waste management methods, analyzing toxic constituents, assessing potential pathways of human exposure, and considering protective measures. The EPA has developed regulatory standards for waste management over 30 years, including protective measures such as using composite liners at disposal sites to minimize human exposure to toxins. Data provided by states and industries inform these measures, which aim to achieve a standard of protection set by federal law. EPA considers risk as the potential for harmful effects on human health or ecological systems from exposure. The EPA uses risk assessments to evaluate the potential harmful effects on human health and ecological systems from exposure to environmental stressors like chemical contaminants. Waste management criteria for MSW landfills aim to protect human health and the environment from risks associated with managing municipal solid waste. The EPA's Subtitle D option for regulating CCRs aims to meet the standard of protection for sanitary landfills, ensuring no adverse effects on health or the environment from solid waste disposal. EPA's proposed standards for CCR landfills and surface impoundments are designed to meet this standard. The EPA's proposed standards for CCR disposal units aim to address risks specific to managing CCRs in landfills and surface impoundments. A comparison in Table A-2 shows differences between existing MSW landfill criteria and EPA's standards, including requirements for location restrictions, operating criteria, design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure, post-closure care, and financial assurance. The EPA's proposed standards for CCR disposal units aim to address risks specific to managing CCRs in landfills and surface impoundments. The most significant differences pertain to the potential regulation of surface impoundments, with requirements in EPA's June 2010 Subtitle D proposal addressing issues unique to the management of CCRs, such as the accumulation of liquids and the higher potential risk of a catastrophic release. The EPA's proposed standards for CCR disposal units aim to address risks specific to managing CCRs in landfills and surface impoundments. Table A-3 lists EPA's proposed \"Design criteria for new CCR surface impoundments and lateral expansions\" at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7257.72, emphasizing the need for effective liners to reduce adverse effects. The EPA's proposed Subtitle D design standards require new landfills and surface impoundments to have composite liners and leachate collection systems. Units must be retrofitted with liners or closed within five years. The same requirements apply under Subtitle C. EPA noted that the technical justification for these requirements is applicable regardless of the statutory authority. The State Implementation Rule (SIR) in 40 C.F.R. Part 239 outlines requirements for state permit programs to ensure compliance with MSW landfill criteria. States must provide detailed information and demonstrate authorities, activities, and procedures before EPA approval. Proposed bills in the 112th Congress align with these requirements. The requirements for state permit programs to implement MSW landfill criteria are outlined in 40 C.F.R. Part 239. Program implementation differences can be seen in comparison to statutory requirements. Key subsections include State Actions, Permit Program Specifications, and Written Notice. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for adequate permit programs in Subpart C of Part 239, including written notice, opportunity to remedy, and implementation by the Administrator. Proposed definitions for \"coal combustion residuals permit program\" and \"permit\" are also mentioned, along with the definition of a \"structure.\" Additionally, Appendix C covers RCRA provisions and EPA responses related to directives in the \"Bevill Amendment.\" In 1978, EPA proposed hazardous waste management regulations under Subtitle C, identifying special wastes deferred from regulation due to perceived lower risk. Congress debated RCRA reauthorization in 1980, with an amendment by Rep. Tom Bevill to defer regulations for fossil fuel combustion waste. The Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 included the \"Bevill Amendment\" which deferred regulation of fossil fuel combustion waste, known as CCRs, under RCRA Subtitle C pending EPA's determination of its hazardous nature. EPA excluded this waste from hazardous waste regulations to avoid burdening the utility industry. The EPA was directed to conduct a study on the adverse effects of coal combustion waste on human health and the environment, including its generation, disposal practices, potential dangers, documented cases, alternatives, costs, impact on natural resources, and utilization. In response to legislative and administrative actions, EPA reviewed studies on coal combustion waste and invited participation from various parties. EPA submitted a draft in March 2000 proposing regulation of coal combustion residuals under Subtitle C when land disposed. National management standards were also being considered, including a potential hazardous waste listing for CCRs. EPA proposed national management standards for coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under Subtitle C, where proper management would exempt them from being classified as hazardous waste. Improper disposal, however, would trigger hazardous waste regulations due to potential risks to human health and the environment. EPA's decision was based on data showing the dangers of mismanagement, such as leaching arsenic. The EPA proposed national management standards for coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under Subtitle C to address risks of arsenic leaching and potential harm to human health and the environment. Despite improvements in industry practices, there were still concerns about inadequate controls in waste management, particularly in groundwater monitoring. EPA intended to maintain the Bevill exclusion but recognized the need for national regulations for CCR disposal in landfills and surface impoundments. EPA proposed national management standards for coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under Subtitle C due to concerns about inadequate controls in waste management, particularly in groundwater monitoring. Significant gaps were identified in state regulatory programs, leading to a revised determination by EPA in June 2010. EPA stated it would revise its determination if a need for regulation under Subtitle C was warranted."
