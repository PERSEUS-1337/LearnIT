    "content": "The report discusses three new ship-based weapons being developed by the Navy - solid state lasers, electromagnetic railgun, and gun-launched guided projectile. These weapons could significantly enhance Navy surface ships' defense capabilities against surface craft, UAVs, and anti-ship cruise missiles. The successful development and deployment of one or more of these weapons could be a game-changer or even a revolution in naval defense. Congress must decide whether to approve these new weapons. The Navy is developing high-energy lasers (HELs), railguns, and gun-launched guided projectiles (GLGP) for potential deployment. Congress must decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Navy's acquisition strategies and funding requests for these new weapons. These technologies have applications beyond surface ships, including military aircraft and ground forces equipment. The decisions made by Congress could impact future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. The Navy is developing high-energy lasers, railguns, and gun-launched guided projectiles for potential deployment in defense against missiles and UAVs. Concerns about the survivability of Navy surface ships in combat situations against adversaries armed with advanced weapons have led to discussions about the need for new naval surface fire support weapons. In the future, the Navy may need to avoid operating in waters within range of advanced weapons, leading to a shift towards a fleet with smaller surface ships, unmanned vehicles, and submarines. The effectiveness of larger surface ships in defending against enemy missiles and UAVs is being questioned due to limitations in magazine depth and cost exchange ratios. The Navy faces challenges in defending against enemy missiles and UAVs due to limitations in magazine depth and unfavorable cost exchange ratios. This can lead to ships running out of ammunition and needing to withdraw from battle to reload, causing delays in returning to the combat area. The Navy faces challenges defending against enemy missiles and UAVs due to limitations in magazine depth and cost exchange ratios. SSLs, EMRG, and GLGP offer potential for improving depth of magazine and cost exchange ratio. SSLs are electrically powered and can be fired indefinitely, while EMRG projectiles and GLGPs can be stored in large quantities on Navy ships. High-energy SSLs and GLGPs stored in Navy ships can improve the ship's ability to counter missiles by allowing for more efficient use of SAMs. SSLs have a low cost per shot, while GLGPs have a higher procurement cost. Despite limitations in countering ASBMs, both technologies indirectly enhance the ship's defense capabilities. The Navy has made progress in deploying high-energy SSLs on surface ships for jamming ISR sensors, countering small boats and UAVs, and potentially enemy missiles in the future. These SSLs would be short-range defensive weapons with advantages such as low cost per shot, deep magazine, fast engagement times, and the ability to counter maneuvering missiles. The Navy has made progress in deploying high-energy SSLs on surface ships for jamming ISR sensors, countering small boats and UAVs, and potentially enemy missiles in the future. These SSLs offer fast engagement times, precision engagements, and the ability to use lasers for various responses. However, limitations include line of sight issues, atmospheric interference, thermal blooming, and the risk of collateral damage. Earlier developments in the Navy's efforts to develop high-energy SSLs include successful testing of a prototype SSL between 2009 and 2012. Between 2009 and 2012, the Navy tested a prototype SSL called the Laser Weapon System (LaWS) against UAVs on land and at sea, with a reported beam power of 30 kW. Another prototype SSL, the Maritime Laser Demonstration (MLD), was tested between 2010 and 2011, culminating in successful engagements with a small boat. In August 2014, LaWS was installed on the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf for operational evaluation against swarming boats and UAVs, declared operational in December 2014. The USS Ponce, equipped with the Laser Weapon System (LaWS), was relieved in September 2017 by the new Expeditionary Sea Base ship Lewis B. Puller. LaWS was removed from Ponce and will be refurbished for land-based testing as part of the HELIOS effort. The Navy is developing Solid State Lasers (SSLs) with improved capabilities to counter surface craft, UAVs, and eventually ASCMs through various programs like SSL-TM, RHEL, ODIN, SNLWS Increment 1 (HELIOS), and HELCAP. The Navy's laser development efforts include the Navy Laser Family of Systems (NFLoS), HELCAP, and future laser systems SNLWS Increment 2 and 3. HELCAP aims to field a fleet-ready High Energy Laser Weapon by leveraging knowledge from NFLoS. The SSL Technology Maturation program involves industry teams like BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. The SSL Technology Maturation program involved industry teams competing to develop a shipboard laser with a beam power of up to 150 kW. Northrop Grumman was selected as the winner of the competition. The Navy plans to install the SSL-TM laser on the USS Portland for sea testing in FY2019. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission states that development associated with RHEL was completed in FY2019, with HELCAP leveraging Alternative Laser Sources for higher powers. Congress added $11.6 million in development funding for RHEL in FY2018 for beam director procurement and system testing. SNLWS Increment 1 is called HELIOS, integrating high energy laser with optical dazzler and surveillance capabilities. The HELIOS effort focuses on developing a 60 kW-class high-energy laser for countering UAVs, small boats, and ISR sensors. Lockheed Martin was awarded a $150 million contract for two HELIOS systems, with options for up to 14 more, increasing the total contract value to $942.8 million. Lockheed Martin's HELIOS system, a 60-150 kW laser, is planned to be installed on a DDG-51 destroyer by FY 2021. The Navy aims to integrate directed energy weapons and test the system on a West Coast DDG-51 in 2021. Rear Adm. Ron Boxall expressed the Navy's commitment to advancing laser weapon technology. Lockheed Martin's HELIOS system, a 60-150 kW laser, will be integrated onto a destroyer for its lifetime. The weapon will provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data, as well as a counter-UAS dazzler capability. Rear Adm. Ron Boxall expressed confidence in increased directed energy power outputs but is cautious about integrating them into existing combat systems. Lockheed Martin's HELIOS system, a 60-150 kW laser, will be integrated onto a destroyer for its lifetime. Rear Adm. Ron Boxall is confident in increasing laser weapon power on ships but acknowledges power limitations, especially on the Flight III destroyer due to power allocation for the new AN/SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense Radar. Additional power will be needed to integrate HELIOS onto a DDG-51 Flight III. The Navy will need to either remove something or implement aggressive power management on a DDG-51 Flight III to integrate the HELIOS system. Lockheed Martin was awarded a $150 million contract to develop two HELIOS systems, one for a DDG-51 and one for testing on land. The FY '19 defense authorization bill limits the Navy to one HELIOS per fiscal year without a detailed acquisition strategy report. HELIOS will be integrated into the Aegis combat system to direct the Directed Energy weapon. Lockheed Martin plans to conduct a production design review for HELIOS in 2019. The Navy has been developing the EMRG cannon since 2005. The Navy has been developing the EMRG cannon since 2005, which uses electricity to fire projectiles at high speeds. EMRG draws power from the ship's electrical supply and has potential for defending against missiles. Industry-built prototypes by BAE Systems and General Atomics have been funded for development. The Navy has been developing the EMRG cannon since 2005, which uses electricity to fire projectiles at high speeds. Industry-built prototypes by BAE Systems and General Atomics are designed to fire projectiles at energy levels of 20 to 32 megajoules, with a range of 50 to 100 nautical miles. The Navy began evaluating the prototypes in 2012, and a new competition is planned for the railgun technology before entering the engineering and manufacturing development phase. The U.S. Navy is advancing its electromagnetic railgun research, aiming for a capacity of 10 rounds per minute with a 32 Mega-Joule muzzle launch for each round. The program will avoid proprietary solutions and plans for full and open competition at milestone B. The ONR S&T program aims to achieve 10 rounds per minute at 32 megajoules by fiscal year 2019. ONR is building barrels and incorporating lessons learned to reach this goal. The Navy's PEO IWS will handle shipboard integration and follow-on acquisition decisions. ONR's rep-rate composite launcher will achieve the desired rate by later this summer and plans to increase rep-rate and energy levels throughout the year. ONR is advancing pulse power technology for higher rep-rate and energy levels, achieving over one megajoule per cubic meter energy density. This scientific breakthrough allows for capacitors that can fit into ships for crewed and future combatants. Despite initial reports of the Navy's railgun program being dead, Adm. John Richardson confirmed continued investment and testing in the program. Adm. John Richardson confirmed continued investment and testing in the railgun program, aiming to increase firing rates and range. Despite reports of a shift in research efforts, the Navy remains committed to advancing railgun technology. The Navy is invested in developing the Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) with a range of 110 miles. The guided projectile for EMRG, known as the hypervelocity projectile (HVP), can also be fired from 5-inch and 155mm powder guns. The projectile reaches hypervelocity speeds when fired from EMRG, but flies slower when fired from powder guns. The Navy is considering using a different high-speed projectile for powder guns instead of the EMRG projectile. The high-speed projectile for powder guns, originally called HVP, is now referred to as the gun-launched guided projectile (GLGP) by the Navy. Both terms are still used, with HVP used in current development programs and GLGP for future acquisition programs. GLGP covers all guided projectile development efforts, including HVP, with an estimated unit procurement cost of about $85,000 in 2018. The Navy's gun-launched guided projectile (GLGP), formerly known as the high-speed projectile (HVP), has a procurement cost of about $85,000. It can be fired from 5-inch and 155mm guns already installed on Navy cruisers and destroyers, allowing for rapid proliferation once integrated into their combat systems. Launch packages for the GLGP are configured for different gun types, including EMRG. The Navy's gun-launched guided projectile (GLGP), also known as the high-speed projectile (HVP), is a next-generation, low drag, guided projectile designed for various gun systems like the Navy 5-Inch, 155-mm, and future railguns. It can perform multiple missions including Naval Surface Fire Support, Cruise Missile Defense, and Anti-Surface Warfare. The HVP's aerodynamic design allows for high velocity, maneuverability, and accurate guidance electronics, making it cost-effective against current threats and adaptable to future air and surface threats. Its compact design eliminates the need for a rocket motor to extend gun range, improving accuracy and reducing collateral damage.

The new technology aims to demonstrate to potential adversaries like China and Russia that U.S. military units can neutralize large missile salvos. The Deputy Secretary of Defense is pushing for a military exercise called 'Raid Breaker' to showcase the capabilities of the Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System program. The Pentagon is focusing on a new hypervelocity powder gun technology for missile defense to demonstrate the ability to neutralize large missile salvos. The Deputy Secretary of Defense is advocating for a military exercise called 'Raid Breaker' to showcase the capabilities of the Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System program, which could potentially intercept 95 to 98 out of 100 cruise and ballistic missiles. The Army Howitzer is now firing an electromagnetic Hyper Velocity Projectile, originally developed for the Navy, to enhance lethality in warzones and strategic locations. The Pentagon is also accelerating testing of the Electro-Magnetic Rail Gun. The Pentagon and Navy are expanding platforms for testing the high-tech Electro-Magnetic Rail Gun and potentially delaying an at-sea demonstration. The Hyper Velocity Projectile is being fired from an Army Howitzer to increase lethality and range for combat deployment. The Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office is developing a new missile defense system to engage multiple threats. The Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office is working on the Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP) to engage threats with different modes of operation based on the threat. The Army and Navy are planning to receive the HVP program from SCO, with the focus on proving the technology works for maneuvering close to threats. Sabio's role is to demonstrate the HVP's capability to engage threats effectively. The Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office is developing Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP) to engage various threats. The Navy conducted a successful test last summer, firing 20 HVPs from a standard Mk 45 5-inch deck gun during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 international exercise. This test demonstrated the effectiveness of using the 40-year-old deck gun design as a low-cost weapon against cruise missiles and larger unmanned aerial vehicles. Sabio's role is to showcase the HVP's capability to engage threats effectively before his program ends in less than a year. The Navy conducted a successful test during the RIMPAC exercise, showcasing the effectiveness of using a 40-year-old deck gun design as a low-cost weapon against cruise missiles and larger unmanned aerial vehicles. Development challenges remain for high-energy SSLs, including ruggedness for shipboard use and integration into the ship's systems. Success in overcoming these challenges is not guaranteed. The Office of Naval Research's program officer for the Navy's SSL program highlighted challenges in developing high-energy laser systems for maritime use, including heat management, power packing, efficiency, corrosion, contamination, and atmospheric turbulence. Progress has been made in demonstrating high-energy laser weapon systems in the maritime environment, but challenges such as turbulence causing diffusing and distorting of laser beams still exist. Additional advances are needed to scale power levels for robust, reliable, and affordable systems capable of engaging more challenging threats. ONR-managed programs are addressing these issues to prepare for acquisition and deployment with the fleet and force. Laser proponents argue that advancements in SSL technology and a shift to more realistic goals have changed the outlook for military lasers, despite past unfulfilled predictions. They suggest that skeptics may be overly cautious, likening them to a cat that won't sit on a hot plate again but also won't sit on a cold plate. The Navy's Railgun development challenges include increasing barrel life, improving the weapon's electrical power system, and integrating it with the ship's combat systems. The Railgun's Integrated Product Team is in the second phase of a two-phase development effort, with advancements made in launcher energy and barrel life. The Navy's Railgun development has seen advancements in launcher energy and barrel life. The focus is now on increasing rep-rate capability, which adds complexity to various sub-systems. A new test facility at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Virginia will support rep-rate testing. Additional rep-rate composite launchers are in design and fabrication stages. The Office of Naval Research is working on a tactical prototype railgun. The Office of Naval Research is developing a tactical prototype railgun launcher with devastating firepower capabilities. The Navy aims to deliver 35 pounds of metal moving at Mach 5.8, with ten shots per minute and 1,000 shots before barrel wear. Significant technical progress has been made, according to program manager Tom Boucher. The Navy's railgun, powered by electromagnetic pulses, was tested at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va. Another railgun is being set up at the Army's White Sands Missile Range for long-range testing. The new railgun can fire multiple shots per day, a significant improvement from previous test weapons. The Dahlgren team is increasing the firing rate of the railgun to 10 shots per minute and focusing on improving barrel life. New materials allow the current test weapons to last for hundreds of shots before needing replacement, aiming for a barrel that lasts 1,000 rounds. Transitioning military technology from research to procurement can be challenging. The Navy is advancing high-energy lasers and electromagnetic railgun programs to transition from research to procurement, aiming to install these technologies on ships. A Directed Energy Program Office has been established to accelerate the fielding of High Energy Laser weapon systems to the fleet. The Navy has established a Directed Energy Program Office to accelerate the fielding of High Energy Laser weapon systems to the fleet. Congress may have oversight questions regarding Navy programs for SNLWS, EMRG, and GLP, including the effectiveness of current air-defense weapons against adversaries like China and the development challenges for these systems. The Navy has questions regarding the development schedules and plans for procuring and installing SNLWS, EMRG, and GLGP on specific Navy ships. They are also considering if future surface ships will have the capability to fully utilize these systems and what changes may be needed in Navy procurement plans. Additionally, there are concerns about funding visibility and the Navy's commitment to completing the development of EMRG for deployment on Navy ships. Table 1 summarizes congressional action on selected Navy FY2020 research and development account line items related to shipboard lasers, EMRG, and GLGP. These PEs may not cover all Navy research and development work for these efforts. Shipboard lasers offer advantages like fast engagement times and low cost per shot. Shipboard lasers offer advantages like fast engagement times, low cost per shot, and the ability to counter radically maneuvering missiles. They can cause disabling damage to targets within seconds and redirect to another target quickly. Lasers are precision-engagement weapons that can also perform nonlethal functions such as detecting and monitoring targets and producing reversible jamming of electro-optic sensors. Shipboard lasers offer advantages like fast engagement times, low cost per shot, and the ability to counter radically maneuvering missiles. They can cause disabling damage to targets within seconds and redirect to another target quickly. Lasers can also perform nonlethal functions such as reversible jamming of electro-optic sensors. However, limitations include line of sight engagements and atmospheric interference. Atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence can affect the effectiveness of shipboard lasers. Water vapor and other substances in the atmosphere can absorb and scatter light, while turbulence can defocus a laser beam. Designing lasers to emit light at specific wavelengths can help maximize their effectiveness by reducing absorption. Adaptive optics can make fine adjustments to counter these atmospheric effects, with absorption generally increasing with distance to the target. Thermal blooming can reduce the effectiveness of lasers by heating up the air and defocusing the beam, making them less suitable for countering targets coming straight at the ship. Laser systems have been tested more against crossing targets than \"down-the-throat\" shots. Most laser tests focus on crossing targets rather than direct shots. Thermal blooming is a concern as laser power increases. Saturation attacks limit a laser's ability to disable multiple targets quickly. Installing multiple lasers on a ship can help mitigate this limitation. Less powerful lasers may be less effective against hardened targets and countermeasures. Less powerful lasers in kilowatts (kW) may be less effective against targets with shielding, ablative material, or highly reflective surfaces, or that rotate rapidly. Small boats could use obscurants to reduce susceptibility to laser attacks, but this could increase cost and weight of the weapon. There is a risk of collateral damage to aircraft, satellites, and human eyesight from upward-pointing lasers. The Navy's SSLs can cause permanent damage to human eyesight, including blinding, at ranges much greater than those for damaging targeted objects. Laser light scattering off targets, fog, or particulates in the air poses a risk to exposed eyes."
