    "content": "The \"Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998\" requires the reevaluation of regulations on medical kit equipment and training for flight attendants within a year of enactment. If modifications are deemed necessary, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be issued. Additionally, the Act mandates reports on deaths that occur on aircraft. During the 1-year period after the enactment of the Act, major air carriers must report quarterly to the FAA Administrator on the number of deaths on their aircraft, including age and cause of death, whether the aircraft was diverted, and any other requested information. The FAA Administrator may request additional information to aid in deciding whether to require defibrillators in airports or on aircraft operated by air carriers. The format for reports submitted under this section may be specified by the Administrator. SEC. 4. DECISION ON AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must decide within 120 days whether to require automatic external defibrillators on passenger aircraft and at airports. The decision will be in the form of a notice of proposed rulemaking or a recommendation to Congress. The Administrator must make a final decision within 120 days on whether automatic external defibrillators should be required on passenger aircraft. If required, the proposal must include details on aircraft size, types of flights, personnel training, and medical kit contents. The proposed rulemaking or recommendation for automatic external defibrillators on aircraft and airports should include details on airport size, training for personnel, and required equipment. The Administrator cannot mandate defibrillators on helicopters or aircraft with a payload capacity of 7,500 pounds or less. If defibrillators are required at airports, the airports are responsible for providing them. SEC. 5. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.

The term \"medically qualified individual\" includes licensed, certified, or otherwise qualified individuals to provide medical care in a State. \"Medically qualified individuals can provide medical care in a State, such as physicians, nurses, physician assistants, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians.\" The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
