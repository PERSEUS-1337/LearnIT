The Act allows for special valuation of sensitive environmental areas in a decedent's estate through an environmental preservation easement lasting 10 years. Qualified heirs must maintain the easement, or face additional estate tax. An additional estate tax is imposed to maintain an environmental preservation easement in a sensitive environmental area. The amount of the tax is based on the adjusted tax difference or the excess of the amount realized from the interest over the environmental use value.

The additional tax is due 6 months after a failure, and the qualified heir may need to provide a bond. The qualified heir may be personally liable for additional tax unless a bond is provided in lieu of personal liability. The Secretary determines the maximum amount of additional tax, and upon furnishing a required bond, the heir is discharged from personal liability.
