    "content": "The \"Maritime Safety Act of 2000\" establishes requirements for response plans for nontank vessels under Chapter 48 of the United States Code. The \"Maritime Safety Act of 2000\" under Chapter 48 of the United States Code defines terms such as 'covered vessel', 'maritime cooperative', and 'response plan' for oil spill prevention and cleanup in navigable waters. The \"Maritime Safety Act of 2000\" in Chapter 48 of the United States Code requires vessels over 300 gross tons carrying oil as fuel to have an approved response plan for operations on US navigable waters. The Secretary must approve and renew these plans every 5 years, with regulations setting minimum requirements issued by January 1, 2003. Response plans required under Chapter 48 of the United States Code for vessels over 300 gross tons carrying oil must include details on responding to oil spills, personnel, materials, equipment needed, coordination with state contingency plans, early detection, and notification procedures to authorities. The response plan for vessels over 300 gross tons carrying oil must demonstrate ownership of an emergency response communications network, detail personnel training and fitness, include training programs for readiness, and outline measures to protect the environment from oil spills. The response plan for vessels over 300 gross tons carrying oil should include detailed equipment, training, and procedures to minimize vessel damage and oil spills, prepositioning of cleanup equipment and personnel, arrangements for cleanup personnel, disposal of recovered oil, measures to prevent spills, and information on available response equipment. Response plans for vessels must be submitted to the Secretary within 12 months. Plans can be submitted by the vessel owner, facility operator, or a maritime cooperative. A person contracted to provide containment and cleanup services for vessel operations can submit a response plan. They may submit a single plan for multiple vessels they are responsible for. Maritime cooperatives can also submit a response plan for vessels owned or operated by their members, with a lien on the vessels for operating assessments. Sec. 4806. Review and approval of response plans includes factors like containment and cleanup equipment, personnel, communication, notification procedures, response time, and vessel traffic in the area covered by the plan. The factors considered in the review and approval of response plans include the volume and type of oil being transported, navigational hazards, spill history, sensitivity of natural resources, previous spill information, incorporation of spill prevention measures, and the number of vessels and facilities in the area. The Secretary may approve a response plan if it meets requirements for prompt oil removal with minimal environmental damage. On approval of a response plan, the Secretary issues a certificate to the person who submitted it, including vessel details and renewal dates. Owners must notify the Secretary of any significant changes affecting the approved plan, and updates may be required. Holders of approved plans are not in violation by providing information. The Secretary may impose terms on response plan approval to ensure access to resources, maintain personnel levels, and compliance. The Secretary may require response plans to use best available technology and demonstrate readiness through training, exercises, and equipment verification. State may approve vessel response plans if their requirements align with federal standards. The Secretary may require response plans to use best available technology and demonstrate readiness through training, exercises, and equipment verification. State approval of vessel response plans must align with federal standards. The Secretary cannot delegate authority to regulate vessel design, construction, equipment, manning, training, or operational requirements to a State. Approval of a response plan by the Secretary does not guarantee its adequacy or serve as a defense to liability under Federal or State law. SEC. 3 amends Section 1004 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to increase limits of liability for nontank vessels. SEC. 4 addresses voyage data recorders. Section 3305 of title 46, United States Code, now requires certain vessels to be equipped with a voyage data recorder as prescribed by the Secretary. This applies to small passenger vessels carrying more than 100 passengers, high-speed commercial vessels, and passenger vessels built after June 30, 2002. Additionally, roll-on-roll-off passenger vessels on international voyages built before July 1, 2000, must comply with this requirement starting June 30, 2002. Starting from January 1, 2004, certain regulations apply to passenger and freight vessels based on their size and build date. These regulations include requirements for voyage data recorders on international voyages. Starting from January 1, 2009, freight vessels between 3,000 and 20,000 gross tons on international voyages must comply with new regulations if built before July 1, 2002. SEC. 5 amends Section 6301 of title 46, United States Code to include responses to marine casualties and improve response to future casualties. SEC. 6 introduces an automated information system. Vessels operating on US waters must have a transponder and display device as per regulations by the Secretary of Transportation. This includes vessels subject to Public Law 92-63, small passenger vessels carrying a certain number of passengers, and towing vessels except those assisting disabled small vessels. The Secretary may exempt vessels from transponder requirements if not necessary for safe navigation. Regulations by the Secretary of Transportation include transponder operation and maintenance. Starting July 1, 2002, vessels built after that date and operating within Vessel Traffic Service boundaries must comply. Starting July 1, 2003, passenger vessels and tankers must also comply. Starting July 1, 2005, transponder requirements apply to all vessels except passenger vessels, tankers, and towing vessels moving a tank vessel. SEC. 7 of the Port and Waterways Safety Act now includes SEC. 15, granting authority to prohibit loading and unloading of vessels. The Secretary has the authority to prohibit vessel activities in US ports if a country fails to enforce safety standards. Within a year, the Secretary must identify countries with the most detained vessels for safety violations and report on their enforcement efforts. Innocent passage and transit are not affected by this provision. Entry into US waters by vessels under international agreements is not prevented by this provision. The Secretary of Transportation will propose the elimination of single hull bunker tanks on commercial vessels carrying more than 1,000 barrels of fuel. This includes prohibiting the operation of vessels built after January 1, 2004, with a single hull bunker tank and establishing a phaseout schedule for older vessels with single hull bunker tanks."
