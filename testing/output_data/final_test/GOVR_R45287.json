Certain restrictions apply, such as prohibiting private bills for pensions, certain bridge construction, military or naval record corrections, or claims covered by the Tort Claims Act.

Private bills in the House of Representatives are typically introduced by the Member representing named individuals for their relief. The sponsor must submit specified documentation and request a hearing for the subcommittee to consider the bill. The subcommittee usually only hears from the sponsor and provides information to Member offices on required documentation. If there are few precedents for favorable House action, the bill may not be reported. Special procedures are established for the consideration of private bills, which are placed on the Private Calendar for monthly consideration. Private Calendar in the House of Representatives follows specific procedures for considering bills, known as \"the House as in Committee of the Whole.\" Bills are automatically called up in order, with no general debate but possible five-minute rule amendments.

Each party appoints official \"objectors\" to review bills on the Private Calendar. In the House of Representatives, the Private Calendar follows specific procedures for considering bills. Official \"objectors\" review bills and may ask for a bill to be passed over informally.

Private bills in the House of Representatives follow specific procedures for consideration. Once a private bill is passed, it may be broken up into separate bills for further action. Committees rarely re-report private measures once recommitted, and omnibus private bills have not been considered in decades.

Presidents can veto private bills, which Congress can override in the same way as public measures. Private claims bills may be referred to the Court of Claims for recommendations, which are advisory but often followed."
