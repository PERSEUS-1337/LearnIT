    "content": "The Bush Administration requested $8.73 billion for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) budget in FY2006, with $3.3 billion allocated for the Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) program. Both the House and Senate passed bills providing funding for MDA, with additional funds allocated for the ground-based missile interceptor program. The House appropriations bill includes $8.58 billion for MDA, while the Senate bill provides $200 million more for the ground-based missile defense interceptor program and $65 million for the Israeli Arrow system. The Bush Administration requested $8.73 billion for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) budget in FY2006, with $3.3 billion allocated for the Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) program. Congress and others have raised questions and concerns over several missile defense programs, including the Airborne Laser, the SSTS, and the BMD System Interceptor program. Recent milestones reported by MDA include successful intercepts by the Navy's sea-based missile defense program and deployment of the 10th operational interceptor of the GMD system. The Bush Administration presented its proposed approach to missile defense to Congress, differing from the previous Clinton Administration's approach. Congress supported the President's plan with some adjustments and funding reductions for certain programs. In 2002, the Administration announced plans to deploy initial missile defense capabilities in 2004-2005, with eight interceptors in Alaska and California. This report provides background information and discusses key issues related to the Bush Administration's missile defense approach. The report discusses key issues related to the proposed missile defense approach, including ballistic missile proliferation and technology challenges. It also addresses the potential deployment timeline and acquisition policy considerations. The report summarizes the Administration's proposed missile defense program, including program and budget data, technical challenges, and congressional action. The United States has spent over $85 billion on missile defense since the Reagan SDI in FY1985. The debate over deploying defenses against ballistic missile threats has been divisive, especially after the demise of the Soviet Union. The changing international security environment has shifted focus from concerns about nuclear stability between the US and Russia to worries about possible attacks from adversaries with limited missiles. Without missile defense capability, the US may be deterred from using conventional forces to protect allies and combat aggressive actions from rogue states armed with weapons of mass destruction. The debate now includes the threat of terrorist acquisition of ballistic missiles with WMDs. The Clinton Administration responded to the changing international security environment by pursuing theater missile defense (TMD) to protect allies and forces from shorter and medium-range ballistic missiles. They also aimed to develop a limited national missile defense (NMD) system to protect U.S. territory from longer-range ballistic missiles, which conflicted with the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty with Russia. Negotiations were made to modify the treaty for the deployment of a limited NMD site in Alaska. The Clinton Administration pursued theater missile defense (TMD) and a limited national missile defense (NMD) system, leading to negotiations to modify the ABM Treaty for a NMD site in Alaska. The Bush Administration shifted the debate on missile defense, emphasizing the development of technologies for land, sea, and space deployment to protect against rogue nations' ballistic missile attacks. President Bush called for a new framework beyond the constraints of the ABM Treaty, reassuring Russia that the U.S. deployment of missile defenses was not directed against them. The Bush Administration outlined plans for missile defenses in July 2001, requesting $8.3 billion for missile defense in the FY2002 budget. They aimed to explore a broader range of technologies and basing modes, increasing funding evenly for missile defense and sensor technologies. The Bush Administration aimed to integrate key components in the missile defense program, eliminating distinctions between theater and national missile defenses. The focus was on developing a single integrated BMD system and aggressively evaluating technologies for land, sea, and air integration. The Bush Administration's goal is to aggressively develop technologies for integrated land, sea, air, or space-based platforms for a global system of layered defenses capable of intercepting missiles at all stages of flight. Layered defenses provide multiple opportunities to target attacking missiles and complicate an attacker's ability to defeat the system by using countermeasures effective in one phase but not others. The Bush Administration's missile defense program focuses on robust research and development of various technologies without a specific architecture or deployment schedule. The goal is early deployment of a defense against missiles targeting U.S. territory, but cost estimates are not provided yet. The Bush Administration's missile defense program aims to develop effective systems over time and deploy them incrementally, using an evolutionary acquisition strategy. This approach differs from traditional military acquisition programs and may face increased scrutiny. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz stated that the ABM Treaty stood in the way of the Administration's missile defense efforts during congressional testimony in July 2001. The ABM Treaty hindered the Bush Administration's missile defense efforts, with concerns that tests could exceed Treaty limits. President Bush and President Putin agreed to discuss offensive weapons and defense systems, leading to consultations but not negotiations for new treaties. The Bush Administration sought to convince Russia to set aside the ABM Treaty and replace it with a new framework for their relationship. Despite sharing information about missile defense developments, Russia did not accept the U.S. approach, leading to the U.S. withdrawal from the Treaty on June 13, 2002. The ABM Treaty was terminated on June 13, 2002, and the Administration announced a plan for missile defense deployment on December 17, 2002. Russia and China are the only countries capable of attacking the US with ICBMs, while other countries may aspire to join this club. Factors like financial resources, political will, and non-proliferation regimes influence missile development. Countries outside of Russia and China could pose future threats globally. The proliferation challenge from countries like Russia and China, along with others, continues to grow with the steady increase in ballistic missile capabilities. While the number of countries with ICBMs remains small, there is a widespread ability to launch shorter to medium range missiles, posing regional threats to U.S. forces. The transition to ICBMs is more about technical expertise than technology, with the potential for longer-range missiles to develop over time. The transition from shorter to medium-range missiles to ICBMs is primarily a matter of technical expertise in developing larger propulsion systems and multi-stage missiles. Countries lacking domestic expertise can import it. The United States monitors ballistic missile development in critical countries like Russia, which has the most significant ballistic missile inventory with approximately 700 ICBMs capable of delivering over 3,000 nuclear warheads. Russia currently has around 700 ICBMs capable of delivering over 3,000 nuclear warheads. Despite these numbers, the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces have been in decline due to various factors. The production of new SS-27 ICBMs has slowed, and older SS-18 and SS-24 ICBMs will be retained instead of being destroyed under START II ceilings. Russia will retain 154 SS-18 Satan heavy ICBMs and 36 SS-24 Scalpel ICBMs under START II ceilings. The SS-27 Topol-M ICBM, deployed in 1997, could potentially carry 3 to 6 warheads. Russia claims to have developed missile defense countermeasures for the SS-27, but independent sources have not confirmed this. The Defense Intelligence Agency predicts Russia will focus on the SS-27 program in the next five years. China's ICBM force consists of liquid propellant, single warhead, silo-based missiles, including CSS-4 missiles that can reach the United States. They also have CSS-3 ICBMs deployed as a deterrent force. China is developing mobile, solid propellant ICBMs and is projected to have most of their land-based ICBMs mobile by 2015. They are also developing solid-fueled DF-31 ICBMs for various basing options. China has tested medium-range ballistic missiles with dummy warheads designed to defeat missile defense systems. They are capable of developing multiple reentry vehicles for their missiles, but face technical and cost challenges. China deploys short-range missiles across the Taiwan Strait and has offered to reduce numbers if Taiwan scales back arms purchases. China has also exported missile technologies to several countries. Iraq is believed to have upwards of 20 Al Hussein SRBMs. Iraq is believed to have around 20 Al Hussein SRBMs and a dozen transporter, erector, launchers in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 687. The London-based Institute for Strategic Studies suggests the number could be fewer. Iraq is working on extending the range of its short-range missiles beyond the permitted 150 km. Iran has a large missile inventory, including SCUD-Bs, SCUD-Cs, and Chinese CSS-8 missiles. They have successfully tested these missiles. Iran has a missile program consisting of SCUD-Bs, SCUD-Cs, and Chinese CSS-8 missiles. They have also developed Shahab-3 MRBMs with a range of 1,300 kms and Shahab-IV with a range of 2,200 kms. Iran is believed to be developing a Shahab-V with an unspecified range, with assistance from Russia, China, and North Korea. U.S. intelligence agencies predict that Iran may not be able to launch an ICBM/SLV until the later half of the decade. North Korea's recent actions suggest a possible resumption of missile testing, including the Taepo Dong 2 missile capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and parts of the U.S. mainland. If a third stage is integrated, the missile's range could extend to strike all of North America. North Korea's SCUD and No Dong missiles pose a significant WMD threat to U.S. and allied forces, with exports to countries like Pakistan and Yemen intercepted in the past. India is aggressively developing ballistic missiles, including the Prithvi I and Prithvi II, as well as the Agni-series with a range of 2,000 km. These missiles are expected to become operational in the next few years and will be India's main MRBM forces. India is actively developing ballistic missiles, including the Surya program which could be converted into an ICBM within one to two years. They are also working on the Sagarika SLBM and seeking nuclear submarines for SLBM deployment. Pakistan is pursuing missile-delivered nuclear weapons as a deterrent to India's nuclear program and conventional forces, developing indigenous ballistic missile production capacity with missiles like the Hatf I and Hatf III. Pakistan is developing various missiles with ranges of 300 kms to 3,000 kms, including the Ghauri and Shaheen II missiles. Libya faced sanctions that hindered its missile development, but has since tried to refurbish its SCUD force and acquire long-range missile systems. Syria possesses a mobile SCUD-B, SCUD-C, and SS-21 SRBM arsenal, allowing it to strike deep into the territories of potential regional adversaries. As regional security prospects worsen, Syria may seek longer-range missile systems like the NoDong MRBM. The concept of hit-to-kill has been a focus of missile defense programs since the 1980s. The United States has been developing missile defense programs since the 1980s, initially using nuclear weapons as interceptors. Over time, more conventional explosive warheads were used, such as the PAC-2 system in the Persian Gulf war. Advanced concepts like lasers were considered impractical. The kinetic kill interceptor aims to destroy its target through direct collision at high speeds, rendering the attacking missile inoperable. Despite initial failures, kinetic kill is proving effective against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. The THAAD and PAC-3 missile defense systems are showing promise in successful tests for developing kinetic kill warheads. The effectiveness of these systems in wartime remains a key question, as operational conditions may differ from test-range conditions. The Patriot system's performance in Desert Storm serves as an example of this discrepancy. The effectiveness of kinetic kill warheads for missile defense remains debatable, with doubts raised about the success of tests and claims of exaggerated results. Critics argue that test targets were enhanced for higher success rates, casting doubt on the reliability of kinetic kill for ICBM defense. Some missile defense advocates believe that continued development and realistic testing are necessary to ensure the success of kinetic kill for long-range missiles. Layered defense systems involve deploying multiple missile defense systems to intercept threats at different stages of flight, providing multiple intercept opportunities. Proponents argue that layered defenses with multiple intercept opportunities increase the chance of destroying attacking missiles or warheads. Each layer targets different vulnerabilities independently, leading to a cumulative probability of interception. Some analysts question the effectiveness of defense systems with high interception probabilities, suggesting a more realistic approach. The probability of an attacking missile or warhead surviving a layered defense system is around 34 percent, not 30 percent as previously assumed. The layers in the defense system are not statistically independent, as the performance of one layer can affect the performance of the next layer. Failure of one layer can lead to saturation of the next, even if each layer is over designed by a factor of 2. The failure of an early layer in a layered defense system can lead to the collapse of the entire missile defense system, as the layers are not statistically independent and the performance of one layer can affect the next. Testing under realistic conditions is necessary to address potential issues with command and control among the layers and unknown variables that could degrade the system unpredictably. The effectiveness of a layered missile defense system is uncertain, as the performance of one layer can impact the entire system. Critics argue that the system may not perform better than the best layer if it becomes overwhelmed by multiple missiles or countermeasures. Proponents believe these issues can be addressed in the design and development of the defense architecture. Acquisition strategy and congressional oversight are also important factors in the debate over missile defense. Some critics are concerned about the Administration's management approach to the missile defense program, specifically regarding the use of evolutionary acquisition, exemptions from reporting requirements, and classification of certain information. Supporters argue that these measures are necessary for the program's efficiency and to prevent adversaries from learning how to evade U.S. missile defense systems. The Administration's missile defense program is criticized for using evolutionary acquisition and exemptions from reporting requirements, which could hinder Congress's oversight. Spiral development is a new approach for developing and acquiring major weapon systems, aiming to prevent adversaries from learning how to evade U.S. missile defense systems. The DOD is implementing spiral development as a new standard acquisition strategy for major weapon systems, aiming to achieve goals such as faster deployment, risk mitigation, user feedback incorporation, and technology integration throughout the system's life cycle. Missile defense was the first program to adopt spiral development, with plans to apply it to other major weapon acquisition programs like the Navy's DD(X) next-generation surface. Evolutionary acquisition involves developing and fielding a basic version of a weapon system, with plans to subsequently enhance it over time through spiral development. This approach allows for incremental evolution of the system to meet required objectives, rather than aiming for a fully detailed military requirement upon initial deployment. The Administration's proposed missile defense effort involves evolutionary development, focusing on incremental evolution of the system to meet objectives over time. This approach treats the final configuration as an open question to be addressed as elements of the system are developed, deployed, evaluated, and modified. The plan applies evolutionary acquisition and spiral development to a family of system development efforts related to missile defense. Systems would be built, tested, deployed, and evaluated incrementally under this evolving concept. The Administration's plan for missile defense involves incremental development and evaluation of systems over time. The final missile defense architecture will be determined gradually, with systems competing for placement based on their capabilities. Deploying missile defenses sooner with less capability is seen as desirable to complicate enemy planning and strengthen deterrence against ballistic missile attacks. The Administration's proposed evolutionary acquisition strategy for missile defense programs involves incremental development and evaluation of systems over time, without traditional DOD acquisition phases and milestones. This approach aims to address less mature technologies compared to established weapons like aircraft and ships. As a result, BMDO is unable to provide Congress with a final missile defense architecture, specific testing and deployment dates, total program cost estimates, or funding requirements beyond individual years. Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish introduced the Administration's missile-defense plan in July 2001, emphasizing that the program does not commit to a specific architecture, procurement program, or deployment dates. The approach includes flexible RDT&E to explore multiple development paths and an acquisition strategy that hedges against the uncertainty of ballistic missile defense challenges. The missile defense program introduced in July 2001 aims to address the ballistic missile defense challenge through an evolutionary acquisition approach. It involves deploying various combinations of sensors and weapons over time to align with national strategic objectives. A robust RDT&E program will prioritize activities showing the most promise, guiding high-level decision-making processes annually. The program will consider optimal approaches and reliable cost information for informed research, production, and deployment decisions. The missile defense program introduced in July 2001 aims to address the ballistic missile defense challenge through an evolutionary acquisition approach. The defense system will evolve over time, with specific system choices and timelines shaping up through a capability-based, block approach. The program is organized to develop militarily useful capabilities as technologies mature and are proven through testing. The missile defense program introduced in July 2001 aims to develop militarily useful capabilities in biannual blocks, starting as early as 2004-2006. The program deviates from standard acquisition processes to address unprecedented technical challenges. A new approach to BMD development features streamlined, flexible management through comprehensive annual reviews to shape evolving systems and allocate resources optimally. The Administration and its supporters argue that using spiral development for the missile defense program will not hinder Congress's oversight ability, as Congress will still approve each block in the program with more reliable information. Critics, however, believe that this approach may reduce Congress's oversight effectiveness by approving programs with vague outlines. The Secretary of Defense exempted the missile defense program from certain reporting requirements in 2002 to streamline management and oversight, potentially hindering Congress's ability to measure program performance and causing funding projections to be more volatile. The Administration classified certain information about the missile defense program in 2002 to prevent adversaries from learning about U.S. missile defense systems, potentially limiting Congress's oversight capabilities. The Administration classified information about the missile defense program in 2002 to prevent adversaries from learning about U.S. missile defense systems. Critics argue that the decision to classify some information is to shield the program from public scrutiny. The Air-Based Boost program, also known as the Airborne Laser (ABL), would use a high-power chemical laser mounted on a modified Boeing 747 to shoot down theater missiles in their boost phase. The Air-Based Boost program, also known as the Airborne Laser (ABL), aims to use a high-power laser to damage the missile's booster skin during its boost phase of flight, causing it to lose thrust and fall short of its target. The program's major subsystems include a lethal laser, a tracking system, and adaptive optics to compensate for atmospheric effects. The ABL program was transferred to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) from the Air Force, with plans to evaluate boost-phase defense projects for a potential architecture decision between 2003 and 2005. The Air-Based Boost program, also known as the Airborne Laser (ABL), aims to use a high-power laser to damage the missile's booster skin during its boost phase of flight. The most recent cost estimate for the program was $10.7 billion, with Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and TRW as the main contractors. The system under development is set to attempt its first missile shoot-down test in 2005. The Air-Based Boost program, also known as the Airborne Laser (ABL), is currently under development and is scheduled to attempt its first missile shoot-down test in 2005. The half-power ABL could be available for deployment as an emergency capability immediately following lethality demonstrations in late 2005. If successful, the system and the next two could provide an initial operating capability between FY2009 and FY2011. Congressional concerns focus on the maturity of key technologies and the concept of operations, with critics questioning the experimental nature of certain aspects, such as the atmospheric compensation system. The development of the Air-Based Boost program, also known as the Airborne Laser (ABL), is facing scheduling concerns due to compressed timelines and concurrent activities. The Defense Department's Office of Test and Evaluation has raised alarms about the short 24-month Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) program schedule. There are doubts about the operational effectiveness of the ABL, even if its technology performs as planned. The ABL's ability to destroy enemy missiles depends on various factors like atmospheric conditions and enemy countermeasures. Technical countermeasures include hardening missile casing and applying a polished finish. Deployment during crisis or war relies on air superiority for a safe area of operations. The uncertainty exists regarding enemy actions before ABL deployment and the sustainability of ABL aircraft on combat patrols. The Space-Based Boost program aims to develop the capability to shoot down ballistic missiles in their boost phase from orbit using space-based laser and kinetic weapons. Congressional funding for this program is decreasing, with the Bush Administration requesting $170 million for space-based laser development in FY2002. The Integrated Flight Experiment and test center for the space-based laser program were cancelled due to insufficient funding from Congress. The Bush Administration's FY2003 request for the program was $34 million, aimed at reducing technical risks. Congress reduced the request by $10 million in its FY2003 appropriations. The space-based kinetic energy component focuses on developing key component technologies for boost phase intercept. Development work and experiments are being conducted to further develop key component technologies for boost phase intercept, including the kinetickill vehicle, boosters, sensors, battle management and control, and platform integration. The Bush Administration requested $53 million for FY2003, but Congress cut the request by $50 million, emphasizing the acceleration of existing systems like the PAC-3. Issues related to space-based boost phase intercept include the potential dual-use as an anti-satellite weapon, which is a controversial topic. The Sea-Based Boost program, part of the missile defense program, aims to use sea-based missiles to intercept enemy ballistic missiles in their boost phase. The technical challenges of space-based interceptors, such as lasers, remain uncertain, requiring demonstration programs to overcome hurdles. The ABM Treaty previously prohibited testing and deploying these systems in an ABM mode. The sea-based boost-defense concept aims to intercept enemy ballistic missiles during the boost phase, especially from countries like North Korea, Libya, or Iran. It is most feasible for missiles launched close to international waters, increasing the chance of interception. However, it offers little potential against long-range Russian or Chinese missiles. Sea-Based Boost program aims to intercept enemy ballistic missiles during the boost phase, but offers little potential against long-range Russian or Chinese missiles due to their deep inland launch sites. A robust sea-based boost system would require an interceptor missile with higher speed, acceleration, and a different kill vehicle than the Sea-Based Midcourse system. The Sea-Based Boost program requires a high-speed missile with a different kill vehicle than the Sea-Based Midcourse system. Using the same interceptor missile for both programs could reduce sea-based missile defense costs. The SM-3 missile, originally designed for theater-range ballistic missiles, may have potential to intercept certain ICBMs fired from coastal launch pads during the boost phase. The radar on Aegis combatants can detect and track ICBMs during boost phase, but system optimization is focused on defending against cruise missiles and airborne-launched missiles. Required modifications for ICBM defense are being considered. The SM-3 missile, originally designed for theater-range ballistic missiles, may have potential to intercept certain ICBMs fired from coastal launch pads during the boost phase. Developers are considering modifications for ICBM defense, including the need for a suitable boost-phase missile interceptor. One proposed approach is to develop a missile interceptor to engage boosting ICBMs later in their boost phase above the atmosphere, allowing ships to be up to 1,000 kilometers from the launch site. Successful boost-phase intercept missiles would need to be faster than the current test missiles. Boost-phase intercept missiles, like the modified SM-3 or wide-diameter missiles, could be used on U.S. Navy ships in international waters to engage missiles from North Korea or Iraq. The effectiveness against Iranian ICBMs would vary, requiring potential ground-based or airborne support. Sea-based boost-phase interceptors offer political advantages by defending against threats from North Korea and the Middle East without impacting Russia or China's land-based ICBM deterrents. A sea-based boost-phase system could potentially threaten Russia's submarine-launched deterrent. Establishing a \"no-launch zone\" and delegating engagement decisions politically may be challenging. Launching interceptors in the direction of the country launching ICBMs and third parties not involved is necessary. Launches against North Korean missiles would entail launches towards both North Korea and China. Launching interceptors against Iraqi and Iranian missiles would also be required. The Sea-Based Boost program is considering high-speed boost-phase missile interceptors for defense against Iraqi and Iranian missile launches. The interceptors could potentially impact uninvolved countries with debris from engagements. The program aims to deter and dissuade countries like North Korea and Iran, but may be less effective against former adversaries. The operational advantages outweigh the political disadvantages, according to MDA Director Kadish in July 2001. The Sea-Based Boost program is considering high-speed boost-phase missile interceptors for defense against Iraqi and Iranian missile launches. General Kadish mentioned in July 2001 that MDA is looking at concepts for boost-phase defense using kinetic energy as a hedge against technical issues in other programs. A modified Standard Missile-3 with a new kinetic kill vehicle may be included in experiments planned for fiscal year 2004. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) plans to spend over $2 billion through FY-07 to develop a boost-phase interceptor that could be launched from a Navy ship. The agency and the Navy will develop mission requirements for early critical experiments (ECE) scheduled for FY-04, including a modified Standard Missile-3 with a new Generation 1 boost kill vehicle. Additionally, a concept definition and assessment study will look at candidate kinetic energy boost elements of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. The study is assessing a broad range of boost concepts for the Ballistic Missile Defense System, including sea, space, air, and ground basing modes. Critical experiments will be conducted in FY-03-05 to mitigate risks and may lead to a focused demonstration of a specific basing mode. The Defense Science Board recommended focusing missile defense efforts on two main approaches in August 2002. In August 2002, the DOD recommended focusing on a ground-based midcourse system and a sea-based boost and ascent-phase system for missile defense. One boost-phase activity involves modifying the lightweight exoatmospheric projectile (Leap) to gather data on a boosting target. The goal is to determine if an infrared sensor can detect the missile, with plans to replace Leap's solid-fuel divert and attitude control system with a larger, liquid fuel system for increased maneuverability. The seeker has difficulty finding the missile in higher altitudes and thinner atmosphere due to hot gases. Modifications may include adding an ultraviolet sensor or laser radar to the IR sensor. Raytheon is testing a modified SM-3 missile for potential use in an operational configuration with high acceleration and velocity. MDA is considering developing a multi-use boost-phase interceptor with a speed of around 6 km/s. MDA is considering developing a 'multi-use' boost-phase interceptor with a speed of around 6 km/s that could be launched from navy ships, operated from land, airborne, and potentially have space applications. Tests to intercept a boosting missile are expected to be conducted no later than 2005. Later, the same interceptor booster may be evaluated with a different kill vehicle for mid-course use. The United States is developing a missile defense system to protect against intercontinental-range ballistic missile attacks. The system includes various radars, surveillance platforms, and communication components. The Administration has initiated the Pacific Missile Defense Testbed to establish a ground-based ICBM defense capability. The United States plans to field initial missile defense capabilities in 2004-2005 to counter ballistic missile threats to the U.S. homeland, deployed forces, and allies. This includes up to 20 ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California, as well as sea-based interceptors on Aegis ships. The United States plans to deploy missile defense systems to intercept ballistic missiles during their boost and ascent phases. This includes air-transportable PAC-3 systems, land, sea, and space-based sensors, and additional measures like more interceptors and basing platforms. Construction for the Ft. Greely site began in 2002, with the initial ground-based midcourse testbed to be completed by September 2004. The test bed aims to validate the ground-based midcourse concept and enhance realism. The test bed aims to validate the ground-based midcourse concept and improve interceptor tests. Key parts of the testbed are planned in Alaska, California, Colorado, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Costs for the system have not been provided, but the Clinton Administration considered deploying a system of 100 ground-based interceptors in Alaska at a cost of $36 billion. The NMD program has faced technical challenges, including delays in testing the rocket booster. The NMD program has faced technical challenges, including ongoing delays in testing the rocket booster and uncertainties in the Integrated Flight Test program. Debate surrounds the success of post-intercept test analyses, with concerns about artificially enhanced target missiles. Despite program delays, non-intercept objectives have been largely successful in testing missile launch, flight, and interceptor performance. On December 11, 2002, the Missile Defense Agency announced the failure of the 8th intercept test in the ground-based midcourse research program due to the kill vehicle and booster rocket not separating. Previous tests had mixed results, with successful interceptions in some tests and failures in others. The program was described as having faced technical challenges and delays, but non-intercept objectives were considered successful. The Sea-Based Midcourse program has had successful intercept tests, including the use of a ship-based SPY-1 radar. However, recent planned intercept flight tests have been delayed, raising questions about the effectiveness of the BMD interceptors deployed in Alaska. The program is intended to intercept hostile missiles in the ascent phase of midcourse flight. The Sea-Based Midcourse program aims to intercept hostile missiles in the ascent phase of midcourse flight, enhancing the overall BMD system's defense capabilities. The program involves spending $3.3 billion between FY2003 and FY2007, with major contractors including Raytheon Missile Systems and Lockheed Martin Naval Electronic and Surveillance Systems. The system is based on Navy's Aegis ships equipped with SPY-1 radar, similar to the NTW program. The Navy's NTW program aims to intercept theater-range ballistic missiles using the powerful SPY-1 radar. This involves modifying the radar and developing the SM-3 interceptor with a third-stage rocket motor and a kinetic kill vehicle. MDA Director Kadish's plan for Sea-Based Midcourse is to enhance the BMD system's defense capabilities. The Administration plans to develop and deploy the Sea-Based Midcourse system to intercept faster-flying intercontinental ballistic missiles. The basic version may be ready for deployment in 2005 or 2006, with a more advanced version capable of intercepting ICBMs ready several years later. The system was successfully tested three times in 2002, achieving intercepts on Aries target ballistic missiles. The Sea-Based Midcourse system was successfully tested three times in 2002, with intercepts on Aries target ballistic missiles. The tests in January and June involved descent-phase intercepts, while the November test was the first in a series of six flight tests aiming to deploy the system as a defense against theater-range ballistic missiles. The upcoming tests will explore the potential for the SM-3 to intercept ballistic missiles in more complex scenarios. The tests will investigate the SM-3's capability to intercept ballistic missiles at lower altitudes in space, potentially replacing the now-cancelled Navy Area Defense program. Improvements to the Sea-Based Midcourse system may include modifications to Aegis ships' radars and the development of a larger, higher-speed missile than the SM-3. The Navy is considering options for a faster missile. The Navy is considering options for a higher-speed missile, including the Faster SM-3 with a range of 1,000 kilometers and a maximum speed of 4.5 kps, and the Enhanced SM-3 with a range of 1,500 kilometers. The Navy is considering options for a higher-speed missile, including the Faster SM-3 with a range of 1,000 kilometers and a maximum speed of 4.5 kps, and the Enhanced SM-3 with a range of 1,500 kilometers. Japan is also participating in a cooperative development program for a new missile, referred to as the Standard Missile 27 or the 6-Pack missile, with a range of more than 1,500 kilometers and a maximum speed of 6.5 kps. Japan is collaborating with MDA to develop technologies for improving the SM-3 missile. A higher-speed missile could be used for both Sea-Based Midcourse and Sea-Based Boost systems, potentially reducing costs. Additionally, MDA plans to build a sea-based X-band radar to support the Ground-Based Midcourse system. MDA plans to build a sea-based radar to support the Ground-Based Midcourse system, with Boeing and Raytheon as main contractors. The sea-based radar is preferred over a ground-based X-band radar due to its repositioning capability for various missile defense tests. The total acquisition cost is estimated at $900 million, with no specific funds allocated in the FY2003 defense budget. The radar is intended to be deployed by September 2005 on a modified semi-submersible platform. The sea-based radar for the Ground-Based Midcourse system will be deployed on a modified semi-submersible platform with specific dimensions and capabilities. The platform will have electric thrusters for relocation and a deck area for the X-band radar. This concept of large radars on sea-based platforms is not new, as the U.S. has used similar setups in the past for missile defense tests. The Patriot PAC-3 is the U.S. Army's medium-range air defense missile system, an improvement over previous versions. It targets enemy missiles in the lower atmosphere and works alongside the THAAD system. The PAC-3 features a new hit-to-kill interceptor missile, improved communications, radar, and ground support systems. Initial deployment was set for late 2001 at Fort Bliss, Texas, with full-rate production delayed to late 2002. Pentagon costs for the PAC-3 increased by $102 million to $2.9 billion due to increased reliability. The costs of PAC-3 increased by $102 million to $2.9 billion due to increased reliability and spares costs. A GAO report in July 2000 showed total program costs rose to $6.9 billion for about 1,012 missiles. The Army aims to reduce missile costs to buy more. In December 2000, the program was restructured to speed up testing and production. The Bush Administration requested $784 million for PAC-3 in FY2002, a 76% increase over FY2001. Funding for PAC-3 was transferred from BMDO to the Army. The House Armed Services Committee did not approve the transfer of funding for PAC-3 in the FY2002 Defense Authorization Bill. Despite a successful string of intercept flight tests, concerns were raised about the rising costs of PAC-3. It has been suggested that unit costs could be reduced by increasing the number of units purchased and the pace of production, especially if more countries buy PAC-3 and the MEADS program is fielded with PAC-3 missiles. In May 2000, DOD decided to stop development of PACM due to the cost-effective defense provided by PAC-3 and PAC-2 systems against ballistic and cruise missile threats. The decision was controversial, but no funds were requested for PACM in the FY2001 authorization bill. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of PAC-3 and other missile defenses against countermeasures, such as Russia's guided warhead for the Scud missile. The THAAD missile system is designed to destroy ballistic missiles in the upper atmosphere using hit-to-kill interceptors. It offers wider protection against missiles and debris, as well as potential nuclear, biological, or chemical threats. Russia is offering a guided warhead for sale to countries in the Middle East with Scud missiles. The Selected Acquisition Report revealed that the projected costs of THAAD had increased by $898 million to a total of $9.5 billion due to a revised estimating methodology. The Army considered an accelerated development proposal in 2000 to move the first THAAD unit equipped from FY2007 to FY2006. The Department of Defense is still studying this option while relaxing the requirement for THAAD to intercept targets within and outside the atmosphere. After facing technological problems, THAAD achieved its first successful interceptor flight test on June 10, 1999. Subsequent tests also showed success, leading to a proposal for THAAD's advancement in EMD. Concerns were raised about testing against target missiles with characteristics of likely enemy missiles. In 1999, legislation was introduced to improve the NTW and THAAD programs for successful intercepts against realistic test targets. The Bush Administration requested a significant increase in funding for THAAD in FY2002, but Congress cut $50 million for THAAD contingency missiles. The FY2003 request for THAAD is $935 million. The Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) is a multinational, ground-based, mobile air and missile defense system with maneuverability and 360-degree coverage. It will operate in the division area of the battlefield to protect against various airborne threats, using the Patriot PAC-3 missile for interception. MEADS requires less manpower and logistical support compared to other missile defense systems. MEADS, a multinational air and missile defense system, will replace the HAWK system and enhance NATO interoperability. BMDO oversees program direction and integration. The Pentagon's attempt to transfer management to the Army was not approved by Congress. Germany and Italy committed to funding a portion of the program. Germany and Italy committed to funding 25% and 15% of the MEADS program for the next 10 years. The German military questioned the number of units needed and Parliament hesitated to approve development costs. The NATO MEADS Management Agency granted a $216 million risk reduction contract to MEADS International, with the US paying 55%, Germany 28%, and Italy 17%. Germany divided its funding into three phases to ease negotiations with Parliament. The Defense Ministry's negotiations with Parliament have led to Germany halting the upgrade of its Patriot batteries to determine if MEADS will duplicate Patriot's capabilities. The deployment of MEADS has been delayed until 2009, with plans for Germany and Italy to co-produce the Patriot PAC-3 interceptor. Funding for MEADS in FY2002 was increased to $74 million, with slight cuts in the final appropriations bill. Funding for MEADS was slightly cut in FY2002. Lockheed-Martin Corp. and Raytheon Company were U.S. partners in the project, with Alenia and European Aeronautic Defence representing the European group. France rescinded its funding commitment in 1996, but remains interested in missile defense. The United Kingdom is not involved, while the Netherlands and Turkey have considered participation. Target production dates for MEADS have been delayed to 2009. The Sea-Based Terminal program was canceled by DOD on December 14, 2001, due to poor performance, cost overruns, and development delays. The Nunn-McCurdy provision was cited as the reason for the cancellation, as unit acquisition and procurement costs had increased significantly. The Nunn-McCurdy provision allows for program cancellation if unit cost breach occurs, with a 15% increase triggering scrutiny and a 25% increase requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense. The Sea-Based Terminal program was canceled due to cost overruns and poor performance, with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition recommending against certification, leading to its cancellation. The Nunn-McCurdy provision led to the cancellation of a defense acquisition program due to a cost breach, resulting in a work stoppage at government and contractor facilities. Major contractors and government field activities involved in the program were listed. The Defense Department granted Raytheon a three-month extension for submitting a formal proposal for termination costs tied to a canceled Navy Area missile defense program contract. Raytheon held contracts for low-rate initial production and engineering and manufacturing development phases of the program. The company had one year from contract termination to submit a final termination proposal, with the final settlement proposal expected by January 2003. Raytheon requested the extension. Raytheon requested a three-month extension for submitting a formal proposal for termination costs related to a canceled Navy Area missile defense program contract. The extension was due to the complexity of subcontracts associated with vendor parts on the Standard Missile-2 Blk IVA. Raytheon plans to submit the LRIP proposal in January and the EMD contract in April 2003. The Navy estimated termination costs for Raytheon to be over $200 million, with $106.9 million for the EMD contract and $95.3 million for the LRIP contract. Following the cancellation of the Navy Area missile defense program, DOD officials announced a post-cancellation strategy to modify the SM-3 missile and the SM-2 Block 4 air defense missile to fulfill the sea-based terminal defense requirement. This two-part strategy aimed to provide much of the capability that was originally planned for the canceled program. The SM-3 missile is being modified to engage shorter range targets, with the goal of intercepting them outside the atmosphere. This modification strategy aims to bridge the gap left by the canceled Navy Area Wide project. The Navy is testing the SM-2 Block 4 missile for intercepting targets within the atmosphere. Software and hardware modifications are being considered, including adapting autopilot and fuze modes from the NAD missile. Industry and government teams are studying options to modify the SM-2 Blk IV missile, with a modified Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile being the most promising successor option. The Navy is considering using the SM-2 Blk IV missile for terminal Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities, aiming to intercept short-range ballistic missiles in the endo-atmosphere. Senior navy officials emphasize the need for a sea-based terminal BMD capability following the cancellation of the Navy Area missile defense program. Adm. Mullen highlights the importance of a sea-based area missile defense capability for national security. The Navy is planning to develop an Extended-Range Active Missile for air defense, with a range of 200nm. The missile will be solely for anti-air warfare but designed to allow for future evolution into a terminal-phase Ballistic Missile Defense variant. This capability is seen as crucial for protecting forces ashore, airports, seaports, and critical overseas infrastructure. The sensors program element includes funding for SBIRS-Low, RAMOS, and program operations. In FY2003, $373 million was requested, with Congress approving $294 million for SBIRS-Low and $10 million for operations. RAMOS funding was cut by $36 million, but $7 million was added for solar arrays. The SBIRS-Low project, part of the Space Based InfraRed System, aims to enhance early warning capabilities for missile launches. It involves satellites in geostationary, highly elliptical, and low orbits. Management was transferred to the Missile Defense Agency in October. The Air Force transferred management of the SBIRS-Low project to the Missile Defense Agency in October 2001 to focus on supporting missile defense. Despite concerns about technological readiness and cost projections, Congress did not fund SBIRS-Low in FY2002. Instead, $250 million was allocated for \"Satellite Sensor Technology,\" with the option to use it for SBIRS-Low or other technologies. The decision was made to continue with a restructured SBIRS-Low program under the direction of MDA Director General Ronald Kadish. The SBIRS-Low program was restructured under MDA Director General Ronald Kadish's plan, with two demonstration satellites set to launch in FY2006 or FY2007. These satellites will have reduced capability compared to the original design. The previous plan for three demonstration satellites was terminated in 1999 due to cost concerns, but now DOD is revisiting the demonstration satellite approach. The SBIRS-Low program was restructured under MDA Director General Ronald Kadish's plan, with two demonstration satellites set to launch in FY2006 or FY2007. These satellites will utilize technologies from FDS satellites and introduce new technologies as they mature. Cost estimates for the program are challenging due to the lack of a final system architecture. The General Accounting Office (GAO) and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided varying cost estimates for the program through FY2022 and FY2015 respectively. The SBIRS-Low program was restructured with a reported increase in life cycle cost from $10 billion to over $23 billion. Two industry teams were chosen for program definition and risk reduction. TRW was named the prime contractor, and Spectrum Astro a major subcontractor for the satellites. Competition at the sensor subcontractor level will continue. The SBIRS-Low program faced challenges with immature satellite technologies and concurrency issues during development. Critics raised concerns about the ability to discriminate between targets and decoys. The Missile Defense Agency faced technical hurdles such as discriminating between targets and decoys. The Bush Administration requested $8.73 billion for the agency in FY2006, with additional funding approved by the House and Senate for testing the ground-based missile defense system. The Senate and House approved additional funding for missile defense programs in FY2006. The bills included money for GMD testing, a multiple kill vehicle, and the Israeli Arrow system. The Bush Administration had requested $10.2 billion for missile programs in FY2005. The FY2005 defense authorization bill provided $9.95 billion for missile defense programs, signed into law on October 28, 2004. The FY2004 defense appropriations act allocated $9.1 billion for missile defense programs, signed into law on September 30, 2003. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announced a request for $7.8 billion for missile defense spending for FY2003. The Pentagon requested $6.7 billion for missile defense spending in FY2003, but the total amount approved by House and Senate conferees was $7.6 billion. This included funding for the Patriot (PAC-3) program and MEADS, totaling $977 million."
