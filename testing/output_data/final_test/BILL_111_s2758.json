    "content": "The \"Growing Safe Food Act of 2009\" is cited as the short title. It introduces a National Food Safety Training, Education, Extension, Outreach, and Technical Assistance Program under the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like 'agricultural producer group' and 'beginning farmer'. The agricultural producer group works on behalf of various agricultural entities, while a beginning farmer is someone who has operated a farm for no more than 10 years and actively participates in farm operations. The term 'conservation systems' refers to practices and measures based on local resources, while 'market value of agricultural products' includes income from agricultural commodities, livestock, and farm-based renewable energy production. The term 'small and medium-sized farm' refers to farms involved in various activities related to farming and forestry, as determined by the Secretary, including the production of renewable energy, processing, packing, storing, and transporting of commodities, livestock rearing, and other market activities. The term 'small and medium-sized farm' refers to a farm with a market value of agricultural products not exceeding $1,000,000 over a 3-year period. Other terms such as 'small food processors', 'small fruit and vegetable merchant wholesaler', and 'socially disadvantaged farmer' are defined by the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish a competitive grant program under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to provide food safety training, education, and technical assistance to owners and operators of farms, small food processors, and small fruit and vegetable merchant wholesalers. The Secretary will provide extension, outreach, and technical assistance related to foods under the authority of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The program will integrate food safety standards with sustainable agriculture and conservation systems. Priority will be given to projects targeting small and medium-sized farms, processors, and fresh fruit and vegetable wholesalers. Coordination with the program implementation will be ensured. The program under this section will interact with the national integrated food safety initiative, considering research and user community needs. Grants will be provided for program implementation. The Secretary will provide competitive grants for training, education, and technical assistance projects to increase understanding and implementation of food safety standards, including good agricultural practices, handling practices, manufacturing practices, produce safety standards, risk analysis, sanitation procedures, and packaging systems. The Secretary will provide competitive grants for training, education, and technical assistance projects to increase understanding and implementation of food safety standards, including safe packaging and storage systems, recordkeeping for product sourcing and sales, food safety audits, certification, and other relevant activities. Projects are encouraged to include features that provide training, education, outreach, and technical assistance in sustainable agriculture and conservation systems. Grants may also target farms transitioning to certified organic production. The national organic program established under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 provides grants with a maximum term of 3 years and up to $600,000 per year. Eligible recipients include State cooperative extension services, Federal, State, local, or tribal agencies, and nonprofit community-based organizations. The national organic program offers grants up to $600,000 per year for a maximum of 3 years. Eligible recipients include State cooperative extension services, Federal, State, local, or tribal agencies, nonprofit community-based organizations, institutions of higher education, agricultural producer groups, collaborations of eligible recipients, and other appropriate recipients determined by the Secretary. Grants may involve projects spanning multiple states. The Secretary evaluates proposals based on specific criteria. The Secretary evaluates proposals based on relevancy, technical merit, achievability, knowledge of relevant laws, benefits to small farms and processors, outreach to underserved groups, and a successful track record in training programs. The Secretary evaluates proposals based on relevancy, technical merit, achievability, knowledge of relevant laws, benefits to small farms and processors, outreach to underserved groups, and a successful track record in training programs. The program must include adequate outreach plans, demonstrate capacity to reach eligible participants, have plans for participatory evaluation, leverage contributions from various sources, collaborate with eligible recipients, and maximize other appropriate factors as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary ensures regional balance and diversity in agricultural production when making grants. The program must align with sustainable agriculture practices and coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on food safety standards. The Secretary requires grant recipients to report annually and evaluate projects funded under the program. Organic production projects must adhere to national organic standards. The Secretary mandates annual reporting and evaluation of funded projects. A nationwide online clearinghouse for food production information may be established. Technical assistance can be provided to grant recipients for program purposes. The Secretary recommends best practices for food safety training programs for agricultural producers and small food processors. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year for this section, with allocations for a curriculum clearinghouse and technical assistance. The Secretary recommends best practices for food safety training programs for agricultural producers and small food processors. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year for this section, with allocations for a curriculum clearinghouse and technical assistance. Not more than 4 percent may be used for administrative costs. The Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive Grants Program emphasizes integrated projects addressing priority research, education, and extension needs relevant to implementing agricultural research laws. The curr_chunk focuses on agricultural research laws related to food safety standards, risk analysis in the food system, conservation practices, and methods to reduce animal contamination of food. The curr_chunk aims to identify low-cost, effective food safety practices for diversified agricultural operations, develop decision support tools for implementing whole-farm food safety plans, and address other relevant topics as determined by the Secretary."
