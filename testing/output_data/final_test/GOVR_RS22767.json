The key themes were building a well-off society and adhering to the scientific development concept, emphasizing balanced and sustainable progress. At the 17th Party Congress led by Secretary Hu Jintao, the focus was on achieving a well-off society and adhering to the scientific development concept. This concept includes improving people's livelihood through issues like employment, health, education, renewable energy, and environmental quality. The Congress voted to enshrine the \"scientific development\" doctrine in the Party Constitution, elevating it to the same level of importance as previous doctrines. Secretary Hu also addressed the Taiwan issue, reaffirming China's commitment to the one-China principle while also calling for peaceful reunification through consultations and ending hostilities. At the 17th Party Congress led by Secretary Hu Jintao, the focus was on achieving a well-off society and adhering to the scientific development concept. Hu made a peace overture, calling for consultations and a peace agreement based on the \"one-China\" principle. Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian criticized the overture, stating it would be a treaty of surrender. The Congress emphasized continued economic development, market reform, and integration into the global system. Hu also endorsed moving towards a growth model that includes expanding domestic consumption and improving modern service sectors.

The Congress emphasized continued economic development, market reform, and integration into the global system. Hu also endorsed moving towards a growth model that includes expanding domestic consumption and improving modern service sectors. Additionally, there was a public debate in China on political reform, with calls for greater democratization and political reform to address deficiencies in governance. Hu's report at the Congress highlighted governance deficiencies and the Party's inability to fully address new challenges. Despite calls for political pluralism, no major reforms were endorsed, signaling the Party's intent to maintain its power monopoly. However, there was pressure for democratization reforms, with Hu proposing modest changes within the Party to address public demand for political participation. The Party proposed democratization reforms within itself, allowing public participation in nominating leaders and direct elections for lower level leaders. The Party Congress delegates' role was expanded, with a unique leadership makeup emerging, including a significant number from the \"lost generation\" of the Cultural Revolution. The senior leadership of the 17th Party Congress in China shows a shift towards members with provincial leadership credentials, foreign education, and experience in social and economic disruptions. There are also more entrepreneurs and corporate CEOs in the leadership, suggesting a greater understanding of the challenges faced by the disenfranchised in China's interior provinces. Additionally, the Congress did not designate a clear \"heir apparent\" to succeed Secretary Hu Jintao, indicating the possibility of two potential candidates for the post. The 17th Party Congress in China introduced two potential candidates for leadership succession, potentially bringing democratic choice to the process. The Politburo, the top decision-making body, expanded to 25 members, including new additions. This could lead to uncertainties in the succession process. The 17th Party Congress in China expanded the Politburo to 25 members, potentially allowing for more collective decision-making. The new Politburo, with only one female member, continues the tradition of male-dominated leadership. Several older members stepped down, suggesting a shift towards a more inclusive leadership style. The retirements of key leaders at the 17th Party Congress in China, including Wu Yi and three members of the Politburo Standing Committee, indicate the seriousness of the PRC leadership about mandatory retirement for Politburo members at the age of 68. This reflects the Party's commitment to incremental political reforms since 1978, including unofficial retirement age requirements and term limits for top-level positions. The 17th Party Congress in China demonstrated the Party's commitment to adhere to agreed-upon requirements for leadership succession. The new Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) has nine members, with Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang seen as potential successors to Hu Jintao. They are part of the \"fifth generation\" of China's leadership and are expected to rise to higher positions at the 18th Party Congress in 2012. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang are potential successors to Hu Jintao in the Politburo Standing Committee. They represent two distinct leadership camps: the \"populist\" group led by Li Keqiang and the \"elitist\" group led by Xi Jinping. The \"populist\" group focuses on balanced economic development and improving the lives of the poor, while the \"elitist\" group prioritizes rapid economic growth and less emphasis on social issues. The 17th Congress announced the selection of a new, eleven-member Central Military Commission (CMC), with Hu Jintao remaining as its head. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, potential successors to Hu Jintao, bring different backgrounds to PRC leadership. The new Central Military Commission (CMC) under Secretary Hu Jintao includes no other Politburo Standing Committee members, unlike its predecessor. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, potential successors, were not named to the CMC, raising questions about military connections and communication within the leadership. The new Central Military Commission (CMC) under Secretary Hu Jintao does not include any other Politburo Standing Committee members, raising questions about military connections and communication within the leadership. This also raises questions about the strength of communication between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the rest of the Party and government in the coming five-year period."
