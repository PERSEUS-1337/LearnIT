    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California has adopted academic content standards in various subjects since 1997, including English language arts, mathematics, science, history-social science, and others. New standards were implemented in 2010, such as the common core state standards and Next Generation Science Standards. Currently, there is no established process for updating content standards, requiring new legislation for any changes needed due to evolving knowledge and research. The Superintendent must recommend a schedule for updating academic content standards by January 1, 2017, aligning with the curriculum framework updates. The process should prioritize public access, rely on current research, and minimize disruption to school districts. When academic content standards in a subject area are up for review, the state board determines if updates are needed based on time since last update, new research, and impact on curriculum. National standards from other states can also be considered. The state board convenes an academic content standards advisory committee to recommend updates to content standards in a subject area. The committee consists of 21 members appointed by various authorities, with at least half being current public school teachers meeting specific qualifications. Members serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority. The academic content standards advisory committees are intended to include representation from teachers of different grade levels, possess thorough knowledge of the standards, reflect diversity, review and update content standards as needed, and consider specific criteria when making recommendations. The academic content standards advisory committee conducts meetings to review and update standards based on current research. Upon completion, their terms end, and the updated standards are forwarded to the state board for approval within 120 days. The academic content standards advisory committee reviews and updates standards based on research. The state board can adopt or reject the proposed updates, with a requirement for a written explanation if rejected. The department must post proposed updates online for public comment for 60 days. Committee members serve without compensation, except for travel expenses. Guidelines for implementation are developed by the Superintendent and adopted by the state board. The convening of an academic content standards advisory committee is dependent on the Legislature appropriating funds in the annual Budget Act."
