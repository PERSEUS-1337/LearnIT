    "content": "The \"Family Farm Protection Act\" allows for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a family farming business to a family member under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Family Farm Protection Act\" excludes gain from selling a qualified family farm interest to a family member if there was material participation in the farming business for 5 years prior to the sale. The family member acquiring the interest must agree to participate in the farming business for the next 5 years. If a qualified family farm interest is disposed of or the family member fails to participate in the farming business, tax recapture may occur within a 5-year period from the date of sale. Tax recapture may occur if a qualified family farm interest is sold or if a family member does not participate in the farming business. The tax imposed on the family member for the year will be increased by the recapture percentage of the excluded tax amount, plus interest. The recapture percentage is determined based on a table. If the event described in paragraph (1) occurs in the following years after such sale, the recapture percentage is determined based on a table. The excluded tax amount is defined as the difference between the tax that would have been imposed on the taxpayer for the taxable year and the tax actually imposed for that year. Definitions for the section include \"qualified family farm interest,\" \"qualified family-owned business interest,\" \"farming business,\" and \"member of the family.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the tax implications for family-owned farming businesses. The term 'member of the family' and 'material participation' are defined in section 2032A(e). A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments in Sec. 1203 exclude gain on sale of family farm to family member. Effective for sales after enactment of this Act."
