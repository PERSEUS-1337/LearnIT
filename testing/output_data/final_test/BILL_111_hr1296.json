    "content": "The \"Access for All America Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to the act. The \"Access for All America Act\" findings highlight the need to improve access to healthcare services, especially primary care, for all Americans. Demonstrations at the Federal and State level aim to connect patients to a primary care \"medical home\" to ensure access, control costs, and enhance quality. A proven medical home model has successfully achieved these goals for over 40 years, serving millions of Americans through community health centers. Community health centers, also known as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), provide coordinated medical, dental, behavioral health, and prescription drug services, leading to reduced emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Studies show that health center patients have 41% lower medical expenses, saving an average of $1,810 per person per year. Providing access to a medical home for all Americans could result in healthcare savings of $67 billion per year. Subsidy needed to sustain and expand health centers to achieve full access, along with investment in National Health Service Corps to address shortage of primary care providers. Both initiatives can be achieved for less than 1% of total healthcare spending. Encouragement needed for broader adoption of cost-effective community health center model and promotion of primary care careers. To promote the adoption and practice of primary care as a career, primary care practitioners should collaborate with community health centers. SEC. 3. Spending for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Section 330(r) of the Public Health Service Act is amended to authorize specific amounts for grants for fiscal years 2010 to 2016 and subsequent years. The Public Health Service Act is amended to authorize specific grant amounts for fiscal years 2010 to 2016 and subsequent years. The grant amounts are adjusted based on the increase in costs per patient served and the total number of patients served. SEC. 4. OTHER PROVISIONS. The text chunk discusses settings for service delivery and the location of service delivery sites under the Public Health Service Act. It mentions that primary health services can be provided at facilities operated by the center or other appropriate settings. Additionally, it states that a center is not required to locate its service facilities within a designated medically underserved area. The Public Health Service Act allows for service delivery sites to be located in areas serving medically underserved populations, including migrant workers, the homeless, and public housing residents. The Secretary may also permit service sites to be located within another center's catchment area if there is demonstrated unmet need. The Secretary may approve proposals for additional Federal resources in areas with unmet needs, considering collaboration between centers and potential impact on existing services and financial viability. (c) Affiliation Agreements.--Section 330(k)(3)(B) of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include contractual arrangements while maintaining compliance with governing board requirements and ensuring center autonomy over health care policies and operations. Governance requirements under Section 330(k)(3) are also amended. The text chunk discusses amendments to Section 330(k)(3)(B) of the Public Health Service Act regarding governance requirements for affiliation agreements, including the authority of public entities over financial and personnel policies for public centers. Amendments to Section 330(k)(3)(I)(i) of the Public Health Service Act allow for modifications to a center's operating plan and budget during the fiscal year, as long as they do not require additional grant funds or compromise current services. Additionally, Section 330(l) is amended to allow for joint purchasing arrangements for reduced costs. The Secretary may provide assistance with supplies and services costs for federally qualified health centers through collaborative efforts or joint purchasing arrangements. Additionally, there is an opportunity to correct material failures regarding grant conditions. The Secretary can assist federally qualified health centers with supplies and services costs through collaborative efforts or joint purchasing arrangements. If a center materially fails to meet grant requirements, the Secretary must provide an opportunity for compliance before terminating the grant. Centers have the right to appeal any Secretarial determination related to their grant. The Secretary can terminate a grant for a federally qualified health center if there is a modification in the service area, termination of a medically underserved population designation, disallowance of grant expenditures, or a significant reduction in grant amount. SEC. 5. FUNDING FOR NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS.
