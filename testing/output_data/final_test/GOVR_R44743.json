    "content": "The provisions in Section 212(f) of the INA, in place since 1952, allow the President to suspend entry of aliens if deemed detrimental to US interests. This grants broad authority to bar or impose conditions on entry, often used in conjunction with financial sanctions. The President can use Section 212(f) of the INA to exclude aliens who threaten Libya's peace, officials of North Korea, and those involved in human rights violations. This authority grants broad discretion to restrict entry into the US for individuals without ties to the country. Legal constraints on the President's use of this power remain unclear. The President can use Section 212(f) of the INA to exclude aliens without ties to the US if their entry is deemed detrimental to the country's interests. However, there are no clear guidelines on factors to consider, issuance of proclamations, appropriateness of restrictions, or duration of restrictions. The Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual is the only available guidance on the exercise of presidential authority under Section 212(f). The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) is the primary guidance on the President's Section 212(f) authority, granting the Secretary of State the power to identify individuals covered by proclamations. It notes that entry can be barred based on affiliation or objectionable conduct, and that statutory inadmissibilities should be considered before applying a Presidential Proclamation. The FAM does not have the force of law to bind the executive branch. The FAM guides the President's Section 212(f) authority, allowing the Secretary of State to identify individuals for proclamations. The Supreme Court's Sale v. Haitian Centers Council decision supports broad presidential authority to restrict alien entry. The Sale Court decision clarified the President's Section 212(f) authority to suspend entry of aliens without necessary documentation, rejecting the Second Circuit's view on interdiction. This decision helped understand the relationship between Section 212(f) authority and other provisions of the INA. The Second Circuit concluded that the Attorney General, as the President's \"agent\" in immigration matters, was prohibited from returning aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the President's interdiction program did not infringe on the Attorney General's delegated responsibilities under the INA. The Supreme Court interpreted the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as not restricting the President's actions outside the United States, specifically in the interdiction program under Section 212(f). The Sale decision clarified the definition of \"entry\" under Section 212(f) as encompassing aliens seeking admission into the United States. The Sale decision distinguished between aliens seeking admission and those already in the US, regardless of entry legality. Despite changes in the INA, Sale's interpretation of entry remains relevant in discussions of Section 212(f) authority. Lower court decisions, like Sesay v. INS, have upheld this interpretation in asylum cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the alien petitioner was ineligible for asylum due to Presidential Proclamation 7062 barring entry. Previous court decisions emphasized the President's broad discretionary authority over alien entry, citing Section 212(f) as granting inherent executive power. The exclusion of aliens is seen as a fundamental act of sovereignty, not just from legislative power but also inherent in the executive branch. The Executive has significant power to bar or impose conditions on alien entry, stemming from inherent executive power over foreign affairs. Previous court decisions emphasize the President's broad discretionary authority under Section 212(f) for exclusion of aliens, reflecting the limited use of this authority to date. The Executive's power to bar or impose conditions on alien entry under Section 212(f) has been historically limited. However, if the President were to bar all aliens or exclude them based on religion, legal issues could arise regarding consistency with Congress's intent in enacting immigration statutes. The President's authority to restrict alien entry under Section 212(f) is historically limited, but legal issues may arise if aliens are excluded based on religion. Other provisions in the INA also allow the Executive to limit aliens' entry, such as Section 214(a)(1) governing nonimmigrant admissions. The President's authority to restrict alien entry under Section 212(f) is historically limited, but legal issues may arise if aliens are excluded based on religion. Section 215(a)(1) also prohibits aliens from entering or departing the United States without the President's prescribed rules and regulations. President Carter used this section to revoke visas during the Iran Hostage Crisis. The current Section 215(a) was enacted in 1952, granting the President power to impose restrictions during times of war. The President's authority to restrict alien entry under Section 212(f) is historically limited, but legal issues may arise if aliens are excluded based on religion. Section 215(a)(1) prohibits aliens from entering or departing the United States without the President's prescribed rules and regulations. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of certain aliens during times of war and national emergency, stating that the exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of certain aliens during wartime and national emergency, stating that the President's authority to restrict alien entry is not in violation of the non-delegation doctrine. The regulations excluding aliens were deemed reasonable in the context of World War II. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of certain aliens during wartime and national emergency, stating that the President's authority to restrict alien entry is not in violation of the non-delegation doctrine. Knauff's statements about the inherent power of nations to exclude aliens with no recognized ties to the country would also generally seem to remain good law."
