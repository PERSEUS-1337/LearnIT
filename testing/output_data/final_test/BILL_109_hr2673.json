The Ocean Habitat Protection Act recognizes the importance of complex seafloor habitats for marine biodiversity and fish species within the exclusive economic zone of the United States. These habitats are valuable natural resources that support the economy, food supply, and health of the country. Deep-sea corals are diverse and widely distributed, creating complex habitats that support marine life. These habitats are valuable for the economy of coastal communities and provide recreational opportunities. However, they are facing increasing human pressures. The rapid spread of deep-sea trawl fisheries into new regions is putting pressure on deep-sea corals, which are diverse and vulnerable. Bottom trawling destroys habitat complexity and reduces biodiversity, impacting economically and ecologically important marine life. Conservation efforts for deep-sea corals are crucial. The expansion of bottom trawling into structurally complex habitats has had significant adverse effects on deep-sea corals and marine life diversity. This practice, facilitated by technological modifications to trawls, threatens economically and ecologically important species and industries. The damage caused by bottom trawling to deep-sea corals and sponges is significant and may take decades to centuries to recover. Scientific studies show that bottom trawling is especially harmful to complex habitats like corals, boulder fields, and sponge beds. Prohibiting certain types of fishing gear is a practical and enforceable solution to mitigate these effects. Prohibiting certain fishing gear is a practical measure to protect benthic marine habitats from bottom trawling damage. Prohibition on using large footrope devices on bottom trawl gear is implemented to protect benthic marine habitats from damage caused by bottom trawling. The policy and purpose of protecting essential fish habitat, specifically complexly structured bottom habitats, is outlined to benefit species that rely on these habitats. The section prohibits access of bottom trawls to these habitats in the Federal exclusive economic zone to prevent damage. The prohibition on using bottom trawls with certain devices exceeding 8 inches in diameter in US fishing areas, including beyond the exclusive economic zone, can be exempted in certain areas by the Secretary if approved by the Council with jurisdiction over the area. The Secretary may exempt certain fishing areas from the prohibition on using large devices on bottom trawls if substantial evidence shows it is necessary to prevent increased bycatch or provide other benefits. The Secretary may exempt fishing areas from using large devices on bottom trawls if evidence shows it is necessary to prevent increased bycatch or provide other benefits, with specific geographic boundaries and a vessel monitoring plan required. The regulations implementing the vessel monitoring plan shall take effect upon the expiration of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The subsection will take effect after 1 year from the enactment of the Act and applies to fishing thereafter. A rebuttable presumption is added to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act regarding vessels using specific gear beyond certain boundaries. The subsection requires vessels to declare their intention to use specific gear in certain areas and have a functioning vessel monitoring system on board. The subsection requires vessels to declare their intention to use specific gear in certain areas and have a functioning vessel monitoring system on board. Assistance is provided. The Secretary of Commerce may provide financial assistance up to $4,000 per qualified fishing vessel for gear transition, including disposing of certain fishing gear and converting trawl nets to footrope gear. The Secretary of Commerce may provide a one-time payment of $10,000 to a qualified fishing vessel owner who ceases trawling and commits to using fixed gear. Economic assistance will also be provided to vessel owners based on relevant factors. Economic assistance may be provided to fishing vessel owners and crew members who cease bottom trawl fishing, with income assistance for up to 2 years not exceeding their previous earnings. Economic assistance may be provided to fishing vessel owners and crew members who cease bottom trawl fishing, with income assistance for up to 2 years not exceeding their previous earnings. The assistance includes funds for training for nonfishery employment determined reasonable by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary is required to submit a report estimating the costs of implementing this subsection within 12 months of the enactment of this Act. Qualified Fishing Vessels are those authorized for trawl fishing under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The Secretary of Commerce is prohibited from issuing trawl permits to individuals receiving economic assistance under this section. SEC. 5. SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ON SEAFLOOR HABITAT. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the United States Geological Survey, must collect and provide information on bottom habitats in the US exclusive economic zone to Regional Fishery Management Councils within 10 years. Federal agencies and Councils must cooperate to provide relevant information. Regional Fishery Management Councils are required to use the information provided. The Management Council will use information from the Secretary to determine seafloor habitats to protect from fishing and human impacts. The Secretary will report to Congress on the program's progress annually. Appropriations authorized for the Secretary of Commerce include $8,000,000 for gear transition assistance, necessary sums for payments and economic assistance, and $100,000,000 for carrying out a specific section."
