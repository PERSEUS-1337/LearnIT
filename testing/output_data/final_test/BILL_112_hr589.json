    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Expansion Act of 2011\" and includes provisions for additional first-tier emergency unemployment compensation. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Expansion Act of 2011 amends Section 4002(b)(1) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 by increasing the entitlement to first-tier emergency unemployment compensation. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Expansion Act of 2011 allows states to pay higher tiers of emergency unemployment compensation before the first-tier to avoid delays. Special rules apply if only the second-tier is paid before the first-tier. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Expansion Act of 2011 allows states to pay higher tiers of emergency unemployment compensation before the first-tier to avoid delays. States can treat the exhaustion of increased first-tier benefits as the exhaustion of second-tier benefits for eligibility for third-tier benefits. States can treat the exhaustion of increased first-tier emergency unemployment compensation as the exhaustion of third-tier benefits for eligibility for fourth-tier emergency unemployment compensation. States may pay extended compensation to eligible individuals after the exhaustion of emergency unemployment compensation, even before additional emergency unemployment compensation is provided. The funding and program termination dates for emergency unemployment compensation are amended by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The termination date is changed from June 9, 2012, to September 22, 2012. The Secretary of Labor can create regulations to implement the Act. The amendments will be effective as if part of a previous law, but no additional first-tier emergency unemployment compensation will be paid for weeks before this Act's enactment."
