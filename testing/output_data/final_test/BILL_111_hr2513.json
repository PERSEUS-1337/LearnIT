    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Protection Training Institute Act of 2009\". Congress finds that there is no mandatory Federal training requirement for State, local, tribal, and territorial food protection officials, leading to varying training standards. The Office of the Inspector General recommended promoting equivalency among Federal and State food safety standards. State employees conduct over half of FDA inspections at domestic food processing plants under State laws and authorities. In fiscal year 2008, States conducted approximately 10,500 FDA food contract inspections, with nearly 80,000 inspections annually of food processing plants. However, the majority of these inspections are not recognized by the FDA as meeting any standard. There is no national accreditation process to ensure State and local food protection programs are equivalent to Federal programs. SEC. 747. FOOD PROTECTION TRAINING ACTIVITIES AND INSTITUTE.
