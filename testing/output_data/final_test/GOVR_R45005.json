    "content": "Wildfire management appropriations have increased since the late 1990s, with significant rises after FY2000. Funding varied between $2.9 billion in FY2012 and $5.2 billion in FY2008. The majority of appropriations go to the Forest Service (FS), with FS receiving around 71% of total wildfire management funds annually on average. In recent years, FS has received 76% of the funds, while the Department of the Interior (DOI) received 24%. Wildfire appropriations make up approximately 50% of FS's discretionary funds over the past 10 years. Wildfire appropriations account for about 50% of the agency's discretionary funds, on average. DOI and FS each have two accounts for wildfire funding: a Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and a Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) account. FLAME is a reserve fund for wildfire suppression. Total wildfire management appropriations have averaged $3.7 billion over the past 10 years. The WFM appropriation is divided into Fire Operations and Other Fire Operations programs. Fire Operations funds preparedness and suppression activities, while Other Fire Operations funds hazardous fuels reduction, research programs, and financial assistance for wildfire management. Funds in many FS accounts, including WFM but excluding FLAME, were specified to remain available through the end of FY2017. The WFM and FLAME accounts were designated as no-year appropriations, with Fire Operations receiving the largest share of funding. Both FS and DOI's WFM accounts fund similar activities like preparedness and suppression. DOI's Other Fire Operations program includes funds for fuels management, fire science activities, and facilities construction. The Fire Operations program includes appropriations for fuels management, joint fire science activities, and facilities construction and maintenance. Preparedness funds support fire prevention, detection, equipment, training, and personnel. FS and DOI use preparedness funds for various activities such as decision support tools, aviation asset management, and predictive services analysis. The DOI and FS use preparedness funds for fire management plans, infrastructure support, firefighting assets, and NIFC. In FY2017, Congress allocated $1.42 billion for preparedness activities, with DOI receiving $333 million and FS receiving $1.08 billion. Funding for DOI preparedness has averaged $294 million annually over the past 10 years, while FS preparedness has averaged $901 million annually. FS preparedness funding increased by close to 50% from FY2011 to FY2012 due to restructuring activities. The restructuring of preparedness and suppression activities led to changes in aviation and funding allocation. FS preparedness appropriations have averaged $1.05 billion annually. Suppression involves extinguishing or containing fires, funded through the WFM and FLAME accounts. If funding is depleted, FS and DOI have authorization for additional resources. The FLAME account may be used for suppression activities if funds are exhausted, known as fire borrowing. Congress can also provide additional funds through emergency appropriations. Suppression funding is divided into WFM suppression, FLAME, and supplemental appropriations, covering firefighter salaries, aviation operations, and incident support. The DOI suppression activity covers personnel, resources, and expenses for the Burned Area Emergency Response program. It includes temporary emergency firefighters, aircraft operations, and initial stabilization activities. FS and DOI may assist each other with suppression activities up to $50 million annually. In FY2017, the suppression activity received $1.64 billion, a significant increase from FY2016 levels. In FY2017, Congress appropriated $570.0 million for hazardous fuels reduction activities to both FS ($390.0 million) and DOI ($180.0 million), a 5% increase over the total FY2016 level ($545.0 million). Fuel reduction projects are funded by FS's Hazardous Fuels Management appropriation and DOI's Fuels Management appropriation for federal lands and high-priority areas in the wildland-urban interface. In FY2017, Congress appropriated $570.0 million for hazardous fuels reduction activities to both FS ($390.0 million) and DOI ($180.0 million), a 5% increase over the total FY2016 level. The Hazardous Fuels subaccount has received the third-largest share of WFM appropriations for both agencies. Additionally, Congress appropriated $148 million for other fire operations activities in FY2017, a 1% decrease from the previous year. Appropriations for the joint fire science program fund wildfire research and support state and volunteer fire departments. FLAME accounts were established in FY2010 to cover costs of large fires when suppression funds are exhausted. The FLAME accounts were established in FY2010 to cover costs of large fires when suppression funds are exhausted. The Secretary of the Interior can transfer funds from the FLAME account to the WFM account for suppression activities upon a secretarial declaration. Congress has been appropriating funds to the FLAME accounts annually, with a significant increase in FY2016 in response to the severity and cost of the 2015 fire season. In FY2017, Congress appropriated $407.0 million to the FLAME accounts ($342.0 million to FS; $65.0 million to DOI) in response to the severity and cost of the 2015 fire season. The funds were designated as emergency requirements and not subject to budgetary enforcement. Additional funds have been provided for suppression activities through supplemental legislation. Congress specifies how the funds are to be used in bill or report language. In FY2017, Congress provided $407.0 million to FLAME accounts for wildfire suppression, with $342.0 million allocated to FS and $65.0 million to DOI. The funds were designated as emergency requirements and not subject to budgetary enforcement. Congress specifies how the additional funds are to be used, with appropriations for suppression coming from various sources. In FY2017, the total combined suppression appropriation was $2.1 billion ($1.59 billion for FS; $460 million for DOI), with an average of $1.98 billion over the past 10 years. The largest appropriation was in FY2008 at $2.85 billion. Continuing resolutions have provided funding at FY2017 levels for FY2018. In FY2017, the total combined suppression appropriation was $2.1 billion ($1.59 billion for FS; $460 million for DOI). The first CR (P.L. 115-56) continued the FY2017 emergency requirements spending designation for FS's and DOI's FLAME accounts, exempting them from a rescission. P.L. 115-72 provided $576.5 million for wildfire suppression purposes to both FS and DOI. The funds for DOI and FS in FY2018 were designated as emergency spending, with FS receiving funds for WFM suppression and FLAME account repayment. The Administration requested $3.72 billion for wildfire management, a decrease from FY2017. Structural changes were proposed for both agencies' wildfire appropriations accounts, with no request for FLAME account appropriations. The Administration requested changes to DOI and FS's wildfire appropriations accounts in FY2018. This included eliminating the Facilities and Construction activity in DOI's WFM account and establishing Fuels Management as its own budget subaccount. For FS, Hazardous Fuels Management would be moved to the National Forest System account for efficiency. The House passed H.R. 3354, providing $3.85 billion for wildfire appropriations, accepting most of the Administration's proposed changes to DOI and FS's wildfire funding. The House passed H.R. 3354, providing $3.85 billion for wildfire appropriations, accepting most of the Administration's proposed changes to DOI and FS's wildfire funding. The bill specifies that appropriations to the FS wildfire accounts are to remain available through the end of FY2021 and appropriations to DOI's wildfire accounts are to remain available until expended. Congress is debating federal funding for wildfire management, including the level of spending and its effectiveness. Wildfire spending has increased significantly since the 1990s, with rising suppression costs being a major factor. The rising costs of wildfire suppression are a significant factor in the increased spending on wildfire management. Congress is debating the allocation of funds for wildfire activities, including whether to invest more in hazardous fuel reduction to reduce future costs. When wildfire suppression funding runs out, agencies may have to transfer funds from other accounts, impacting their performance. Congress must decide whether to reimburse these accounts or provide supplemental appropriations. The rising costs of wildfire suppression have led to debates in Congress about funding allocation. Transfers from other accounts may disrupt the budget cycle, prompting discussions on the structure of wildfire funding. Factors like weather and fuel load impact wildfire suppression funding estimates, leading to questions about the accuracy of forecasting expenses. Wildfire suppression estimates often underestimate costs, impacted by resource efficiency and federal management protocols. Analyzing funding trends pre-FY2001 is challenging due to changing account structures and the creation of new accounts like the FLAME account in FY2010. Costs for one wildfire season often extend beyond a calendar year. Costs for one wildfire season often extend into appropriations for two fiscal years, with appropriations sometimes enacted in one fiscal year to cover costs from previous fiscal years."
