    "content": "The political and cultural status of Tibet remains a contentious issue in U.S.-China relations, with ongoing debate among U.S. policymakers. Controversies include Tibet's status within China, the role of the Dalai Lama, and the impact of Chinese control on Tibetan culture and traditions. U.S. congressional actions in support of Tibet are criticized by the Chinese government. This report covers current issues in Tibet, historical and political status, and U.S. involvement. The 2008 demonstrations in Tibetan regions of China began peacefully but escalated in the following days, spreading beyond the Tibetan Autonomous Region. In March 2008, protests spread from the Tibetan Autonomous Region to other Tibetan-populated areas in China. By March 14, mobs in Lhasa were burning and looting businesses. Chinese reports claimed weapons were found in monasteries, but CCTV footage showed protesters using fists, rocks, and knives. The violence began on March 14, with no mention of peaceful protests. Reports vary on the number of casualties during the initial demonstrations. By March 31, 2008, official PRC sources claimed 18 deaths, while the Tibetan government-in-exile claimed 140 deaths. The dead included Tibetans and ethnic Han Chinese merchants, some shot by police and others dying in fires set by the mob. The TAR government declared a \"people's war\" in Tibet to eradicate support for the Dalai Lama and suppress Tibetan independence aspirations, leading to an increased presence of PRC security forces in Tibetan areas. In late March, Burma conducted house-to-house searches for individuals involved in demonstrations. Two Tibetan political activists were turned over to China by Burma. Isolated demonstrations in Tibetan areas of China have continued despite increased security. March and October are symbolic months of Chinese rule for Tibetans. Tibetans commemorated the 1959 Tibetan National Uprising on March 10. On the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan National Uprising, the Dalai Lama criticized the Chinese government for human rights violations and lack of religious freedom. He supported Beijing hosting the 2008 Olympics and urged Tibetans to peacefully fight for their rights. Tibetan exiles started a protest march into Tibet from India, while a new activist group, the Tibetan People's Uprising Movement, was formed to take direct action against China's actions in Tibet. The Tibetan People's Uprising Movement (TPUM) aims to end China's occupation of Tibet, with demands including the Dalai Lama's return, release of political prisoners, and cancellation of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Controversy arose over media coverage of March demonstrations in Tibet, with PRC officials alleging bias. The site reproduces videos and photos purporting to show media bias in coverage of riots in Lhasa. Tibetan supporters argue that Chinese reports focus on Han Chinese victims and label Tibetan organizations as the \"Dalai clique.\" The PRC alleges that these groups are controlled by the Dalai Lama and act on his behalf. The Dalai Lama has never renounced his dream of an independent Tibet, despite advocating for greater autonomy within China. The PRC accuses him of organizing unrest and instigating separatist activities, labeling his actions as deceitful and hypocritical. This is not the first time the PRC has accused the Dalai Lama of inciting riots in Tibet. The Dalai Lama is accused by the PRC of being a jackal and wolf, and a vicious devil in human form. Some Tibetan organizations do not support his policy for broader Tibetan autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. The Dalai Lama denies involvement in the March 2008 demonstrations and calls for dialogue to address Tibetan resentment. The Dalai Lama's pacifist views and adoption of a \"middle way\" approach indicate he seeks greater autonomy for Tibet within China, not independence. He reiterated this stance in public statements and appeals to the Chinese people. The Dalai Lama appeals to the Chinese people, emphasizing his desire to preserve Tibetan culture and identity within China. Despite fears of little hope for policy changes from Beijing, some believe the Dalai Lama is key to resolving China's issues in Tibet. China views his approach as a sidetrack to independence and aims to out-wait his influence on the Tibetan movement. The international Tibetan community expresses concerns about China's rejection of the Dalai Lama's approach, fearing it undermines his influence on younger, more militant Tibetans. They believe his demise without achieving greater Tibetan autonomy would remove a key restraint on ideological elements in the Tibetan community. They highlight ongoing controversies over PRC rule in Tibet, citing lack of freedom of religion and expression, and assert that Chinese authorities tightly control religious publications. Religious publications remain tightly controlled by Chinese authorities in Tibet, along with restrictions on religious celebrations and Tibetan minors receiving religious instruction. Despite improved infrastructure in religious institutions, recent observations in Lhasa show decreased signs of religious devotion at key sites. Controversy surrounds the recognition of the 11th Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama in 1995, highlighting ongoing tensions over religious authority in Tibetan Buddhism. In 1995, Nyima was identified as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama, angering Beijing officials who claimed the authority to name the spiritual leader. Chinese leaders rejected the Dalai Lama's choice and enthroned Gyaltsen Norbu as the \"real\" Panchen Lama. Both boys and their families were then taken into custody by Chinese authorities. In 1995, Gendun Choekyi Nyima was identified as the Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama, leading to his family being taken into custody by Chinese authorities. The boy recognized by Beijing, Gyaltsen Norbu, reappeared in Tibet in 1999 under heavy security. The Chinese government has kept Nyima's whereabouts secret, claiming he is under government supervision or house arrest for his own protection. The case raised concerns about the future reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. Beijing took steps in 2007 to control the selection process of Tibetan lamas by requiring government approval for reincarnation applications. The regulations were seen as an attempt to institutionalize management over living Buddhas, which was criticized by the Dalai Lama's Special Envoy as an attack on Tibetan religious identity. The regulations also aimed to prevent the illegal reincarnation of the current Dalai Lama. The Chinese government attempts to control the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, who has expressed his refusal to be reborn in China under current circumstances. The new law inserts China into the traditional Tibetan Buddhist practice and has sparked criticism from the Tibetan government-in-exile and Tibetans for promoting loyalty to Beijing through \"Patriotic Education\" campaigns. The Chinese government uses \"Patriotic Education\" campaigns to control monastic activity in Tibet and discredit the Dalai Lama among Tibetans. Chinese officials visit Tibetan monasteries to subject monks to education and training, aiming to reduce the Dalai Lama's influence by labeling him as a tool of Western anti-Chinese forces. In 2005, Tibetan monks in exile reported new Patriotic Education campaigns in Tibet, where monks were forced to denounce the Dalai Lama as a \"separatist\" and many were expelled from their monasteries. Following the 2008 protests, China's Public Security Minister called for broader Patriotic Education campaigns, leading to renewed protests and crackdowns in Tibetan monasteries. Additionally, Chinese officials initiated a campaign in 1999 to promote atheism in Tibet. According to a U.S. government report, a Chinese propaganda official in Tibet emphasized the importance of intensifying propaganda on atheism to promote economic development and free peasants and herdsmen from the influence of religion. Tibetan specialists are concerned about the theft and plundering of Tibetan religious and cultural artifacts, with some attributing it to monetary gain involving various participants like art dealers, Chinese officials, Tibetan locals, monks, and Western enthusiasts. Dr. Robert Barnett noted that the Chinese government returned confiscated Tibetan artifacts in the 1980s, but now these artifacts are disappearing again, being stolen and sold in a global market. Tibetan scholars are unsure of the details, but many artifacts are being sold on eBay, in antique stores, and at auctions. The issue is particularly sensitive in Tibet due to the cultural significance of the artifacts. The issue of disappearing Tibetan artifacts is particularly sensitive in Tibet due to fears about the loss of Tibetan culture. Chinese government policies on economic development in Tibet have raised living standards but at a high cost to traditions and cultural identity, leading to tensions between Tibetans and Chinese immigrants. Beijing has spent substantial sums restoring Buddhist temples in Tibet to assuage Tibetan resentment. Plans adopted in 1994 aim to increase economic activity in Tibet by 10 percent per year and provide economic subsidies to help the less developed economy. The Chinese government has provided economic assistance and infrastructure projects in Tibet, but Tibetans are concerned that the development primarily benefits Han Chinese immigrants, leading to cultural identity disruptions. The Chinese government's economic development strategy in Tibet has led to large migrations of non-Tibetans into the region, causing tensions between economic benefits and cultural preservation. Some suggest Beijing aims to integrate the Tibetan economy with China's eastern provinces. Concerns exist about the need for a more inclusive policy that respects ethnic diversity and cultural pride without imposing a Chinese perspective. Since her appointment as Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs in May 2001, Paula Dobriansky has also served as the U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibet, encouraging negotiations between the PRC Government and Tibetan groups. Chinese leaders have been reluctant to allow religious, cultural, and political freedom among ethnic populations like Tibetans and Uighurs, equating divergence from Chinese norms as a threat to social stability. This unwillingness to address Tibetan autonomy requests has implications for China's policy toward Taiwan. The U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibet, Paula Dobriansky, aims to facilitate negotiations between the PRC Government and the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile. She is responsible for issuing annual reports on Sino-Tibetan contacts and submitting State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, including separate accounts for Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau. Despite some optimism, concerns remain about sustaining momentum in negotiations. The latest report on Sino-Tibetan contacts found limited grounds for optimism, with slight progress noted in negotiations between PRC officials and representatives of the Dalai Lama. Initiatives such as inviting delegations from the Tibetan community to China and Lhasa were seen as positive steps by some observers. Despite some progress noted in negotiations between PRC officials and representatives of the Dalai Lama, there are concerns about the outcome of tentative ventures due to new SARA regulations requiring governmental approval for reincarnation. China's restructuring of Tibetan policy-making institutions has made management of Tibetan affairs more complex and less predictable. China's actions to inhibit the Dalai Lama's visits overseas are seen as more assertive, and massive development projects in Tibet, like the Qinghai-Tibet railroad, are ongoing. The new Qinghai-Tibet railroad in Tibet has attracted more ethnic Chinese, raising concerns about Chinese encroachment on Tibet's cultural identity and ecosystem. Tibetan groups aim to pressure Beijing to reform policies, using the 2008 Summer Olympics as leverage. The formation of the TPUM movement was linked to the Olympics, with Beijing claiming the movement was planned. The TPUM organizations are suspected of orchestrating protests along the Olympic torch relay route from Greece to China, including through Tibet. The Dalai Lama's envoy criticized China's plan to carry the torch through Tibet as provocative. The crackdown in Tibet has fueled calls for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics. The Tibet crackdown has led to calls for boycotting the Beijing Olympics. Despite renewed calls for China to change its policies in Tibet, Beijing shows little willingness to make significant changes. China seems to believe it can wait out the Dalai Lama, banking on his eventual demise to weaken the Tibetan movement. Many in the West view the Dalai Lama as crucial in resolving China's issues in Tibet, but Beijing's rejection of his approach has alienated younger, more militant Tibetans. Members of Congress have supported the Tibetan cause by adopting measures to emphasize U.S. resolve on negotiations between Beijing and the Dalai Lama. Suggestions for improving U.S. leverage on the Tibet issue include reassessing the position of the U.S. Special Coordinator on Tibet and obtaining a detailed account of the 2008 protests with access to Tibet by independent observers. The 2008 protests in Tibet have prompted calls for independent observers to have access to the region. Suggestions include establishing a U.S. consulate office in Lhasa and increasing pressure on Beijing to address ethnic minority issues. Tibetan history is characterized by the strong influence of Buddhism and the role of the Dalai Lama as both a spiritual and temporal leader. The Dalai Lama is the highest and most revered leader in Tibetan history, believed to be the reincarnation of Tibet's patron deity. There is ambiguity and disagreement regarding Tibet's relationship with China, with Tibetans seeing it as historically independent while Chinese governments claim it as part of China. In 1949-1951, China sent military troops to occupy Tibet, which has been under Beijing rule since then. The dispute between Beijing and Tibetans revolves around China's claim to Tibet. The Chinese government asserts that Tibet has been part of China for over seven hundred years, citing historical ties and military presence. In contrast, the Tibetan government-in-exile argues that Tibet was independent before the PRC's invasion in 1949-1950, with its own leaders, military, and culture. They highlight a declaration of independence in 1913 after the fall of the Qing Dynasty. The Dalai Lama declared Tibet's independence from China, citing a historical \"priest-patron\" relationship rather than subject-sovereign. The dispute with China includes conflicting views on Tibet's past and boundaries, with the PRC demanding acknowledgment of historical Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. The Dalai Lama's Five Point Peace Plan of 1987 aims to establish Tibet as a \"zone of peace,\" including historical Tibetan areas in Chinese provinces outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in India since 1959, with a long-standing political connection dating back to the 19th century. Political involvement with India dates back to the 19th century when India was under British rule. After the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet in 1950, India received a protest from Tibet and a request for help. Indian officials tried to balance peaceful relations with China while acknowledging Tibet's cultural ties with India. In 1956, the Dalai Lama visited India for a Buddhist festival and decided to stay in India instead of returning to Tibet after meeting with Prime Minister Nehru. In 1959, PRC troops shelled the Dalai Lama's palace in Tibet, prompting his escape to India where he sought political asylum. India's Prime Minister Nehru granted the request, leading to tens of thousands of Tibetans joining the Dalai Lama in exile. Reports suggest third-party involvement in the 1950s dispute between Tibet and China, including India and the U.S. The CIA became involved in the conflict between Tibet and China in the 1950s, training Tibetan rebels and assisting the Dalai Lama's escape to India in 1959. The Dalai Lama and Tibetan exile community denied third-party involvement. The PRC's rule in Tibet was troubled, especially during the Cultural Revolution. The International Campaign for Tibet claims over 1 million Tibetans died during the first 30 years of PRC rule, while Beijing disputes this, citing improvements in Tibetans' material life. Tibet has been a recurring issue in congressional discussions on China since the late 1980s, driven by the Dalai Lama's political activities, reports of human rights abuses, and U.S. policymakers' differing views on China. Congressional opinions on Tibet often clash with the White House's stance. Since the late 1980s, Tibet has been a recurring issue in congressional discussions on China due to the Dalai Lama's political activities and reports of human rights abuses. Congressional views often clash with the White House's stance on Tibet as part of China. The U.S. government has recognized Tibet as part of China since 1979, despite some questioning the historical consistency of this position. The Dalai Lama has been a prominent advocate for the Tibetan people, gaining support in the U.S. Congress. In 1986-1987, efforts to gain international support for Tibet's cause took a significant step forward through meetings between Tibetan and Western representatives. In 1986-1987, meetings between Tibetan and Western supporters launched Tibet's \"international campaign\" to garner U.S. support and pressure Beijing for political concessions. The U.S. Congress began pressuring the White House to protect Tibetan culture despite objections from Beijing. The Dalai Lama's 1987 speech in the U.S. proposed a five-point plan for resolving the Tibet issue, gaining significant support. In 1987, Congress passed non-binding measures urging the U.S. to prioritize Tibet's situation and encourage dialogue with the Dalai Lama. This marked a significant increase in congressional activity on Tibet's status, with Tibet being mentioned separately in legislation related to China. In 1990, Congress singled out Tibet for special mention in legislation, closely resembling the Dalai Lama's proposed \"five points.\" In 1994, Congress enacted Tibetan-related provisions in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of FY1994-1995, including mandating Tibet be listed separately in the State Department's annual report on human rights and issuing a report on the state of relations between the U.S. and the Dalai Lama, his representatives, and the Tibetan Government in exile. Congressional efforts to raise Tibet's profile since 1986 have faced resistance from U.S. Administrations. President Reagan signed legislation authorizing Export-Import Bank funding that listed Tibet as a separate country in 1986. He clarified that the United States recognizes Tibet as part of China and considered Tibet's inclusion as a separate country a technical oversight. Subsequent U.S. Presidents, such as George Bush and Bill Clinton, acknowledged the Tibetan community-in-exile, with Clinton meeting the Dalai Lama multiple times, causing tension with Chinese leaders. The Clinton Administration's compromise to establish the position of Special Coordinator for Tibet offended Chinese leaders. Congress considered creating a U.S. Special Envoy for Tibet during the early years of the Clinton Administration, but the legislation was never enacted. Senator Claiborne Pell believed a Special Envoy for Tibet was necessary to focus White House attention on Tibet-related issues. In response to calls for a U.S. Special Envoy for Tibet, the Clinton Administration compromised by creating the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues within the State Department. This move was seen as a compromise to address concerns about establishing an ambassadorial rank position for Tibet, which the U.S. recognizes as part of China. The creation of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues within the State Department in response to calls for a U.S. Special Envoy for Tibet led to increased official attention on Tibet-related issues. This resulted in regular congressional provisions for U.S. assistance to Tibet, including Voice of America and Radio Free Asia broadcasts in Tibetan, scholarships for Tibetans living outside Tibet, and an educational and cultural exchange program with Tibet. The Ngawang Choepel Exchange Program was established for educational and cultural exchange with Tibet, funded at $500,000 annually. Funds were also allocated for humanitarian assistance to Tibetans in Nepal and India, as well as for non-governmental organizations supporting Tibetan environment and traditions. U.S. assistance to Tibet increased over the years, reaching $5 million in the 110th Congress. The U.S. assistance program to Tibet is largely a result of congressional earmarks in legislation. The \"Tibetan Policy Act of 2002\" created a U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues and outlined policy objectives on Tibet, including dialogue with Beijing, support for political prisoners, and efforts to locate the 11th Panchen Lama. In 2006, legislation was passed to award the Dalai Lama. In 2006, the 109th Congress passed legislation to award the Dalai Lama a Congressional Gold Medal. The decision was denounced by Beijing, leading to a ceremony on October 17, 2007, where the Dalai Lama received the medal. The 110th Congress responded to the March 2008 Tibet demonstrations, with some members calling for a U.S. boycott of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Senator Patrick Leahy criticized the violent actions of both PRC security forces and Tibetan demonstrators. The 110th Congress responded to the March 2008 Tibet demonstrations by introducing legislation, including H.R. 5668 and resolutions H.Res. 1075 and H.Res. 1077 condemning the Chinese government's actions and urging dialogue with the Dalai Lama. The 110th Congress responded to the March 2008 Tibet demonstrations by introducing legislation, including H.R. 5668 and resolutions condemning the Chinese government's actions and urging dialogue with the Dalai Lama. P.L. 110-161 earmarked funds for projects in Tibet and NGOs supporting cultural traditions, sustainable development, and environmental protection. The 108th and 109th Congresses allocated funds for NGOs supporting cultural traditions, sustainable development, and environmental protection in Tibet, with specific amounts designated for human rights and democracy programs through the National Endowment for Democracy. The 108th and 109th Congresses allocated funds for NGOs supporting cultural traditions, sustainable development, and environmental protection in Tibet, with specific amounts designated for human rights and democracy programs through the National Endowment for Democracy. Additionally, funding was provided for democracy, human rights, and rule of law in China, Hong Kong, and Tibet, with a portion allocated for NGOs supporting sustainable development and preserving cultural traditions in Tibet and other Tibetan communities in China. The 108th and 109th Congresses allocated funds for NGOs supporting cultural traditions, sustainable development, and environmental protection in Tibet. Specifically, funds were designated for human rights and democracy programs through the National Endowment for Democracy. Additionally, funding was provided for democracy, human rights, and rule of law in China, Hong Kong, and Tibet, with a portion allocated for NGOs supporting sustainable development and preserving cultural traditions in Tibet and other Tibetan communities in China. The 106th Congress allocated funds for NGOs outside China to support Tibetan cultural traditions, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. Funds were also provided for humanitarian assistance to Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India. The 105th Congress passed the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act, FY1999, which provided funding for Radio Free Asia to broadcast in China and Tibet. The act also established the Ngawang Choepel Exchange Program for U.S.-Tibetan educational exchanges and scholarships for Tibetan and Burmese scholars and students. In FY1997, 30 scholarships were provided for Tibetan students and professionals outside of Tibet by the 103rd Congress. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act included provisions for establishing an office in Lhasa, educational and cultural exchanges with Tibet, Radio Free Asia broadcasts to Asian countries including Tibet, and annual reporting requirements on \"occupied Tibet\". The 102nd Congress also addressed China's illegal control of Tibet. The 103rd Congress established Tibet as an occupied country under international law, recognizing the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Government-in-exile as true representatives. It highlighted Tibet's distinct national, cultural, and territorial identity, condemned China's illegal occupation, and noted that several countries recognized Tibet as independent. The 103rd Congress recognized Tibet as an occupied country under international law, affirming Tibet's right to self-determination and condemning China's illegal occupation. Selected U.S. Government reports have also acknowledged Tibet's distinct identity and the illegality of China's occupation."
