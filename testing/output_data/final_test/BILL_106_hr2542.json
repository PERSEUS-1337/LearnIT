    "content": "The Space Access Improvement Act of 1999 may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Congress acknowledges the significant role of commercial space activities in establishing the US as an economic superpower. Satellite services like global positioning and intelligence gathering have also contributed to the country's military strength. Access to space enables research in space science and Earth observations, enhancing the US's scientific and technological prowess. Space activities have the power to inspire future generations to study science. The United States is losing its share of the commercial space launch market to foreign nations due to underfunding in research and development of advanced space transportation technologies. This could lead to significant cost reductions in accessing space. The United States is losing its share of the commercial space launch market to foreign nations due to underfunding in research and development of advanced space transportation technologies, which could lead to significant cost reductions in accessing space. SEC. 3. REDUCING SPACE ACCESS COSTS. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is required by Congress to develop innovative technologies to reduce costs and increase reliability in space transportation systems. The Federal Government should aggressively fund the development of these technologies. The Federal Government is urged to aggressively fund the development of innovative propulsion systems, thermal protection systems, vehicle health monitoring systems, airframes, and launch operations to reduce costs and increase reliability in space transportation systems. Additionally, efforts should be made to enhance US economic competitiveness by facilitating commercial sector access to space technology and facilities. The Federal Government should enter cooperative agreements with academic and commercial sectors to advance space transportation research and development. They should minimize regulations that discourage involvement in advanced space transportation technologies, utilize US expertise before seeking foreign help, and promote engineering and science education related to space transportation technologies. The Federal Government aims to collaborate with academic and commercial sectors to advance space transportation research and development, minimize regulations hindering progress, utilize US expertise first, and promote education in engineering and science related to space transportation technologies. Amendments are made to protect intellectual property rights and maintain US competitiveness in the world. Amendments to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 1986 aim to further advance space transportation technologies by emphasizing the importance of developing low-cost, frequent, and reliable access to space."
