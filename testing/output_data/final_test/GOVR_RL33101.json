    "content": "Native Hawaiian recognition bills have been considered in the 106th-108th Congresses, with differences in provisions such as land transfers and jurisdictional powers. The closest Congress came to enacting a bill was in the 106th Congress when the House passed H.R. 4904, which was not passed by the Senate. Congress has enacted various programs for Native Hawaiians, including the Hawaiian Home Lands program. Concerns exist that these federal programs may be at risk without the creation of a Native Hawaiian political entity. These programs provide federal funding for Native Hawaiian communities and organizations, with over $70 million flowing into Hawaii in FY2002. In FY2002, over $70 million flowed into Hawaii through major federal Native Hawaiian programs such as the Native Hawaiian Education Act, Higher Education Act, Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act, Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grants, and Loan Guarantees for Native Hawaiian Housing. Total program obligations for Native American Programs Act of 1974 were $39.7 million in FY2004, and for Native American Employment and Training were $55 million in the same year. (P.L. 93-644, as amended; P.L. 105-220, \u00a7166)"
