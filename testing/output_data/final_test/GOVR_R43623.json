    "content": "According to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, an unaccompanied alien child is defined as a person under 18 without lawful immigration status and no parent or guardian in the US available for care. Not every minor without legal status is considered a UAC, and if a child is detained with a parent, they are not classified as a UAC. Reuniting with a parent or turning 18 may change a child's UAC status. Historically, the determination of whether a child is unaccompanied is based on their circumstances at and after apprehension. If a child is not with a parent or guardian, or cannot be reunited within hours, they are treated as a UAC for transfer from DHS to HHS custody. DHS may not review or reconsider the UAC designation, and HHS's ability to reassess may be limited by statutory constraints. Legislation in the 113th and 114th Congresses proposed changes to how unaccompanied alien children (UACs) are treated, allowing them to stop being classified as UACs if a family member is available to provide care. Some UACs may qualify for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status if they meet certain criteria. Eligibility for SIJ status is defined under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status under the Immigration and Nationality Act is limited to young aliens without parental care, who have been declared dependent on a U.S. juvenile court and whose reunification with parents is not viable due to abuse or neglect. It must be determined to be in the alien's best interest to not return to their previous country, and the Secretary of Homeland Security must approve the SIJ status. SIJ status allows young aliens without parental care to remain in the US and eventually apply for citizenship. DHS regulations impose restrictions on eligibility, but it is unclear if they are legally binding. SIJ status grants aliens the ability to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident aliens and eventually apply for US citizenship. The Flores settlement agreement, also known as the Flores agreement, resolved a challenge to INS practices regarding the detention of UACs. Being classified as a UAC does not automatically allow for legal status in the US, but certain forms of relief from removal may be available depending on individual circumstances. In 1984, INS adopted a policy restricting the release of detained minors to parents or guardians. This policy was challenged in a lawsuit on behalf of unaccompanied minors, leading to a Supreme Court decision in Flores v. Reno in 1993. The Court rejected the argument that minors have a fundamental right to be placed with private custodians. Despite this decision, the Flores litigation continued over the conditions of UAC detention, ultimately resulting in a settlement. The Flores agreement outlines principles for the detention of alien minors, emphasizing dignity and respect for their vulnerability. It includes procedures for temporary placement, such as processing minors promptly, informing them of their rights, and segregating them from unrelated adults. The Flores agreement emphasizes the release of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) to their parents or guardians without delay, but allows for exceptions such as detention for immigration court appearances or safety reasons. Courts have imposed limitations on the enforceability of the Flores agreement, only allowing actions seeking compliance with its terms, not monetary damages for violations. Legislation enacted after the agreement may govern treatment of UACs, potentially providing more favorable conditions. The Flores agreement, established in 1997, was extended in 2001 until federal regulations are implemented. Unaccompanied alien children (UACs) at ports of entry are generally inadmissible under the INA. Admission into the United States requires valid entry documents, while entry is the act of an alien coming into the country. Unaccompanied alien children (UACs) may be authorized under the TVPRA of 2008 for admission. The TVPRA of 2008 implicitly authorizes UACs to enter the United States, with distinctions made between UACs from contiguous countries and other countries. UACs from contiguous countries may be returned home if found inadmissible, while UACs from other countries are transferred to the custody of the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 72 hours. Other provisions of law could also allow UACs to enter the US. The TVPRA of 2008 allows UACs to enter the US, with distinctions based on their country of origin. Section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA permits parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit. DHS and HHS are the main agencies responsible for UAC custody. HHS does not detain certain UACs from Canada and Mexico who agree to be repatriated. DHS is responsible for detaining accompanied alien children for removal and enforcing immigration laws. CBP officers may encounter alien children at the border without legal authorization. If individuals enter the United States without legal authorization, they may be taken into custody and removed according to immigration laws. The care of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) is transferred from immigration enforcement to HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). ORR is responsible for coordinating the care and placement of UACs in licensed facilities and foster care. DHS may still remove a UAC even if transferred to ORR custody. If a UAC from Canada or Mexico is apprehended at a land border or U.S. port of entry and deemed inadmissible, they may be offered voluntary return instead of placement in removal proceedings. A determination must be made within 48 hours for repatriation eligibility. If not eligible or no decision is reached, DHS must take further action. Children in the custody of DHS or another federal agency must be transferred to ORR within 72 hours of being deemed a UAC. UACs may be placed in specific removal proceedings, with exceptions for UACs from Canada and Mexico who may be voluntarily returned if certain criteria are met. Federal statute establishes requirements for the removal of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) in the United States. While many aliens may be immediately ordered removed through expedited removal, UACs are exempt from this process. If the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks to remove a UAC, they must place the child in formal removal proceedings before an immigration judge and provide access to counsel. UACs are required to have access to counsel during removal proceedings. They may also be eligible for voluntary departure under Section 240B of the INA at no cost. Special rules apply to arriving UACs from Canada and Mexico, who may be voluntarily returned to their home countries if they consent to withdrawal of their application for admission. Arriving UACs from Canada or Mexico may be voluntarily returned to their home countries if they meet specific criteria and agree to withdraw their application for admission. If they do not meet these criteria or refuse to withdraw their application, they may be placed in formal removal proceedings before an immigration judge. Aliens facing removal proceedings may be eligible for relief depending on individual circumstances, such as being victims of trafficking or facing persecution. Relief options include asylum, regardless of age. Aliens of any age may be eligible for asylum if they fear persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group. Asylum can be applied for affirmatively with USCIS or defensively in removal proceedings. UACs have initial jurisdiction for asylum claims, and federal law makes it easier for UACs to be granted asylum. Some alien children without lawful status may be eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status, which can lead to becoming Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs). SIJ status is available to juveniles who have been declared dependent by a state court, are unable to reunite with parents due to abuse or neglect, and it is not in their best interest to return to their native country. Immigrant visa availability for SIJ status holders is subject to numerical caps. The immigrant visa for aliens with SIJ status is subject to numerical caps. Alien children without status may be eligible for nonimmigrant visas if they are victims of trafficking or certain crimes, allowing them to stay temporarily and potentially adjust to LPR status. The T visa allows victims of trafficking to live in the US for up to four years and apply for LPR status after three years. The U visa is available for aliens who have suffered abuse due to criminal activities, with a maximum validity of four years. Up to 10,000 U visas can be issued annually, and holders can apply for LPR status after three years. DHS and HHS have custody over children without immigration status for different purposes. DHS aims to secure the child's presence during removal proceedings, while HHS's purpose is not specified. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have custody over children without immigration status for different purposes. DHS aims to secure the child's presence during removal proceedings, while HHS's purpose is to provide temporary shelter care and protect them from trafficking and exploitation. Juveniles in removal proceedings may be released from custody based on criteria outlined in the Flores settlement agreement and DHS regulations. Release is not required when DHS determines that continued detention is necessary. DHS regulations state that release of juveniles is not always required, especially when their detention is necessary for safety reasons or to ensure their presence at immigration removal proceedings. Juveniles may be released to a parent, legal guardian, or designated adult relative, or in exceptional cases, to an individual designated by DHS. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may choose to release juveniles and accompanying adults from detention simultaneously on a case-by-case basis. The Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for the care and custody of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs), subject to the terms of the Flores settlement agreement and TVPRA standards. Once transferred to HHS's ORR custody, UACs are generally released. Once transferred to HHS's ORR custody, Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) are generally released to an ORR-contracted care facility based on their needs and age. They remain in federal legal custody and may stay in the facility until removal proceedings are completed, they turn 18, or a guardian is found. The \"best interest of the child\" standard is crucial in determining custody and placement decisions for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) in HHS custody. State courts must grant SIJ status before a child can be committed to a state agency or court-appointed entity. This standard prioritizes the child's welfare in decision-making processes. The \"best interest of the child\" standard is important in custody decisions for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) in HHS custody. It does not determine if a child is subject to removal, but can influence immigration removal proceedings. The standard does not override immigration laws and regulations. The \"best interest of the child\" standard can influence immigration removal proceedings and decisions regarding the release of a child from detention. It is also considered in determining eligibility for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status, along with other criteria that must be met. In 2008, Congress mandated that UACs placed in ORR custody be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child. Some UACs may be eligible for asylum due to gang-related violence in their home countries, but eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis. Persecution for asylum purposes is defined as the infliction of suffering or harm on individuals based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group membership. It must be on account of a protected ground and not just generalized violence or lawlessness. Gang-related violence may be considered persecution if it is on account of a protected ground. Asylum seekers often claim persecution based on gang-related violence, citing membership in a specific social group or political opinion opposing the gangs. The definition of the relevant social group varies, including those resisting recruitment, former gang members, witnesses against gangs, and families affected by violence. Tribunals sometimes reject these proposed social groups as too vague or not recognizable by society. The determination of asylum claims often depends on the evidence presented by the alien regarding social perceptions in their home society. Inconsistencies in stories can lead to claims being deemed not credible. Unaccompanied alien children (UACs) seeking asylum are treated similarly to other aliens, with exceptions such as all UAC asylum applications being heard by USCIS. Claims for asylum can be filed by aliens in removal proceedings, with USCIS handling applications for unaccompanied alien children. Minority status can be considered an \"extraordinary circumstance\" for late filings, and the primary difference between refugees and asylees is their location when applying for status. The primary difference between refugees and asylees is the alien's location at the time of applying for status, based on the definition of a refugee in the INA. Refugee status is granted to aliens outside the United States, while asylum is granted to aliens at the U.S. border or inside the country. Considering Central American individuals for refugee status would eliminate the need to travel through Mexico to reach the United States. The program allows unmarried children under 21 in El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras with parents legally present in the US to be considered for refugee status or parole. They must show past persecution or fear of future persecution based on a protected ground. Refugees face broader criminal grounds of inadmissibility compared to asylees. Applicants for refugee status must be sponsored and may be placed on waiting lists, unlike asylees. Refugees have a limit on admissions each year and can be selected based on US policies. Asylees can appeal denials, unlike refugees. Derivative status may be granted to spouses and minor children of refugees and asylees, who can also become LPRs after one year. UACs have access to legal counsel under two federal provisions. Access to legal counsel for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) is granted under two federal provisions, but the government is not required to provide counsel at its expense. Challenges have been made on the grounds that this violates the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, arguing that children in other civil proceedings have a categorical right to government-funded counsel. Courts have rejected arguments for a categorical right to government-funded counsel for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs), but some federal courts have suggested appointing counsel on a case-by-case basis for aliens who are unable to represent themselves due to age, ignorance, or mental capacity. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act could also require the appointment of counsel for immigration detainees with serious mental disorders. The federal government's 2014 announcement of grants to provide legal representation for children in immigration proceedings raised questions about using funds to provide counsel for UACs in removal proceedings. Section 292 of the INA governs aliens' right to counsel, stating that individuals have the privilege of being represented at no expense to the Government. Some argue that the government cannot pay for aliens' counsel in removal proceedings based on INA Section 292 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a73106. However, this interpretation has not been adopted by any court, and other interpretations are possible. It could be argued that these provisions only limit aliens' ability to claim counsel at the government's expense, not precluding the government from paying for their counsel under other laws or at its discretion. The United States, like many countries, is a party to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), which allows foreign nationals to have their consulate notified when arrested. The VCCR does not require notification in every instance but gives the detained individual the option to have their consulate informed. Foreign consular officers also have the right to communicate with and visit detained nationals. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) allows detained foreign nationals to have their consulate notified when arrested, giving them the right to communicate with consular officers and arrange legal representation. The United States has bilateral agreements with some countries for consular notification, but most Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) encountered along the U.S.-Mexico border do not have separate agreements for mandatory consular notification. The United States may enter into legally binding or nonlegal arrangements with foreign countries for the repatriation of their nationals, including Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs). Nonlegal arrangements often involve notifying Mexican consular officials and repatriating UACs during daylight hours. The VCCR requires host countries to notify consular posts promptly if a guardian is needed for a minor or incapacitated person from the sending State. UACs who arrived in the US in FY2014 are generally not eligible for DACA, a temporary relief program. The administration has been stopped from expanding DACA and creating a similar program for certain undocumented parents of US citizens or LPRs. DACA eligibility requires continuous residence in the US since June 15, 2007, with physical presence on June 15, 2012. Immigration officials can still grant deferred action to aliens outside of DACA under certain circumstances. The administration can grant deferred action to aliens outside of DACA under certain circumstances, or if humanitarian factors support allowing individual aliens to stay in the United States."
