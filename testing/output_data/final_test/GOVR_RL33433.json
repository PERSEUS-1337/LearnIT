Wealth serves as a crucial source of income during economic hardships and retirement. It also influences consumer spending and economy-wide recovery. Congressional deliberations on taxation, education, housing, and entitlements could affect wealth accumulation. This report analyzes data from 1989 to 2013 on wealth trends and concentration across families. The report analyzes wealth trends and concentration across families, highlighting the limited data available on family wealth. Data sources include estate tax returns, Census Bureau reports, and the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) collects detailed statistics on family assets, liabilities, and income every three years since 1992. It measures wealth by net worth, including financial assets like accounts, stocks, and real assets like residences and vehicles. Liabilities such as mortgages are also accounted for. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) collects data on family assets and liabilities every three years. It measures wealth by net worth, including financial assets and real assets. Some argue that excluding Social Security and pension benefits from net worth calculations is a limitation of the SCF. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) collects data on family assets and liabilities every three years, measuring wealth by net worth. It uses a sample design with a geographically based random sample and an oversample of wealthy families to correct for nonresponse bias. Median and mean net worth are common measures used to describe wealth levels and concentration. The median is a more reliable indicator of the \"typical\" family's wealth compared to the mean in wealth distribution. The mean can be skewed if a minority of high-wealth families own a significant portion of wealth. SCF data shows that mean family net worth was consistently higher than median net worth from 1989-2013, indicating wealth concentration among upper-half families. The wealth distribution became more concentrated at the upper end over time, with median family net worth declining by 40.0% and mean net worth declining by 14.6% between 2007 and 2013. Median family wealth dropped almost to its 1992 level, while mean net worth remained essentially unchanged in 2013. The median family's total asset holdings fell 11% from $200,600 in 2010 to $177,900 in 2013, while the mean total asset holdings fell 3% from $656,200 in 2010 to $638,900 in 2013. Debt holdings also decreased, with the median family's debt falling 20% from $75,800 in 2010 to $60,400 in 2013, and the mean debt holdings decreasing 13% from $140,000 in 2010 to $122,300 in 2013. The distribution of family wealth in 2013 shows that the top 10% of families held 75.3% of total net worth, while the bottom 90% held 24.7%. The wealth share of the top 3% increased from 44.8% in 1989 to 51.8% in 2013, with the next 7% holding 20.9% since 1989. Overall, the top 10% of wealth owners saw their share grow from 67.2% in 1989 to 75.3% in 2013, while the remaining 90% saw a decline from 33.2% to 24.7% in the same period. The decline in household saving rate from 33.2% in 1989 to 24.7% in 2013 was linked to the rise in equity and housing prices, which led to an increase in family wealth through asset appreciation. Stock values tripled, and home values rose, substituting saving from current income as a way to accumulate wealth. The median value of stock owned by families tripled between 1989 and 2001, while housing prices rose rapidly through 2006, keeping the saving rate low. The real median value of stock fell by 16% between 2001 and 2007, but the median value of primary residences rose by 39% over the same period. Residential assets are more widely distributed than stock, with the wealthiest 10% of families holding 38.5% of the gross equity in principal residences compared to 90.4% of the value of stock. In 2007, families held 48.9% of the gross equity in principal residences compared with 9.0% in stock. Rising house prices benefited a larger proportion of the population than stock price appreciation. The top 10% of wealth-owning families benefited the most from stock prices. The 2007 SCF was completed during a financial crisis, with 63% of families experiencing a loss in net worth. Between 2007 and 2009, 63% of families experienced a decrease in net worth, with a median percentage decrease of 45%. The drop in median net worth (23%) was greater than the drop in mean net worth (19%), indicating that lower-income families were more affected by the recession. Stocks, vehicles, business equity, and nonresidential property values all saw significant declines in median value during the recession. During the 2007-2009 recession, primary residences' value dropped significantly, with a median decrease of 12% and an absolute drop of $18,700. This decline, along with decreases in home equity, stocks, and business equity, contributed to the overall decrease in net worth. The composition of assets held by families also changed, with primary residences, stocks, and business equity all experiencing drops in their share of total assets. Housing price depreciation played a larger role in the decline of family net worth compared to stocks and business equity. Results from the 2010 and 2013 SCF show that house price depreciation played a significant role in reducing median net worth between 2007 and 2013. The median family's total asset holdings decreased by 11% from 2011 to 2013, with stocks showing uneven distribution of gains and losses across families. The median value of stocks increased from $21,400 in 2010 to $27,000 in 2013, while the mean value rose from $224,800 to $294,300. In contrast, the median and mean value of primary residences decreased. Higher income families are better positioned to accumulate wealth. In 2013, wealth was more concentrated than income, with families in the top 10% saving more compared to those in the bottom 20%. The mean net worth was 6.6 times more than the median net worth, indicating greater wealth concentration among higher-income families. Analysts have explored reasons for this disparity. Researchers have found that saving for retirement alone does not fully explain the higher concentration of wealth compared to income. Adding variables for unpredictable events like job loss and divorce to savings behavior models shows that precautionary saving contributes to wealth concentration. Analysts are also considering entrepreneurship as a factor in explaining this disparity. Entrepreneurs, who make up a small proportion of the population, constitute a significant portion of the wealthiest families. They are motivated to save due to difficulty in borrowing funds for their businesses. Wealthier families also save to pass assets to their children, leading to high savings rates even in old age. Bequests include financial capital. Wealthy parents can pass on greater earnings abilities to their children through bequests of financial and human capital, such as education. This advantage stems from their ability to finance their children's post-secondary education more easily, leading to increased earning potential and wealth accumulation for the next generation."
