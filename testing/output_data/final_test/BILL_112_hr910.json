    "content": "The \"Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\" prohibits the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases under Title III of the Clean Air Act. The \"Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\" defines greenhouse gases and limits the Administrator from regulating or taking action on their emissions to address climate change. The \"Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\" excludes greenhouse gases from the definition of air pollutants, except for purposes other than climate change. It also allows for specific exceptions related to vehicle emissions standards. The proposed rule addresses greenhouse gas emissions standards and fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles. It includes implementation and enforcement of various sections related to climate change and class I and II substances. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 state that greenhouse gases are not subject to certain air quality regulations. Specific rules and actions related to reporting and findings for greenhouse gases are repealed. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 exempt greenhouse gases from certain air quality regulations. Recent publications and memorandums have addressed the interpretation of regulations determining pollutants covered by permitting programs and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. The Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule was published in 2010 along with actions to ensure authority to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program for sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Implementation Plan was published in 2010 to ensure authority to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program for sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Implementation Plan published in 2010 established permitting authority for greenhouse gas emitting sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program. Federal actions before the enactment of this section applying stationary source permitting requirements are exempted, except for specific listed actions. The section allows states to adopt, enforce, or repeal laws regarding greenhouse gas emissions without federal limitations, except for specific provisions that are not federally enforceable. The term 'provision' in the plan or program refers to any limitation or permit requirement for greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. The Administrator cannot approve or enforce any provision in a permit program under title V that limits greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. SEC. 3 amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit waivers for emissions standards of greenhouse gases for new vehicles. SEC. 4 expresses the Sense of Congress. The Sense of Congress acknowledges scientific concern over climate change, emphasizes the international nature of the issue, recognizes the US role in addressing global climate change, and calls for policies that do not harm the American economy. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
