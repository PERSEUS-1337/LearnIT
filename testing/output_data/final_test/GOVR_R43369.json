    "content": "Article III, Section I of the Constitution establishes the judicial power of the United States in the Supreme Court and lower courts created by Congress. Justices and judges appointed under Article III serve for life unless removed for misconduct. This report focuses on recent nominations to the U.S. circuit courts of appeals and district courts by President Obama and other recent Presidents. Nominations to the Supreme Court and U.S. Court of International Trade are not covered. In recent Congresses, there has been ongoing interest in the nomination and approval process of U.S. circuit and district court judges by the President and Senate. Senate debates often focus on the success rate of a President's nominees in gaining confirmation compared to nominees of other Presidents. Concerns also arise about delays in considering nominees by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the increasing number of vacant judgeships in the federal judiciary. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII to lower the vote threshold for cloture on presidential nominations, enabling a majority vote for confirmation. This change aims to address delays in filling vacant judgeships and streamline the confirmation process. This report compares the progress of President Obama's judicial nominees with his three predecessors, analyzes nomination timelines, and examines judicial vacancies during their fifth and sixth years in office. The report compares the judicial nomination and confirmation process of President Obama's first five years in office with his three immediate two-term predecessors (Reagan, G.W. Bush, and Clinton), focusing on the number and percentage of confirmed nominees for U.S. circuit and district courts. The report compares the judicial nomination and confirmation process of President Obama's first five years in office with his three immediate two-term predecessors (Reagan, G.W. Bush, and Clinton), focusing on the number and percentage of confirmed nominees for U.S. circuit and district courts. It also compares the percentage of circuit and district court judgeships vacant at the beginning of each President's fifth and sixth years in office, including vacancies considered \"judicial emergencies.\" The report does not analyze the appropriate number of nominees for the Senate to confirm or the time needed for the Senate Judiciary Committee to process nominations. During the first five years of a presidency, Presidents Reagan through Obama nominated between 50 and 60 individuals to circuit court judgeships. Presidents Reagan and Obama nominated the greatest number of individuals (58 and 57, respectively). The report does not analyze the appropriate number of nominees for the Senate to confirm or the time needed for the Senate Judiciary Committee to process nominations. During the first five years of their presidencies, Presidents Reagan through Obama nominated between 50 and 60 individuals to circuit court judgeships. President Reagan had the highest confirmation percentage of nominees by the end of his fifth year (96.6%), while President Clinton had the lowest (69.8%). President Clinton saw an increase in confirmation percentage to 88.7% for nominees confirmed later in his presidency. President G.W. Bush had a confirmation percentage of 77.8% for nominees by the end of his fifth year. During the first five years of their presidencies, Presidents Reagan through Obama nominated individuals to district court judgeships. President G.W. Bush had the highest percentage of nominees never confirmed (18.5%), followed by Presidents Clinton (11.3%) and Reagan (3.4%). Each President nominated between 194 and 239 individuals, with Clinton and Obama nominating the most. During their first five years in office, Presidents Reagan through Obama nominated individuals to district court judgeships. President G.W. Bush had the highest percentage of nominees never confirmed (18.5%), followed by Presidents Clinton (11.3%) and Reagan (3.4%). Clinton and Obama nominated the most individuals, with Reagan having the highest confirmation rate of nominees during his first five years. During their first five years in office, Presidents Reagan through Obama nominated individuals to district court judgeships. President Clinton had the highest percentage of nominees who were never confirmed (7.9%), followed by Presidents Reagan (1.5%) and G.W. Bush (1.0%). There is variation in the number of U.S. circuit and district court nominees confirmed solely during a President's fifth year in office. Reagan had the highest number of circuit court nominees confirmed during a fifth year, while G.W. Bush had the lowest. For district court nominees, Reagan had the highest number confirmed during a fifth year, while G.W. Bush had the lowest. Clinton and Obama also had district court nominees confirmed during their fifth years. President Obama had the second greatest number of district court nominees confirmed during his fifth year in office, trailing behind other Presidents in overall number and percentage of confirmations. This delay may be due to the Senate taking longer to confirm his nominees. Some nominations at the end of his fifth year were still pending action by the Judiciary Committee or the full Senate. President Obama had 10 circuit court nominees awaiting action by the Judiciary Committee or full Senate at the end of his fifth year in office, accounting for 17.5% of his total nominations. In comparison, Clinton and G.W. Bush had 13 and 7 nominees awaiting action at the same point in their presidencies, respectively. During the first five years of the Clinton and G.W. Bush presidencies, 24.5% and 13.0% of individuals were nominated, respectively. President Obama had the highest number of district court nominees pending action by the end of his fifth year, with 46 nominees awaiting committee or Senate action, accounting for 20.4% of all nominations during his first five years. In contrast, President G.W. Bush had 11 district court nominees awaiting action by the end of his fifth year, accounting for 5.7% of those nominated during his first five years. During President Clinton's fifth year in office, 30 district court nominees were awaiting committee or floor action, accounting for 12.6% of those nominated. President Reagan had eight district court nominees awaiting action by the Judiciary Committee or full Senate, accounting for 4.0% of his nominees. The discussion is based on nomination and confirmation statistics from each President's first five years in office. The average and median number of days from a judicial vacancy occurring to a President nominating someone for that vacancy is tracked from Reagan to Obama, excluding nominees who were never confirmed or confirmed in a President's sixth year or later. The calculations include individuals nominated to circuit and district court judgeships during a President's first five years, using the date a vacancy occurred for the purpose of calculating the days elapsed from vacancy to nomination. President Clinton took the longest time to nominate individuals to circuit court vacancies, averaging 370.6 days. Presidents Obama and G.W. Bush took around 261.6 and 256.4 days, respectively, while President Reagan took 234.3 days. For district court nominees, President Obama took the longest time to nominate individuals, averaging 348.3 days, while President G.W. Bush took the least time at 258.8 days. President Clinton took the longest time to nominate individuals to district court vacancies, averaging 303 days, while President G.W. Bush took the least time at 194 days. It is unclear if there is a relationship between nomination time and Senate confirmation rates. Despite taking nearly as long as President Obama to nominate district court judges, President Clinton had 25 more judges confirmed in the first five years of his presidency. The speed of submitting judicial nominations to the Senate reflects factors within and outside an Administration's control. Factors within control include the President's priority on filling vacancies and the vetting process. Factors outside control include Supreme Court vacancies and Senators' recommendations. President G.W. Bush's circuit court nominees waited the longest period of time from nomination to confirmation, averaging 402 days. President Obama's nominees followed with an average of 253.7 days, while Presidents Clinton and Reagan had averages of 158.2 days and 56.8 days, respectively. President G.W. Bush's circuit court nominees had the longest wait time for confirmation at 245 days, followed by President Obama's nominees at 228 days. President Clinton's nominees waited a median of 108 days, while President Reagan's nominees waited 37 days. Analysis shows that 61.8% of President Reagan's nominees were confirmed within 60 days, while 48.6% of President Clinton's were confirmed within 61 to 120 days. President G.W. Bush's circuit court nominees had the longest wait time for confirmation at 245 days, followed by President Obama's nominees at 228 days. Comparatively, 69.0% of Bush's nominees were confirmed after more than 180 days, while 80.5% of Obama's nominees were confirmed after the same time frame. Obama's nominees had a higher percentage of waiting more than 6 months for confirmation during his first five years. During President Obama's first five years, his district court nominees had longer wait times for confirmation compared to other Presidents. On average, his nominees waited 223.3 days from nomination to confirmation, while President G.W. Bush's nominees waited 161.2 days, President Clinton's nominees waited 106.9 days, and President Reagan's nominees waited 50.0 days. The median waiting times ranged from 214.0 days for Obama to 50.0 days for Reagan. During President Obama's first five years, district court nominees had varying confirmation wait times. President Reagan had the shortest wait time at 31.0 days, while President Obama had the longest at 214.0 days. President Clinton and G.W. Bush had median wait times of 90.0 and 137.5 days, respectively. President Reagan had a majority of nominees confirmed within 60 days, while President Obama had a majority wait over 180 days for confirmation. During President Obama's first five years, a majority of U.S. circuit and district court nominees waited over 180 days to be confirmed after being nominated. Figure 3 compares the mean and median days from nomination to committee hearing for nominees of four Presidents. G.W. Bush's circuit court nominees had the longest wait for a hearing during his first five years in office. During President Obama's first five years, circuit court nominees waited an average of 76.4 days for a committee hearing after being nominated, with Reagan's nominees having the shortest wait of 28.8 days. Clinton's nominees waited 88.9 days on average, while G.W. Bush's nominees waited 296.6 days. Obama's nominees received hearings relatively quickly compared to other presidents. During President Obama's first five years, district court nominees waited an average of 81.8 days for a hearing, similar to the waiting time during the Clinton presidency. The median number of days for Obama's nominees was 77.0, while Clinton's nominees waited 62.0 days on average. Notable changes during the Obama presidency include the length of time nominees await final consideration. During the Obama presidency, judicial nominees waited longer on the Executive Calendar before Senate consideration compared to past Presidents. The average days from committee report to confirmation increased over the years, with the longest wait during the G.W. Bush presidency. During President Obama's first five years, the average number of days from committee report to confirmation increased to 144.9 days, with a median range from 4 days during Reagan's presidency to 131 days during Obama's. Clinton and G.W. Bush had median confirmation times of 7 and 30.5 days, respectively. Reagan's district court nominees had shorter wait times compared to other Presidents, with an average of 12.2 days. Clinton and G.W. Bush saw increases to 18.2 and 33.1 days, respectively. During the Obama presidency, the average number of days from committee report to confirmation increased to 109.2 days, with a median range from 2.0 days during Reagan's presidency to 90.0 days during Obama's. Clinton and G.W. Bush had median confirmation times of 6.0 and 18.0 days, respectively. Obama's district court nominees had longer wait times, but this did not result in widespread opposition during confirmation. During the Obama presidency, the average time from committee report to confirmation increased to 109.2 days, with a median of 90.0 days. For district court nominees with longer confirmation times, 65.0% were confirmed by voice vote or with zero nay votes. Additionally, 52.6% of circuit court nominees with extended confirmation times were confirmed similarly. The percentage of vacant judgeships varies based on nominee selection pace and Senate consideration speed. Table 5 compares the percentage of vacant U.S. circuit and district court judgeships during the fifth and sixth years of four Presidents' terms. It shows that vacancies were highest during the Reagan and Clinton presidencies in the fifth year, and during the Clinton and Obama presidencies in the sixth year. During the Clinton and Obama presidencies, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships was highest. President Obama was the only one to see a slight increase in vacancies from his fifth to sixth year in office. Reagan and G.W. Bush saw decreases in vacancies during the same period. Reagan and Clinton had the highest percentage of vacant district court judgeships in their fifth year. During the Clinton and Obama presidencies, the percentage of vacant district court judgeships was highest, with Obama seeing a slight increase in vacancies from his fifth to sixth year in office. Vacancies are deemed \"judicial emergencies\" based on case filings and vacancy duration. During the Clinton and Obama presidencies, the percentage of vacant district court judgeships was highest, with Obama seeing a slight increase in vacancies from his fifth to sixth year in office. Factors contributing to judicial emergencies include the pace of nominee selection by the President and Senate consideration. Judicial emergencies are determined by case filings and vacancy duration for circuit and district court judgeships. Table 6 compares the percentage of circuit and district court vacancies considered judicial emergencies during the fifth and sixth years of Presidents Clinton, Obama, and G.W. Bush's terms. The data shows that G.W. Bush had the highest percentage of judicial emergencies for circuit court judgeships during his fifth year, followed by Clinton and Obama. Reagan's data is not available for comparison. During the G.W. Bush presidency, the percentage of circuit court vacancies considered judicial emergencies was highest at 61.5% in his sixth year. President Obama saw an increase in vacant circuit court judgeships deemed judicial emergencies from 37.5% to 58.8% between his fifth and sixth years, while Presidents G.W. Bush and Clinton experienced decreases of 18.5% and 3.0% respectively. During the Obama presidency, the percentage of judicial emergencies for district court vacancies on January 1 of his fifth and sixth years was highest compared to G.W. Bush and Clinton. G.W. Bush was the only President whose percentage of vacant district court judgeships deemed judicial emergencies declined from his fifth to sixth year in office. For Clinton and Obama, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships considered judicial emergencies increased. Judicial emergencies increased by 7.8% and 0.4% from the fifth to sixth year of each President's term."
