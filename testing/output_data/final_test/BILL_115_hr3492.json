Congress finds that apprenticeships can help veterans transition from military service to civilian employment by providing on-the-job training, utilizing their acquired skills, offering practical work experience, and forming professional connections. In fiscal year 2016, over 21,000 apprenticeship programs were registered in the United States. In the United States, over 1,700 new apprenticeship programs were established, with more than 206,000 individuals entering these programs. Additionally, over 505,000 apprentices aimed to acquire skills for financial security, and around 49,000 individuals graduated from apprenticeship programs. SEC. 2. Educational assistance for veterans pursuing specific apprenticeship programs. Section 3313(g)(3) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to provide an annual stipend for tuition and fees for individuals pursuing registered apprenticeship programs on a more than half-time but less than full-time basis. The stipend amount is capped at the lesser of the actual net cost after waivers or 25 percent of the calculated amount under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii).

Pilot program for veterans pursuing computer numerically controlled machining certifications. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program offering eligible veterans the chance to enroll in computer numerically controlled machining certification programs. Eligible veterans are those entitled to educational assistance. The Secretary will contract with multiple providers for these programs within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will pay contractors for certification programs for eligible veterans in computer numerically controlled machining. Providers must be operational for at least two years to qualify. The Secretary will also provide tuition reimbursement for the pilot program. The Secretary will give preference to providers offering tuition reimbursement for students who complete a certification program but do not find employment within 180 days. Eligible veterans in a CNC machining program will receive a monthly housing stipend based on the basic allowance for housing. Veterans pursuing certification programs may receive a monthly housing stipend based on their pay grade and location. The amount is determined by the number of course hours taken for the certification program. A certification program in computer numerically controlled machining is defined as a training program offered by an entity other than an institution of higher learning or a professional organization, does not lead to a degree, and leads to a National Institute for Metalworking Skills credential. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to submit reports to Congress on this program. The Secretary will report to Congress on the pilot program. The Comptroller General will submit an interim report to Congress three years after the program starts, with recommendations for improvement.
