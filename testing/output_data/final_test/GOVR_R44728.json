    "content": "The Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) has been providing GI Bill benefits since 1944, distributing over $14 billion in FY2017 to help veterans and servicemembers afford postsecondary education. State Approving Agencies (SAAs) play a crucial role in approving programs, conducting compliance visits, and providing assistance to ensure the quality of education and training. State Approving Agencies (SAAs) ensure veterans and GI Bill participants have access to quality education and training programs. The report outlines SAAs' roles, responsibilities, and processes in administering GI Bill benefits. It notes variations in work processes and does not reconcile differences in accounts. The original GI Bill of 1944 relied on state agencies to approve education programs for eligible individuals. Due to the large number of veterans using the GI Bill, state agencies struggled to establish adequate standards, leading to abuses and inconsistencies. State Approving Agencies (SAAs) were then authorized to provide consistency, guidance, and financial resources in approving programs. State Approving Agencies (SAAs) were authorized to provide consistency, guidance, and financial resources in the approval process from the federal government. In response to abuses, the VA and Congress sought to improve oversight of education programs approved for GI Bill purposes. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-377) modified SAA responsibilities to focus on program oversight and reduce possible misuse. The bill aims to reduce misuse of benefits and fraud by shifting SAA approval activities to program oversight. Each state is required to have an SAA for oversight, training, and outreach activities related to GI Bill benefits. VA covers expenses for SAA employees and administrative costs. If a state fails to designate an SAA, VA steps in to fulfill the role. The VA fulfills the duties of the State Approving Agency (SAA) if a state fails to designate one. Forty-eight states and Puerto Rico have SAAs, while Alaska, Washington D.C., Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands do not. Some states have multiple SAAs specializing in different types of education. VA Education Liaison Representatives (ELRs) handle education liaison and approval functions. The VA Education Liaison Representatives (ELRs) work with facilities and State Approving Agencies (SAAs) to ensure compliance with GI Bill statutes. ELRs also serve as SAAs for Alaska, Washington D.C., Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Secretary of Veterans' Affairs can enter contracts with SAAs to approve education programs and provide related services. The VA Education Liaison Representatives (ELRs) work with State Approving Agencies (SAAs) to ensure compliance with GI Bill statutes. SAAs are responsible for establishing approval and compliance standards for education programs, personnel qualifications, evaluation standards, and reimbursement amounts. The VA collaborates with SAAs to develop personnel qualifications and performance standards in accordance with state and local requirements. The VA is accountable for the overall administration of GI Bill benefits. The VA is responsible for overseeing GI Bill benefits administration, coordinating with SAAs, DOL, and ED to avoid duplication of efforts, and may request services from SAAs to aid in program approval and benefit administration. The VA works closely with State Approving Agencies (SAAs) to administer GI Bill benefits. SAAs interpret and apply federal and state requirements at the local level, with guidance from the VA's Education Liaison Representative (ELR). Communication between SAAs and ELR is crucial for ensuring eligible individuals receive benefits. To receive GI Bill benefits, eligible individuals must be enrolled in approved education programs. Educational institutions, training establishments, and testing organizations must submit applications to their State Approving Agencies (SAAs) for program approval. The application contents vary based on the type of education program. To initiate the approval process for a new education program for GI Bill benefits, a facility or individual can contact the State Approving Agency (SAA). If the program is not approved, the VA will send a \"Denial of Benefits\" letter, prompting the facility to submit an application for approval. SAAs handle new program applications regularly. The SAA or VA completes initial approval review for education programs, issues approval/disapproval letters to facilities, and sends approval package to ELR for GI Bill funding review. VA maintains list of approved programs for GI Bill benefits. Individuals can start receiving benefits once program is on VA's approved list. The GI Bill benefits program has three main approval processes for education programs: \"deemed approved,\" SAA approval, and VA approval. Prior to 2011, SAAs and the VA conducted in-depth reviews for program approval. \"Deemed approved\" programs do not require in-depth review as they are approved by another agency. After the enactment of P.L. 111-377, the VA reinterpreted the approval process for programs deemed approved. In 2015, the VA implemented an abbreviated approval process for deemed approved programs, which include college degree programs, flight training courses, apprenticeship programs, secondary school diploma programs, and licensure/certification tests offered by government agencies. In 2015, the VA implemented an abbreviated approval process for deemed approved programs to reduce duplicative efforts by federal agencies. The process requires SAAs to ensure program criteria are met, including program objectives, mode of delivery, the 85-15 rule, and institutional criteria. The Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 codifies this process, requiring SAAs to approve programs meeting the deemed approved definition. The VA implemented an abbreviated approval process for deemed approved programs in 2015 to reduce duplicative efforts. SAAs are responsible for approving programs that do not meet the deemed approved criteria, such as NCD programs, programs at private for-profit institutions, and non-accredited programs. They may also approve licensing and certification tests upon request. The State Approving Agencies (SAAs) coordinate and share information with state partners and accrediting agencies to review applicant programs. This helps identify potential issues, avoid duplicative efforts, and guide the review process. The application review typically takes 30 days but may extend to 90 days based on various factors. The State Approving Agencies (SAAs) work with educational institutions to review and approve new programs of education. Programs at well-resourced institutions with approved programs require less effort, while innovative or unapproved programs require more time and review. SAAs may conduct site visits to verify applications. The VA approves programs outside of SAA jurisdiction, such as those in foreign countries or states without an SAA. The VA approves programs in foreign countries and states without an SAA, including programs for dependents in the DEA program. Changes to approved programs require review and approval, with revisions needed for various updates like curriculum changes or new SCOs. Contacting the SAA before making changes can prevent approval issues. The SCO must obtain approval for changes in program location, ownership, accreditation, or licensure status. Failure to do so promptly may lead to program suspension. Supervisory visits ensure compliance with regulations through reviews of student records and interviews with faculty and students. The SAA reports any changes to the VA following approval reviews. Supervisory visits by SAAs ensure compliance with regulations by reviewing various aspects of facilities and programs, including enrollment status, correspondence with VA, state licensure, advertising materials, distance learning policies, instructor qualifications, and facility resources. While not contractually required anymore, some SAAs still conduct these visits to uncover issues and provide training as needed. Supervisory visits by SAAs ensure compliance with regulations through annual reviews of facilities and programs. Compliance surveys focus on financial accountability and statutory adherence, with a shift in responsibility from VA Education Compliance Survey Specialists to SAAs after the enactment of P.L. 111-377. The VA Education Compliance Survey Specialists conducted surveys, but SAAs took over compliance surveys in FY2012 under P.L. 111-377. The VA and NASAA formed a joint group to improve the compliance survey process. Statutory provisions guide the nature and targeting of compliance surveys. Prior to P.L. 114-315, annual compliance surveys were required for educational institutions enrolling at least 300 GI Bill recipients. The requirement for annual compliance surveys of educational institutions enrolling at least 300 GI Bill or VR&E participants has been modified by P.L. 114-315 to include institutions with at least 20 participants. The Secretary may waive the requirement based on an institution's compliance record, and there are concerns about insufficient resources to conduct the surveys. The VA conducts compliance surveys annually on educational institutions with at least 20 GI Bill or VR&E participants. The surveys aim to ensure statutory requirements are met, assist officials and veterans in understanding the law, and verify proper VA benefit payments. Surveys may be conducted on-site or remotely, with priorities set for higher risk programs. The VA conducts annual compliance surveys on educational institutions with at least 20 GI Bill or VR&E participants to ensure statutory requirements are met. Priorities are set for higher risk programs, with procedures prescribed by the VA for selecting facilities and reviewing student files. The SAAs review the VA database to select students for compliance surveys, comparing their enrollment and certification history during on-site visits to ensure proper GI Bill payments and adherence to approval standards. Files include transcripts and credit evaluations. The facility's student files contain transcripts, credit evaluations, financial accounts, attendance records, and other relevant documents. Compliance surveys also involve student interviews, verifications, and classroom visits. SAAs assess complaints in the VA GI Bill Feedback System and verify SCO's understanding of job requirements, fund transfers, and school policies. The compliance checklist covers various areas such as the 85-15 rule, independent study requirements, and pilot's license requirements. SCOs can ask questions and address issues during the visit, with discrepancies shared before the end of the survey. The compliance survey report and referrals are then shared with the facility, SAA, and ELR. The compliance surveys focus on proper administration and controls of federal funds, with concerns raised about their effectiveness in uncovering educational and financial noncompliance. The National Association of Veterans' Program Administrators also expressed concerns about diverting resources from training and supervision to compliance surveys. The National Association of Veterans' Program Administrators has concerns about diverting resources from training and supervision to compliance surveys. NASAA estimates that SAAs conduct compliance visits for only 15% of active institutions annually, with approximately 5,000 surveys completed by the VA and SAAs in 2016. Compliance surveys focus on proper administration of federal funds and may require different skill sets and training compared to training and supervisory visits. Additionally, SAAs may conduct technical assistance visits to provide information on facility responsibilities and non-GI Bill veterans' benefits. The VA requires SAAs to conduct compliance visits within 30 days of program approval at new facilities to ensure adherence to approval standards. These visits can be triggered by various factors such as third-party information, complaints, or professional judgment. For example, after concerns were raised about Corinthian Colleges, Inc., SAAs were asked to review their facilities. After each visit, a report is submitted to the VA along with any necessary referrals. The VA may disapprove new GI Bill enrollments at facilities charging more than others. GI Bill benefits can be suspended for ineligible individuals or programs not meeting requirements. The VA may disapprove new GI Bill enrollments at facilities charging more than others. GI Bill benefits can be suspended for ineligible individuals or programs not meeting requirements, with notification and corrective action timelines in place. Additionally, the VA must disapprove education programs charging above in-state rates for qualified GI Bill participants, discontinuing payments thereafter. The VA or SAA may disapprove unaccredited courses leading to licensure if requirements are not disclosed. SAAs are responsible for suspending non-compliant programs and providing training for compliance. Compliance issues are often uncovered during interactions other than surveys. The SAA may suspend a program of education for up to 60 days if it fails to meet approval requirements, providing assistance to resolve the issue. Failure to resolve the issue may result in program disapproval affecting GI Bill participants. Communication of suspension or disapproval will be through registered letters and notice to the ELR. The VA may not have the authority to override an SAA decision on approval, suspension, or withdrawal. Facilities can appeal to their parent agency or write an informal letter to the SAA if they disagree with the decision. Testing organizations can appeal to the VA Education Service Director. The VA may reverse the SAA decision based on additional information. The VA may reverse an SAA decision based on additional information, and the facility may litigate against the SAA. In some cases, court orders have forced SAAs to reverse their decisions, such as in the case of ITT Educational Services, Inc. and ECPI University's Medical Careers Institute. If a facility submits a false claim, the VA will notify the SAA and possibly the Attorney General, leading to an investigative visit by the SAA. The Executive Order 13607, signed in 2012, aims to assist veterans and servicemembers in pursuing quality education. It designates educational institutions as supportive environments for veterans and their families, with roles outlined for State Approving Agencies (SAAs). The Principles of Excellence encourage schools to provide transparent information on costs and quality, end deceptive recruiting practices, gain accreditation before enrolling students, and offer support services to veterans and servicemembers. Compliance may attract more enrollments from veterans and their families. The Principles of Excellence encourage schools to provide transparent information on costs and quality, end deceptive recruiting practices, gain accreditation before enrolling students, and offer support services to veterans and servicemembers. Compliance mechanisms include establishing refund policies, education plans, and designated points of contact for academic and financial advising. Non-compliance may result in removal from the list of schools adhering to the Principles of Excellence. The VA reviews institutions' compliance through surveys and takes necessary action. The Executive Order required the VA to use State Approving Agencies (SAAs) to improve information sharing among educational stakeholders overseeing institutional and program quality. This includes instituting uniform procedures for processing complaints, creating a coordinated mechanism to alert the VA of complaints, and establishing procedures for targeted risk-based program reviews. SAA personnel must meet qualification standards set by the VA. The FY2016 contracts outline qualification standards for SAA personnel overseeing job training establishments. New and continuing SAA employees receive training on their responsibilities, including mentoring and job shadowing. The only required training is annual privacy and information security awareness. The VA, in collaboration with SAAs, develops a training curriculum for SAA employees. VA provides informational materials to SAAs to fulfill their obligations. The VA provides professional development materials to SAAs, including training at NASAA conferences and the National Training Institute (NTI) with a focus on SAA responsibilities and activities. New SAA employees attend the NTI within their first year and receive the National Training Curriculum (NTC). The VA also offers Education Compliance Survey Specialist (ECSS)/ELR training modules for new SAA employees. The VA provides professional development materials to SAAs, including training at NASAA conferences and the National Training Institute (NTI) with a focus on SAA responsibilities and activities. New SAA employees attend the NTI within their first year and receive the National Training Curriculum (NTC). The VA also offers Education Compliance Survey Specialist (ECSS)/ELR training modules for new SAA employees, which requires approximately 64 hours to complete. Ongoing professional development is provided through refresher training at conferences and the development of a Training Performance Support System module in conjunction with the SAAs in FY2014. Additionally, regional conferences are held throughout the year for further training opportunities. In September 2014, the VA and NASAA formed a Joint Advisory Committee to address VA/SAA responsibilities. SAAs provide training to SCOs on GI Bill benefits administration. Various organizations offer formal and informal training opportunities for SCOs, including on-site training and technical assistance. SAAs make efforts to provide formal training to new and experienced SCOs, with a focus on smaller schools and institutions with fewer GI Bill participants. Participants often require additional in-person training as they are less likely to attend formal training. SAAs and ELRs provide informal, in-person training to SCOs during site visits. The 2007 GAO report highlighted the value of SAAs' training in ensuring proper administration of GI Bill benefits. Outreach activities aim to promote increased participation in VA or DOD educational assistance programs. SAAs also collaborate with education professionals to exchange information and support GI Bill interests. SAAs collaborate with the VA to promote outreach efforts and provide information on veterans' education benefits. They assist veterans in navigating GI Bill benefits through various outreach programs and events. SAAs also counsel veterans on utilizing GI Bill benefits at local facilities. The Department of Labor's Jobs for Veterans State Grants program utilizes disabled veterans' outreach program personnel to promote apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs. Outreach efforts have been reduced since 2012 due to compliance survey obligations. The Jobs for Veterans State Grants program utilizes disabled veterans' outreach program personnel to promote apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs. Surveys replaced supervisory visits for outreach activities. State Approving Agencies (SAAs) meet with Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVERs) to ensure graduates are aware of employment resources. SAAs are held accountable for fulfilling contractual obligations through reporting, evaluation, and reimbursement. The State Approving Agencies (SAAs) are responsible for overseeing education programs, conducting compliance visits, providing technical assistance to SCOs, offering trainings, liaising with various stakeholders, submitting reports, and fulfilling contractual obligations. The State Approving Agencies (SAAs) oversee education programs, conduct compliance visits, provide technical assistance, offer trainings, liaise with stakeholders, and submit reports. SAAs are responsible for funding allocation, business plans, compliance surveys, and performance measures with targets. Compliance visits are based on the number of full-time equivalent staff, and SAAs must meet specified performance standards, including timely facility visits and reporting to the VA. SAAs submit monthly or quarterly reports to the VA on their activities, including services performed and decisions made regarding education programs. Reports include approval actions, technical assistance interactions, compliance survey visits, facility visits, staff development activities, and outreach activities. The VA evaluates each SAA annually based on contract terms, starting with a self-evaluation. The evaluation considers personnel utilization, completed activities, outstanding activities, effective practices, resources used, and achievement of performance standards and business plan. The VA ELR, acting as the Contracting Officer Representative, evaluates SAAs annually through a self-assessment. A Joint Peer Review Group then reviews and rates the assessment for contract compliance. SAAs can appeal ratings to the VA Education Service Director and NASAA President. The VA considers annual evaluations when negotiating contracts, not necessarily the JPRG rating. VA covers necessary expenses for SAAs to fulfill their contractual obligations. The VA reimburses SAAs for necessary expenses to fulfill contractual obligations, with annual funds of $19 million since FY2006. Actual expenditures have increased from $17 million in FY2006 to $19 million since FY2013. SAAs have requested additional funds to cover increased responsibilities. Reimbursable expenses include salaries, benefits, necessary travel, and administrative expenses, excluding overhead expenses. SAA salaries must be comparable to other state employees. Allowable travel expenses are for program inspection, approval, or oversight. Administrative expenses for SAAs include outreach events, supplies, rental, repair, maintenance, and utility expenses. The administrative expense allowance is based on reimbursable salary costs and is specified in current law. Funds are allocated to SAAs based on the weighted number of active facilities. The VA allocates funds to SAAs based on the number of active facilities they oversee, with weighting based on institution type. Unused funds may be redistributed for supplementary awards. If SAAs fail to comply with contractual obligations, the VA may withhold reimbursement, leading to potential disputes under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The standards for GI Bill approval are outlined in federal statutes, regulations, and VA policies. The Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, along with SAAs, can develop additional criteria to ensure program quality. SAAs can also implement state regulations. Some statutory requirements may not align with current educational practices, such as those related to distance education. The standards for GI Bill approval are outlined in federal statutes, regulations, and VA policies. SAAs can develop additional criteria to ensure program quality, including implementing state regulations. Some statutory requirements, like those for distance education, have not been updated to reflect current practices. The approval process for programs of education includes initial approval standards for deemed approved programs and compliance requirements for all programs. The SAA evaluates if the educational institution maintains accurate records for GI Bill participants, reports enrollment changes to the VA promptly, and does not engage in deceptive advertising or incentivize enrollment. The SAA evaluates educational institutions for compliance with GI Bill regulations, including accurate record-keeping, prompt enrollment reporting, and ethical advertising practices. Programs must be offered by approved institutions and meet specific criteria for eligibility, including the 85-15 rule for student enrollment. Flight training programs must be offered by accredited institutions or approved flight schools. The Secretary disapproves new enrollments in courses if over 85% of students have educational charges paid by the institution, VR&E, or GI Bill. For NCD programs, institutions must be in operation for at least two years and retain faculty, student body, and courses after ownership change or move. Contracted courses must be approved for GI Bill purposes, and programs leading to licensure must meet state instructional requirements.

Deemed approved programs must maintain the same standards as non-deemed approved programs. Federal law sets the standards for GI Bill approval for education programs. The GI Bill sets standards for education program approval, including the 85-15 rule and restrictions on avocational and recreational programs. Program providers must also adhere to state licensure requirements and maintain accreditation. The facility must adhere to strict guidelines for education program approval under the GI Bill, including restrictions on deceptive practices and incentives for enrollment. It is required to have a designated SCO and report enrollment changes to the VA promptly. Private not-for-profit or for-profit educational institutions must meet specific criteria to be approved for GI Bill purposes, including retaining faculty, student body, and courses after ownership changes or moves. Public IHLs cannot charge tuition above the in-state rate for GI Bill participants. SAA and VA employees cannot receive remuneration from private for-profit educational institutions where GI Bill participants are enrolled. Private for-profit educational institutions must meet certain criteria to be approved for GI Bill purposes, including participating in Title IV programs and offering programs leading to state licensure or certification. Courses for programs preparing individuals for law practice must be accredited by an ED-recognized agency. Apprenticeships offer individuals the opportunity to earn a salary while learning the skills necessary for full employment in a career. Apprenticeships are DOL Registered Apprenticeship programs and apprenticeship programs approved by a state apprenticeship agency recognized by the DOL Office of Apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are deemed approved if the job does not require a wage subsidy. In the application, apprenticeship programs must provide information on the job objective, length of the training. Apprenticeship programs must provide information on the job objective, training period length, schedule for learning objectives, hours of instruction, and other requested details. The program must be pursued full-time and a training agreement with wage scale must be provided to GI Bill participants and the VA. On-the-Job Training (OJT) offers progression based on skills learned on the job, excluding apprenticeships.

The On-the-Job Training (OJT) program requires full-time training for 6 months to 2 years, with related instruction and progress monitoring. The training establishment must have necessary resources and not offer training to already qualified individuals. A training agreement must be provided to GI Bill participants and the VA, and additional criteria may be established by the SAA. Wages must meet approval and no wage subsidy is allowed. SAA may set additional criteria for OJT establishments to certify wages meeting approval criteria. Starting wages must be at least 50% of journeyman wages, increasing to 85% by the end of training. Accredited educational institutions offering non-approved programs include for-profit institutions and non-college degree programs. Degree programs at accredited educational institutions, courses accepted for teacher certification, and courses meeting regulations for nursing facilities must adhere to specific requirements including catalog submission, academic progress standards, student conduct policies, and record-keeping for GI Bill participants. The program must meet specific requirements such as previous education and training, curriculum quality, adequate resources, and qualified staff. Correspondence courses must be offered by an accredited educational institution. The program or course offered by an accredited educational institution must meet specific requirements and at least 50% of participants must complete it.
