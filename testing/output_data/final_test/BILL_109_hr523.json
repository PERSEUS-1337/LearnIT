The definition of Consumer Price Index is clarified as the CPI for All Urban Consumers (all items; United States city average) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. SEC. 3. Extension of pay-as-you-go by amending Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to enforce pay-as-you-go. The purpose of this section is to ensure that any legislation enacted before October 1, 2010, affecting direct spending that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration within 15 days of Congress adjourning. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will calculate the deficit increase or decrease by adding all OMB estimates for the budget year of direct spending legislation. The legislation requires OMB to calculate savings from prior year sequestration, deficit changes from current year direct spending legislation, and perform calculations before fiscal year 2005. OMB shall assume an automatic deficit increase of $8,400,000,000. The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts in a specific order. If additional reductions in direct spending are needed, each non-exempt account will be reduced by a uniform percentage to meet the required cuts. Medicare programs specified in section 256(d) will not be reduced by more than 4 percent. Outlay reductions may occur due to sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity. Outlay reductions from sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in that year. Accounts are assumed to be at the baseline level for fiscal year 2006 and adjusted for any sequester in fiscal year 2005 for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. CBO provides estimates to OMB of direct spending legislation, and OMB estimates are due within 7 calendar days after Congress completes action on the legislation. After the enactment of direct spending legislation, OMB must submit a report to Congress within 7 days, including CBO and OMB estimates and explanations for any significant differences. If there are discrepancies, OMB will consult with the House and Senate Budget Committees. The consultation process for estimates includes written communication to committees for comments before report issuance. Estimates cover changes in outlays for the current year, budget year, and outyears, excluding certain amounts. OMB and CBO, in consultation with Budget Committees, establish scorekeeping guidelines. The House of Representatives and Senate will determine scorekeeping guidelines and prepare estimates under this section. Emergency legislation may designate certain provisions as emergency requirements, affecting budget authority, outlays, and receipts in all fiscal years. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, changing the expiration date from \"2002\" to \"2010\". SEC. 5. EMERGENCY SPENDING LEGISLATION AND THE BASELINE. SEC. 5 amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 regarding emergency appropriations and legislation covered by specific sections. It specifies that emergency legislation shall not be extended in the baseline. The definition of \"emergency\" under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is a situation requiring new budget authority for the prevention or response to loss of life, property, or national security threat, and must be unanticipated, sudden, and urgent. The term \"emergency\" is defined as a compelling need requiring immediate action, unforeseen, and temporary. This definition is in line with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. SEC. 7. RULE RESPECTING DESIGNATION OF LEGISLATIVE PROVISION AS AN EMERGENCY. This section amends Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by adding a new rule regarding the designation of legislative provisions as emergencies. In designating legislation as an emergency requirement, the committee report must analyze if it meets the definition of an 'emergency' as outlined in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Bills with emergency designations under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 must also meet this definition to be considered in the Senate or House of Representatives. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 outlines procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate, requiring a three-fifths vote to suspend certain sections. In the House of Representatives, it is not allowed to consider a rule that waives subsection (b). The Chair in the House will put the question of consideration for a point of order, which is debatable for 10 minutes. The House of Representatives allows for 10 minutes of debate on a point of order, with an additional 10 minutes for an opponent. The question of consideration also applies to determining the consideration of an amendment made in order as original text. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Sec. 316. Rule respecting designation of legislative provision as an emergency."
