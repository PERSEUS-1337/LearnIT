The \"Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act of 2001\" amends the Social Security Act to provide grants for qualified enterprise communities designated under a specific section of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. The amount of grants available is also adjusted. The grant amount for qualified enterprise communities is $500,000 multiplied by the proportion of the community's population in the State. Grants will be made to the State where the community is located at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 and for the following 6 years. The funding for empowerment zones and enterprise communities is amended to $1,000,000,000 for original grants and $70,000,000 for additional enterprise community grants. Definitions for qualified enterprise communities are also provided. Definitions for qualified enterprise communities are amended to include references to section 766 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. Strategic plans under this Act are also updated to reflect this amendment. The use of grant funds is outlined in Section 3. The Social Security Act allows states to use funds for revolving loan activities to support disadvantaged adults and youths in achieving economic self-support by making loans to entities that hire them. The disbursement of these funds is regulated by the Secretary in accordance with the Cash Management Improvement Act. The Cash Management Improvement Act governs the disbursement of funds for grants to revolving loan funds and insured depository institutions. Grants must be made according to written commitments and as determined necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury may disburse funds for capitalization of a revolving loan fund or insured credit union as needed."
