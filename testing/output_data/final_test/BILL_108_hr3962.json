    "content": "The \"Support for Military Reserve Families Act of 2004\" includes a new chapter for a loan program for members of the Selected Reserve under title 10, United States Code. The \"Support for Military Reserve Families Act of 2004\" establishes a loan program for members of the Ready Reserve, including Coast Guard Reserve, called the 'Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program'. Eligible members with dependents enrolled in DEERS can receive loans for active duty performed under involuntary call to support a contingency operation. The \"Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program\" is administered by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security for the Coast Guard Reserve. Eligible members can receive loans if their income during service is less than before being called to duty. The Secretary determines income eligibility for the Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program by comparing the member's military compensation to their income before service. Loans must not be used for investment purposes. The Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program allows eligible members to borrow up to $500 for each full month of covered service performed. The loan amount can be disbursed as directed by the member, including for the benefit of dependents. Interest-free period is provided for the loan. Sec. 12595 of the Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program states that loans for covered service have an interest-free period of 5 years for less than 12 months of service, and 10 years for 12 months or more. After the interest-free period, a 5 percent interest rate applies. Sec. 12596 outlines the repayment period for loans under the Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program. Repayment begins when the member is released from active duty, with a repayment period of five years for service less than 12 months and ten years for service of 12 months or more. Payment on a loan under this chapter shall be deducted from the member's basic pay or inactive-duty pay unless an alternative repayment agreement is made with the Secretary. The Ready Reserve Mobilization Loan Program allows for loan repayment through deductions from a member's basic pay or inactive-duty pay."
