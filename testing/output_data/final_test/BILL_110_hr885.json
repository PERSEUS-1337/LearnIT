    "content": "The International Nuclear Fuel for Peace and Nonproliferation Act of 2007 establishes an international regime for the assured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means. It includes findings, a sense of Congress, statements of policy, and a report. Additionally, it authorizes voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency and appropriations for an International Nuclear Fuel Bank. The United States believes that limiting the number of countries with nuclear weapons is crucial for global security to prevent the use of nuclear weapons and avoid a potential arms race. Uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities pose a proliferation risk by producing nuclear material for both peaceful and weapon purposes. It is essential to minimize the number of countries operating these facilities to prevent easy access to nuclear weapons. The construction of uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities in additional countries is often driven by factors other than economic considerations, such as national pride and technological advancement. This poses a proliferation risk by increasing access to nuclear material for both peaceful and weapon purposes. The acquisition of uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities by developing countries demonstrates independence from technological domination. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty allows for the peaceful use of nuclear energy but prohibits the development of nuclear weapons. The proliferation of national uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities increases the risk of new nuclear weapon states. To address this, there is a need for multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply, sharing of peaceful nuclear energy applications, an international fuel bank, and possibly multilateral participation in enrichment and reprocessing facilities to reduce incentives for countries to develop their own. The recent revelations of a nuclear black-market and the attempts by North Korea and Iran to acquire uranium enrichment technology for nuclear weapons have reignited the debate on the need for multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply. Iran has justified developing its own uranium enrichment capability by citing concerns about an unreliable international supply of nuclear reactor fuel. Various initiatives have been proposed to address these proliferation concerns, including the United States' proposal. The United States has proposed the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and joined other countries in proposing a Multilateral Mechanism for Reliable Access to Nuclear Fuel to address concerns about nuclear proliferation and ensure reliable access to nuclear fuel. The Russian Federation has proposed placing one of its uranium enrichment facilities under international management as part of a Global Nuclear Power Infrastructure proposal. This aims to create international nuclear fuel cycle centers to ensure reliable access to nuclear reactor fuel at current market prices. The Russian Federation's proposal aims to establish international nuclear fuel cycle centers to provide countries with assured nuclear fuel supply at market prices, contingent on their commitment to nonproliferation and forgoing uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 102. The Sense of Congress, outlined in Section 102, supports the expansion of a multilateral mechanism for nuclear fuel access, international management of uranium enrichment facilities, and funding for an international nuclear fuel bank by the IAEA. The Sense of Congress supports the expansion of a multilateral mechanism for nuclear fuel access and funding for an international nuclear fuel bank by the IAEA. Member states should collectively pledge at least $100,000,000 in matching funds to fulfill the NTI proposal. Governments, organizations, and experts should identify additional incentives for an international regime for the assured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means. This includes participation in non-weapons-relevant technology development and fuel leasing to discourage countries from developing national uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities. SEC. 103. STATEMENTS OF POLICY. The policy of the United States is to support an international regime for nuclear fuel supply under multilateral authority and oppose non-nuclear weapon states from developing nuclear weapons. States party to the NPT are encouraged to interpret the right to peaceful nuclear energy as conditioned by the NPT's goal of preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. The United States supports an international regime for nuclear fuel supply under multilateral authority and opposes non-nuclear weapon states from developing nuclear weapons. Measures to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation include refraining from nuclear cooperation with non-compliant states and implementing a coordinated response by Nuclear Suppliers Group members to violations. The President must submit a report to Congress within 180 days on US efforts to establish an international nuclear fuel supply regime. The report should assess the feasibility of creating an international fuel services center in the US. Additionally, voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency are supported. The President is authorized to make voluntary contributions to the IAEA for an international nuclear fuel bank to provide low-enriched uranium in case of supply disruptions. Contributions require certification of pledged amounts. The international nuclear fuel bank will be established in a non-nuclear weapon state under IAEA oversight, provided the state meets certain criteria including having full scope safeguards agreements in place. The international nuclear fuel bank will be established in a non-nuclear weapon state under IAEA oversight, if the state meets criteria including effective export controls comparable to those of the United States and no history of supporting international terrorism. The international nuclear fuel bank will provide nuclear reactor fuel to a country only if it is in full compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement and has an additional protocol for safeguards in force. If a country has been determined to be in noncompliance in the past, the IAEA Board of Governors must confirm that necessary actions have been taken to address concerns. The international nuclear fuel bank will provide nuclear reactor fuel to a country if it meets certain criteria, including compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement, effective export controls, absence of uranium enrichment or spent-fuel reprocessing facilities, and not being a state sponsor of terrorism. The Arms Export Control Act prohibits uranium enrichment or spent-fuel reprocessing facilities in the international nuclear fuel bank. The nuclear reactor fuel will only be provided to eligible countries at current market prices. The President can waive this requirement if it is in the national security interests of the United States, with a report to Congress. The section prohibits voluntary contributions to support subsidization of nuclear reactor fuel prices guaranteed by the United States, IAEA, or other entities covered by the Act. Authorization of appropriations for the President totaling $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 is granted under section 201. The funds will remain available until September 30, 2010."
