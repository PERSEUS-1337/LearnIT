    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Ferry Systems Investment Act of 2011\". Congress finds that ferries are vital for the US transportation system, serving as a key mode of transportation in congested areas, connecting isolated communities, providing emergency evacuation options, and serving as interim solutions during infrastructure failures. Ferries are crucial for the US transportation system, providing energy-efficient and environmentally friendly travel options. Many of the largest ferry services are publicly owned and integrated with other transportation modes. A significant percentage of US ferries are aging, highlighting the need for federal investment in the ferry system due to their unique role in transportation. The United States transportation system has a large and growing need for new ferry vessels and terminals. Ferries do not easily fit into other federal transportation programs. Federal ferry funds are distributed by formula to support the largest public ferry systems and through discretionary awards to expand ferry services nationwide. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of Transportation. The Act also addresses the construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities. Section 147 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to allocate funds for ferry systems and public entities based on passenger and vehicle numbers. Fifty percent of funds are discretionary, while the rest follow a formula considering passenger and vehicle counts. The annual funding for ferry systems is based on passenger and vehicle numbers, with 25% determined by route miles serviced. The Secretary has access to $200,000,000 each fiscal year from the Highway Trust Fund for this purpose until 2018. SEC. 5 amends Section 5308 of title 49, United States Code to include ferries in the Clean Fuels Grant Program. SEC. 6 establishes a Ferry Joint Program Office. The Secretary will establish a Ferry Joint Program Office within the Department of Transportation to coordinate federal programs related to ferry transportation and promote it as part of the US transportation system. The Office will also oversee programs carried out by the Federal Highway Administration. The Ferry Joint Program Office, established by the Secretary of Transportation, coordinates federal programs for ferry transportation. It ensures resource accountability, provides strategic leadership for technology development, promotes ferry transportation to reduce costs, and develops energy-efficient operating models to reduce carbon emissions. SEC. 7. NATIONAL FERRY DATABASE. Section 1801(e) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act is amended to include government funding sources and ensure consistency with the national transit database. Amendment to Section 1801(e) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act to update the year from 2009 to 2018. SEC. 8. NATIONAL FERRY TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE. Establishment of a National Ferry Transportation Institute through a grant awarded by the Secretary to a college within a year of the Act's enactment. The Institute will conduct research and recommend development activities to improve ferry transportation programs in the United States in collaboration with various entities. The National Ferry Transportation Institute aims to enhance ferry programs in the US by reducing wake, using clean fuels, training employees, promoting collaboration, and preserving historical information. The National Ferry Transportation Institute aims to enhance ferry programs in the US by developing models and recommendations to enhance security on ferries and around ferry facilities. Funds from a grant may be provided to a contractor or entity to assist in carrying out these functions. Selection criteria for the grant include the importance of public and private ferries to the region's transportation system. The National Ferry Transportation Institute aims to enhance ferry programs by developing models and recommendations for security. Selection criteria for grants include the historical importance of ferry transportation, diversity in maritime communities, anticipated growth in ferry transportation, public-private collaboration, and research resources. Non-Federal funding of 25% is required for colleges to receive the grant. The National Ferry Transportation Institute receives funding from non-Federal sources to support its research and development activities. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the Institute's activities. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2018 for this purpose."
