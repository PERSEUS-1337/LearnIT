    "content": "SSDI beneficiaries under 65 may qualify for Medicare exceptions, such as immediate coverage for ALS or after the third month for ESRD. Other individuals under 65 with disabling conditions may also be eligible for Medicare. Certain disabled individuals, including widows/widowers and dependent adult children, may be eligible for Medicare after a qualifying period. The waiting period starts at age 18 or when disability is determined. Spouses and children may also be eligible based on a worker's record. In 2006, over 7 million beneficiaries under 65 received Medicare due to disability. More than 43% were aged 55-64, with more men (53.3%) than women (46.7%) benefiting. The majority (73.5%) were white, and eligibility was extended to disabled individuals through the Social Security Amendments of 1972. The House Committee on Ways and Means recommended extending Medicare protection to the disabled in 1971, with a 24-month waiting period to control costs and avoid overlapping insurance. This approach ensures protection for those with severe and long-lasting disabilities. The Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 allowed individuals re-entitled to SSDI benefits to count earlier months of disability towards the waiting period. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 extended Medicare Part A coverage for working former SSDI beneficiaries for 8.5 years. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 extended Medicare Part A coverage for working former SSDI beneficiaries for 8.5 years. SSDI beneficiaries with limited incomes and assets may qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, which also entitles them to Medicaid benefits in most states. Certain working SSDI beneficiaries may be eligible for a Medicaid Buy-In Option. Employers offering health insurance must continue coverage for individuals who would otherwise lose it due to a change in work or family status under COBRA. The Social Security Administration provides an additional 11 months of continuation coverage for individuals whose disability onset occurred during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage. This provision aims to bridge the gap until Medicare coverage begins. Some SSDI beneficiaries may qualify for veterans' programs for medical care. A study on new SSDI beneficiaries in 1995 found that 11.8% died within the waiting period, 2.1% recovered, and 86.1% became entitled to Medicare. Estimated Medicare costs for the first 24 months of SSDI entitlement were $10,055 in 2000. Hypothetical Medicare costs for the first 24 months of SSDI entitlement in 2000 were estimated to be $10,055 per person. Costs varied by diagnostic group and outcome, with beneficiaries who died costing $25,864 and those who recovered costing $1,506. Studies suggested that eliminating the 24-month waiting period would cost between $5.3 billion and $8.7 billion, depending on factors like the year of estimation and the inclusion of different beneficiary groups. In 2002, around 40% of SSDI beneficiaries in the Medicare waiting period were enrolled in Medicaid. One study estimated that eliminating the 24-month waiting period would save the federal government $2.5 billion in Medicaid, but this would be offset by cost increases to the Medicare program. States would also save $1.8 billion in Medicaid if the waiting period was eliminated."
