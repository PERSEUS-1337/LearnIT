The cities must maintain signs directing motorists and ensure traffic flow on the relinquished portions of Route 74. The commission may relinquish a portion of Route 74 within the City of Lake Elsinore to the city, with conditions to ensure professional traffic engineering standards are maintained. The city must conduct traffic studies and consider public input on decisions affecting the highway, excluding routine maintenance. The City of Lake Elsinore must indemnify the department for any liability resulting from decisions or actions related to Route 74. The relinquishment becomes effective upon recording the resolution, at which point the portion of Route 74 ceases to be a state highway. The City of Lake Elsinore must ensure traffic flow on the portion of Route 74 relinquished, maintain signs for motorists, and indemnify the department for any liability. The commission may also relinquish a portion of Route 74 to the City of Hemet under certain conditions.
