    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Transparent Review of Unjust Transfers and Holds (TRUTH) Act aims to address the lack of transparency and accountability in recent immigration enforcement programs by ICE. This includes the problematic Secure Communities deportation program that misled the public and burdened local law enforcement agencies with federal immigration enforcement responsibilities. The TRUTH Act aims to address the lack of transparency and accountability in ICE's deportation programs, including the terminated Secure Communities program. ICE continues to promote similar programs like the Priority Enforcement Program, 287(g) Program, and Criminal Alien Program, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. The bill seeks to ensure meaningful public oversight of all ICE deportation programs involving local law enforcement in California. This bill aims to promote public safety and preserve local resources by preventing entanglement between local law enforcement and ICE. It introduces standards for participation in ICE programs and defines terms like \"community forum\" for public engagement. The bill aims to prevent entanglement between local law enforcement and ICE by introducing standards for participation in ICE programs and defining terms like \"hold request\" and \"ICE access.\" The bill aims to prevent local law enforcement agencies from providing ICE with non-public information, allowing ICE interviews, or sharing probation and parole check-in details. The bill aims to restrict local law enforcement agencies from sharing non-public information with ICE, including notification and transfer requests for individuals in their custody. Before any interview between ICE and an individual in local law enforcement custody for civil immigration violations, the local law enforcement entity must provide the individual with a written consent form in multiple languages, explaining the purpose of the interview and the voluntary nature of it. The individual can choose to decline the interview or have their attorney present. Upon receiving an ICE hold, notification, or transfer request, the local law enforcement agency must inform the individual and decide whether to comply. If the agency notifies ICE of an individual's release date, they must also inform the individual, their attorney, or another designated person in writing. All records related to ICE access provided by local law enforcement agencies, including communication with ICE, are public records under the California Public Records Act. Personal identifying information may be redacted before disclosure. These records include data on the number and characteristics of individuals given ICE access, the date of access, and the method of access (hold, transfer, notification). Beginning January 1, 2018, local governing bodies in counties, cities, or city and counties where local law enforcement agencies have provided ICE access to individuals must hold at least one public community forum the following year. The forum must provide information on ICE's access to individuals and allow for public comment. Law enforcement agencies can share data on the individuals to whom ICE access was provided, including demographic characteristics and the method of access. Personally identifiable information must be protected. Individual records are not maintained, with personally identifiable information redacted. The Legislature clarifies that no state or local law enforcement agency can detain individuals based on ICE hold requests. This new chapter in the Government Code aligns with the California Constitution's emphasis on public access to local government proceedings and documents. The act requires public meetings on local law enforcement cooperation with federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws, aligning with the California Constitution's emphasis on public access to government proceedings and documents. No reimbursement is needed as any costs incurred would be within the scope of the Constitution."
