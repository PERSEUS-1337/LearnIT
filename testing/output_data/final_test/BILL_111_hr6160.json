It also amends the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980. The Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010 defines key terms such as \"appropriate Congressional committees,\" \"Department,\" and \"rare earth materials\" including specific chemical elements. The Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010 defines key terms and specific chemical elements like Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, and Lutetium. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 101. RARE EARTH MATERIALS PROGRAM. Established in the Department is a program for research, development, and application to ensure a secure supply of rare earth materials for national security and economic needs. The program includes activities to characterize stocks, explore and recover materials, and improve extraction and recycling methods. The program aims to enhance the use, recovery, and recycling of rare earth materials, improve understanding of their performance in engineering designs, identify alternative materials, engineer applications using recycled or alternative materials, and collect and disseminate information on rare earth materials. The Secretary aims to support improved processes and technologies in the rare earth materials industry, encourage multidisciplinary collaborations, and provide opportunities for students at institutions of higher education. The program for rare earth materials industry support includes collaboration with foreign agencies, consistency with national policies, and submission of a biennial plan by the Secretary. The plan for the rare earth materials program must be submitted to Congressional committees and include details on research activities, contributions to innovative methods, criteria for evaluating loan guarantees, and the status of projects receiving support. The Secretary must consult with various stakeholders to prepare the plan for the rare earth materials program, ensuring broad participation from academic, industrial, and other contributors. The plan should also reflect recommendations from assessments conducted previously. After 4 years of operation, the Secretary will contract the National Academy of Sciences to assess the rare earth materials program. The assessment will recommend either continuing with improvements or terminating the program with lessons learned, and will be shared with Congress and the public. SEC. 1706. TEMPORARY PROGRAM FOR RARE EARTH MATERIALS REVITALIZATION. The Secretary is authorized to make guarantees for new technologies in rare earth materials separation, preparation, and application for national security and industrial purposes. The Secretary is authorized to make guarantees for new technologies in rare earth materials separation, preparation, and application for national security and industrial purposes, including magnets, batteries, refrigeration systems, optical systems, electronics, and catalysis. The Secretary aims to minimize delay in approving loan guarantee applications while cooperating with the private sector to establish a complete rare earth materials production capability in the United States within 5 years of the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010 enactment. The Secretary may not award a guarantee for a project unless the project's proponent assures that the loan or guarantee will be used to support the production of rare earth materials in the United States for domestic customers. The authority to enter into guarantees under this section will expire on September 30, 2015. Title II of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 includes amendments related to a temporary program for rare earth materials revitalization. This section outlines the provisions for supporting the production of rare earth materials in the United States for domestic customers. The authority to enter into guarantees for this program will expire on September 30, 2015. The National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended by the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010. Changes include replacing the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology with the National Science and Technology Council. Amendments also involve adjustments to subsection (c) by removing references to the Federal Emergency Agency and modifying language for appropriateness. The National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended to assess the supply of materials necessary for national security and industrial production. Subsections (d) and (e) are removed, and subsection (f) is redesignated as subsection (d). Section 3 is amended for policy changes, and Section 4 is amended for implementation. The National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended to assess the supply of materials necessary for national security and industrial production. Section 4 is amended for implementation, removing irrelevant details and specifying the policies to be implemented by departments and agencies. The National Critical Materials Act of 1984, Title II of Public Law 98-373, is repealed. This decision was passed by the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010."
