The Gulf Coast Housing Accessibility Act of 2006 provides additional assistance for project-based housing vouchers to support affordable housing in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, Rita, or Wilma of 2005, including repairing or rebuilding damaged housing and supporting new housing structures. The Gulf Coast Housing Accessibility Act of 2006 provides funds for 4,500 project-based vouchers to support affordable housing in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, Rita, or Wilma.

The Homeless Assistance Act defines \"homeless\" to include adults who are homeless. The Secretary awards project-based vouchers to a State agency designated by the Governor, or a local housing agency if the State agency is unable to request funds. The Secretary can transfer administration of vouchers to local housing agencies for specific developments. Project-based vouchers are exempt from certain limitations. $200,000,000 is authorized for project-based assistance under section 8(o)(13) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.
