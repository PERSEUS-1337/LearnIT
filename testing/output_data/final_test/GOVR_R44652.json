    "content": "Veterans' preference provides advantages to qualified former members of the Armed Forces in federal government civilian employment. This report discusses how veterans' preference is applied in competitive examination processes for federal positions, including qualification criteria and implementation in assessment and selection phases. Data on veterans' employment in the federal government and issues for Congress are also presented. This report does not cover special hiring authorities or noncompetitive appointments for veterans. This report discusses the application of veterans' preference in competitive examination processes for federal positions, including assessment methods like numerical rating and category rating. It does not cover special hiring authorities or noncompetitive appointments for veterans. Veterans' preference in federal positions allows for alternative assessment procedures like category rating. \"Preference eligible\" individuals include qualified veterans or their family members who qualify for derived preference. Veterans qualify for preference based on service-connected disability or active duty during specific periods. Preference eligibility is a lifetime status for veterans discharged under honorable conditions. Preference-eligible veterans qualify for different types of preference depending on their service and assessment method. Veterans' preference can be based on service-connected disability or active duty during specific periods. Military retirees without a service-connected disability may not qualify for preference. Preference types are summarized in Table 1, with veterans potentially receiving ten, five, or zero points under numerical rating. Eligible veterans under category rating are assigned a preference code for assessment. Veterans with service-connected disabilities receive the strongest preference in the hiring process, regardless of the assessment method used. They may be eligible for a 10-point preference under the numerical rating method or fall into different categories under category rating, such as CPS, CP, or XP. These designations can impact their placement in the hiring process. Veterans without service-connected disabilities can qualify for preference based on specific criteria, such as serving during a qualified time period or military campaign. This preference can result in a five-point preference under numerical rating or a TP designation under category rating. Eligibility is determined by the veteran's active duty service in various circumstances, including during wars, authorized campaigns, specific time periods, or extended service durations. Veterans can qualify for preference based on specific criteria, such as serving during a qualified time period or military campaign. This preference gives them an advantage over nonveteran candidates with the same assessment score. Nonpreference eligible veterans do not have service-connected disabilities or meet the required active duty timeframes. When applying for federal positions, former members of the Armed Forces who do not qualify for preference are subject to the same assessment and selection processes as nonveterans. Eligibility for preference is slightly different for retired members of the Armed Forces, where a veteran who retires from the Armed Forces may only claim veterans' preference under specific conditions. Retired members of the Armed Forces face a 180-day waiting period before being appointed to civilian positions at the Department of Defense (DOD). This waiting period does not apply to veterans who separated for reasons other than retirement or veterans working at agencies outside of DOD. Spouses, widows/widowers, or parents of veterans may qualify for preference in certain cases, known as derived preference, with a 10-point/XP preference. Spouses of veterans with service-connected disabilities and unable to qualify for civil service positions, and unmarried widows/widowers of veterans who served during specific periods, are eligible for preference. Veterans' preference eligibility criteria include serving during a war, specific periods, or under certain conditions, with derived preference available for spouses, widows/widowers, and parents of veterans meeting specific criteria. For federal positions filled through competitive examination, candidates are assessed based on qualifications. Veterans' preference gives preference-eligible candidates favorable treatment in assessment and selection processes. Preference is applied based on the type of position and preference eligible qualifications. It is only considered if the candidate meets the minimum qualifications. Veterans' preference is applied in the category rating method, where veterans are placed at the top of the quality category they qualify for in scientific or professional positions at GS-9 or above. In the category rating method, veterans are ranked at the top of the quality category they qualify for based on their preference eligibility. Veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 10% or higher are placed at the top of the highest quality category, allowing them to potentially rank higher than nonveterans. This process is illustrated in Figure 1 and is based on a 100-point scale for assessing candidates' qualifications. Candidates' qualifications are assessed on a 100-point scale, with veterans' preference points added to increase their chances of being among the top applicants. Preference points are applied differently based on job types, with additional points possible for scientific or professional positions at GS-9 or above. If a preference eligible does not rank among the top applicants after the addition of preference points, they will not be forwarded to the hiring official. For positions at GS-9 or above, veterans' preference points are added to the applicant's score. Preference eligibles with a service-connected disability rated at 10% or higher automatically move to the top of the list. Hiring officials must select a preference eligible if they are among the highest-ranked candidates, or formally pass over them by disqualifying them. Qualified preference eligibles cannot be passed over without valid reasons. When hiring for positions at GS-9 or above, veterans' preference points are considered. Preference eligibles with a service-connected disability rated at 10% or higher are prioritized. Hiring officials must select a preference eligible if they are among the top candidates or formally pass over them with valid reasons. Nonpreference eligibles can only be chosen over preference eligibles after completing a pass over procedure. When hiring for positions at GS-9 or above, veterans' preference points are considered. To pass over a preference eligible, an agency must establish \"proper and adequate\" reasons to disqualify the candidate, such as lack of education or experience, false statements, or unsatisfactory performance ratings. Pass overs for veterans with disabilities rated below 30% can be approved by the hiring agency with delegated examining authority, while those rated at 30% or more require OPM approval. A CPS veteran is entitled to advance notice of a proposed pass over and may respond to the hiring official's reason for pass over. The veteran must submit a response to OPM within 15 days. An agency may not pass over a preference eligible without proper and adequate reasons. Data from FY2016 shows veterans with preference accounted for 28% of all permanent, full-time, executive employees. In FY2016, veterans with preference made up 28% of all permanent, full-time, executive branch employees, which was significantly higher than the 7% of veterans in the overall civilian labor force. The Departments of Defense and Veterans' Affairs had the most veterans and employees. Veterans with preference accounted for 37% of federal new hires, with disabled veterans making up 18% of total new hires. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs were the agencies with the most hires, comprising 65% of total new hires and 73% of newly hired veterans with preference. The share of veteran new hires is higher than the overall share of veterans employed in the executive branch, increasing from 25% in FY2010 to 28% in FY2016. Recent proposals have focused on revising veterans' preference, with some suggesting limitations on existing preferences while others aim to expand incentives for military service. Some proposals aim to expand veterans' preference to incentivize and reward military service, while others suggest limiting the number of times a veteran can use preference. Additionally, there are proposals for alternate forms of preference for veterans who do not currently qualify. Some Members of Congress have proposed amending preference laws to extend preference to veterans who do not currently qualify, aiming to simplify eligibility and selection policies for veterans and hiring agencies."
