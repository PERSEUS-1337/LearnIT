    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act\". The volume of electronic devices in the United States is substantial and continues to grow, with over 2 billion devices sold since 1980. Only 15 to 20 percent of discarded devices reach recyclers, despite the potential to recover valuable materials. Challenges remain for household and small generator electronic device recycling in the US. The challenges of electronic device recycling include expensive collection, costly separation of materials like lead, and the harmful impact of exporting devices to developing countries with crude recycling methods. Improving logistics, technology, and design of devices can address these challenges. The public can benefit from better electronic device recycling opportunities by studying behavior factors and educating consumers. Developing tools to increase device lifespan and promote safe reuse can reduce environmental impact and improve recyclability. Accurately assessing environmental impacts of device production and recycling is crucial. The production and recycling of electronic devices is a complex task. Data, tools, and methods are needed to quantify these impacts for better end-of-life management options. SEC. 3. ELECTRONIC DEVICE ENGINEERING RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. The Administrator will award multiyear grants to consortia for research on managing environmental impacts of electronic devices and developing scientists, engineers, and technicians in the field. Research will focus on improving device collection and recycling efficiency, finding new uses for materials from devices, and creating eco-friendly alternatives to hazardous materials in device production. The research will focus on developing methods to identify, separate, and remove hazardous materials from electronic devices, redesigning products for easier refurbishment and recycling, conducting lifecycle analyses, and extending the lifespan of electronic devices through upgrades and safe reuse. The grant program aims to address barriers to recycling and reuse of electronic devices by promoting upgrades, safe reuse, and developing strategies to increase awareness. Grants will be awarded based on merit through a competitive process. Consortiums must submit applications detailing research projects, contributions of participating entities, and how the project reduces impediments. The grant program aims to address barriers to electronic device recycling by promoting upgrades, safe reuse, and increasing awareness. Grants will be awarded based on merit through a competitive process. Research results will be disseminated through best practices, training materials, conferences, and publication on the Environmental Protection Agency's website. The for-profit entity in the consortium must contribute at least 10% of the total research project cost. The Administrator will not disclose proprietary information provided by any person or entity. Each consortium member must have protections in place to receive a grant under this section. Within this section, consortium members must protect proprietary information and trade secrets. If a member breaches these conditions, they may have to return any funds received. The Administrator will provide a biennial report to Congress listing grants awarded, consortium entities, and research projects funded by the grants. Authorization of Appropriations:\n$18,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, and $22,000,000 for fiscal year 2012 are authorized for the Administrator to carry out the research projects and adoption of results in the electronics industry. The National Academy of Sciences will report on electronic device recycling. The Administrator will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to report on opportunities and barriers for increasing electronic device recyclability and safety within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The report will focus on making electronic devices safer and more environmentally friendly by reducing hazardous materials, addressing risks in storage, transport, recycling, and disposal, evaluating research and training programs for environmental design, and identifying regulatory barriers to implementing best practices and innovations. The report will identify gaps in current research and training programs related to electronic device recycling, recommending areas for additional research and development resources to reduce environmental impact. SEC. 5. ENGINEERING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Administrator, with the National Science Foundation Director, will award grants to higher education institutions for developing curricula integrating environmental design principles into electronic device development for training engineers and professionals in the industry. Eligible entities include higher education institutions under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Administrator will award grants to higher education institutions under the Higher Education Act of 1965 for integrating environmental design principles into engineering curricula. Outreach to minority serving institutions will be conducted to provide information on grant opportunities. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition, and funds must be used to enhance engineering curricula with a focus on environmental design principles for electronic devices. The grant program aims to integrate environmental design principles into engineering curricula at higher education institutions. Activities include developing curriculum, creating research opportunities, establishing certificate programs, and offering continuing education for professionals. Institutions must submit an application to the Administrator for grant consideration. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2010\n- $5,150,000 for fiscal year 2011\n- $5,304,000 for fiscal year 2012 SEC. 6. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS PHYSICAL PROPERTY DATABASE. The Director will establish a database for eco-friendly materials in electronic devices. Priorities and characterization requirements will be set in collaboration with industries. $3,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2012. For the purposes of this Act, the terms \"Administrator,\" \"Consortium,\" \"Director,\" and \"Electronic device\" are defined. The Administrator refers to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Consortium includes various entities in grant applications, Director refers to the head of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Electronic device encompasses various electronic equipment. The curr_chunk discusses various electronic devices such as computers, monitors, TVs, laptops, printers, and gaming systems. It also defines terms like \"institution of higher education\" and \"minority serving institution.\" The curr_chunk states that the document was passed by the House of Representatives on April 22, 2009, with the attestation of LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
