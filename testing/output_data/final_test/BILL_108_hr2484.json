    "content": "The Native American Education Equity Act of 2003, also known as the Native American-Serving Institutions section, authorizes an assistance program under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will provide grants and assistance to Native American-serving institutions to enhance their capacity to serve Indian tribes. The term 'Indian tribe' includes various organized groups recognized for special programs. 'Native American-serving institution' is defined as... Native American-serving institutions, eligible under specific criteria, must have at least 15% undergraduate enrollment of students from Indian tribes. Grants are provided to these institutions to improve their capacity to serve Indian tribes through various activities. Native American-serving institutions receive grants to enhance their capacity to serve Indian tribes through activities like purchasing educational equipment, renovating facilities, supporting faculty development, curriculum development, and acquiring educational materials. Native American-serving institutions seeking assistance must provide enrollment data to demonstrate eligibility and submit required information to the Secretary for grant consideration. This includes activities like purchasing equipment, renovating facilities, faculty development, curriculum development, and acquiring educational materials. Native American-serving institutions must submit an application for assistance to the Secretary, including a 5-year plan for improving student assistance and other required information. The Secretary may require a simplified format for applications. Native American-serving institutions receiving funds under this section cannot receive funds under other provisions. Section 313(d) exemption does not apply to eligible institutions. The Secretary will ensure equitable distribution of grants among eligible institutions. Section 399(a)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to authorize appropriations of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and subsequent years for section 318."
