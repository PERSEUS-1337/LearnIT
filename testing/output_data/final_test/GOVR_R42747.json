    "content": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system for approximately 6.7 million unique veteran patients. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, VA health care is a veteran-specific national system owned by the federal government, providing services directly to veterans. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services to veterans through a national system owned by the federal government. Not all veterans are eligible for free VA health care, as they must meet specific criteria such as the statutory definition of a \"veteran\" and \"active duty.\" Claims of \"free health care for life\" for military personnel and veterans are not entirely accurate. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not offer free medical benefits for life to all veterans. Eligibility for VA health care has evolved over time, with the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 establishing two eligibility categories. Prior to this reform, all veterans were technically eligible for some care, but actual provision was based on available resources. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established two eligibility categories for VA health care based on prioritization. Category A veterans include those with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances, and World War I veterans. Another category includes veterans with no service-connected disabilities and/or higher incomes. VA was authorized to manage access to health care through a patient enrollment system. The VA health care system established a patient enrollment system to provide care for 'core' veterans with specified priorities. The system allows the Secretary discretion in determining enrollment operations, with health care provision dependent on available resources and discretionary appropriations. The VA health care system's patient enrollment system depends on discretionary appropriations. Eligibility statuses of veterans can change, leading to disenrollment if found ineligible. CHAMPVA provides health care services to dependents and survivors of certain veterans through a fee-for-service program. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 expanded the CHAMPVA program to include the primary family caregiver of an eligible veteran without other health insurance. Services provided include counseling, training, and mental health services for the caregiver. VA health care enrollment is based on veteran status, service-connected disability, and income. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 required the VA to establish an enrollment system for eligible veterans. Once enrolled, veterans can seek care at any VA facility without reestablishing eligibility. Exact requirements for enrollment depend on various criteria such as service component and combat experience. Veterans returning from combat theaters are eligible for VA health care for five years without demonstrating a service-connected disability or income requirement. This special enrollment period was established in 1998 and expanded in 2007 to address concerns of Persian Gulf War Veterans. The National Defense Authorization Act extended VA health care enrollment eligibility for combat veterans from two to five years after discharge. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act provided an additional one-year enrollment period for certain veterans. Members of the Reserve components have limited eligibility for VA health care services, similar to active duty servicemembers. They may enroll based on veteran status, service-connected disability, and income. Reservists achieve veteran status and are exempt from the 24-month duty requirement if called to active duty, completed their term, and received a discharge under other than honorable conditions. Reserve component members may be granted service connection for injuries incurred during training sessions, including heart attacks or strokes. This ensures eligibility for VA care. National Guard members have limited VA health care eligibility when not on full-time federal service. National Guard members may be eligible for VA health care based on veteran status, service-connected disability, and income. They achieve veteran status if called to active duty by federal order, complete their term, and receive an honorable discharge. Veterans can apply for enrollment at any time by submitting an application to a VA health care facility. To receive VA health care, veterans must enroll by completing and submitting VA Form 10-10EZ. The VA Form 10-10EZ is used to apply for Health Benefits and includes information about military service, demographics, and financial status. Veterans can apply online, in person at a VA health facility, by mail, or by telephone. Upon completion, a confirmation message will be displayed for online applications, and enrollment notification letters will be sent within five to seven days for in-person applications. Veterans can now apply for VA health care over the telephone without having to wait to receive, sign, and return their applications. Starting March 15, 2016, veterans who served in combat operations after November 11, 1998, can apply over the phone. Other veterans can apply over the phone starting July 15, 2016. Applications are processed through VA medical facilities or Health Eligibility Centers. Veterans can apply for VA health care over the phone without waiting for paper applications. Applications are processed through VA medical facilities or Health Eligibility Centers using VistA or WRAP tools. Accepted veterans become enrollees in the VA health care system. Veterans approved for VA health care can schedule their first appointment after receiving an enrollment notification letter. They will also receive a personalized Veterans Health Handbook by mail, detailing benefits and copay status. Ineligible veterans can appeal the decision by following instructions in a letter from the VA. Enrollment can be canceled at any time, with reenrollment applications accepted anytime. Acceptance for future enrollment is based on priority group status. The VA offers enrolled veterans a standard medical benefits package that includes inpatient and outpatient care, prescription drugs, and various health services. This package also caters to the healthcare needs of female veterans, providing gynecological care, maternity care, infertility treatment, and more. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 authorized these services. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 authorized the VA to provide health care services to newborn children of female veterans receiving maternity care. The VA does not cover IVF, abortions, or abortion-related services but does offer infertility services to both service and nonservice-connected veterans. Dental care eligibility is limited. The VA provides limited dental care eligibility for enrolled veterans, categorized into classes for treatment. The VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP) offers premium-based dental insurance coverage. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 authorized a pilot program for private dental insurance for eligible veterans, survivors, and dependents. Under a three-year pilot program set to expire in August 2016, the VHA contracted with dental insurance carriers to provide dental insurance for CHAMPVA beneficiaries. The VA administers the contract and verifies eligibility for veterans, survivors, and dependents. Hearing aids and eyeglasses are provided to veterans with compensable service-connected disabilities, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, and those receiving compensation. Veterans eligible for various benefits including compensation for injuries from VA treatment, increased pension for housebound veterans, and assistance for hearing or vision impairment. Additionally, veterans with functional or cognitive impairments affecting daily activities are also covered. The VA provides long-term care services for veterans with impairments affecting daily activities, including those with severe hearing and/or vision impairment. Nursing home services are required for enrolled veterans who meet specified criteria, such as being 70% or more service-connected disabled. The VA meets the requirements of P.L. 106-117 by providing nursing care through Community Living Centers, Community Nursing Homes, and State Veterans Nursing Homes. The SVNH program subsidizes state-operated facilities for veterans, with the VA covering costs for disabled veterans. The VA offers non-institutional home and community-based services for veterans, including Skilled Home Care and Home Based Primary Care. Skilled Home Care is a professional service purchased from private-sector providers recommended by a VA primary care provider, covering nursing services and therapy. Home Based Primary Care provides medical care to chronically ill or disabled veterans in their own homes through a VA-funded interdisciplinary team. The VA partners with federal Area Agencies on Aging to purchase needed services for veterans, allowing them to decide on a mix of services. Specialized home care services are provided for veterans with spinal cord injuries, including respite care, long-term care, bowel and bladder care, and caregiver education. The Homemaker/Home Health Aide program offers assistance with personal care and support services for veterans in their own homes. Eligibility is based on clinical judgment. The VA provides specialized home care services for veterans, including the Homemaker/Home Health Aide program for assistance with personal care. Eligibility for the program is determined by clinical judgment to assess the need for nursing home equivalent care. H/HHAs are trained personnel supervised by nurses, and services are paid for by the VA. Community Residential Care (CRC) offers health care supervision for veterans who cannot live independently due to medical or psychosocial limitations. Community Residential Care (CRC) provides various types of residential settings for veterans who need assistance with daily living activities. Veterans can choose their facility, and the cost is covered by their own resources. The VA may reimburse non-VA providers for health care services under certain circumstances. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) allows veterans to receive medical care in the community from non-VA providers in specific situations. This program was established under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. Non-VA care can include outpatient care, inpatient care, emergency care, medical transportation, and dental services. The Veterans Choice Program, established under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, allows veterans to receive medical care from non-VA providers in specific situations. The program was amended by the Appropriations Act, 2015, the Construction Authorization and Choice Improvement Act, and the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 to increase access to care outside the VA health care system. This included the establishment of the Veterans Choice Program, which allows the VA to authorize care for veterans outside the VA health care system under certain conditions. The Veterans Choice Program allows veterans to receive medical care from non-VA providers in specific situations, based on distance from a VA medical facility and travel burden. Veterans living 40 miles or more from a VA facility with a full-time primary care physician, or facing unusual travel burdens, may qualify for care outside the VA system. Additionally, veterans residing more than 20 miles from a VA facility in Alaska, Hawaii, or New Hampshire may also be eligible for non-VA care. The Veterans Choice Program allows eligible veterans to receive medical care from non-VA providers in specific situations. VA staff determine eligibility within 10 business days by reviewing clinical and administrative records. Veterans and network providers should verify eligibility before scheduling appointments. Community Programs not covered by the VCP are listed in Table 3. The program is administered by a private Third Party Administrator on behalf of the VA. The VA has contracted with Health Net Federal Services, LLC, and TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corporation to administer the Veterans Choice Program. Contractors manage appointments, counseling services, providers, billing, card distributions, and the call center. Eligible veterans will be contacted by the contractor for scheduling appointments within 30 days. Non-VA health care services are authorized by Health Net or TriWest. Veterans must obtain pre-authorization for non-VA health care services from Health Net or TriWest. Out-of-pocket costs under the Choice Program are the same as those in the VA system, but veterans with other health insurance may have additional expenses. VA will cover financial obligations under the veteran's insurance plan, but differences may exist for those with OHI. The VA can cover a veteran's financial obligations under their insurance plan, but may not pay more than the Medicare rate for services. Veterans may still owe copayments, cost shares, or deductibles to the provider. The VA is a secondary payer under the VCP, and a primary payer under non-VA care. Project ARCH aims to improve access to healthcare for rural veterans. The Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 required VA to conduct evaluations. The VA conducted pilot programs to provide non-VA health care services to eligible veterans through contractual arrangements. The program was extended by two years under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. The Project ARCH pilot program, extended by P.L. 113-146, ensures timely medical appointments for eligible veterans in specified VISNs. Eligibility is based on VA enrollment and statutory definitions, including OEF/OIF veterans. The Project ARCH pilot program, extended by P.L. 113-146, provides timely medical appointments for eligible veterans in specific VISNs. Covered veterans include those who served in combat operations after November 11, 1998, residing far from VA healthcare facilities. Five pilot sites offer various healthcare services such as primary care, specialty care, acute care, and diagnostic radiology. Not all services are available at each site. The VA may pay for emergency care for enrolled veterans at non-VA providers based on certain factors. Prior to P.L. 111-137, veterans were reimbursed for emergency treatment at non-VA hospitals only if they had no other health insurance. The law now requires the VA to pay for emergency treatment for nonservice-connected conditions if a third party is not responsible for the full cost of care, with limitations on reimbursement when a third-party insurer covers part of the veteran's medical liability. The VA is the secondary payer for veterans' medical liability when a third-party insurer covers part of the cost. Veterans are responsible for copayments to the third-party insurer, but not for any remaining balance after payments from the insurer and the VA. Veterans can get reimbursement for emergency services from non-VA providers if they meet certain criteria. Veterans may be required to pay copayments for medical services and outpatient medications related to nonservice-connected conditions, depending on their enrollment Priority Group. Priority Group 1 veterans and those deemed catastrophically disabled by a VA provider are never charged copayments, even for nonservice-connected treatments. Veterans in different priority groups may be charged copayments for nonservice-connected medical services. There are four types of nonservice-connected copayments: outpatient, inpatient, extended care services, and medication. Some outpatient services, like health fairs and screenings, do not require copayments. Copayments for primary care outpatient visits are $15, while specialty care outpatient visits are $50. Veterans do not pay more than one outpatient copayment per day. Rates for inpatient copayments vary. For veterans required to pay inpatient copayments, rates vary based on Priority Group enrollment. Priority Group 8 veterans and certain others pay the full inpatient copayment, while Priority Group 7 veterans and others pay 20%. Priority Groups 1-5 are exempt from inpatient and outpatient copayments. Long-term care copayments are based on nonservice-connected care levels, with charges varying based on financial situation. VHA bills private insurers for medical care, supplies, and prescriptions provided to veterans. The VA can bill Medicare supplemental health insurance carriers for covered services provided to veterans for their nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans are not responsible for paying any remaining balance not covered by their health insurance carrier. VA copayment charges can be offset by payments received, and veterans with certain disability ratings or circumstances may be exempt from medication copayments. Veterans in Priority Groups 2 through 6 have a $960 calendar-year cap on copayments. Requests for assistance with copayment charges can be submitted if needed. Beginning January 1, 2017, VA is proposing to change the copayment rate for nonservice-connected conditions treated in an outpatient setting. The new rule would categorize medications into three tiers with different costs: Tier 1 at $5, Tier 2 at $8, and Tier 3 at $11 for a 30-day supply. Veterans meeting eligibility criteria can contribute towards health savings accounts. The Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 allows veterans receiving care for service-connected conditions to contribute to HSAs. Only eligible individuals covered under a qualifying high-deductible health plan can establish and fund Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to pay for medical expenses. Veterans who were otherwise eligible to contribute to an HSA could do so if they had not received care from the VA in the preceding three months. Under P.L. 114-41, veterans eligible for HSAs can contribute even if they received care from the VA for a service-connected disability. This change took effect on January 1, 2016. The VA can bill insurers for nonservice-connected care provided to veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. The law allows the VA to collect charges for medical care from third parties for nonservice-connected disabilities incurred by veterans. The VA can receive payments from Medicare supplemental coverage plans for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans are not responsible for paying any remaining balance of the VA's insurance claim. The VA is prohibited from billing Medicare in most situations. Veterans are responsible for paying all Medicare premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. Medicare is prohibited from reimbursing for services provided by a federal health facility. Medicare is generally prohibited from reimbursing federal health care providers unless certain conditions are met, such as providing services to the public as a community institution, through Indian Health Service facilities, or in emergency situations. The VA is also prohibited from receiving Medicare payments for services provided to Medicare-covered veterans. Congress likely excluded Medicare from paying for services provided by federal entities to ensure that the VA does not receive duplicate payments. The VA can be reimbursed by Medicare under certain conditions, such as when providing services to Medicare-covered individuals not eligible for VA care under specific agreements. Medicare can also reimburse veterans for VA copayment amounts or services not covered by the VA. The VA can be reimbursed by Medicare for services not covered by the VA, such as care for a different condition. Veterans are classified into Priority Groups based on factors like service-connected disabilities and income, with some groups considered \"high priority\" for enrollment. Veterans enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 are considered \"high priority\" by the VA. This includes veterans with service-connected disabilities, compensable conditions, POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, World War I veterans, those exposed to hazardous agents, and those with income below a VA threshold. The VA assesses applicants' income and medical expenses from the previous year to determine eligibility. Veterans in Priority Groups 7 or 8 do not fall into the high priority categories and are primarily those with nonservice-connected medical conditions and incomes above the VA means test threshold. They may be billed for treatment of conditions not related to military service."
