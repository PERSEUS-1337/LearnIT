    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Intermodal Equipment Safety and Responsibility Act of 2003\". Congress finds that promoting safety on US highways is a national priority, with the Secretary of Transportation enforcing regulations for this purpose. Intermodal transportation is crucial for the US economy, but motor carriers lack control over intermodal equipment they transport in interstate commerce. Motor carriers must have control over intermodal equipment to ensure compliance with safety regulations and highway safety. Violations due to lack of maintenance negatively impact carrier safety records. The Act aims to hold parties controlling intermodal equipment on public highways accountable for its safety during interstate commerce. Key definitions are provided in the Act. The Act provides definitions related to intermodal equipment on public highways for interstate commerce, including the inclusion of motor carriers and agents, and the definition of equipment interchange agreement. The Act defines a controller of intermodal equipment as a party with legal rights in the equipment, excluding motor carriers unless they have delegated maintenance authority. The Act defines \"interchange\" as providing intermodal equipment to a motor carrier for transportation purposes, excluding leasing for over-the-road freight hauling. \"Applicable safety regulations\" refer to regulations for controllers of intermodal equipment. SEC. 5. JURISDICTION OVER EQUIPMENT CONTROLLERS: The Secretary of Transportation can regulate controllers of intermodal equipment under commercial motor vehicle safety laws.\n\nSEC. 6. EQUIPMENT CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITY. Section 5910 of title 49, United States Code, requires controllers of intermodal equipment to be responsible for inspecting, maintaining, and repairing the equipment to ensure compliance with safety regulations before offering it for interchange with motor carriers. Controllers of intermodal equipment must inspect and repair the equipment to comply with safety regulations before offering it to motor carriers. If repairs are needed while in a motor carrier's possession, the controller must reimburse the carrier for expenses and any losses due to delays caused by the repairs. Controllers of intermodal equipment must reimburse motor carriers for repairs unless the carrier's negligence caused the damage. The Secretary can impose fines on equipment controllers for violating these regulations. SEC. 7. SAFETY COMPLIANCE. Sec. 5911 of Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, holds the controller of intermodal equipment liable for safety regulation violations, except when caused by the negligence of a motor carrier. Intermodal equipment receivers are not liable for safety regulation violations unless caused by their negligence. Violations related to interchanged equipment do not affect a motor carrier's safety rating unless caused by negligence or willful misconduct. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a process for correcting records promptly. The Secretary of Transportation will establish expedited procedures to correct records or reports of violations not adversely affected by safety regulations violations. Final regulations must be issued within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 8. AUTHORITY TO INSPECT. Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to inspect intermodal equipment at facilities to ensure compliance with regulations. An inspection program with regular audits is established, requiring inspections at least once every 3 months. Non-complying equipment will be addressed accordingly. Equipment failing safety regulations must be placed out of service until repairs are completed and documented in maintenance records. SEC. 9. PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION. Section 5913 of title 49, United States Code prohibits controllers of intermodal equipment from retaliating against motor carriers who request maintenance or repair to comply with safety regulations. Failure to timely provide safe equipment is considered retaliation under this section. If the controller of intermodal equipment fails to provide compliant equipment to the motor carrier within 60 minutes of arrival, they may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. SEC. 10. DELEGATION OF MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY. A controller of intermodal equipment cannot delegate maintenance and repair responsibility to a motor carrier in an equipment interchange agreement. SEC. 11. COMPATIBILITY OF STATE LAWS. Section 11 of the text addresses the compatibility of State laws with federal regulations. It states that State laws are preempted if they conflict with federal requirements, unless the State law is more stringent but still compatible with federal regulations. The term \"tribal organization\" is defined in this section as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. SEC. 12. Repeal of Section 5907 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 13. Clerical amendments to the table of sections. SEC. 14. Implementing regulations. The Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations under the Act, including requirements for identifying controllers of intermodal equipment, matching equipment to controllers with unique numbers, maintaining maintenance records, and evaluating compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The regulations include provisions prohibiting noncompliant controllers of intermodal equipment from placing equipment on public highways, requiring consideration of maintenance facilities on safety, allowing anonymous petitions for investigations, establishing dispute resolution procedures, and implementing an inspection and audit program. The regulations required under subsection (a) of title 49, United States Code, shall be developed within 120 days and issued within one year of the enactment of this Act. Definitions from section 5901 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 4, shall apply. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for the inspection program. The effective date for sections 4-13 of the Act and related amendments is 30 days after enactment."
