    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Voter Opportunity To Inform Congress Effectively on Term Limits Act\" (the \"VOICE Act\"). It includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that the right to vote and have a voice in Congress are fundamental rights, there is a growing demand for term limits for members of Congress, and voters in multiple states have already approved laws to limit congressional terms. The Act aims to give citizens a voice on limiting the terms of members of Congress through a national non-binding referendum in the 1994 general election. It also seeks to explore the feasibility of conducting similar referenda on other important issues in the future. The Act defines key terms such as \"advisory question,\" \"general election,\" \"Federal office,\" and \"State election agency.\" It outlines procedures for a national non-binding referendum on term limits for members of Congress in the 1994 general election. The Act mandates that each State include an advisory question on term limits for members of Congress on the general election ballot. The question is to be certified by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate for inclusion in each congressional district. The Act requires each State to include an advisory question on term limits for members of Congress in the general election ballot. Results of the non-binding referendum will be certified by the State election agency to the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate, with breakdowns by county, congressional district, and statewide totals. The Committees on the Judiciary of both the House of Representatives and the Senate will consider the results. The Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate will examine whether Congress should propose a term limits amendment to the Constitution in response to the non-binding referendum results. State election agencies will provide feedback on future non-binding referenda procedures within 90 days after the general election. The costs of including the advisory question required by this Act will be reimbursed by the United States through the franking accounts of Congress, with equal amounts drawn from the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate will oversee the reimbursement process."
