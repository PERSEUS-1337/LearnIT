    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Diamond Trade Act\". It includes findings related to the diamond trade. Congress finds that funds from the sale of rough diamonds are used to finance military activities, overthrow governments, and commit atrocities against civilians in countries like Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Over 6.5 million people have been displaced and 3.7 million have died in wars over control of diamond mining areas. Nearly 70 million people in these countries have been affected by the conflicts. The diamond trade has led to conflicts in countries like Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, affecting nearly 70 million people. Efforts by human rights advocates, the World Diamond Council, and the United States Government aim to end the trade in conflict diamonds. The United Nations Security Council has taken action to address threats to international peace and security related to conflicts linked to diamonds. The United States implemented sanctions restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Angola, Sierra Leone, and Liberia unless accompanied by specified certificates of origin to address conflicts linked to diamonds. The United States is taking action against trade in conflict diamonds to prevent consumer backlash and protect economies. South Africa and over 30 countries are working on a solution through the Kimberley Process. The US, as a major diamond consumer, has a responsibility to help end the link between diamonds and conflict. The United States is pushing for effective solutions to curb the trade in conflict diamonds, which could harm the legitimate diamond trade in countries like Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania. US initiatives aim to resolve regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa that fuel the trade in conflict diamonds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, conflict diamonds are rough diamonds prohibited by UN Resolutions due to fueling conflict. Diamonds are classified under specific subheadings, including polished diamonds and rough diamonds. The term \"United States\" is also defined. The term \"United States\" refers to the several States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. MEASURES TO PREVENT IMPORTS OF CONFLICT DIAMONDS. The President has the authority to prohibit imports of rough diamonds into the United States from countries that do not take effective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds, as long as it is necessary for the essential security interests of the US and consistent with foreign policy interests. Effective measures are those that meet the requirements of United Nations Security Council Resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds and international arrangements on conflict diamonds. The President can ban rough diamond imports into the US from countries not stopping trade in conflict diamonds if necessary for US security interests. Measures must meet UN Security Council Resolutions on conflict diamonds. Requirements include secure packaging with validated documentation, verifiable controls from mine to export, and reexport regulations. (C) Countries reexporting rough diamonds must have controls to prevent conflict diamonds from entering legitimate trade. Verifiable recordkeeping by all mining, import, and export companies, with government inspection. Government must publish official rough diamond import/export statistics periodically. Penalties for violating laws combating trade in conflict diamonds. Regulations aim to combat trade in conflict diamonds, including full cooperation with international bodies for inspection and monitoring. Exclusions apply to rough diamonds for personal use or reimported without value addition. The regulations aim to combat trade in conflict diamonds by requiring evidence for reimported rough diamonds to ensure they are not conflict diamonds. SEC. 5 prohibits polished diamonds and diamond jewelry if produced with conflict diamonds. SEC. 6 enforces seizure and forfeiture laws for violations. SEC. 7 requires reports. The President must submit annual reports to Congress detailing actions taken by countries exporting rough diamonds to the US to stop trade in conflict diamonds. Countries not implementing effective measures may face consequences outlined in sections 4 and 5 of the Act. The President must submit semiannual reports to Congress on actions taken by the US and identified countries to prevent conflict diamonds from being imported. Reports should detail measures taken since the previous report to ensure diamonds are conflict-free. The requirement for a semiannual report on a country's measures to prevent conflict diamonds from being imported into the United States remains in effect until effective measures are implemented. GAO Report: The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress within 3 years on the effectiveness of the Act in preventing conflict diamond imports. Recommendations for any necessary modifications to the Act should be included. The sense of Congress is for the President to negotiate an international arrangement to eliminate the trade in conflict diamonds, seek UN Security Council Resolutions for additional countries involved in diamond trade, and not hinder the trade in legitimate diamonds with cooperating nations. The sense of Congress is for companies involved in diamond extraction to financially support countries implementing measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds. Authorization of appropriations of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to assist countries in implementing measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds. Effective date of the Act is upon enactment."
