    "content": "The \"UNRWA Anti-Incitement and Anti-Terrorism Act\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings, United States contributions to UNRWA, and sense of Congress. The Act may be cited as the UNRWA Anti-Incitement and Anti-Terrorism Act. Congress finds that UNRWA's annual budget exceeds $1.4 billion, with the US being the largest contributor. The US has given over $5.25 billion to UNRWA from 1950 to 2014. UNRWA staff unions, including teachers, are linked to Hamas, and the curriculum in UNRWA schools contains anti-Israel materials. Despite UNRWA's controversial activities and anti-Israel stance, it continues to receive significant funding from the United States and other nations, totaling over $400 million in 2014. UNRWA spokesperson Christopher Gunness dismisses criticisms by pointing to the substantial financial support from the US and European Commission. Former UNRWA general counsel James Lindsay highlighted these concerns in a 2009 report. In a 2009 report, it was noted that the United States, despite being the largest donor to UNRWA, has failed to make the organization align with its foreign policy objectives. Efforts to influence UNRWA have been ineffective, and the US is not obligated to fund agencies that do not comply with its wishes. Changes in UNRWA could benefit refugees, the Middle East, and the US, but they will only happen with pressure from the US and the European Union. During Israel's Operation Protective Edge in 2014, UNRWA's Commissioner General gave a press briefing ignoring Israel's efforts to avoid civilian casualties. The European Union's financial support compels the agency to enact reforms, following donors' political objectives. During Israel's Operation Protective Edge in 2014, UNRWA failed to condemn Hamas for using Palestinian civilians as human shields and returned missiles found in its schools to Hamas, potentially enabling further attacks. During Israel's Operation Protective Edge in 2014, a pattern of Hamas weapons being stored in UNRWA facilities was established, raising questions about UNRWA's awareness of Hamas actions. This was highlighted by the discovery of a stockpile of Hamas rockets in a school in Gaza. Additionally, three Israeli Defense Force soldiers were killed in an explosion at a booby-trapped UNRWA health clinic housing an opening to a Hamas tunnel. John Ging, former head of UNRWA, confirmed in an interview that Hamas was using human shields and UN facilities to store weapons and launch missiles into Israel. During Operation Protective Edge in Gaza, UNRWA was accused of distorting facts and inciting anti-Semitism and violence through social media accounts of its officials. UNRWA officials, including Hani Al Ramahi, have been found to openly incite anti-Semitism and violence on social media. The United Nations has taken disciplinary actions against staff members for violating social media rules. As of October 21, 2015, at least 9 Israelis have been killed and dozens injured in 44 violent attacks in Israel and the Palestinian territories since September 13, 2015. Remaining allegations are under assessment. SEC. 3. UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNRWA. Section 301 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to require a certification by the Secretary of State for US contributions to UNRWA or related entities. The amended Section 301 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 requires a certification by the Secretary of State for US contributions to UNRWA or related entities, ensuring that no individuals associated with UNRWA are members of terrorist organizations or promote anti-American, anti-Israel, or anti-Semitic rhetoric. Additionally, it prohibits the use of UNRWA resources for political purposes related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. UNRWA is subject to financial audits and oversight to prevent resources from being used by terrorist organizations. UNRWA-funded schools must not propagate anti-American, anti-Israel, or anti-Semitic rhetoric. Recipients of UNRWA funds must not be members of terrorist organizations. UNRWA is monitored to prevent funding terrorist organizations. It has no ties to institutions involved in money laundering or terror financing. Definitions include appropriate congressional committees and foreign terrorist organizations. The Senate defines a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the Secretary of State. Certifications are valid for 180 days or until proven inaccurate. Limitations apply during the certification period. During a certification period, the US cannot contribute more to UNRWA than the highest annual contribution from a League of Arab States member, exceed a proportion of the total UNRWA budget compared to UNHCR, or surpass 22% of UNRWA's total budget. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the President and Secretary of State should lead diplomatic efforts to urge nations to withhold contributions to UNRWA until it meets specified conditions. Additionally, citizens of recognized states should be removed from UNRWA's jurisdiction and the definition of a \"Palestine refugee\" should be revised. UNRWA's definition of a \"Palestine refugee\" should align with the UNHCR's definition, and responsibility for Palestinian refugees should be transferred to the UNHCR to alleviate their suffering."
