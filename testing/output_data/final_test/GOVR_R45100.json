    "content": "The \"10-20-30 provision\" in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated at least 10% of funds to persistent poverty counties with poverty rates of 20% or more for the past 30 years. This policy targeted existing funds in rural development programs without increasing overall spending. The past four Congresses included 10-20-30 language in multiple appropriations bills, with varying definitions of \"persistent poverty counties\" leading to different lists of counties identified as persistently poor. Legislation covered rural development, public works, economic development, technological innovation, and brownfields site assessment and remediation. The report discusses how data source selection and rounding of poverty estimates can impact the identification of persistently poor counties. It explores the definition and measurement of \"persistent poverty\" and how different interpretations and data sources can result in varying lists of such counties. The report does not compare the 10-20-30 provision against other policy options or examine its suitability for different programs or policy goals. The poverty rate of 20% is considered a critical point for examining social characteristics of high-poverty versus low-poverty areas. High-poverty areas have lower property values and less return on investment, leading to a financial disincentive for property owners to maintain and improve their properties. Policy interventions at the community level, rather than just at the individual or family level, have been of interest to Congress due to the documented ill effects of high poverty rates in both urban and rural areas. Persistent poverty counties are those with poverty rates of 20% or higher for at least 30 years. Data sources like the decennial census, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), and American Community Survey (ACS) are used to measure poverty rates. The official definition of poverty in the US is based on family income compared to a poverty threshold. The precision of rounding for poverty rates can impact which counties are identified as persistent poverty counties. The poverty threshold is a dollar amount representing economic hardship, varying by family size. Families below this threshold are considered in poverty, with rates calculated by dividing the number of people below the threshold by the total population of a county. Data from the American Community Survey and Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program are used to compute poverty rates at the county level. Before the mid-1990s, poverty data was only available from the Decennial Census. After Census 2000, the decennial census no longer collects income information, making it unable to compute poverty estimates. To determine persistent poverty post-2000, ACS or SAIPE poverty estimates must be used. ACS provides continuous data similar to the decennial census long form, available at the local level for all counties. The SAIPE program was developed to estimate poverty at the county level for school-age children and the overall population, for funding allocations. SAIPE data are available annually and reflect one calendar year, unlike the ACS which covers a five-year time span. Census Bureau recommends using SAIPE poverty estimates for county-level estimates. SAIPE poverty estimates are recommended for county-level estimates, especially for counties with small populations. ACS data is recommended when additional demographic and economic detail is needed at that level. SAIPE data use administrative data to reduce uncertainty in estimates for small population counties, while ACS estimates are available for a wider array of geographic levels. The ACS provides estimates in five-year ranges for small geographic areas, while SAIPE data is more current as it is based on a single year. Poverty status is not defined for certain populations like those in institutions or the homeless, and they are excluded from poverty statistics. The homeless population is not explicitly counted in poverty statistics, as they are not included in the ACS household survey. SAIPE estimates are based on SNAP and tax data, indirectly capturing some homeless individuals. Poverty status is not defined for those in college dormitories, but off-campus students are included. Counties with large student populations may have higher poverty rates due to lower money income. The 10-20-30 provision was created to identify counties with persistently high poverty rates, but it may not be flexible enough to target counties that have recently experienced economic hardship, such as those affected by recent plant closures. Other interventions may be more suitable for counties with a sudden increase in poverty rates. Persistent poverty counties in ARRA are defined as those with 20% or more of the population living in poverty over the past 30 years. Two approaches can be used to identify these counties: using poverty rates of at least 20.0% in all three years or using rates that round up to 20% or greater in all three years. The former approach is more restrictive, resulting in a shorter list of counties, while the latter is more inclusive. Table 1 shows the number of persistent poverty counties identified using different datasets. The list of persistent poverty counties can vary by approximately 70 to 100 counties depending on the data source and rounding method used. The list is based on data from the 1990 Census, Census 2000, and the 2017 SAIPE estimates, including counties with poverty rates of 19.5% or greater. The rounding method and data source selection significantly impact the number of counties listed. The poverty estimates for counties with rates of 19.5% or greater are mapped in Figure 1. Decennial Census data is used for these estimates, which require a sufficient sample size for accurate results. Smaller geographic areas require a larger sample size for reliable estimates. National-level surveys can provide accurate estimates for the entire country without responses from every county, but to estimate all 3,143 county areas, responses from each county are necessary. Before the mid-1990s, the decennial census was the only data source with a large enough sample size to provide meaningful estimates at the county level. The census long form, sent to one-sixth of U.S. households, included income questions that allowed for poverty estimates for every county and smaller areas. The American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the decennial census long form in the mid-1990s to provide detailed information on small communities more frequently. The ACS, along with the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program (SAIPE), ensures that poverty data for counties and small areas are still available. The American Community Survey (ACS) collects information continuously from respondents every month to provide estimates for small communities. One-year estimates are pooled for geographic areas with 65,000 or more persons, while five-year estimates are used for the smallest geographic levels. Data collection is ongoing, but the publication of data occurs once a year for both types of estimates. The Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program was created to provide more current poverty data for local areas between census years. It was developed in the 1990s and is used for Title I-A funding allocations. SAIPE estimates are model-based, using survey data and administrative data to compute estimates. The U.S. Census Bureau recommends using the CPS ASEC for national income and poverty analysis due to its timeliness and accuracy. For subnational data, the ACS is preferred, especially for detailed demographic characteristics. Users seeking state-level trends before 2006 should use CPS ASEC 2-year averages, while the ACS is recommended for 1-year estimates at the state level. Consider specific needs when choosing data sources for substate areas like counties. Users should consider their specific needs when choosing a data source for substate areas like counties. The SAIPE program provides overall poverty and household income estimates with smaller standard errors than direct surveys. SAIPE is recommended for comparing poverty and income estimates for counties or school districts, especially for populations under 65,000. For other characteristics like poverty among Hispanics or median earnings, the ACS should be used. The SIPP is the only Census Bureau source of longitudinal poverty data, offering national estimates and reliable state-level estimates for select states since 2004. It collects monthly income over 3 or 4 year panels, providing poverty estimates for different time periods, including monthly rates. Table A-1 below shows Census Bureau's recommendations for poverty estimates over different time periods, including monthly rates."
