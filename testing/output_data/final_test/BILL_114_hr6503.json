When a woman faces challenges during pregnancy, practical support from those around her can help mitigate anxiety. This support includes assistance with day-to-day needs related to pregnancy, birth, and motherhood, as well as concerns about family, paternity, education, and workplace accommodations for pregnant and parenting women. Often pregnant women may not be aware of available support from private and public sources at local, State, and national levels, especially in workplaces accommodating pregnant and parenting women.
