The Gulf Opportunity Zone Public Finance Relief Act of 2005 introduces a new section for Gulf Tax Credit Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Taxpayers holding these bonds on credit allowance dates can receive a credit against their tax equal to 25 percent of the annual credit determined for the bond. The annual credit is calculated based on the credit rate set by the Secretary at the time of sale. The Secretary determines a credit rate for Gulf tax credit bonds daily, based on the face amount of the bond. The credit rate allows for issuance without discount or interest cost to the issuer. The term 'credit allowance date' refers to specific dates throughout the year. The credit for Gulf tax credit bonds is determined daily by the Secretary based on the bond's face amount. The credit allowance date is specified as September 15 and December 15, including the last day the bond is outstanding. A special rule applies for bonds issued or redeemed within a 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date. The credit allowed in a taxable year cannot exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under this part. The Gulf tax credit bond is defined as a bond issued by Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, with 95% or more of the proceeds used to pay principal, interest, or premiums on qualified bonds issued by the state or political subdivisions. The Gulf tax credit bond must be designated by the Governor of the state, be a general obligation bond in registered form, have a maturity of no more than 2 years, and be issued between December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2007. Additionally, the issuer must pledge an amount equal to the face value of the bond for specified payments or loans. The requirement for payments or loans from bond proceeds must be met by equal amounts from the bond issue and pledged amount. This requirement applies to payments or loans made within a year of issuance. There is a limit on the total face amount of bonds that can be designated. The aggregate face amount of bonds designated under this section by the Governor of a State is limited to $200,000,000 for Louisiana, $100,000,000 for Mississippi, and $50,000,000 for Alabama. A bond must satisfy arbitrage requirements to be considered a Gulf tax credit bond. A qualified bond is defined as any bond meeting specific criteria. The term 'qualified bond' refers to any State or political subdivision obligation outstanding on August 28, 2005, excluding private activity bonds and advance refundings. Gross income includes the credit allowed under this section, treated as interest income. Other definitions and special rules apply for this section. The term 'bond' includes any obligation. Rules similar to section 41(g) apply to partnerships, S corporations, and other pass-thru entities for the credit under subsection (a). No basis adjustment for bonds held by partnerships or S corporations. Regulated investment companies holding Gulf tax credit bonds are subject to specific rules. The Gulf tax credit bond held by regulated investment companies allows shareholders to claim the credit. Issuers must submit reports similar to those required for other bonds. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the tax code. The table of sections for subpart H of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the tax code is amended by adding a new item at the end. SEC. 54A provides a credit to holders of Gulf tax credit bonds, with amendments applying to taxable years ending after December 31, 2005. SEC. 3 allows for advance refundings of certain tax-exempt bonds. One additional advance refunding for certain Gulf Coast bonds is allowed under specific conditions until January 1, 2011, as per the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Governor of the State must designate the bond for this purpose, and certain requirements must be met. One advance refunding is allowed for certain exempt facility bonds issued by Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi before January 1, 2011, under specific conditions. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by the Governor of a State under specific conditions is $4,500,000,000 for Louisiana, $2,250,000,000 for Mississippi, and $1,125,000,000 for Alabama. Additional requirements must be met for any advance refunding of these bonds. The amendments made by this section apply to advance refundings after the date of the enactment of this Act on August 28, 2005. SEC. 4. FEDERAL GUARANTEE OF CERTAIN STATE BONDS. Federal guarantee of state bonds applies to specific criteria including the issuing states of Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, general obligation bonds in registered form, proceeds distributed to political subdivisions, maturity not exceeding 5 years, issuance between enactment date and January 1, 2008, and designation by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary may designate a bond for this purpose based on an application from the state. The Secretary may designate a bond for federal guarantee based on an application from the State demonstrating the need for such designation due to criteria like loss of revenue base, infrastructure funding needs, lack of access to capital, and other determined criteria. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide guidance for the submission and consideration of applications. The Secretary of the Treasury will prescribe regulations for the submission of applications for federal guarantee of bonds. Bonds described in the subsection are guaranteed by the US for 50% of the outstanding principal. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued under this section is $3 billion. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 16, 2005."
