    "content": "Software is now integrated into everyday consumer goods like televisions, refrigerators, thermostats, and more, providing automation, Wi-Fi connectivity, and remote control features. These \"smart\" devices offer new qualities to products, making them safer, more efficient, and easier to use for consumers. When consumers buy software-enabled products, they own the hardware but may only have a license to use the embedded software. Manufacturers use software licensing to prevent unauthorized resale or alterations. Some products have digital rights management to control post-purchase behavior, like preventing the use of third-party accessories. The use of DRM in consumer products raises concerns about consumers' ability to repair, modify, or resell their personal property, potentially violating copyright laws. Copyright law applies to software installed in products like coffee makers and thermostats, even if they do not store copyrighted material. This report explores how copyright law impacts consumer products with copyrighted software, affecting their use, modification, and resale. It discusses general copyright principles, application to software programs, and provisions like fair use, first sale doctrine, and DRM. The report analyzes how these laws may limit consumers' rights to repair, resell, or modify their software-enabled devices. It also reviews relevant case law and examines the interplay of these concepts with consumer expectations. The report discusses how copyright law affects consumer products with copyrighted software, including their use, modification, and resale. It explains the Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the exclusive rights granted to creators. Copyright protection only covers the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Copyright holders have exclusive legal entitlements under the Copyright Act. A copyright holder has exclusive legal entitlements under the Copyright Act, granting rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display the protected work. Permission can be granted through a license, allowing a third party to use the work without violating the holder's rights. Each exclusive right of a copyright holder can be licensed. Licensing agreements are necessary for third parties to duplicate and publicly perform copyrighted works, with terms including limitations and royalty fees. Unauthorized use may lead to infringement, prompting the copyright holder to take legal action. The Copyright Act offers civil remedies for infringement, but certain unauthorized uses may be exempt under statutory limitations like fair use and first sale. Copyrights are limited in duration, lasting the creator's life plus 70 years. After expiration, the work enters the public domain for anyone to use without permission. Ownership of a physical copy does not grant copyright rights. Ownership of a physical copy does not grant copyright rights. For example, buying a book or music CD does not give the right to reproduce or distribute the content. Copyright protection extends to various written materials, including software programs. The Copyright Act allows software developers to claim copyright protection for their programs, with limitations on reproduction rights. Owners can create necessary copies for personal use and make copies through machine activation. Section 117(d) allows for the activation of a machine containing an authorized copy of a computer program for maintenance or repair purposes. Software companies often structure transactions as licenses rather than outright sales, providing end users with limited rights to use the software. The EULA may restrict distribution and activities related to copyrighted software. Buyers of software may not automatically have rights like using the software for intended purposes or reselling it. Most software comes with shrinkwrap licenses or click-through licenses for downloads. The EULA, also known as a \"click-through\" license, requires users to accept terms before downloading or installing software. The terms typically include restrictions on copying, usage, distribution, modifications, and legal remedies. Shrinkwrap licenses are enforceable unless objectionable on legal grounds. The enforceability of click-through agreements has been upheld by federal district courts. Advanced copyright topics such as fair use, first sale, and digital rights management may affect consumers' ability to repair, modify, or sell electronic devices. Fair use allows the public to use copyrighted material under certain circumstances without the copyright holder's consent, such as for scholarly lectures or commentary. The Copyright Act allows for fair use of copyrighted material for purposes like criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Federal courts evaluate several factors on a case-by-case basis to determine fair use, including the purpose of use, nature of the copyrighted work, amount used, and impact on the market. Litigation in the software industry initially focused on copyright protection for computer programs rather than fair use analysis. In the early 1990s, courts began considering the fair use defense in software copyright infringement cases. The first sale doctrine in the Copyright Act allows the owner of a copy of a copyrighted work to sell or dispose of it without permission from the copyright owner. This doctrine limits the copyright owner's control over distribution once the item is sold. The first sale doctrine allows owners of lawful copies of copyrighted works to distribute them without the copyright owner's consent. However, this doctrine only limits the distribution rights, and owners may still be liable for infringement if they reproduce or publicly perform the work without permission. The first sale doctrine allows owners of copyrighted works to distribute them without the copyright owner's consent, but not if the work is merely licensed. Retailers often label transactions involving digital media as a limited license to avoid losing control over distribution. Public policy supports the doctrine to promote the progress of science and arts. The Copyright Act balances copyright holders' rights with the public's interest in ownership rights. The first sale doctrine allows owners to distribute copyrighted works without consent, except for licensed works. The Record Rental Amendment Act of 1984 restricts renting sound recordings for commercial advantage without authorization. The Computer Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 extended the first sale doctrine exception to software, preventing owners from renting, leasing, or lending for commercial advantage. Congress aimed to prevent unauthorized copying and displacement of sales, with an exemption for software embodied in a product that cannot be copied during ordinary use. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 prohibits circumventing technological measures that control access to copyrighted works, such as DRM systems on digital content. The DMCA prohibits circumventing DRM security measures to access copyrighted material, including descrambling, decrypting, or bypassing technological restrictions without authorization. Violations result in civil and criminal penalties, focusing on preventing the act of DRM circumvention. The DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions prohibit DRM circumvention, including design, manufacture, import, or trafficking in technology used to bypass copyright protection measures. Fair use does not excuse a violation of the DMCA, but temporary exemptions can be granted by the Librarian of Congress every three years. The DMCA allows for temporary exemptions every three years, giving consumers the right to disable digital locks on copyrighted materials. Proposals for exemptions are submitted by the public, reviewed by the Register of Copyrights, and approved by the Librarian. Users can lawfully modify or disable access controls during the designated three-year period. Additionally, the DMCA permits circumvention for \"reverse engineering\" purposes in certain situations. The DMCA allows temporary exemptions every three years for disabling digital locks on copyrighted materials. Users can modify or disable access controls during this period. The DMCA also permits circumvention for \"reverse engineering\" purposes, allowing individuals to analyze and enable interoperability of computer programs. Courts have interpreted and applied these concepts in cases involving software copyrights. Courts have accepted the fair use defense to infringement claims involving copyrighted software when cases involve \"reverse engineering\" a computer program to access its unprotected functional elements. For example, in Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that Accolade's reverse engineering of Sega's copyrighted computer program was fair use. It remains to be seen if courts will view copyright protection for software-enabled consumer products differently than traditional software installed on general purpose computers. Accolade reverse engineered Sega's software to create Genesis-compatible games, deemed fair use by the appellate court. In a similar case, Sony sued Connectix for creating software to play PlayStation games on computers through reverse engineering. Connectix developed software to play PlayStation games on computers through reverse engineering Sony's BIOS. The district court initially ruled against Connectix, but the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision, stating that the copying of the BIOS was protected fair use. This decision was influenced by a previous case involving Sega, where reverse engineering was also deemed fair use. The court relied on Sega Enterprises' rule on reverse engineering software code, stating that disassembly is fair use if necessary to access unprotected elements. In a 2010 lawsuit, Oracle accused Google of copying Java code for its Android system without proper licensing, seeking $8.8 billion in damages. Google argued it only used a small portion of the code for transformation into a new mobile platform. In 2016, Google was found not liable for copyright infringement by a federal jury, as they used a small portion of software code under fair use doctrine to create a new mobile operating system. Oracle plans to appeal this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The software produced by Autodesk (AutoCAD) is subject to a EULA that imposes conditions and restrictions, including retaining title to all copies, granting a nonexclusive license, prohibiting renting or transferring without consent, and restricting activities like modifying the software. Autodesk enforces its license requirements through serial numbers, tracking registered licensees, and requiring activation codes for continued use. Autodesk requires customers to input activation codes within one month of installation to continue using the software. Customers obtain the code by providing the product's serial number to Autodesk, who issues the code after confirming authenticity. Once obtained, the activation code can be used to activate the software on additional computers without notifying Autodesk. In a case involving Cardwell/Thomas & Associates, Inc. (CTA), CTA sold older software versions to Vernor instead of destroying them as required by Autodesk's licensing agreement. Vernor then listed the software on eBay for sale. In August 2007, Vernor brought a declaratory action against Autodesk, seeking a determination that his resales of used software are protected by the first sale doctrine. The Ninth Circuit determined that CTA was a licensee, not an owner, of the software, and therefore not entitled to resell the copies under the first sale doctrine. The Ninth Circuit ruled that CTA, a licensee, could not resell software copies to Vernor due to license restrictions, infringing Autodesk's distribution rights. CTA, Vernor, and customers couldn't claim ownership or the essential step defense. Software copyright holders may also pursue DMCA claims for circumvention of security measures, as seen in Apple's lawsuit against Psystar Corporation in 2008. In 2008, Apple sued Psystar for copyright infringement and DMCA violations for selling unauthorized Macintosh computer clones that bypassed Apple's software license restrictions. Psystar allegedly disabled Apple's technological measures to install the Mac operating system on non-Apple computers. The federal court sided with Apple, finding Psystar liable for violating Apple's exclusive rights. The court found Psystar liable for copyright infringement and DMCA violations against Apple for selling unauthorized Macintosh computer clones. End user license agreements may restrict resale, modification, or repair of software on electronic devices. Original equipment manufacturers may contract third-party developers for customized software. The manufacturer of consumer electronic products may only hold a license to use the software embedded within them, preventing them from transferring ownership to consumers. This means consumers acquire only an \"implied license\" to use the essential software. The \"first sale doctrine\" does not apply to this software, but companies may offer a \"software license transfer\" fee for the right to sell the software-enabled product to another. Consumers may need to pay a \"license transfer\" fee to sell their software-enabled products to another buyer, as they only have an implied license to use the software. Without permission from the original manufacturer, there could be potential copyright infringement or breach of contract. Some believe this issue could extend beyond computers and servers to everyday consumer goods, but others argue that manufacturers would find new software providers if restrictions were imposed on resale. The legal consequences of resale activity involving software-enabled products have not been judicially established. Copyright issues may arise from attempting to modify consumer software-enabled products, like \"locked\" cellphones. The device is \"locked\" to a carrier like AT&T or Verizon, and consumers may want to unlock it after their contract expires. If the carrier refuses, consumers could be in violation of the DMCA for trying to bypass the digital lock. Exemptions to the DMCA have allowed consumers to disable software locks on their devices. The DMCA exemption for cell phone unlocking allowed consumers to bypass software locks to switch networks without DMCA liability. In 2012, the exemption was limited to phones acquired before January 26, 2013, sparking objections from consumer groups and the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration called for a legislative fix to allow consumers to switch carriers with their existing phones. Congress passed the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act in 2014, temporarily restoring the cellphone unlocking exemption. The Librarian of Congress expanded the exemption to include other devices like tablets and wearable wireless devices in the 2015 rulemaking. The Librarian of Congress approved an exemption allowing the modification of motorized land vehicles. Modifying software-enabled devices like cellphones could infringe on software copyright and involve the DMCA. The Librarian's rulemaking process addresses these issues temporarily. The DMCA regulation directly applies to concerns regarding the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) but does not impact copyright infringement claims. Consumers with broken electronic devices have options such as purchasing new models, contacting authorized repair services, attempting repairs themselves, or seeking independent repair facilities. However, repairing software-enabled products may involve copying software, potentially violating the software copyright holder's rights. Some manufacturers have threatened legal action against users for sharing copyrighted product service manuals online. Some consumer rights advocates are pushing for a \"digital right to repair\" law to allow consumers to repair their electronic devices without facing copyright infringement liability. Advocates argue that consumers should have more options beyond authorized dealers who may charge high prices for repairs. Organizations like iFixit and the Repair Association support making repair instructions and parts more accessible to the public. Advocates for a right to repair believe in providing repair manuals, diagnostic equipment, and replacement parts to independent repair facilities. They argue that repairing old devices reduces electronic waste and benefits consumers by offering lower-cost refurbished electronics. However, the consumer electronics industry opposes loosening restrictions on repair rights, citing the need to maintain control over repair options for product integrity and customer experience. Manufacturers are concerned about the risks to their products and customer experience if repair information is disclosed. They have created certification programs for independent repair facilities but worry about damage to their brand from unauthorized repairs. Federal agencies are examining intellectual property laws in this regard. The Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force examined copyright issues related to software-enabled consumer products in a White Paper published in January 2016. They concluded that the first sale doctrine in copyright law did not need revision at that time, but noted that this may change in the future. The ability to resell electronic products with embedded software is an important issue for consumers. Senators Grassley and Leahy requested a review of copyright laws in everyday products containing software. The Copyright Office requested input on the application of copyright law to software in everyday products, seeking feedback on how it impacts innovation and business interests. The deadline for the report is December 15, 2016. The Copyright Office sought feedback on the impact of copyright law on software in consumer products. Various groups expressed concerns about consumer rights, end user licensing agreements, and user expectations regarding software-enabled devices. The Copyright Office sought feedback on the impact of copyright law on software in consumer products. Representatives of copyright holders oppose changes to current law regarding user rights and end user licensing agreements for software-enabled devices. The Copyright Office sought feedback on the impact of copyright law on software in consumer products. Various organizations argued that software licensing contributes to product integrity and should be respected under copyright law, urging against treating software in devices as deserving only second-class copyright protection. Legislation has been proposed at both federal and state levels to modify consumer rights regarding software-embedded consumer electronics. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress, the You Own Devices Act (YODA) (H.R. 862), aims to amend the Copyright Act to allow consumers to transfer software programs embedded in electronic devices without worrying about copyright infringement. YODA ensures that owners can sell, lease, or transfer their devices along with the software program without any restrictions. The You Own Devices Act (YODA) allows consumers to transfer software programs embedded in electronic devices without copyright infringement concerns. It ensures that owners can sell, lease, or transfer their devices along with the software program without restrictions. The bill's amendments would apply to transfers of computer programs occurring on or after the date of enactment. Another bill, the Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation Act of 2015 (S. 990), aims to consider the impact of the DMCA's anti-circumvention prohibition on repair, recycling, research, fair uses, and access to information not subject to copyright protection. The Unlocking Technology Act of 2015 (H.R. 1587) proposes amending the DMCA to allow circumvention of digital rights management for non-infringing purposes, such as unlocking electronic communication devices to switch carriers. State legislation has focused on the \"right to repair\" electronic devices, following the success of the automotive right to repair initiative in Massachusetts. After Massachusetts passed the automotive right to repair law in 2013, trade groups representing automobile manufacturers reached an agreement with advocates of the automotive right to repair movement. The agreement extends the provisions of Massachusetts' law nationwide, requiring manufacturers to provide vehicle diagnostic and repair information to independent repair facilities. This agreement aims to prevent a patchwork of differing state laws on the issue. The memorandum of understanding on right to repair legislation aims to prevent a patchwork of state laws but lacks enforcement power. Several states have considered similar bills requiring manufacturers to provide repair information to independent shops, without revealing trade secrets. The legislation on right to repair exempts motor vehicles but is criticized for being vaguely worded and potentially affecting various electronic products. Software on electronic devices enhances user experience but may limit functions to authorized options. The copyright protection of software in consumer devices benefits manufacturers but raises questions about users' rights to resell, modify, or repair products. The challenge lies in the fact that software is copyrightable, while the physical hardware is not. The application of copyright law to software-enabled products is still debated, with uncertainties around fair use, the first sale doctrine, and the DMCA for consumers. Some believe current laws on software-enabled products do not need changes unless new circumstances arise. Others advocate for protecting consumer ownership rights against manufacturers' post-purchase control. Congress may need to find a balance between software copyright holders and consumer rights if legislative action is deemed necessary."
