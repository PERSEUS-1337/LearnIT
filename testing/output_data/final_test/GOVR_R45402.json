    "content": "A \"lame duck\" session of Congress occurs when a Congress meets after its successor is elected but before the current Congress's term ends. Between 1940 and 2016, there were 21 lame duck sessions, with seven following elections that changed the majority party in one or both chambers. These sessions took place in 1948, 1954, 1980, 1994, 2006, 2010, and 2014. Three of these sessions followed a majority-changing midterm election during a President's first term. Lame duck sessions are held after elections when the same party controls the White House, House, and Senate. These sessions focus on completing legislation, preventing recess appointments, considering motions of censure or impeachment, and approving nominations. Critics argue against defeated members or parties managing the legislative agenda, while proponents see them as useful for lawmaking at the end of a Congress. In recent years, lame duck sessions have become routine occurrences, addressing program authorizations, trade measures, appropriations, and the budget. Lame duck sessions have become a regular occurrence during even-numbered years, following the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. These sessions occur after the November election in an even-numbered year and before the next Congress starts on January 3. Between 1935 and 1998, lame duck sessions were held in 12 out of 32 Congresses, while from 2000 to 2016, both houses held a lame duck session in every Congress. These sessions are now expected biennial events. Lame duck sessions in Congress have become a regular occurrence every two years after the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. These sessions typically start in mid-November and last for about a month, with the House holding an average of 15 daily sessions and the Senate holding an average of 18 daily sessions. The shortest sessions have had a limited agenda, such as the House spending three days on President Clinton's impeachment proceedings in 1998. In 1948 and 1994, lame duck sessions were held after an election that changed the majority party in Congress. These sessions were similar in length to the overall average. From 1935 to 2016, seven lame duck sessions followed such elections. Two occurred during a presidential election year, two followed a midterm election during a President's second term, and three followed a midterm election during a President's first term. Table 1 shows lame duck sessions after a majority party change, listing the seats lost and key measures approved. In the 1954 midterm election, the Republican Party lost its majorities in both chambers during President Eisenhower's first term in office. The Senate reconvened solely to consider disciplinary actions against Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. In November 1954, a resolution of censure was debated and amended on the Senate floor against Senator McCarthy for his behavior related to his inquiry into alleged communist influence. The Senate approved the resolution on December 2, censuring McCarthy. In the 1994 midterm election, Republicans gained control of the House and Senate. Both houses reconvened to consider the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which received bipartisan support in the lame duck session. In the 2010 election, congressional Democrats lost their House majority during President Obama's first term. During President Obama's first term, congressional Democrats lost their House majority and six Senate seats. In November, Congress passed several key measures including the NDAA, FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, and James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. They also extended income tax cuts, passed continuing resolutions for government funding, ratified the New START arms control treaty with Russia, and confirmed 19 federal judges."
