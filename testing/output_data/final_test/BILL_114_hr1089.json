    "content": "The \"Native American Indian Education Act\" ensures Federal funding for colleges to waive tuition charges for Native American Indian students, including those who are not residents of the State where the college is located. Congress acknowledges the valuable role of Native American-serving nontribal college institutions in providing educational opportunities to Native American Indian students, some of which offer tuition-free education with state support. The tuition waiver benefits provided by these colleges and states today exceed the original grant of land and facilities. The financial burden of providing tuition-free education to Native American students is no longer equitably shared among states and colleges. Native student tuition waiver benefits are at risk of being terminated due to severe budget constraints. State relief is sought from federal mandate. The Secretary of Education will pay eligible colleges the tuition charges for non-resident Indian students enrolled in the college, as mandated by Federal statute. Eligible colleges must be Native American-serving nontribal institutions providing tuition-free education to Native American Indian students. The college received land and facilities from the United States. The amount paid to any college for each fiscal year may not exceed the tuition charges for non-resident Indian students or $15,000,000. Any payments received by a college will be considered a reimbursement from the State and fulfill the Federal mandate to admit Indian students tuition-free. The Act mandates that states reimburse colleges for tuition charges exceeding the amount received for non-resident Indian students. For resident Indian students, states must reimburse the full tuition amount. The term \"Indian students\" includes \"Indian pupils\" as defined in Federal statutes. The Act mandates states to provide tuition-free education to Native American Indian students, with funding authorized for implementation. SEC. 5. OFFSET. In General, $15,000,000 in unobligated funds are rescinded. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will determine which accounts the rescission applies to. A report will be submitted within 60 days. Exceptions include funds for Native American Indian student education and the Department of Defense. Exceptions to the $15,000,000 fund rescission include education for Native American Indian students, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Education."
