    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016\". Congress finds that in June 2014, an internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs revealed over 120,000 veterans faced long wait times for health care appointments. Despite efforts to increase appointment handling, the number of veterans waiting 30 days or more for care rose by 50% the following year. Additionally, in 2008, the Inspector General estimated that 18% of outpatient appointment slots went unfilled due to patient no-shows or lack of refilling canceled appointments. Wait times are not exclusive to the VA, as the private sector also experiences delays. The private sector is leveraging technology to reduce wait times for appointments, with an average wait time of over 18 days. In June 2015, the Institute of Medicine called for a patient-oriented scheduling platform for online self-scheduling of care. The pilot program establishes a patient self-scheduling appointment system, in response to the need for reducing wait times for appointments and the call for a patient-oriented scheduling platform. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will start a pilot program where veterans can schedule health care appointments online. The program will be implemented in at least three Veterans Integrated Services Networks, and the Secretary will contract with one or more providers to offer the scheduling and confirmation capability. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will issue a request for proposals for a contract allowing patients to self-schedule, confirm, and modify outpatient and specialty care appointments online. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program for online scheduling of appointments, allowing patients to book, cancel, and modify appointments in real-time through a website. The program will integrate with existing infrastructure and run for 18 months. The Secretary may extend the pilot program if it reduces wait times for veterans seeking health care and fills more appointment times. A report on the outcomes of the pilot program must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The pilot program aims to improve veterans' ability to schedule health care appointments and reduce wait times. No additional funds are authorized for the program, which will be funded using existing resources allocated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Recommendations for expanding the program to other Veterans Integrated Services Networks will be made as deemed appropriate by the Secretary."
