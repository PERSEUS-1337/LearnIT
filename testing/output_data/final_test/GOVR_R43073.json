    "content": "The President is required by federal law to submit an annual budget to Congress by the first Monday in February. This budget outlines the President's fiscal policy, including proposed spending, revenues, and deficit/surplus levels. It also highlights priorities for federal programs like defense, education, and health. The budget may include legislative proposals for spending and tax policy changes. President Obama submitted his FY2014 budget to Congress on April 10, 2013. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. CMS is the largest purchaser of healthcare in the US, providing insurance to 114 million individuals in 2010. This report summarizes the President's budget estimates for CMS and legislative proposals included in the budget. The President's budget includes a description of current law and proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, private health insurance, and program management. The CMS budget consists mostly of mandatory spending, with estimated net outlays of $845.5 billion in FY2014, a 6.4% increase from FY2013. The budget assumes an increase in Medicare spending. The President's budget proposes legislative changes to Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, private health insurance, and program management. It estimates a $15.4 billion increase in CMS's net outlays for FY2014 due to a proposed adjustment in physician payments. The total net outlays are estimated to be $860.9 billion in FY2014. The budget also predicts a $0.3 billion increase in net outlays for FY2013 and a $5.8 billion decrease for FY2014 if the legislative proposals are implemented. With adjustments and estimated savings, CMS's net outlays are projected to be $854.3 billion. The President's budget estimates CMS's net outlays will be $854.3 billion in FY2014, an increase of $60.2 billion from FY2013. Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, program integrity, state grants, private health insurance, CMMI, and program management are the sections of CMS. Medicare covers health care services for qualified beneficiaries, including individuals 65 and older and permanently disabled individuals under 65. The President's FY2014 budget estimates that Medicare's total net mandatory and discretionary outlays will be $522.1 billion, with adjustments and legislative proposals aimed at decreasing outlays by $6.0 billion during FY2014 and $371.0 billion over the next 10 years. The FY2014 budget estimates Medicare's total net outlays to be $531.5 billion, a 3.9% increase from FY2013. The \"Medicare Legislative Proposals\" section describes legislative proposals for the program, including costs and savings. CMS contracts with QIOs to improve services for beneficiaries. The QIO's 10th Statement of Work (SOW) provides $1.6 billion in funding over three years for various clinical quality improvement priorities, beneficiary center care, value-based purchasing support, infrastructure, and other initiatives. The 11th SOW, starting in August 2014, will implement changes to the QIO program, including flexibility in geographic scope and contracting with a broader range of entities. The QIO program is undergoing changes, including allowing contracts with a broader range of entities, awarding certain tasks to specialty contractors, and extending contract length to five years. Medicaid is a jointly funded program by the federal government and states, providing medical services and long-term care. States have flexibility in designing and administering their own Medicaid programs, leading to variability in eligibility levels and covered services. Medicaid is a jointly funded program by the federal government and states, providing medical services and long-term care. Eligibility has expanded to include individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The President's FY2014 budget estimates Medicaid total net outlays to be $303.8 billion, with the federal government covering a share of costs. Proposed legislative changes could decrease total net outlays for Medicaid. The President's budget estimates FY2014 net outlays for Medicaid to be $303.7 billion, with a decrease of $0.1 billion in FY2014 and $22.1 billion over the next 10 years. The \"Medicaid Legislative Proposals\" section discusses current and proposed laws for the program, including costs or savings for each proposal. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established CHIP to provide health insurance coverage to low-income, uninsured children. Authorization and funding for CHIP has been extended multiple times, most recently by the ACA through FY2015. CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with funding capped on a state-by-state basis. It allows states to cover low-income children above Medicaid eligibility levels and pregnant women under certain conditions. The President's FY2014 budget estimates CHIP's total outlays to be $10.1 billion, with a slight increase from FY2013. There are no specific legislative proposals for CHIP, but other CMS budget proposals may impact it. The legislative proposals discussed in the \"Program Integrity Legislative Proposals\" section aim to prevent fraud in Medicaid and CHIP. The HCFAC program, established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, focuses on detecting and combating healthcare fraud, including in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. Funding is used to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicaid program. The budget estimates for program integrity activities in the Medicaid program amount to $2.0 billion in FY2014, with an increase of $52 million from FY2013. Funding consists of mandatory ($1.7 billion) and discretionary ($0.3 billion) funding. The \"Program Integrity Legislative Proposals\" section describes current and proposed laws for program integrity activities. The President's budget estimates $0.7 billion for state grants and demonstrations in FY2014, a decrease of $40 million from FY2013. The budget does not include any legislative proposals impacting this portion of the CMS budget. The ACA includes reforms focusing on program integrity activities in the Medicaid program. The ACA includes reforms that focus on restructuring the private health insurance market by creating new programs like Health Insurance Exchanges. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight within CMS is charged with helping implement these provisions. The President's FY2014 budget estimates $7.3 billion for health insurance programs, including the implementation of exchanges offering coverage by January 1, 2014. In FY2014, total outlays for health insurance programs are projected to be $7.3 billion, a 76.4% increase from FY2013. The President's budget includes a legislative proposal with no budgetary impact. The ACA established CMMI to test innovative healthcare models with $10 billion in funding from FY2011 to FY2019. The President's budget for FY2014 includes funding for various healthcare programs such as Pioneer ACOs, Advance Payment ACO Model, and state demonstrations for dual eligible individuals. The budget estimates $1.4 billion for CMMI, a 7.6% increase from FY2013. Additionally, $6.4 billion is allocated for program management activities under CMS. No legislative proposals impacting CMMI are included in the budget. The President's budget for FY2014 includes $6.4 billion for program management activities, with legislative proposals that could increase funding by $0.4 billion in FY2014 and $0.5 billion over 10 years. Discretionary funding for program management is estimated at $5.2 billion in FY2014, a 35.8% increase from FY2013. Mandatory funding is projected to be $0.3 billion in FY2014. The President's FY2014 budget includes $6.4 billion for program management activities, with potential legislative proposals to increase funding by $0.4 billion. Mandatory funding for program management is estimated at $0.3 billion, a $34 million decrease from FY2013. The total program level funding for program management activities in FY2014 is projected to be $6.9 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion or 47.8% over FY2013. The President's budget also includes proposals to impact the CMS budget, with some aimed at program expansions and others at reducing federal spending. The President's FY2014 budget includes proposals to impact the CMS budget, with some aimed at program expansions and others at reducing federal spending. This report provides a description of legislative proposals grouped by program areas such as Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, private health insurance, and program management. Medicare historically reimbursed providers for beneficiaries' unpaid coinsurance and deductible amounts, with scheduled reductions in bad debt reimbursement percentages over the years. The Medicare bad debt reimbursement percentages have changed over the years, with reductions implemented by BIPA and DRA. The MCTRJCA further reduced reimbursement to 65% for all providers, including critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, and others. The MCTRJCA reduced Medicare bad debt reimbursement to 65% for all providers, with phased reductions for those previously reimbursed at higher rates. The President's budget proposes further reducing reimbursement to 25% over three years. Additionally, Medicare provides additional payments to hospitals with medical residency programs through indirect medical education (IME) payments. The IME payments for hospitals with medical residency programs are based on the resident-to-bed ratio, with a 5.5% increase for every 10% increase in ratio. MedPAC found that less than half of IME payments are justified and recommended changes in funding to support necessary workforce skills. The President's budget proposes a 10% reduction in IME funding starting in FY2014, with the Secretary given authority to set standards for teaching hospitals to focus on primary care training and workforce skills development. Critical access hospitals (CAHs) are limited-service rural facilities that offer 24-hour emergency care, with specific criteria for bed count and length of stay. They receive enhanced cost-based Medicare payments since FY2004, providing 101% reimbursement for various services to Medicare beneficiaries. The President's budget proposes a reduction in Medicare reimbursement for CAHs. The President's budget proposes reducing Medicare reimbursement for Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to 100% of reasonable costs starting in FY2014. To be certified as a CAH, a rural entity must meet specific distance criteria or be designated as a necessary provider by the state. The budget would eliminate the ability for states to waive federal mileage requirements for entities less than 10 miles from another hospital or CAH. The President's budget proposes reducing Medicare reimbursement for Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to 100% of reasonable costs starting in FY2014. The proposal includes eliminating Medicare enhanced payments for entities less than 10 miles from another hospital or CAH. MedPAC recommended eliminating Medicare payment updates for SNFs, IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs in its March 2013 report. The ACA amended the annual update policy for post-acute providers to include an adjustment for cost savings. The President's budget proposes reducing Medicare reimbursement for post-acute providers, including SNFs, IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs. The proposal includes implementing productivity adjustments and additional update reductions for these providers. The annual updates for these providers may be subject to reductions, with a minimum payment rate of 0.0. The President's budget also includes a proposal to implement a 1.1 percentage point reduction in payment updates for these providers from FY2014 through FY2023. IRFs are facilities exempt from Medicare's IPPS, required to treat a certain proportion of patients with specified medical conditions to qualify for higher payments. The \"75 percent rule\" mandates that at least 75% of a facility's inpatient population must have one of 13 pre-established medical conditions to be classified as an IRF. The compliance threshold for IRFs was temporarily suspended and reissued in 2004 with revised qualifying conditions and transition periods. The threshold started at 50% in 2004 and increased to 75% in 2007. The DRA extended the 60% threshold in 2006. MMSEA set the compliance threshold at 60% in 2007, including comorbidities as qualifying conditions. The President's budget proposed reinstating the 75% threshold in FY2014. The President's FY2013 budget proposal included adjustments to reimbursement rates in post-acute care settings for certain conditions. IRFs providing intensive rehabilitation services for uncomplicated conditions would be paid as SNFs. The proposal aimed to limit payment differentials for conditions involving hips, knees, and pulmonary issues. The ACA established penalties for acute care hospitals with high readmission rates, starting at 1% in FY2013 and increasing to 3% in FY2015. SNFs are not subject to these penalties. MedPAC recommended reducing Medicare payments to SNFs with high rehospitalization rates for better care coordination. The President's budget proposed reducing payments to SNFs with high preventable readmission rates by up to 3% in FY2017. Post-acute care services include nursing and rehabilitation in various settings like LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs. Post-acute care services are provided in different settings like LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs. Medicare payment rates vary across settings due to different cost structures. Geographic variation in Medicare spending is influenced by post-acute care services. MedPAC proposed a bundled payment for an episode of care to improve efficiency and care coordination. MedPAC's bundled payment proposal is still in development, while CMS has launched the BPCI Initiative to test bundling payment models. In Model 2, participants manage a beneficiary's episode including hospital, physician, and post-acute care services. Those achieving spending reduction compared to a benchmark can share in savings. The President's budget plans to implement bundled payments for post-acute care providers in FY2018, aiming to reduce Medicare expenditures by 2.85% by FY2020. The Medicare DSH funds are paid to qualifying hospitals through an adjustment within the applicable PPS. DSH hospitals receive additional payments based on a DSH patient percentage (DPP) calculated from two fractions: the Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction. The Medicare DSH payment adjustment is made to qualifying hospitals under an approved state Medicaid plan. Urban acute care hospitals may receive DSH payments under an alternative formula. The President's budget proposes including hospital days for beneficiaries who have exhausted their Medicare Part A benefits and are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in the DSH calculation. Medicare covers certain drugs under Part B, reimbursing physicians based on 106% of the manufacturer's Average Sales Price. The President's budget proposes reducing Medicare Part B drug reimbursements from 106% to 103% of the manufacturer's Average Sales Price. This change would affect providers such as physicians, hospital outpatient departments, and clinics who negotiate drug prices with wholesalers and manufacturers. Larger purchasers can often secure lower prices and make a profit, while smaller purchasers may struggle to break even or even lose money on Part B drug transactions. The proposal aims to reduce Medicare Part B drug reimbursements from 106% to 103% of the manufacturer's ASP. Drug manufacturers may need to pay rebates in certain cases. Clinical lab services are paid based on fee schedules updated annually, with a payment ceiling set at 74% of the median fee schedule amount. Adjustments are made annually based on the CPI-U, with updates eliminated for certain years. The President's budget proposes lowering payment rates under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule by -1.75% annually from 2016 to 2023. It also grants the Secretary authority to adjust rates in a budget-neutral manner, with support for electronic reporting of lab results. Physician self-referral limitations were established under the Stark law in 1989, prohibiting certain referrals for designated health services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. The Stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid to entities they have a financial relationship with, aiming to prevent overutilization and healthcare cost increases. There are exceptions for physicians and group practices meeting specific requirements to provide certain services in their offices. Beginning in 2015, a proposal would exclude certain services from the in-office ancillary services exception to the Stark law, unless specific accountability standards are met. Medicare beneficiaries pay monthly premiums and out-of-pocket cost-sharing amounts for Part B services, including an annual deductible. The Medicare deductible set by statute is increased annually based on Part B costs. The President's budget proposes a $25 increase in deductible for new enrollees in 2017, 2019, and 2021. Two beneficiary groups would have different deductible amounts. The first group, enrolled before 2017, would not be affected, while the second group, enrolled after, would see changes in their deductible. For Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in Medicare after January 1, 2017, deductibles would increase by $25 in 2017, 2019, and 2021. This proposal was part of the President's FY2013 budget. The deductible amounts for new enrollees would be higher than those enrolled before 2017 due to annual adjustments based on expected costs. Medicare provides payment for a 60-day episode of home health care under a prospective payment system, covering skilled nursing, therapy, social services, and medical supplies. Legislative changes eliminated cost-sharing for home health services, but beneficiaries may have copayments for durable medical equipment and osteoporosis drugs. MedPAC recommended Congress to consider changes in March 2013. The MedPAC recommended establishing a per episode copayment for home health episodes not preceded by hospitalization or post-acute care. The President's budget proposed a $100 copayment for new beneficiaries for each home health 60-day episode with five or more visits. Medigap is private health insurance that supplements Medicare coverage, covering deductibles, coinsurance, and additional services. Medigap requires a monthly premium set by the insurance company. There are 10 standardized plans with varying coverage levels, two of which offer full coverage for Parts A and B deductibles and coinsurance. A proposal in the President's budget would impose a Part B premium surcharge for new beneficiaries choosing a plan with low cost-sharing. This surcharge would be around 15% of the average Medigap premium. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes changes to Medicare Part B premiums based on income levels. Higher-income beneficiaries pay a larger share of premiums, with income thresholds set at $85,000, $107,000, $160,000, and $214,000 for single filers. The ACA also introduced income-related premiums for Part D services and suspended inflation-indexing of income thresholds for Parts B and D through 2019. Around 4% of Part B enrollees were estimated to pay higher income-related premiums in 2011. Starting in FY2017, the budget would increase the applicable percentage of the program's cost per aged enrollee. The budget proposal in the President's FY2013 budget would increase the applicable percentage of the program's cost per aged enrollee for higher income beneficiaries to between 40% and 90%. This proposal also includes suspending inflation-indexing of income thresholds until 25% of beneficiaries under Parts B and D are subject to these premiums. Medicare Advantage (MA or Medicare Part C) is an alternative to original fee-for-service Medicare where beneficiaries can receive Medicare covered benefits through a private health plan. MA plans are paid a monthly amount per person to provide these benefits regardless of usage. The DRA and ACA required adjustments to MA plan payments based on risk scores and coding patterns. Starting in 2014, minimum coding intensity adjustments were specified, with subsequent amendments. The DRA and ACA mandated adjustments to MA plan payments based on risk scores and coding patterns. Minimum coding intensity adjustments were set starting in 2014, with yearly increases until reaching 7.59% in 2018. The President's budget proposed further increases to the minimum coding intensity adjustment, not included in the FY2013 budget proposal. Employers and unions can sponsor Medicare Advantage plans for their eligible members. Employers and unions may sponsor Medicare Advantage plans for their eligible members, including retirees and their spouses. These plans, known as Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs), receive payments based on bids compared to a benchmark, with rebates based on plan quality. Starting in 2012, rebates range from 50% to 70% of the cost difference. The rebate amount for Medicare Advantage plans is determined by plan quality, ranging from 50% to 70% of the bid-benchmark difference. The rebate must be given back to enrollees through additional benefits, reduced cost-sharing, or lower premiums. If a plan's bid exceeds the benchmark, each enrollee pays an extra premium. Starting in 2015, payment amounts for EGWPs would be based on average MA plan bids in each market. Medicare Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs for about 60% of eligible beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part D may qualify for the low-income subsidy (LIS) to help with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. In 2013, an estimated 11.4 million beneficiaries qualified for the LIS. Those who qualify for Medicaid, Medicare Savings Programs, or Supplemental Security Income are automatically eligible. Others with limited assets and incomes below 150% of FPL may also qualify. About 40% of Part D enrollees receive the LIS through private prescription drug plans. Private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and MA prescription drug plans offer prescription drug coverage, with Part D plan sponsors negotiating prices with drug manufacturers for rebates. Medicaid determines basic prescription drug rebates based on a drug's quarterly average manufacturers' price (AMP) or a flat percentage. The President's budget in 2014 would require drug manufacturers to pay the difference between rebates provided to Part D plans and Medicaid rebate levels for brand name and generic drugs provided to LIS beneficiaries. The President's FY2013 budget proposal included plans to align Medicaid rebate levels for brand name and generic drugs provided to LIS beneficiaries with Medicare Part D standard drug benefit, which includes a coverage gap. The ACA gradually phases out the coverage gap through manufacturer discounts on brand-name drugs. The ACA phases out the coverage gap in Medicare Part D through manufacturer discounts on brand-name drugs and federal subsidies for both brand-name and generic drugs. By 2020, enrollees will have a 25% cost-share for prescriptions from deductible to catastrophic limit, with increasing subsidies provided by the government. The President's budget proposes increasing the manufacturer discount for brand-name drugs to 75% from 50% in 2015, effectively eliminating the coverage gap for brand-name drugs. The President's budget proposes increasing the manufacturer discount for brand-name drugs to 75% from 50% in 2015, effectively eliminating the coverage gap for brand-name drugs. LIS beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part D may qualify for additional assistance with prescription drug cost-sharing based on income levels. Dual-eligible beneficiaries have varying levels of drug co-pays or coinsurance depending on their income. LIS beneficiaries in Medicare Part D have different cost-sharing rates based on income levels. They pay $2.65 for generic drugs and $6.60 for brand-name drugs until reaching the catastrophic threshold, where co-payment is zero. Those with higher incomes pay a flat 15% coinsurance rate up to the threshold, with cost-sharing above that level. LIS beneficiaries tend to have more chronic ailments and higher drug costs compared to non-LIS beneficiaries. The President's budget proposes reducing co-payments for generic drugs for LIS beneficiaries based on income levels, while increasing co-payments for brand-name drugs. The Secretary would have discretion to exclude certain drugs from generic substitution. The proposed cost-sharing change for LIS beneficiaries would not apply to those in institutions or receiving certain community-based services. Part D beneficiaries with incomes between 135% and 150% of FPL may face higher cost-sharing if they reach their plan's catastrophic coverage limit. The process for low-income individuals to qualify for LIS involves determining eligibility and enrolling in a specific Part D plan, with some automatically enrolled by CMS. The CMS auto-enrolls beneficiaries in Part D plans with basic prescription drug coverage if the premium is at or below the low-income subsidy amount. The President's budget proposes contracting with a single plan to provide coverage for LIS beneficiaries during eligibility processing, instead of the current random process. This would streamline reimbursement for retroactive drug claims. The proposal to streamline reimbursement for retroactive drug claims by contracting with a single plan paid by CMS was not included in the President's FY2013 budget proposal. The ACA established IPAB to develop proposals to reduce Medicare spending, focusing on payments to MA and PDP plans and reimbursement rates for providers. Recommendations made by the Board automatically go into effect unless Congress enacts specific legislation to prevent their implementation. The IPAB proposals can take effect in 2015 if not prevented by Congress. The target growth rate for the first five years depends on consumer price indices, while from the sixth year onwards, it will be based on GDP per capita increase plus 1.0 percentage point. The CBO estimated that the IPAB trigger conditions would not be met in the next 10 fiscal years. The CMS Actuary determines the trigger for IPAB activity, but it is projected to have no effect on federal budget outlays from FY2013 to FY2023 under current law. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes lowering the target rate for 2020 and beyond. Medicare and Medicaid appeal processes differ significantly, causing confusion and inefficiency, especially for dual eligibles. Medicaid serves as the payer of last resort for dual eligibles, leading to challenges in navigating the appeals processes. The President's budget proposes legislation to create an integrated Medicare and Medicaid appeals process for dual eligibles, addressing delays and care interruptions caused by differences in the current systems. This aims to reduce administrative costs and duplicative treatments. The President's budget proposes an integrated Medicare and Medicaid appeals process for dual eligibles to reduce delays and care interruptions. The proposal expands the use of Medicare data for fraud prevention and value-added analysis for physicians by qualified entities. The proposal expands the use of Medicare data for fraud prevention and value-added analysis for physicians, allowing qualified entities to release raw claims data for care coordination and practice improvement. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2013 budget proposal. The Hatch-Waxman Act established the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway at the FDA, allowing generic applicants to obtain marketing approval based on safety and efficacy data provided by the brand name firm. The FDA provides 180-day market exclusivity to the first paragraph IV filer(s) under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Settlements between brand name and generic firms in litigation sometimes involve \"reverse payment\" or \"pay-for-delay\" agreements. The President's budget proposal aims to authorize the FTC to prohibit such agreements that delay entry of generic drugs into the market. The President's FY2013 budget proposal impacts both Medicare and Medicaid budgets by establishing a regulatory regime for biosimilar and interchangeable biologics. The FDA plays a key role in determining standards for these products and provides data protection and marketing exclusivity for brand name and follow-on biologic drugs. Brand name biologic drugs receive four years of marketing exclusivity and 12 years of data exclusivity. The President's FY2013 budget proposal impacts both Medicare and Medicaid budgets by reducing data exclusivity for brand biologics from 12 to 7 years. This change would eliminate additional exclusivity periods for minor product formulation changes. The BBA97 required states to pay Medicare Part B premiums for Qualifying Individuals (QIs) with income between 120% and 135% of FPL. Medicaid payment for QIs is funded through an annual transfer from the Medicare Part B Trust Fund. States receive 100% federal funding to pay QI's Medicare premiums up to the federal allocation. The QI program, funded since October 1, 1998, has been extended 13 times. The ATRA authorized the QI program through December 31, 2013, with appropriations for FY2013 and FY2014. The President's budget proposes extending QI authorization through December 31, 2014, authorizing an additional 12 months of funding. States are required to make Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients. Federal Medicaid DSH allotments to states totaled $11.3 billion in FY2012. The ACA mandates aggregate reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments from FY2014 to FY2020, with reductions applied to FY2021 and FY2022. States' DSH allotments will rebound to pre-ACA levels in FY2023. The President's budget proposes to \"rebase\" Medicaid DSH allotments for FY2023 and subsequent years based on ACA reduced levels. The allotments would be calculated by increasing each state's FY2022 allotment by the percentage change in CPI-U. The ACA requires aggregate reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments from FY2014 to FY2020. The President's budget proposes delaying Medicaid DSH reductions for one year and spreading out the reduction currently slated for FY2014 over FY2016 and FY2017. States have flexibility in setting Medicaid payment rates, with some exceptions. Providers subject to federal upper payment limits under Medicaid include hospitals and nursing homes. The federal regulations under Medicaid limit payments for inpatient hospital and long-term care services to Medicare reimbursement levels. Currently, there is no Upper Payment Limit (UPL) for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) under Medicaid. Medicare historically paid for DME based on fee schedules, but the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) introduced a competitive bidding program for selected DME in certain areas. The competitive bidding program aims to determine prices based on suppliers' bids rather than fee schedules. The program faced implementation concerns initially but was restarted in 2009. The competitive bidding program for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) began in October 2009, with contracts and payments taking effect in January 2011. The second round of competition started in 2011 in 91 additional areas, with payments and contracts expected to start in July 2013. The program is set to be extended by 2016, and the President's budget proposes limiting federal reimbursement for Medicaid spending on certain DME. Medicaid distinguishes between single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs for prescription drug rebates. Medicaid distinguishes between single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs for prescription drug rebates. Rebates for drugs still under patent have a basic rebate and an additional rebate based on price comparisons. Manufacturers owe additional rebates if their prices increase faster than inflation. For innovator and non-innovator multiple source drugs, manufacturers' rebates are set at 13% of the drug's price. The President's budget proposes changes to Medicaid rebate obligations for drugs, including clarifying that certain OTC products are still considered brand drugs. The proposal aims to close loopholes that could allow manufacturers to pay lower rebates than required by Medicaid law. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2013 Budget, and the ACA refined the definition of Medicaid multiple-source, generic drugs. The ACA expanded the FDA's definition of therapeutically equivalent drugs, requiring federal upper limits for Medicaid drug reimbursement. Medicaid drug FULs are based on the average price of all drugs in each product code, excluding brand and authorized generics. Medicaid covers outpatient prescription drugs for most beneficiary groups, with manufacturers required to enter rebate agreements. The President's budget proposes changing the calculation of Medicaid rebates for single source brand name products to exclude sales of authorized generic drugs. This move aims to prevent the lowering of Medicaid rebate obligations for manufacturers by including authorized generic sales with brand product sales. The President's budget proposes changing Medicaid rebate calculations for single source brand name products by excluding authorized generic sales. This adjustment aims to increase the rebate owed by manufacturers on brand name drugs. The President's budget proposes changing Medicaid rebate calculations for line-extension products to align with original product AMPs. A technical correction to the ACA provision would adjust the rebate formula for line-extension drugs. States have the option to enroll certain Medicaid beneficiaries in benchmark benefit plans. The ACA established a new Medicaid eligibility group for non-elderly, non-pregnant adults with income up to 133% of FPL in 2014. States may opt for benchmark-equivalent coverage with the same actuarial value as benchmark plans. The proposal in the President's FY2013 Budget includes benchmark-equivalent coverage for non-elderly, non-disabled adults with income exceeding 133% of FPL. States must provide transitional medical assistance (TMA) to low-income families facing coverage loss due to income changes. Federal law mandates four months of TMA for families losing Medicaid eligibility due to various reasons, with work-related TMA benefits expanded in 1988 to provide up to 12 months of coverage. The President's budget proposal extends the authorization and funding of expanded Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) requirements through December 31, 2014. States may choose to provide work-related TMA for a full 12-month period under the ARRA option. Congress has extended these requirements beyond their original sunset date of September 30, 1998, most recently through the ATRA. The proposal also allows states that adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion to opt out of TMA. The HHS poverty guidelines, based on Census Bureau thresholds, are used for determining financial eligibility for federal programs like Medicaid. The guidelines are updated annually to reflect changes in the CPI-U, rounded, and adjusted for family sizes. The President's budget proposes a permanent hold harmless provision to adjust HHS poverty guidelines only with an increase in CPI-U. This would impact social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. SSI benefits are generally for U.S. citizens, but certain refugees and humanitarian immigrants may also qualify. The President's budget proposes extending SSI eligibility for refugees, asylees, and humanitarian immigrants from seven to nine years until the end of FY2015. After this period, they would revert to a seven-year eligibility. Additionally, federal law holds fathers financially responsible for birth costs if the custodial parent lacks private medical coverage at the child's birth. The President's budget proposes prohibiting the use of child support to repay Medicaid costs for birth expenses. Medicare covers DME, including power wheelchairs, when medically necessary, but there is a history of fraud and abuse associated with these devices. The ACA added new program integrity tools to combat Medicare fraud, including a requirement for face-to-face examinations before DME can be prescribed. CMS is focusing on high-risk areas for improper payments and fraud, with a demonstration in seven states requiring prior authorization for PMDs. Medicare's FY2010 expenditures for PMDs in these states were 43% of the total PMD expenditures. The Medicare PMD prior-authorization demonstration, initially scheduled for January 1, 2012, was delayed until September 1, 2012, and is set to end on August 31, 2015. The President's budget proposal includes continuing this demonstration, requiring Medicare providers and suppliers to update enrollment information within specified time frames to monitor provider status and prevent fraudulent activity. Civil penalties may be imposed for failure to update records promptly. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes a requirement for timely updating of enrollment records to prevent fraudulent activity. Claims processing systems lack data to verify if services billed are medically necessary. Electronic health records (EHR) systems are being implemented by many providers, with incentives provided by ARRA and ACA. EHR systems can interact with clinical decision support systems and electronic claims processing. The President's FY2013 budget proposal aims to implement an electronic Medicare claims ordering system to validate high-risk services ordered by practitioners for medical necessity. This system would help prevent fraudulent activity by ensuring that patients receive the necessary services. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes measures to prevent fraudulent activities in Medicare payments, such as requiring providers to report the use of accounts that transfer funds to offshore jurisdictions. This aims to address cases where improper payments were quickly transferred to shield them from recovery actions. The President's FY2013 budget proposal aims to recover improper payments from providers, particularly in the growth of advanced imaging services under Medicare. Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of these services, with a significant increase in self-referred advanced imaging services from 2004 to 2010. The President's Budget proposes prior authorization for expensive imaging services in Medicare. Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) investigate and prosecute healthcare providers suspected of fraud in the state's Medicaid program. MFCUs also handle complaints of neglect, abuse, and misappropriation of patient funds in healthcare facilities receiving Medicaid payments. MFCUs do not receive federal matching funds for patient abuse or neglect investigations in non-institutional settings. They are responsible for investigating fraud in the administration of the state Medicaid program and collecting overpayments. Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) investigate and prosecute healthcare providers suspected of fraud in the state's Medicaid program. MFCUs have authority to investigate fraud in other federally-funded health care programs with the Inspector General's approval. They are funded partially through a grant from the HHS OIG and matching state funds. The President's budget aims to expand the range of care settings where MFCUs can investigate patient complaints. The proposal to expand the range of care settings for Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) to investigate patient complaints was not included in the President's FY2013 budget proposal. Under third-party liability rules, Medicaid is the payer of last resort, and other insurers or programs are required to pay before Medicaid for medical costs incurred by Medicaid-eligible individuals. States must determine the existence of third parties and ensure providers bill them before Medicaid. The DRA strengthens states' TPL authority to recover Medicaid payments from third parties, clarifying entities considered third parties and requiring insurers to comply with Medicaid TPL rules. The President's budget proposes expanding Medicaid's TPL authority to delay payment for prenatal and pediatric costs, collect medical child support from non-custodial parents with health insurance, and recover costs from beneficiary liability settlements. This proposal was included in the President's FY2013 budget. Medicaid statute gives states broad authority for prescription drug monitoring. The President's proposal aims to enhance Medicaid's authority in monitoring high-risk drug billing to detect potential abuse or excessive usage. States have implemented various prescription drug monitoring activities, including \"lock-in\" programs for Medicaid beneficiaries and linking Medicaid data with statewide monitoring programs. Some states have also increased penalties for individuals involved in diverting Medicaid drugs for fraudulent activities. The President's proposal aims to enhance Medicaid's monitoring of high-risk drug billing to detect potential abuse or excessive usage. States can tailor their programs to address overuse or abuse of certain drug classes. Drug manufacturers must pay rebates for drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries under the Medicaid drug rebate program. The President's budget proposal aims to address irregularities in how drug manufacturers interpret CMS guidance on calculating Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for Medicaid rebates. Manufacturers sometimes include sales of excluded drugs in their AMP calculation, reducing rebates owed to states. The proposal would require manufacturers to fully compensate states for rebates on improperly reported drugs not covered by Medicaid. The President's budget proposal aims to address irregularities in drug manufacturers' reporting of drug prices for Medicaid rebates. CMS and HHS OIG have authority to monitor and audit manufacturers for accuracy in reporting drug prices. There is variation in methodologies used by manufacturers, impacting the rebates owed to states. CMS conducts data checks on reported prices but does not always verify manufacturers' documentation. The President's budget proposal aims to address irregularities in drug manufacturers' reporting of drug prices for Medicaid rebates. Studies and False Claims Act settlements have shown discrepancies in manufacturers' drug price reporting. The ACA made changes to Medicaid prescription drug pricing policies to create more uniform reporting standards. The proposal includes regular audits and surveys of drug manufacturers to evaluate compliance with rebate agreements and regulations. Medicaid covers drugs approved by the FDA under specific regulations. Manufacturers must list their products with the FDA for reimbursement. Proposed regulatory changes aim to improve drug price reporting for Medicaid rebates. The President's budget proposal requires drug manufacturers to electronically list their products with the FDA for Medicaid coverage. This aligns Medicaid drug coverage requirements with Medicare's. Manufacturers must offer rebates to states selling products to Medicaid programs, with accurate price reporting to CMS for rebate computation. ACA provisions amended the Medicaid drug rebate statute. The ACA amended the Medicaid drug rebate statute, and CMS proposed changes to implement these amendments. Penalties may be imposed on individuals who provide false information in Medicaid drug rebate reporting. The President's budget proposed increasing penalties for drug manufacturers who knowingly report false information. Medicaid and CHIP are jointly funded by the federal government and states. The federal government and states jointly fund Medicaid and CHIP. Federal reimbursement for Medicaid services is provided based on the FMAP rate, with exceptions for certain states and situations. CHIP matching funds are provided at an E-FMAP rate, capped on a state-by-state basis. Federal regulations prohibit using other federal sources for Medicaid funding without authorization. The President's budget proposed increasing penalties for drug manufacturers who provide false information in Medicaid drug rebate reporting. The President's budget proposal would codify the principle that states cannot use federal funds for Medicaid or CHIP without specific authorization. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to review programs for erroneous payments and report estimates to Congress. CMS implemented the Medicaid Payment Error Rate Measurement to estimate improper payments. The President's budget proposal includes a streamlined audit program to consolidate the MEQC and PERM programs for Medicaid and CHIP payments. RACs are authorized to recover improper payments and have expanded nationally to include Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D, as well as Medicaid. The President's budget proposal authorizes further RAC expansion to Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid, with total fee-for-service corrections of $4.2 billion from FY2010 to FY2013. RAC recoupments are returned to the Medicare Trust Fund, but the proposal would allow CMS to retain a portion for corrective actions. HHS OIG has the authority to exclude healthcare providers from federal programs. The President's budget proposal aims to expand HHS OIG exclusion authority to include individuals and entities affiliated with sanctioned entities in federal health programs, closing loopholes that allow evasion of exclusion. This proposal was included in the President's FY2013 budget proposal. The President's FY2013 budget proposal aims to strengthen penalties for distributing Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP beneficiaries' identification or billing privileges. Medicare and Medicaid have limitations on federal coverage for individuals in custody or incarcerated. In Medicaid, federal financial participation is not available for medical services for inmates of public institutions. States are responsible for the care of inmates in non-federal correctional facilities. Federal matching funds are only available for Medicaid services when an inmate becomes an inpatient in a medical facility and is otherwise eligible for Medicaid. The President's budget includes a proposal to increase federal and state access to healthcare. The President's budget proposes increasing access to the Prisoner Update Processing System for federal and state agencies to prevent improper payments to incarcerated individuals. States can apply for waivers under the ACA for health insurance coverage requirements starting in 2017. The Secretaries have the authority to grant state innovation waivers for health insurance coverage under the ACA. The President's budget proposal includes allowing states to apply for state innovation waivers earlier than currently permitted under the ACA. CMS's Program Management account funds Medicare's administrative functions, including program operations, federal administration, survey and certification, research, and state high-risk pools. The Program Management category funds contractor and IT activities for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA implementation. Mandatory program management appropriations were established by ACA, ARRA, MIPPA, and ATRA. The President's FY2014 budget includes reimbursable administration and provisions for new legislative initiatives. The budget proposes a $400 million increase in mandatory funding for Program Management to implement healthcare proposals, aiming to decrease federal expenditures by $393 billion over ten years. The federal government sets quality and safety requirements for Medicare providers and suppliers to participate in the programs. CMS contracts with organizations to conduct inspections and investigate complaints, following federal regulations. State agencies or contractors handle survey activities and policies, including hiring and training surveyors. The Medicare and/or Medicaid programs survey and certify various providers and suppliers, with the number of participating facilities increasing by 4.3% from FY2012 to FY2014. CMS estimated that in FY2014, over 24,000 initial surveys and re-certifications will be completed, along with investigating over 55,000 complaints. All facility providers must undergo initial survey and certification inspections when enrolling in Medicare. CMS plans to introduce inspection requirements for community mental health centers in FY2014. The President's budget proposes new user fees, including a Survey and Certification Revisit Fee and a fee for sharing Medicare data with qualified entities. The Revisit Fee aims to ensure quality of care by revisiting poor performers and would be phased in over time. Fees for expanded data sharing would enable qualified entities to use Medicare data for fraud prevention and care coordination. The FY2013 budget proposal includes provisions for quality and performance measurement duties for a contracted consensus-based entity, as mandated by MIPPA and the ACA. These duties involve priority setting, measure endorsement, maintenance, stakeholder input, and reporting to Congress. The President's budget proposal includes funding for quality and performance measurement duties for a contracted consensus-based entity, as mandated by MIPPA and the ACA. This funding would support MIPPA Section 183 at $10 million per year and ACA Section 3014 at $20 million per year for fiscal years FY2014 through FY2017. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2013 budget. The House and Senate agreed on budget resolutions before the President's budget request. President's budget for Function 550 differs from House and Senate, but Function 570 is similar. House and Senate budget resolutions compared to President's FY2014 budget. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan released FY2014 House budget resolution. Chairman Ryan's budget proposal, outlined in his report, was considered and amended by the House Budget Committee before being voted on and agreed to by the full House. The proposal suggests changes to federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA exchanges, with a focus on repealing certain ACA provisions within a 10-year budget window. The House budget proposal includes Medicaid coverage up to 133% of FPL, restructuring Medicaid to a block grant program, fixing the SGR for Medicare physician rates, repealing the IPAB, and reducing healthcare spending by $2.7 trillion over 10 years. It also plans to increase the age of eligibility for Medicare and convert it to a fixed federal contribution program starting in FY2024. The Senate Budget Committee passed the FY2014 Senate budget resolution titled Foundation for Growth: Restoring the Promise of American Opportunity on March 14, 2013. S.Con.Res. 8 was introduced on March 15, 2013 and passed on March 23, 2013 with a vote of 50-49. The resolution maintains ACA changes, including Medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges. It includes $275 billion in health care savings through delivery system reforms and reducing fraud. It also assumes costs for a permanent fix to the SGR physician payment system. The budget resolution assumes costs for a permanent fix to the SGR physician payment system and eliminates Medicare sequestration cuts. It compares outlays for health care programs in Function 550 and Function 570 across different budget proposals. Function 550 includes Medicaid and other health programs like anti-bioterrorism activities, biomedical research, and health services for under-served populations. The major programs in Function 550 are Medicaid, CHIP, federal and retirees' health benefits, and health care for Medicare-eligible military retirees. Medicaid accounts for the majority of spending in Function 550, with the House resolution proposing significant cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years. The Senate resolution and President's budget have different approaches to Medicaid funding. The curr_chunk discusses legislative proposals impacting the Medicaid program and the Medicare program, which pays for health care services for individuals age 65 or older and certain persons with disabilities. It highlights the mandatory spending for Medicare benefits and the annual appropriation for program administration. Estimated outlays for Medicare from FY2014 through FY2023 under different budgets show minimal differences in funding, with the Senate resolution providing slightly more funding in later years. The President's budget and the Senate resolution assume fixes to the SGR physician payment system and no 2% reduction in Medicare benefit spending under sequestration. The President's budget includes specific legislative proposals to save $371 billion over the next ten years, while the Senate resolution focuses on savings of $265 billion through delivery system changes and efforts to reduce fraud and abuse. The House budget resolution also assumes a fix to the Medicare payment system. The House budget resolution assumes a fix to the SGR physician payment system and a repeal of the IPAB, with a slight decrease in Medicare spending over the next ten years. However, specifics on how spending would be reduced to lower levels were not provided."
