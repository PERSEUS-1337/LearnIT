    "content": "The \"Border Protection Corps Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to border security. The Congress finds that federal authorities lack the manpower and resources to defend the US borders, leading to an increase in dangerous criminals, gang members, drug smugglers, and potential terrorists entering the country illegally. The United States is at war with terrorist criminal organizations and individuals from foreign nations who are committed to destroying the country. Throughout history, citizen volunteers have defended the borders of the United States. The Congress authorizes all able-bodied and eligible US citizens to serve in a militia to defend international borders under the Governors' command due to the threat of terrorist organizations. To defend against future attacks similar to 9/11 and supplement inadequate resources, congressional authority is needed to mobilize the Militia for the common defense of the United States. The program is authorized. The Governor of a State on a border of the United States can establish and lead a militia called the \"Border Protection Corps\" comprised of US citizens without criminal or mental health issues. This militia is tasked with patrolling and defending the state's international border with Canada or Mexico to prevent unauthorized entry into the US. Members work with local law enforcement and the Border Patrol, taking an oath to uphold US and state laws and the Constitution. The Governor of a State can establish a militia called the \"Border Protection Corps\" comprised of US citizens to defend the international borders. Members are authorized to prevent unauthorized entry and detain individuals who have entered unlawfully. All individuals detained under the Border Protection Corps shall be promptly handed over to Federal law enforcement. They will only be released after ensuring they are not violent criminals, terrorists, or potential terrorists, and will be removed to their country of entry if cleared. SEC. 4. FUNDING. Any State calling forth citizens into militia service to patrol and defend US borders will be reimbursed for costs by the Secretary of Homeland Security, including expenses for calling up citizens, equipping and training the militia, paying overtime to law enforcement officers, and detaining individuals who enter the US unlawfully. Reimbursement for State militia expenses related to border protection will be made from the Border Protection Corps Establishment and Operation Account. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer unexpended Homeland Security funds to this account for the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out the reimbursement. Unexpended Homeland Security funds from the fiscal year, available until expended by law, and remaining unspent for 2 years or more, will be transferred to the Border Protection Corps Establishment and Operation Account for State militia expenses related to border protection reimbursement. The Border Protection Corps established under this Act is considered a defense force authorized by section 109(c) of title 32, United States Code. Regulations will also be implemented. The Secretary of Homeland Security will issue regulations for distributing funds for costs incurred by states and the Border Protection Corps under this Act. The regulations will provide uniform standards for implementing the Act by federal law enforcement authorities. The Act takes effect immediately upon enactment, and regulations are not required for the deployment of the Border Protection Corps or the work of local and state law enforcement authorities. Expenses incurred prior to the promulgation of regulations are authorized by the Act. Expenses incurred by states and the Border Protection Corps before regulations are eligible for reimbursement under this Act. The term \"State\" in this Act refers to any U.S. state bordering Canada or Mexico."
