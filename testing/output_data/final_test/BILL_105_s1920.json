The Act known as the \"Federal Oil and Gas Lease Management Improvement Act of 1998\" recognizes the successful history of State regulation in the oil and gas industry, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of State governments in regulating operations on Federal lands. The Federal Oil and Gas Lease Management Improvement Act of 1998 acknowledges the cost-effectiveness of State regulation in the oil and gas industry on Federal lands. It suggests that significant cost savings could be achieved by having the Federal Government defer to State regulation of oil and gas lease operations on Federal lands, eliminating duplicative oversight and streamlining regulatory processes. The Federal Oil and Gas Lease Management Improvement Act of 1998 recognizes the efficiency of State regulation in the oil and gas industry on Federal lands. It proposes transferring responsibility to the States to eliminate conflicts of interest and streamline regulatory processes. The Act aims to promote private sector enterprise in developing domestic mineral industries, including oil and gas resources, while ensuring the orderly and economic development of mineral resources. Management analyses and surveys under conservation laws benefit the public and should be borne by the Federal Government. The Federal Oil and Gas Lease Management Improvement Act of 1998 proposes transferring authority to regulate oil and gas operations on leased tracts from the Bureau of Land Management to States. This transfer aims to streamline regulatory processes, share cost savings with State governments, prevent delays and recoupments for Federal oil and gas lessees, and ensure funds deducted from States' net receipt share are tied to administrative costs related to oil and gas on Federal lands. The Federal Oil and Gas Lease Management Improvement Act of 1998 proposes transferring authority to regulate oil and gas operations on leased tracts from the Bureau of Land Management to States in order to streamline regulatory processes, share cost savings with State governments, prevent delays and recoupments for Federal oil and gas lessees, and ensure funds deducted from States' net receipt share are tied to administrative costs related to oil and gas on Federal lands. The term \"Federal lands\" in the Act refers to all lands owned by the United States subject to mineral leasing laws, excluding Indian lands and submerged lands on the Outer Continental Shelf. The term \"oil and gas conservation authority\" refers to State agencies responsible for regulating oil and gas operations for conservation purposes. Federal lands subject to section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act are considered part of the state sharing revenues. This Act does not grant states property rights in Federal leases or land. No sooner than 6 months after enactment, a State may notify the Secretary of the Interior to regulate oil and gas operations on Federal lands. Authority includes processing permits, production operations, well testing, completion, spacing, communization, well abandonment, and inspections. Following the transfer of authority, the Bureau of Land Management will no longer charge the State for well abandonment procedures, inspections, enforcement activities, and site security. The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service will still oversee lease issuance and surface use plans, ensuring timely decisions are made considering various factors. Following the transfer of authority, Federal agencies will no longer have control over oil and gas lease operations on Federal lands. States will enforce their own laws and regulations regarding these operations, with consideration for national interests and conservation principles. The Bureau of Land Management can still enforce actions for past offenses until resolved, and pending applications for operations on federal lands will continue. Pending applications on federal lands will be transferred to state oil and gas conservation authorities for processing according to state laws and regulations. TITLE II--USE OF COST SAVINGS FROM STATE REGULATION\n\nThis section focuses on the utilization of cost savings from state regulation. Sec. 201 states that the Secretary of the Interior will compensate States for costs incurred in carrying out transferred authorities. Payment will be made quarterly, not exceeding 50% of the Bureau of Land Management's allocated cost for the State. The maximum compensation level will be adjusted every two years based on the Consumer Price Index. The Secretary will not include costs for preparing resource management planning documents and analyses for areas where oil and gas leasing is excluded or not the primary activity for calculating deductions. TITLE III--STREAMLINING AND COST REDUCTION: The Secretary will not include costs for preparing resource management planning documents and analyses for areas where oil and gas leasing is excluded or not the primary activity for calculating deductions. Sec. 301 prohibits the Department of the Interior from recovering costs for oil and gas lease-related documents. The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service must complete planning documents within 90 days of receiving an offer, or offer the applicant the opportunity to prepare it at the agency's expense. The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service must ensure timely decisions on oil and gas leasing and operations on federal lands. Offers to lease must be accepted or rejected within 90 days, otherwise deemed accepted. Applications for Permit to Drill must be approved or disapproved within 30 days, otherwise deemed approved. Surface use plans must be approved or disapproved within 30 days. The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service must ensure timely decisions on oil and gas leasing and operations on federal lands. Offers to lease must be accepted or rejected within 90 days, otherwise deemed accepted. Applications for Permit to Drill must be approved or disapproved within 30 days, otherwise deemed approved. Surface use plans must be approved or disapproved within 30 days. Federal oil and gas lessees or operators have two years for the Department or Service to issue a final decision on an administrative appeal. Unwarranted denials, stays of lease issuance, and restrictions on lease operations must be eliminated. Lands designated for multiple use under resource management plans shall be available for oil and gas leasing. The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service must ensure timely decisions on oil and gas leasing and operations on federal lands. More stringent lease stipulations can only be imposed with a written explanation. Rejections of lease offers must be explained in writing. The agency must provide a detailed explanation for rejecting lease offers or requiring modifications to surface use plans. A decision on oil and gas leases by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service is effective pending administrative appeal. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will submit a report to Congress on eliminating overlapping jurisdiction and making policy changes. The Secretary of the Interior will also publish a national inventory by March 31, 1999. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will publish a national inventory in the Federal Register by March 31, 1999, detailing oil and gas reserves on Federal lands available for leasing and development. Public comments on the inventory will be accepted until September 30, 1999. By September 30, 1999, public comments on the inventory of oil and gas reserves on Federal lands will be filed. The Secretary of the Interior will invite comments on the impact of Bureau of Land Management decisions on oil and gas development. By March 31, 2000, a report will be submitted to Congress outlining steps to increase lands open for oil and gas resource development."
