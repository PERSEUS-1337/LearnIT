There are around ten to twelve million unlawfully present aliens in the country, with about 80% having been here for over ten years. The issue of legalizing or providing relief to these individuals is a frequent topic of discussion. The debate over legalizing unlawfully present aliens in the US is a common topic in Congress, often referred to as the \"third leg of the stool\" in immigration reform. Various proposals aim to offer pathways to lawful permanent residence for these individuals, following models like the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Some bills focus on specific groups, such as childhood arrivals under the Dream Act proposals. The legislative proposals aim to provide relief to unlawfully present childhood arrivals by offering ad hoc legalization measures. These measures would not change the generally applicable law concerning legalization for future childhood arrivals. The current law under the INA allows for limited circumstances where unlawfully present aliens can obtain legal immigration status to prevent removal. The report explains the narrow circumstances in which unlawfully present aliens can legalize under current law, focusing on acquisition of lawful immigration status to prevent removal. It excludes other issues and statutory provisions that also apply to lawfully present aliens. The INA takes three primary approaches to regulating the unlawfully present population: removal, deterrence, and legalization. Unlawfully present aliens can be subject to removal indefinitely under U.S. immigration law, even after many years in the country, regardless of other offenses committed. The federal government lacks resources to remove all unlawfully present aliens, leading to an enforcement gap. Executive branch administrations prioritize removal of aliens who have committed crimes. The INA aims to deter the arrival or continued presence of unlawfully present aliens by criminalizing some immigration violations. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) criminalizes immigration violations and bars aliens without lawful status from working or receiving federal benefits. It renders aliens who commit violations inadmissible for a specified time or for life. Opportunities for legalization exist for unlawfully present aliens through limited avenues in the INA. Unlawfully present aliens can legalize through adjustment of status if they marry a U.S. citizen or face specific hardships like persecution or extreme hardship to family members. Otherwise, they may need to leave the country and apply for an immigrant visa, but prior unlawful presence can result in a ten-year bar from reentry. Under current law, unlawfully present aliens in the United States face difficulties in obtaining legal immigration status, making them ineligible to return for ten years. U.S. immigration law developed its stance towards this population in the mid-twentieth century, strengthening removal statutes and rendering the primary legalization statute obsolete. Illegal immigration became a significant issue in the U.S. with the introduction of immigration restrictions in the 1920s. The U.S. immigration law evolved over time with the imposition of various restrictions, starting from state laws targeting convicts, paupers, and those with contagious diseases. The Page Act of 1875 imposed federal restrictions on convicts and prostitutes, followed by qualitative restrictions on Chinese laborers and aliens likely to become public charges. Numerical restrictions were introduced in 1921 with the Emergency Quota Act, and a more restrictive system of national origins quotas was established in the Immigration Act of 1924. Numerical limitations have been a constant feature of U.S. immigration law since then. The Immigration Act of 1924 established a permanent quota system and allowed for the deportation of aliens who entered or remained in the country in violation of its restrictions at any time. This marked a significant change from earlier deportation statutes that had limitations periods for removal of illegal entrants. The 1924 Act eliminated limitations on deportation for violating immigration statutes. A registry mechanism was developed for unlawfully present aliens to legalize their status based on long-standing presence. The registry statute allowed immigration officials to grant lawful permanent residence to eligible aliens who entered before a specified date, demonstrated good moral character, and met other criteria. Unlawful presence was not a barrier to registry. The registry statute allowed unlawfully present aliens to legalize their status based on long-standing presence before specific cutoff dates. Congress changed the cutoff dates over the years, with the current date set at 1972 under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. About 200,000 aliens legalized through registry between 1929 and 1945. The registry statute, with a cutoff date of 1972, remains mostly obsolete. Few unlawfully present aliens qualify for legalization through registry due to the distant cutoff date. In 2004, only 205 aliens became LPRs through registry. The INA governs the disqualification of aliens based on unlawful presence for obtaining LPR status through family relationships or other grounds. With the registry statute obsolete, federal law no longer supports this legalization mechanism. The INA allocates immigrant visas to family-based, employment-based, and diversity-based immigrants. Family-based immigrants make up two-thirds of permanent immigration to the US each year, while employment-based immigrants account for about 12%, and diversity-based immigrants for about 4%. Unlawfully present aliens may qualify for immigration through these categories, such as by marrying a US citizen or having a US citizen child. The law imposes obstacles for aliens living in the US in violation of the INA to obtain LPR status, requiring most to apply for an immigrant visa at a US consulate abroad. Exceptions exist for some unlawfully present aliens to adjust their status from within the US, such as those who overstay a nonimmigrant visa. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) creates challenges for unlawfully present aliens in the US seeking Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) status. Most must leave the US to apply for an immigrant visa at a consulate abroad, facing a three or ten-year bar on readmission. Exceptions exist for those who overstay a nonimmigrant visa and marry a US citizen. The Immigration and Nationality Act poses challenges for unlawfully present aliens in the US seeking Legal Permanent Resident status. Most must leave the US to apply for an immigrant visa abroad, facing three or ten-year bars on readmission. Advance parole can help some become eligible to adjust status without facing these bars. Adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245 allows eligible aliens in the US to acquire LPR status without leaving the country. This mechanism was not part of federal immigration statute until 1952, leading to creative administrative solutions for those seeking LPR status before that time. In 1945, President Truman exempted about 1,000 displaced persons from an exit-to-enter procedure to apply for visas at the U.S. embassy in Canada. The adjustment of status statute was enacted seven years later, requiring aliens to have been inspected and admitted into the U.S. and maintained lawful status to adjust to LPR status within the country. Aliens who entered the United States surreptitiously generally cannot adjust status due to not being \"inspected and admitted\" or \"paroled\" into the country, and failing to maintain lawful status. Exceptions exist, including for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and under certain statutory provisions like INA \u00a7 245(i). Under current law, aliens generally may adjust status only if they meet the lawful entry and maintenance of status requirements or fall within an exception to those requirements. Exceptions to the lawful entry requirement exist for victims of domestic violence and certain statutorily defined \"special immigrants.\" Exceptions to the lawful entry requirement exist for victims of domestic violence, special immigrants, and aliens who meet specific criteria. In some cases, federal courts have allowed aliens with Temporary Protected Status to adjust status despite unlawful entry. Immigration parole from DHS can also enable surreptitious entrants to adjust status. A grant of parole can serve as a workaround for the barrier that unlawful entry typically presents to adjusting status. DHS grants parole to aliens not yet on U.S. territory, including unlawfully present aliens, through \"parole in place\" or \"advance parole.\" Both forms of parole satisfy the lawful entry requirement for adjustment of status. Parole in place and advance parole are forms of relief granted by DHS to aliens, including those unlawfully present. Eligibility criteria are set internally, with parole in place granted sparingly to immediate relatives of U.S. armed forces members. The primary purpose of parole in place is to help recipients adjust status, while advance parole is available to unlawfully present individuals. Advance parole is granted by DHS to unlawfully present aliens for various discretionary reprieves, such as TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure. It allows travel for specific purposes like visiting ill family members or attending funerals. While not granted specifically for adjusting status, it can facilitate this process. Leaving and reentering the US with advance parole avoids the three- or ten-year bar for unlawful presence. The controversy surrounding advance parole for unlawfully present aliens has sparked debate in the immigration community. Some criticize it as a loophole that undermines enforcement of statutory bars for unlawful presence, while others advocate for its expansion to provide a path to legalization for many in this population. Multiple federal appellate courts have struck down regulations limiting parolees' eligibility for adjustment of status, highlighting the ongoing tension in this issue. The INA \u00a7 245(c)(2) generally bars unlawfully present aliens from adjusting status, even if they satisfy the lawful entry requirement, due to their lack of lawful immigration status. Exceptions exist for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Exceptions to the bar on adjustment of status for unlawfully present aliens include those who marry a U.S. citizen, certain domestic violence victims, \"special immigrants,\" employment-based visa applicants with short lapses in status, and those meeting the April 30, 2001 cutoff date. However, many unlawfully present aliens cannot adjust status based on family relationships due to statutory requirements, requiring them to leave the U.S. and apply for an immigrant visa. Unlawfully present aliens may pursue LPR status by leaving the country and applying for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. However, they face a significant obstacle as their departure triggers a three-year or ten-year unlawful presence bar. A discretionary waiver of these bars is only available to spouses or children of U.S. citizens or LPRs, with extreme hardship to their U.S. citizen or LPR parent or spouse being a requirement for the waiver. Unlawfully present aliens can apply for discretionary waivers to overcome the three-year or ten-year unlawful presence bar, with extreme hardship to their U.S. citizen or LPR parent or spouse being a requirement. The provisional waiver program allows them to apply for waivers from within the United States before departing for visa interviews abroad, reducing uncertainty about how long they must stay outside the country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began pre-examining unlawfully present aliens in 1935 before channeling them into immigrant visa application procedures in Canada. Hypothetical scenarios demonstrate how INA provisions work in practice, allowing aliens to adjust to LPR status even after overstaying their visa for ten years. The alien, who has been out of legal status for ten years, may be eligible to adjust to LPR status. However, if they entered the United States surreptitiously, they may not be eligible to adjust status and must apply for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad, facing a ten-year unlawful presence bar upon departure. When a U.S. citizen daughter turns twenty-one, she can obtain an approved immigrant visa petition for her mother. If the mother is not eligible to adjust status due to unlawful entry, she must apply for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad, facing a ten-year unlawful presence bar upon departure. If the daughter is in the military, the mother may qualify for parole in place, making her eligible to adjust status without facing the unlawful presence bar. The alien marries a U.S. citizen and obtains an approved immigrant visa petition. He is not eligible to adjust status due to unlawful entry and must apply for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. To avoid the ten-year unlawful presence bar, he may apply for a provisional waiver showing \"extreme hardship\" to his spouse. If granted advance parole after receiving DACA, he can adjust status upon reentry to the U.S. without facing the unlawful presence bar. INA's cancellation of removal provision allows immigration judges to grant LPR status to certain unlawfully present aliens in removal proceedings who have lived in the U.S. for at least ten years. To qualify, they must demonstrate that their removal would cause \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" to immediate relatives who are U.S. citizens or LPRs. This relief option dates back to 1935 when a two-step procedure was implemented to grant relief from deportation in hardship cases. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 replaced \"suspension of deportation\" with \"cancellation of removal,\" a more restrictive form of relief with higher qualifying hardship criteria. One form of cancellation of removal exists for LPRs and another for non-LPRs, including unlawfully present aliens who must demonstrate exceptional hardship to qualify. Cancellation of removal is a form of relief for non-LPRs, requiring a showing of \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" to immediate relatives. This hardship must be substantially beyond ordinary expectations, such as a U.S. citizen child with a serious medical condition facing separation or lack of medical treatment. Good moral character and no certain criminal convictions are also necessary. Immigration judges have discretion to deny relief, with a cap of 4,000 cancellations for non-LPRs under the INA. Cancellation of removal is a form of relief for non-LPRs, with a cap of 4,000 per year. Immigration judges can grant the application but must wait for cap spaces to be available if reached. It is only available as a defense in removal proceedings, leading to LPR status for the alien if granted. The annual cap and limitations on applying for cancellation of removal sharply restrict its availability. Some aliens proactively trigger removal proceedings by prompting DHS through special requests or filing an affirmative asylum application, which can have pitfalls as it may lead to removal or dismissal by immigration judges. Asylum application with the USCIS seeks cancellation of removal in Immigration Court. Asylum, withholding of removal, and U visa offer relief to unlawfully present aliens facing persecution or torture. Asylum provides a pathway to LPR status and citizenship for those who have suffered persecution or fear it in their country of origin. The general eligibility criteria for asylum include persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. Aliens who have persecuted others or committed serious crimes are not eligible. Asylum is a remedy for aliens in the United States facing persecution, not specifically for the unlawfully present population. Lawful entry is not required for asylum, and periods of unlawful presence do not affect eligibility. Asylum eligibility is not dependent on lawful entry or presence in the United States. Unlawfully present aliens who have suffered persecution can apply for asylum within one year of arrival to seek LPR status. Time restrictions apply to asylum applications, which can be done affirmatively or defensively in removal proceedings. Asylum is a secure form of relief for unlawfully present aliens in the United States, offering protection from removal and allowing for work authorization. Asylees have a direct pathway to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status and eventual citizenship. Those who do not qualify for asylum may be eligible for withholding of removal, which prevents deportation to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened based on specific criteria. Withholding of removal and CAT protection do not lead to LPR status like asylum does, but they provide a defense against removal and work authorization. They have a stricter burden of proof and are mandatory forms of relief. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes DHS to grant special nonimmigrant statuses to unlawfully present aliens who are victims or witnesses of certain crimes and provide assistance to law enforcement. This includes U visa status for victims of crimes like rape and domestic violence, T visa status for victims of sex trafficking, and nonimmigrant statuses for those willing to provide assistance. These forms of relief do not have one-year application deadlines and are mandatory. Unlawfully present aliens may qualify for special nonimmigrant statuses such as U visa for crime victims, T visa for sex trafficking victims, and S visa for providing critical information about criminal or terrorist organizations. Caps limit the number of U visas to 10,000, T visas to 5,000, and S visas to 250 per year. Recipients can adjust to lawful permanent resident status if they meet specific requirements. U visa status is the most sought after and has faced litigation. DHS has consistently reached the 10,000 U visa cap since 2010, with a backlog of 234,114 pending applications as of FY2019. The U visa program has a backlog of 234,114 pending applications, with applicants waiting an average of four years for eligibility vetting. Other methods besides INA legalization provisions, such as ad hoc laws and discretionary reprieves like deferred action, have been used to confer legal status or protection from removal on certain unlawfully present individuals. In the second half of the twentieth century, Congress enacted a major one-time legalization program known as the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, offering LPR status to aliens without legal status since 1982 or those who did agricultural work for at least ninety days between May 1985 and May 1986. The rationale behind these measures was to deter future illegal immigration. Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 to offer LPR status to certain aliens, aiming to deter future illegal immigration. Other laws targeted specific nationalities for special legalization mechanisms, such as the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 and the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992. In the 21st century, proposed legalization legislation has focused on offering relief to specific groups of aliens who were unlawfully present in the United States during a specified time period or who fit within narrowly defined criteria. For example, the Dream Act proposals aim to provide a pathway to Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) status for undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children, covering those who entered before a certain date and have resided in the country. In recent decades, proposed legalization legislation has focused on providing relief to specific groups of unlawfully present aliens in the United States during a specified time period. This includes the Dream Act proposals for undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children. Other bills have also aimed to provide relief to certain agricultural workers and recipients of TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure. In recent decades, immigration authorities have granted temporary reprieves to unlawfully present aliens through programs like deferred action, DACA, and TPS. These discretionary reprieves have become a significant aspect of regulating the unlawfully present population. The enactment of the TPS statute in 1990 and the implementation of the DACA program in 2012 have increased the number of aliens receiving these reprieves. Together, TPS and DACA cover a significant number of unlawfully present individuals. The discretionary reprieves granted to unlawfully present aliens through programs like DACA and TPS do not provide permanent protection from removal but offer benefits such as work authorization. While these reprieves do not eliminate the basis for removal under the INA, they do provide assurance from DHS that imminent removal is not imminent. Discretionary reprieves like DACA and TPS offer temporary protection, including work authorization and nonaccrual of unlawful presence. Legal scholars use terms like \"quasi-legal status\" to describe this relief. The INA lacks pathways for many unlawfully present aliens to obtain lawful status based on long-standing presence. Political views on legalization vary, with some advocating for expanded pathways and others seeking to restrict them. The INA's penalties for unlawful entry and presence make it hard for unlawfully present aliens to gain legal status based on family ties. Legalization on hardship grounds is limited to extreme cases for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or LPRs. Humanitarian relief options like asylum and the U visa program have specific criteria. Discretionary reprieves and quasi-legal status are significant in the U.S. immigration system."
