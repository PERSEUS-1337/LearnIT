The AIIB was formally established on December 25, 2015, with 52 members including four G-7 economies. The Bank's purpose is to foster sustainable economic development in Asia by investing in infrastructure and other productive sectors. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was established in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping to promote economic integration in Asia. Some question China's motives, suggesting it aims to create an alternative to the World Bank and the ADB. The emergence of Chinese-led regional economic institutions, like the AIIB, raises concerns for the United States due to its limited influence in these alternatives. The AIIB was created in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping to promote economic integration in Asia. Some view it as a challenge to U.S. leadership in established multilateral bodies. Analysts suggest the U.S. should focus on reforming existing institutions rather than joining the AIIB dominated by China. This shift in Chinese economic policy began under Xi Jinping's leadership in 2012. Since Xi Jinping became Chinese Communist Party General Secretary in 2012 and president in 2013, he has pursued an ambitious foreign policy agenda to deepen economic, security, and political ties with neighboring countries. President Xi aims to leverage China's economic power to build a network of new institutions and projects to strengthen relationships in Eurasia, the South Pacific, and Eastern Africa. The \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative has been the centerpiece of Chinese foreign economic policy since 2013. The China International Trade Institute identified 65 countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to boost economic linkages through trade promotion and infrastructure development. China is investing in institutions like the AIIB, Silk Road Fund, and New Development Bank to influence regional trade and investment relations. AIIB's financing of OBOR may reinforce China as a regional infrastructure hub, shaping regional economies. China's infrastructure hub status through OBOR may lead regional economies to prioritize trade with China over other economies. China is also reforming international financial institutions to accommodate its increased economic influence globally, despite feeling underrepresented. China's creation of the AIIB was linked to the delay in U.S. approval of IMF governance reforms, which increased China's financial contributions and voting power. The delay in IMF quota reform contributed to a narrative that China was taking advantage of slow progress in reforming international financial institutions to build support for the AIIB. Many countries have significant infrastructure needs. Many countries have substantial infrastructure needs, with developing countries requiring annual investments of $819 billion to prevent a decrease in economic growth. South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific account for 63% of the needed investment. MDBs are major providers of development support for infrastructure financing, although their financing has declined in recent decades. Infrastructure support has declined in recent decades, with the World Bank being the largest provider in 2013. China has funded large-scale projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, often criticized for lack of social and environmental standards. Critics argue that Chinese assistance undermines efforts to promote good governance and democracy in developing countries. China's development assistance and establishment of the AIIB are seen as self-serving to enhance its influence. The AIIB, established by China, is seen as a self-serving move to enhance its influence in Asia and Africa. Efforts to address the infrastructure gap in Asia include the creation of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund and the World Bank's Global Infrastructure Facility. The AIIB, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, was established to facilitate infrastructure PPPs and mobilize private sector investments. Despite initial opposition from the US, 21 regional countries signed an MOU in 2014 to set up the bank. The AIIB, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aimed to facilitate infrastructure PPPs and attract private sector investments. In early 2015, the UK and other European countries sought membership in the AIIB, leading the Obama Administration to soften its criticism and encourage collaboration with other MDBs. By March 2017, the AIIB had 52 members, including European and advanced economies. Chinese officials distanced the AIIB from China's OBOR initiative as membership expanded. The AIIB, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aimed to facilitate infrastructure PPPs and attract private sector investments. Chinese officials distanced the AIIB from China's OBOR initiative as membership expanded, clarifying that while the Bank would support OBOR projects, it was not created exclusively for this initiative. President Xi stated that the AIIB would finance infrastructure projects in all emerging market economies, not just those belonging to the Belt and Road initiative. The AIIB, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aimed to facilitate infrastructure PPPs and attract private sector investments. China has differentiated AIIB projects from other foreign assistance by co-financing with MDBs, ensuring conformity to international standards and avoiding being solely a tool of Chinese foreign policy. The AIIB complements existing MDBs, relies on partners for expertise, and largely overlaps with the geographic area of the OBOR initiative. The AIIB, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to facilitate infrastructure PPPs and attract private sector investments. The AIIB allows for non-sovereign entities to apply for membership, with over half of the ADB members already joining. China's goal of establishing an independent and high-standard MDB may conflict with its economic and national security priorities in the region. Membership in the AIIB is open to all members of the World Bank or the ADB, with potentially 57 permanent founding members. The AIIB has attracted many European ADB members, with only Belgium and Ireland not joining yet. Approximately 25 more countries are expected to join in 2017. Japan is cautious about membership until the AIIB proves adherence to international standards. Canada applied for membership in 2016. The AIIB's governance structure differs from other MDBs, giving more decision-making authority to regional countries and China. The AIIB's governance structure differs from other MDBs, giving more decision-making authority to regional countries and China. The board of governors is the highest decision-making body, responsible for major decisions like changes in membership and electing the president. The executive board, comprising nine regional and three non-regional members, manages day-to-day activities. The AIIB's board comprises nine regional and three non-regional members elected by members. Projects are approved by the board, but delegation of authority to the president may be considered. China holds the largest voting share at 28%, based on a weighted voting system in the Articles of Agreement. The voting shares at the AIIB show a significant disparity, with China holding 28%, over 350% more than India's 8%. The executive board's composition and voting process are illustrated in Figure 3, where a majority vote can be achieved with as few as four members voting in favor due to China's large share. The Articles of Agreement for the AIIB require a super majority or special majority of the Board of Governors for key decisions. China, with over a quarter of the votes, has an effective veto power. This is similar to the United States' veto power in other international financial institutions. China's political influence in the AIIB is evident in decisions like rejecting Taiwan's membership, despite Taiwan being a full ADB member. The AIIB's articles allow any full ADB member to join, including Taiwan as \"Taipei, China.\" China rejected Taiwan's application as a founding member, suggesting Taiwan apply as a regular member through China's Ministry of Finance. Taiwan decided not to seek AIIB membership in 2016, citing the need for equality and dignity. The Asia Pacific chief economist of IHS Global Insight stated that China's unilateral decision on Taiwan's AIIB membership shows China's dominance in decision-making. The AIIB's nonresident board of directors meets infrequently, leading to concerns about its ability to focus on strategic decisions. Critics argue that resident executive boards at other MDBs are costly to maintain. The AIIB's resident boards are seen as essential for proper shareholder oversight, ensuring transparency and accountability. Without a permanent board, the bank's ability to guarantee taxpayers' interests is diminished. Jin Liqun of China was elected AIIB president for a five-year term in January 2016. Interim Secretariat (MIS) is responsible for preparing frameworks for AIIB establishment. President Jin has a background in finance and government roles. AIIB's senior management includes five vice presidents and a general counsel from member countries. Regional members will hold the majority of the Bank's capital stock. The AIIB, like other development banks, has an initial subscribed capital of $100 billion, with $89 billion subscribed by the end of 2016. Shareholders contribute through paid-in capital and callable capital, with the AIIB having a higher share of paid-in capital compared to the World Bank. Callable capital serves as a backup for borrowing but cannot be used for loans. The AIIB has a much higher share of paid-in capital compared to other MDBs, with $19.6 billion out of $20 billion already committed. This allows for quick lending ramp-up, potentially reaching a portfolio of $120 billion by 2025, larger than any other regional MDBs. The AIIB aims to have a portfolio of $120 billion by 2025, surpassing other regional MDBs. It emphasizes being \"lean, clean, and green\" with efficient management, ethical practices, and environmental respect. Concerns remain about its environmental and social safeguards, with Members of Congress advocating for strong policies. The AIIB aims to have a $120 billion portfolio by 2025, surpassing other regional MDBs. Concerns about its environmental and social safeguards persist, with Members of Congress pushing for strong policies. Reforms have reduced the negative impact of MDB projects on local communities and limited funding for carbon-intensive energy projects. Many developing countries are avoiding MDB financing for large infrastructure projects due to safeguards policies. The AIIB's performance standards are still being assessed, with co-financed projects required to adhere to partner agency safeguards. The AIIB aims to have a $120 billion portfolio by 2025, surpassing other regional MDBs. Concerns about its environmental and social safeguards persist, with Members of Congress pushing for strong policies. The AIIB has published operational policies, including an Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and policies on procurement and preventing corrupt practices. China is expected to follow best practices at the AIIB to avoid reputational damage. The AIIB's ESF was approved in February 2016, with the possibility for updates after the first three years of operations. The AIIB's Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) has received mixed reviews, with some praising its commitments to transparency and public participation, while others criticize its reliance on corporate and country systems, lack of detail on oversight mechanisms, omission of coal from exclusion lists, and lack of mandatory impact assessments for certain projects. The AIIB's operations are aligned with international agreements on sustainable development. Recipients of AIIB financing include member countries and agencies in member territories. The AIIB has partnerships with the World Bank, ADB, EBRD, and EIB. Nine projects worth $1.7 billion have been approved by the AIIB. The AIIB has approved nine projects worth $1.7 billion, with most being co-financed with established MDBs. Procurement information for these projects is currently unavailable, and it is uncertain if details on winning firms and procurement will be made public. AIIB officials anticipate lending program growth to $1.5-$2.5 billion in 2017 and $2.5-$3.5 billion in 2018. Despite distancing from China's OBOR initiative, many approved projects align closely with it. Future projects include those in Azerbaijan, Georgia, India, Indonesia, and Oman. Denmark and the United Kingdom have requested AIIB lending to be included in OECD's Official Development Assistance statistics. The OECD is considering including AIIB lending in its Official Development Assistance statistics, with some observers criticizing the U.S. approach towards the AIIB. The Center for Strategic & International Studies recommends U.S. participation in the AIIB to signal support for regional economic architecture. The Institute for the Analysis of Global Security suggests the U.S. should consider joining the AIIB due to its transparency and credibility. This move would encourage private sector investment in AIIB-co-financed projects. The Obama Administration's focus on AIIB transparency and best practices was praised by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew for pushing China to adopt high standards at the AIIB. China's efforts to integrate AIIB financing into the existing development system were commended. The AIIB has adopted operating rules aligned with multilateral institutions' norms. Analysts suggest the U.S. should consider joining the AIIB, with David Dollar advocating for U.S. membership as a \"good investment.\" The establishment of AIIB raises political and economic issues for Congress as it considers potential U.S. involvement with the Bank. Congress influences MDB policy through authorizations, appropriations, oversight, and funding control. Hearings and reports are used to gather information and address pressing concerns. The AIIB raises political and economic issues for Congress as it considers U.S. involvement. Congress influences MDB policy through authorizations, oversight, and funding control. Members may monitor AIIB projects to assess China's regional priorities. Chinese officials view economic development in the region as a way to prevent regional instability and strengthen political and economic ties with Beijing. The AIIB's financing for regional infrastructure and trade relations could impact Asian trade dynamics and help absorb China's manufacturing overcapacity. The potential security implications of increased economic linkages between China and countries in Central and South Asia should also be considered. China's efforts with the AIIB raise questions about its relationship with existing MDBs, as it continues to borrow large volumes for infrastructure projects while also supporting its own national development banks. Members of Congress could explore ways to engage with the AIIB beyond co-financing projects with U.S.-led institutions like the World Bank and ADB. Members of Congress could recommend pursuing membership in the AIIB or exploring ways to influence its activities. One option to enhance U.S. cooperation with the AIIB is to grant diplomatic privileges and immunities to AIIB personnel, as international organizations play a crucial role in multilateral relations. The Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA) provides privileges and immunities for international organizations designated by the President, such as immunity from suit for official acts and tax benefits. The United States is not a member of some international organizations like the African Union, but diplomatic immunities were extended to the African Union Mission in 2007. Some argue for focusing on increasing the attractiveness of the World Bank and other MDBs where the U.S. is a dominant member. Members may want to consider greater representation by developing countries in institutions and innovative financing mechanisms like the World Bank's Program-for-Results. The current environment for development finance offers a variety of new donors and funds, raising questions about the continued preference for MDBs in providing official development assistance. Consideration should also be given to potential duplication of efforts across MDBs and the role of private investment. Some U.S. officials have concerns about the AIIB's operational aspects, China's influence, and its independence from Chinese leaders. China's previous infrastructure projects in Asia lacked social and environmental standards. Developing countries may prefer AIIB over World Bank or ADB loans due to fewer safeguards and conditions. The AIIB's safeguards policies are largely drawn from other MDBs and have been well received. It is too early to evaluate the AIIB's compliance with its policies as most projects are co-financed with established MDBs. Concerns include the potential impact on U.S. firms if the AIIB promotes China-focused standards. Members of Congress may want to monitor procurement contracting for AIIB projects. The AIIB has issued procurement policies and guidelines, but it is uncertain if firms from non-member countries will be considered for bidding on projects. The extent of U.S. firms' participation in AIIB projects remains unclear, raising concerns about fair bidding and transparency. It is too early to assess the AIIB's commitment to open procurement practices."
