    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Standardized School Report Card Act\". Congress finds that the content of school report cards varies widely, with most not providing parents with necessary information for comparison. Taxpayers believe that publishing school information would motivate educators to improve, yet many have not seen report cards for their area schools. Dissemination of understandable school information is crucial for parents and taxpayers to assess school quality and hold them accountable for performance improvement. The Act aims to provide clear school report cards for parents, taxpayers, and educators, with definitions aligned with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Each State educational agency must create and distribute an annual report card for elementary and secondary schools, including student performance on assessments in various subjects, comparisons with other districts, and trends in student achievement over three years. The annual report card for schools must include data on student performance levels, attendance rates, graduation rates, advanced placement course completion, dropout rates, teacher qualifications, and average class sizes. The annual report card for schools should also cover school safety, parental involvement, student access to technology, and average class sizes. The school report card must include information on student performance in language arts, mathematics, and history, as well as other subject areas required by the state. It should also cover school safety, parental involvement, student access to technology, and average class sizes. The school report card must include student performance in various subjects, comparisons with other students, trends in performance levels, attendance rates, graduation rates, advanced placement course completion, and dropout rates. The school report card also includes information on the professional qualifications of teachers, average class size, school safety, and parental involvement. The model school report card includes parental involvement, student access to technology, school improvement status, and other indicators of school performance and quality. The Secretary of Education will develop a model school report card for dissemination upon request. The State educational agency or school must disaggregate student data in annual report cards as required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. State report cards must be distributed to schools, educational agencies, and the public through various means. The Secretary of Education awards grants to States with State report cards meeting requirements to publish annual report cards for schools receiving funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The report cards are disseminated to schools, parents, and the public through various means. The Secretary of Education reserves a portion of the amount appropriated under subsection (j) for payments to the Secretary of the Interior and outlying areas based on their needs for assistance under the Act. The Secretary of Education reserves a portion of the amount appropriated under subsection (j) for payments to the Secretary of the Interior and outlying areas based on their needs for assistance under this Act. State allotments are then determined based on the number of public school students enrolled in each State. Each State educational agency receiving a grant must allocate the funds accordingly. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under subsection (f) must allocate remaining funds to local educational agencies. States can reserve up to 10% of funds for activities in subsections (a) and (b), and subsection (e)(1) for fiscal year 2002, and up to 5% for fiscal year 2003 and the following years. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional appropriations for the next 4 fiscal years."
