    "content": "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 exempted critical infrastructure information from the Freedom of Information Act. The House and Senate versions of the Act had different language, with the final version including the House language. This report discusses the differences in language and arguments from both supporters and critics of the exemption. Critical infrastructure includes activities like transportation, communications, banking, and electricity supply. President Clinton established the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) in July 1996 to assess vulnerabilities and propose protection strategies for the nation's critical infrastructures. The Commission emphasized the importance of information sharing for infrastructure assurance. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection highlighted the need for information sharing among infrastructure owners, operators, and the government to identify vulnerabilities and acquire necessary protection tools. The exchange of information is crucial for developing analytic capabilities to recognize and predict potential attacks. However, there is reluctance from the private sector and government to share information due to concerns about reputation, competitiveness, and misuse of data. The Commission recommended promoting a partnership between government and infrastructure owners to increase information sharing on threats, vulnerabilities, and interdependencies. This included establishing an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) for analyzing information and informing both government and private sector users. The Commission recommended establishing an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) to promote partnership between government and infrastructure owners for sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities. It also discussed the need to protect confidential information in the exchange of information between government and private sector users, including the potential creation of a legal vehicle within the critical infrastructure information sharing mechanism. President Clinton responded to the Commission's report by releasing Presidential Decision Directive No. 63 (PDD-63). President Clinton released Presidential Decision Directive No. 63 (PDD-63) in response to the Commission's recommendation. The Directive instructed government officials to consult with private sector owners of critical infrastructures and promote the creation of a private sector information analysis and sharing center. It also directed studies on liability issues, legislative impediments, and improved protection of confidential business data and national security information. The Clinton Administration did not take a formal position on exempting certain information from FOIA. Despite the formation of ISACs by critical infrastructure sectors to share information with the government, little to no formalized information flow occurred from the private sector to the federal government according to a report by the General Accounting Office in April 2001. The Infrastructure Protection Center and the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security have raised concerns about the uncertainty of FOIA exemptions for sharing threat and vulnerability information with the government. Previous bills in Congress aimed to provide exemptions for cyber security information shared voluntarily with the federal government, but none were passed. In Congress, bills H.R. 2435 and S. 1456 aimed to exempt critical infrastructure information from FOIA and protect against civil action. S. 1456 was modified to align with House language but was never introduced. The Bush Administration supported both bills, including a FOIA exemption in the proposal for the Department of Homeland Security. In 1966, Representative Rumsfeld quoted James Madison during a debate on the Freedom of Information Act, emphasizing the importance of knowledge for governance. The government seeks information from critical infrastructure owners to protect against terrorism, while the public desires transparency for accountability and oversight. The federal government has historically delegated authority to control departmental papers and documents to agency heads. The Housekeeping Statute of 1789 and the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 have been used to regulate the disclosure of agency information, but concerns have been raised about agencies using these laws to withhold information and maintain secrecy. Amendments have been made to clarify that these laws do not authorize unrestricted agency discretion. The Housekeeping Statute was amended to clarify it does not allow withholding information from the public. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was signed into law in 1966, allowing access to federal information. FOIA was amended in 1974, 1986, and 1996 due to various reasons. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ensures citizen access to government information, with exemptions for certain categories of information. The law has been amended over the years to address issues such as Department of Justice resistance, increased oversight by Congress, court interpretations, time delays by agencies, and technological advances for public access. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows for the withholding of requested information under certain exemptions, but any non-exempt material must be provided. Disputes can be reviewed in federal court, and fees may be imposed for search, review, or copying of materials. The Act was amended in 1996 to allow for public access to information in electronic form. In 2001, agencies received around 1.9 million FOIA requests, with exemptions providing protections against the release of homeland security and critical information. Exemption 1 of the FOIA protects national security information related to defense or foreign policy, classified according to executive orders. Executive Order 12,958, issued by President Clinton and amended in 1999, specifies the types of information that can be classified. The categories of information that may be classified under Executive Order 12,958 include national security, foreign relations, scientific, technological, and economic matters. Information cannot be classified unless it could reasonably cause damage to national security. A directive issued by the White House Chief of Staff in 2002 emphasized the need to protect sensitive homeland security-related information, particularly concerning weapons of mass destruction. The implementing guidance for the directive focuses on homeland security information classified under Executive Order 12,958. It states that classified information should maintain its status, extending classification duration and exempting it from automatic declassification. Previously unclassified or declassified information related to weapons of mass destruction can be classified or reclassified if not publicly disclosed under proper authority. The executive order outlines special requirements for classification or reclassification of information previously requested, such as through a FOIA request. H.R. 5005 and S. 2452 direct procedures for sharing homeland security information among federal agencies, including classification guidelines and sharing protocols after removing classified information. Exemption 3 of the FOIA allows for the withholding of information protected by other statutes from public disclosure if certain criteria are met. This provision was included in Section 982 of P.L. 107-296, with the House language prevailing over S. 2452. The exemption applies to matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, with no agency discretion, or with established criteria for withholding. Exemption 3 of the FOIA allows for the withholding of information protected by other statutes if specific criteria are met. The government must prove that requested records are properly withheld, and the information must fit within a category authorized to be withheld by the statute. Some statutes qualify as exemption 3 statutes because they require information to be withheld without agency discretion, while others fail to qualify due to too much agency discretion or lack of specificity. Exemption 3 of the FOIA allows for withholding information under specific criteria. Congress has proposed legislation to exempt cyber security, DHS information, and critical infrastructure data from FOIA disclosure. Exemption 4 protects trade secrets and commercial information. This is relevant to the federal government's protection of private sector critical infrastructure. Exemption 4 of the FOIA protects commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is confidential or privileged. The D.C. Circuit has clarified that information generated by the federal government is not covered under this exemption. Cases often revolve around the confidentiality of the information, with a 1974 case establishing an objective test for confidentiality. The National Parks test established criteria for determining the confidentiality of commercial information under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. In 1992, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed the application of this test in Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, based on the principle of stare decisis. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals clarified the scope of the National Parks test in a case involving a utility industry group's reports voluntarily submitted to the NRC. The court established a new test for confidentiality, exempting voluntarily submitted information from disclosure if the submitter can show it is not customarily released to the public. This decision introduced a broader exemption 4 standard for such cases. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals established a new \"customary treatment\" test for confidentiality, exempting voluntarily submitted information from disclosure if not customarily released to the public. This broader exemption 4 standard applies to utility industry group reports voluntarily submitted to agencies. The Department of Justice has issued policy guidance on the distinction between required and voluntarily submitted information under Critical Mass. They state that submitting records for government contracts is mandatory, not voluntary. The Justice Department's principles include that voluntary participation in an activity does not determine if information submission is voluntary, Critical Mass determinations should consider the circumstances, information can be required by various legal authorities, and agency authority to require information submission does not automatically make it voluntary. The Critical Mass distinction between voluntary and required submissions has generated commentary and been applied in various court cases. However, it has not been widely adopted by circuits endorsing the National Parks test. Executive Order 12,600 requires agencies to establish procedures for notifying submitters of confidential commercial information that may be required to be disclosed under the FOIA, allowing submitters to object before disclosure. The courts will consider a \"reverse FOIA\" suit if the agency releases information against the submitter's objections. The mosaic effect recognizes that combining individual pieces of information can cause competitive harm. Courts have used this to protect confidential business information. The federal government aims to obtain private sector information voluntarily. The Senate version of the National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002, S. 2452, aimed to codify the rule from Critical Mass v. NRC regarding critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted by the private sector to the Department of Homeland Security. The Bush Administration's proposal also sought to exempt such information from disclosure under FOIA. The Bush Administration's proposal aimed to exempt information related to infrastructure vulnerabilities from FOIA. The proposal faced criticism for lacking specificity and was modified in H.R. 5005 and S. 2452 to include a FOIA exemption in separate sections. The House added a FOIA exemption to bill S. 2452 establishing the Department of Homeland Security. Section 214 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 exempted critical infrastructure information from disclosure under FOIA. The Homeland Security Act defines critical infrastructure information as non-public information related to the security of critical infrastructure or protected systems, including threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities. The submission of critical infrastructure information is voluntary for covered agencies like the Department of Homeland Security. Information disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission under certain provisions is not protected by this provision. The Homeland Security Act exempts critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the Department of Homeland Security from FOIA and prohibits its use in civil actions without consent. The Homeland Security Act protects critical infrastructure information submitted to the Department of Homeland Security from unauthorized disclosure, with penalties for federal officials who violate these protections. Information can only be disclosed for specific purposes such as criminal investigations or to authorized entities, and cannot be used for other purposes or disclosed under state laws. The Homeland Security Act protects critical infrastructure information submitted to the Department of Homeland Security from unauthorized disclosure. Information must be marked as protected and can only be disclosed for specific purposes. The Secretary of Homeland Security establishes procedures for handling the information, and only designated agencies may receive it. The Infrastructure Program may receive critical infrastructure information from the Department, but this does not limit the ability of government entities or third parties to obtain and use such information as permitted by law. Submission of protected information to the government does not fulfill requirements to submit it to a federal agency under other laws, and the Act does not create a private right of action for enforcement. The National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002 exempted records on critical infrastructure vulnerability and threats voluntarily provided to the Department of Homeland Security from FOIA. The provider had to certify the record as confidential and not typically public. The bill did not define \"critical infrastructure information\" like the Homeland Security Act. The National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002 exempted records on critical infrastructure vulnerability and threats voluntarily provided to the Department of Homeland Security from FOIA. Under S. 2452, records submitted voluntarily are not used to satisfy legal requirements or obtain government benefits. Agencies sharing protected records are bound by the FOIA exemption, with requests for protected information referred back to the Department of Homeland Security. The bill allows for the disclosure of segregable portions of records after removing protected information. The bill S. 2452 allowed agencies to disclose records under FOIA if they received similar records independently of the Department of Homeland Security. It did not preempt state or local disclosure laws and did not include civil liability immunity or criminal penalties. The Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to establish procedures for handling voluntarily furnished records. The Senate bill S. 2452 required the protection and maintenance of confidentiality for voluntarily furnished records. The Comptroller General was to report to Congress on the implementation of these protections, including the number of entities furnishing records voluntarily and requests for access. Significant differences existed between H.R. 5005 and S. 2452 regarding information protection, exemptions from FOIA, and definitions of voluntary submissions. The owners and operators of critical infrastructure have concerns about the disclosure of sensitive information under FOIA, which could harm their public relations, competitive position, and expose them to liability. They seek legal protections through a specific exemption in statute. Owners and operators of critical infrastructure seek legal protections through a narrowly tailored (b)(3) exemption in statute to prevent disclosure of sensitive information under FOIA. They also advocate for federal preemption of state and local disclosure laws to avoid potential liability. Public interest groups oppose the broad definition of exempted information in the House version of the protections. Critics argue that the definition of critical infrastructure in the (b)(3) exemption is too broad, potentially allowing any company to submit various types of information to protect it from FOIA disclosure. Concerns also arise regarding the broad language used in defining attacks or conduct that harms interstate commerce, which could encompass non-criminal incidents. The purposes for which protected information may be used are also criticized for being overly inclusive. The critique of the (b)(3) exemption in the bills raises concerns about the broad definition of critical infrastructure and the potential for companies to protect various types of information from FOIA disclosure. There are also worries about the expansive language used to define attacks on interstate commerce and the overly inclusive purposes for which protected information can be used. Additionally, there are concerns that information currently available to the public could be shielded from disclosure if submitted to the Department of Homeland Security. This is particularly problematic in the realm of environmental law and a community's right to know. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act require facilities handling hazardous substances to report amounts on hand, location, and releases into the environment. Owners must identify hazards, maintain safe facilities, and minimize consequences of accidental releases. The Clean Air Act mandates facilities handling hazardous substances to develop risk management plans, including accounting for accidental releases, estimating potential exposures, and implementing prevention and emergency response programs. Public disclosure of most information is required, but details of off-site consequence analyses for hypothetical accidents are not mandated to be disclosed. Companies can claim confidentiality for certain information if supported. Security concerns arose regarding the potential utility of risk management planning data to terrorists, leading to a decision by the EPA not to post Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) data on its website. Despite this, the information could still be accessed electronically through FOIA. In response, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to exempt OCA data from FOIA disclosure and directed the EPA to limit public disclosure to reduce risks. The EPA issued a final regulation on data access in 2000, allowing the public to view paper copies of sensitive OCA information in federal reading rooms and providing Internet access to less sensitive OCA data elements. The OCA data elements with the least criminal risk are accessible online for the public. Federal reading rooms allow viewing of OCA information for up to 10 facilities per month and all facilities affecting the local emergency planning committee's jurisdiction. Sharing OCA information is permitted as long as it does not include sensitive RMP sections or EPA electronic database content. A Clinton Administration proposal for broader access was rescinded by the Bush Administration. Critics are concerned that the FOIA exemption for critical infrastructure information could potentially exempt information about facilities handling dangerous chemicals. Public interest groups fear that this exemption, combined with restrictions on using the information in civil suits, could give owners of critical infrastructures immunity from various laws. Public interest groups argue that existing FOIA exemptions and case law provide enough protection to owner/operators, citing exemption (b)(4) which allows agencies to withhold commercial information that is privileged or confidential. They believe that the FOIA exemption for critical infrastructure information, combined with restrictions on using the information in civil suits, could grant owners of critical infrastructures immunity from various laws. Public interest groups are concerned about the exemption from FOIA for critical infrastructure information, arguing that it could lead to government secrecy and limit public access. They also worry that the private sector could determine what information is protected, leading to potential abuse. Additionally, they view the criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure as anti-whistleblower measures and question the voluntary nature of information submission to the government. Lastly, they oppose the provision that preempts state and local freedom of information laws. The Senate version of the FOIA exemptions has been cautiously accepted by public interest groups, as it aligns with recent case law on protecting confidential information submitted to government agencies. Industry representatives argue that extra protections are necessary to ensure voluntary information submission, as current laws do not guarantee confidentiality. Agencies are not required to commit to confidentiality until a FOIA request is received. The Senate bill, S. 2452, aimed to exempt critical infrastructure information from the Freedom of Information Act, but it did not pass. Industry and owners/operators support a narrow exemption for infrastructure threat and vulnerability information. Debate exists on both sides regarding the need for confidentiality of security-related information submitted to government agencies. The Senate bill, S. 2452, aimed to exempt critical infrastructure information from the Freedom of Information Act, but it did not pass. The provisions regarding the exemption of Critical Infrastructure Information from FOIA were adopted by the Senate from the House-passed bill. Public interest groups continue to criticize the language in S. 6 introduced in the 108th Congress."
