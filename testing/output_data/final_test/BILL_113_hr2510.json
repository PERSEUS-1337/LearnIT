    "content": "The Act titled \"Helping Veterans Exposed to Toxic Chemicals Act\" establishes Centers of Excellence for prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of health conditions related to exposure to open burn pits and other environmental exposures. The Secretary of Defense will establish three centers of excellence within the Department of Defense for addressing health conditions from exposure to burn pits and environmental factors. The selection of sites for these centers will be based on specific criteria outlined in the legislation. The Secretary of Defense will establish three centers of excellence to address health conditions related to exposure to burn pits and environmental factors. The selected entities must have specialized equipment, a publication track record, collaboration with a geosciences department, developed models of dust immunology and lung injury, and expertise in relevant fields. The centers will collaborate with each other and the Secretary of Defense. The center of excellence will collaborate with various entities to carry out responsibilities related to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of health conditions from exposure to burn pits and environmental factors. This includes implementing a comprehensive plan, developing best practices for treatment, and providing guidance for the health system. The center of excellence will guide the health system in determining personnel needs, train health professionals, advance research on health effects from exposure to burn pits, and share best practices within military medical facilities. The center of excellence will conduct research on health conditions related to exposure to burn pits and other environmental factors, provide medical treatment to veterans in the burn pits registry, and utilize data from the registry for its responsibilities. The burn pits registry, established under the Dignified Burial and Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2012, defines \"open burn pit\" as an area in Afghanistan or Iraq used for burning waste without incinerators. \"Other environmental exposures\" include hazards like dust, sand, and waste in Afghanistan.
