    "content": "The 116th Congress continues to focus on U.S. research and development (R&D) and evaluating support for federal R&D activities. The federal government has historically supported R&D efforts leading to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. Concerns about federal debt and budget deficits have influenced decisions on prioritizing R&D within the federal budget. Despite increases in budget caps for FY2018 and FY2019, concerns persist as the caps for FY2020 remain unchanged. The U.S. government funds a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D for various purposes. The federal government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D for purposes such as national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security. R&D funding is allocated to individual agencies with budgets reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The federal R&D budget is determined by aggregating activities from each agency, with Congress playing a key role in setting priorities and funding levels. Some members express concerns about federal spending due to the deficit, while others support increased R&D investment for future competitiveness. Congress faces decisions on the amount and allocation of funding in the FY2020 appropriations process. President Trump's FY2020 budget request includes discussions on R&D funding allocation and prioritization. The report analyzes R&D funding from various perspectives and for multiagency initiatives. It also examines the budget requests of federal departments and agencies accounting for 99% of total federal R&D funding. President Trump released his proposed FY2020 budget on March 11, 2019, with additional details provided the following week. The completion of the FY2019 budget process was delayed, leading to a government shutdown. The delay in the release of President's FY2020 budget request, due to a government shutdown, resulted in the use of a mix of estimated FY2019 funding levels by the Office of Management and Budget. The aggregate R&D funding levels for all agencies in the President's FY2020 budget were estimated using a combination of FY2019 enacted appropriations and Continuing Resolution levels. The enactment of the remaining FY2019 appropriations acts in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, impacted the Administration's estimated aggregate R&D funding level. President Trump's proposed R&D funding for FY2020 is approximately $134.1 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion (1.2%) from the FY2018 level of $135.8 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the FY2020 request represents a constant-dollar decrease of 5.2% from FY2018. The analysis compares the President's FY2020 request to the FY2018 actual level, as comprehensive R&D figures for FY2019 are not yet available. The agency sections of the report will be updated with FY2019 R&D levels when information becomes available. The President's FY2020 R&D funding request is $134.1 billion, a 5.2% decrease from FY2018. The report analyzes R&D funding by agency and program perspectives for decision-making. Congress determines R&D funding through authorization and appropriations processes. Table 1 shows R&D funding by agency for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. In FY2020, eight federal agencies would receive over 97% of total federal R&D funding, with the Department of Defense receiving the largest share at 44.3%. This report analyzes the R&D budget requests for these agencies and a few others. In FY2020, most federal agencies would see a decrease in R&D funding compared to FY2018, with only DOD, VA, and DOT receiving increases. The largest funding declines would be in HHS, DOE, NSF, and NASA budgets. DOD would see an increase in R&D funding in FY2020, while HHS and DOE would experience significant decreases. In FY2020, federal R&D funding would decline across various agencies. The Department of Education, DOE, and VA would all see decreases in funding. President Trump's FY2020 request includes changes in funding for basic research, applied research, development, and facilities/equipment. The private sector may underinvest in basic research due to factors such as long time horizons, technical risk, and shareholder demands for short-term returns. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research in the US, funding 42% in 2017, followed by business at 30%. In 2017, business funded 55% of U.S. applied research, while the federal government funded 33%. Business also provided 85% of development funding, with the federal government providing 13%. State governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations funded the remaining percentages. The President's FY2020 budget proposes significant funding for various national priorities in federal R&D, including spaceflight, energy sources, and counterterrorism efforts. The Department of Health and Human Services, mainly NIH, would be the largest federal funder of basic research and applied research, accounting for nearly half of all federal funding in these categories. DOD would be the primary federal funder of development, comprising a significant portion of total federal development funding. The President's FY2020 budget request shows that the Department of Energy (DOE) would be the main federal funder of facilities and equipment, accounting for 50.5% of total federal funding in this category. Multiagency R&D initiatives, such as the NITRD program, NNI, and USGCRP, receive funding from various agencies and produce annual budget supplements with detailed information. The President's FY2020 budget is largely silent on funding levels for multiagency R&D initiatives, such as the NITRD program, NNI, and USGCRP. Established by the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991, the NITRD program coordinates federal networking and information technology R&D investments. Additional information on these initiatives will be updated as it becomes available. The NITRD program coordinates federal networking and information technology R&D investments in areas like supercomputing, high-speed networking, cybersecurity, software engineering, and information management. 21 agencies are NITRD members, with efforts coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee. The director of NITRD must prepare an annual report for Congress, including budget details. President Trump requested $5,277.6 million for FY2019. In FY2019, President Trump requested $5,277.6 million for NITRD research, a slight increase from the FY2017 funding of $5,126.4 million. The FY2020 NSF budget request includes $1.20 billion for NITRD, a decrease of $98.2 million (7.6%) from FY2018. The U.S. Global Change Research Program focuses on understanding and responding to global climate change. Additional information on NITRD can be found at https://www.nitrd.gov. The US Global Change Research Program aims to advance climate change science and inform human responses to global change through coordinated federal programs. In FY2018, 13 departments and agencies participated in the program, coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Global Change Research. Each agency develops and carries out activities as its contribution to the program, with funds appropriated accordingly. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates federal agencies involved in global change research to report annually to Congress. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates federal agencies involved in global change research to report annually to Congress on their proposed activities and budget allocations. The President is required to include this information in the annual budget request to Congress. Some agencies provide the required information in their budget justifications, while appropriations laws have also required a comprehensive report on climate change funding. The most recent report was submitted in January 2017 for the FY2017 request. The President's FY2020 budget does not specify funding levels for USGCRP for FY2018, FY2019, or FY2020. Without complete budget reports, it is challenging to estimate federal funding for USGCRP accurately. Selected agencies' funding data incompletely represent recent years' support for USGCRP. The publicly reported funding for the USGCRP is insufficient to independently estimate accurately. The National Nanotechnology Initiative, launched in FY2001, aims to advance understanding at the nanoscale. Additional information can be found in the CRS Report R43227 and at http://www.globalchange.gov. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (P.L. 108-153) established the legislative foundation for NNI activities, coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET). NNI funding in FY2019 was included in the President's budget request for 16 federal departments and agencies dedicated to nanotechnology R&D. The NSET involves various federal departments and agencies responsible for health, safety, environmental regulation, trade, education, intellectual property, and international relations. P.L. 108-153 mandates the NSTC to prepare an annual report for Congress, detailing the program's budget for the current fiscal year. The NNI program's budget details for FY2019 and FY2020 are outlined, with President Trump requesting $1,395.6 million for NNI research in FY2019. The latest annual report was published in August 2018, and the NSF budget request includes $389 million in NNI funding for FY2020. Additional information on the NNI can be found in a CRS report and on http://www.nano.gov. Executive Order 13859 was signed in February 2019 to establish the program. President Trump signed Executive Order 13859 in February 2019 to establish the American Artificial Intelligence Initiative, aiming to accelerate national leadership in AI. The EO directs agencies to prioritize AI in R&D, allocate high-performance computing resources for AI applications, and provide approximately $850 million in funding for the initiative in the President's FY2020 budget. President Trump signed the National Quantum Initiative Act in December 2018, allocating approximately $850 million for the initiative across various departments. The act aims to ensure US leadership in quantum information science and technology applications, requiring a 10-year plan for development. The President's FY2020 budget includes around $430 million for this initiative at different agencies. The President's FY2020 budget prioritizes R&D in manufacturing, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign sources of critical products. Initiatives include intelligent manufacturing systems, semiconductor design, Cancer Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, Precision Medicine Initiative, and Materials Genome Initiative. The President's FY2020 budget prioritizes R&D in manufacturing, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign sources of critical products through initiatives like intelligent manufacturing systems, semiconductor design, Cancer Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, Precision Medicine Initiative, and Materials Genome Initiative. This report provides an in-depth analysis of R&D in 12 federal departments and agencies receiving nearly 99% of total federal R&D funding, with agencies presented based on the size of their FY2020 R&D budget requests. Annual appropriations for these agencies are provided through 9 of the 12 regular appropriations bills. The report highlights that R&D funding levels are often included in appropriations line items that also cover non-R&D activities, making it challenging to precisely identify the amount allocated to R&D. As of the report date, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2020 had been enacted into law, with updates expected as Congress progresses in the appropriations process. The Department of Defense's mission is to provide military forces for national security. Congress supports DOD's research and development activities through RDT&E funding, mainly in the defense appropriations bill. Access individual reports on appropriations bills and their status on the CRS website. RDT&E funds are appropriated in various parts of the defense appropriations bill, including the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. These funds support research on various medical conditions and activities to destroy lethal chemical agents. The Munitions Destruction Program aims to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. Funding for this program is requested through Defense-wide Procurement appropriations and Title VI. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports naval reserve fleet procurement, operation, maintenance, and research. RDT&E funds are also used for efforts in the Global War on Terror. The Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have been terms used by different administrations. The FY2020 budget includes funds for OCO activities divided into direct war, enduring, and OCO for base categories. Various transfer funds have been included in OCO/GWOT-related requests/appropriations in the past. The FY2020 budget includes a request for $104.294 billion for DOD's Title IV RDT&E PEs, along with funding for RDT&E through the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. Additionally, there is funding for the Inspector General for RDT&E-related activities. The FY2020 budget includes $104.294 billion for DOD's Title IV RDT&E PEs, with no RDT&E funding via the National Defense Sealift Fund. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments and DOD agencies, categorized by budget activity such as basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on developing specific weapon systems with established operational needs. Activity 6.6 provides management support for test and evaluation facilities, while 6.7 supports system improvements. DOD S&T program funding is crucial for new technology development and maintaining military superiority. The FY2020 request for Title IV S&T funding is $14.135 billion, 9.7% lower than FY2019. The Trump Administration is requesting $2.320 billion for DOD basic research for FY2020, $208.4 million (8.2%) below the FY2019 enacted level. DOD is a significant source of federal funds for university R&D in fields like aerospace, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer sciences, and materials science. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aims to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) focuses on research and development funded through the National Institutes of Health, which accounts for the majority of HHS R&D funding. Other HHS agencies also provide funding for R&D, including the CDC, CMS, FDA, AHRQ, HRSA, and ACF. NIH is the primary agency for biomedical and behavioral research, training researchers, and disseminating health information. The NIH's mission is to seek knowledge about living systems to enhance health. It consists of the Office of the Director and 27 institutes focusing on diseases, human health, and research fields. Each institute manages its own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. The NIH provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, OD, the Innovation Account, and an intramural Buildings and Facilities account. NIH supports basic and clinical research, research training, and health information dissemination. About 10% of the budget supports intramural research projects conducted by NIH federal scientists, while over 80% goes to extramural research performed by nonfederal scientists at universities and medical institutions. The NIH receives funding primarily from the LHHS appropriations act and has additional funding for Superfund-related activities. It also receives mandatory funding for type 1 diabetes research. The total program level for NIH activities is determined by the discretionary budget authority. President Trump's FY2020 budget request would decrease NIH's total program level to $34.368 billion, a 12.6% decrease from FY2019 enacted. The proposed FY2020 program level for NIH is $34.368 billion, a decrease of $4.941 billion (12.6%) compared to FY2019 enacted levels. The budget proposal includes funding from LHHS appropriations, PHS evaluation transfer, Superfund-related activities, and a mandatory type 1 diabetes program. All existing ICs and budget activity lines, except for Buildings and Facilities, would receive a decrease in funding. Additionally, the Budget Request suggests consolidating the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality into NIH. The FY2020 budget proposal includes the creation of a new NIH institute called the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) with $256 million in funding. The budget also proposes reducing the average cost of research project grants (RPGs) by capping the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds to 90%. Additionally, there is $150 million in mandatory funding for research on type 1 diabetes in the FY2020 Trump budget proposal. The FY2020 Trump budget proposal includes $150 million in mandatory funding for research on type 1 diabetes under the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Congress and the President would need to enact legislation to extend the special diabetes program funding. Additionally, the budget includes $741 million in funding transferred to NIH by the PHS evaluation tap. The PHS evaluation tap redistributes funds among PHS and HHS agencies, with NIH being a net recipient of tap funds in recent years. The FY2020 NIH budget request includes $492 million from the 21st Century Cures Act. The Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) allocates funds for various research initiatives, including $149 million for Precision Medicine, $140 million for the BRAIN Initiative, $195 million for cancer research, and $8 million for regenerative medicine in FY2020. The President's FY2020 budget prioritizes research themes for NIH, such as addressing the Opioids Crisis with $1.3 billion for opioids and pain research, including $500 million for the HEAL Initiative. Additionally, NIH plans to support pediatric research. The FY2020 budget proposes $50 million for a pediatric cancer initiative to aggregate data and support research. $15 million is designated for the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. $100 million is allocated for the Next Generation Researchers Initiative to support new scientists in obtaining NIH grants. The FY2020 budget includes funding for a pediatric cancer initiative, the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network, and the Next Generation Researchers Initiative to support new scientists in obtaining NIH grants.

The request would provide no funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, requiring MEP centers to become self-supporting. In FY2019, President Trump proposed ending federal funding for MEP centers, requiring them to become self-supporting. The FY2020 request includes $15.2 million for Manufacturing USA, with $10 million for NIIMBL and $5 million for network coordination. The President is requesting $59.9 million for the NIST CRF account, a significant decrease from FY2019. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and oceans. It was created in 1970 to unify environmental programs and protect the environment. NOAA's administrative structure includes six line offices: National Ocean Service (NOS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), and Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO). NOAA's administrative structure includes six line offices supported by Mission Support for administrative functions. Congress funds these offices through two accounts. In 2010, NOAA published its Next Generation Strategic Plan with long-term goals and enterprise objectives guiding its five-year R&D plan. The NOAA's five-year R&D plan, published in 2013, aims to integrate diverse perspectives and expertise to understand the earth system holistically. President Trump requested $651.1 million for NOAA's R&D funding in FY2020, a decrease from the previous year. Congress allocated funds for research, development, and other activities in FY2019. In FY2020, the President is requesting $352.3 million for research, $106.3 million for development, and $192.6 million for R&D equipment, totaling 14.1% of NOAA's total discretionary budget authority request of $4.622 billion. OAR accounts for the majority of R&D funding, with a request of $335.1 million, a decrease from the previous year. The President's FY2020 request includes funding cuts for NOAA laboratories and cooperative research institutes, including a $13.1 million reduction from the FY2019 enacted level. The request also proposes to terminate federal support for the National Sea Grant College Program, which supports scientific research and stakeholder engagement for coastal communities. In FY2019, Congress appropriated $68.0 million to the National Sea Grant College Program and $12.0 million to the Marine Aquaculture Research program under the federal support. The Department of the Interior (DOI) was established to conserve natural resources, provide scientific information, and uphold trust responsibilities to indigenous communities. DOI's responsibilities include mapping, geological, hydrological, and biological science, wildlife conservation, surface-mined lands protection, and historic preservation. Requested R&D funding for FY2019 was not available when the FY2020 budget was prepared. The Administration is requesting $12.6 billion in net discretionary funding for DOI in FY2020, with $757 million requested for R&D funding, $148 million below the FY2018 actual level. The President's FY2020 DOI R&D funding request includes 8.9% for basic research, 73.3% for applied research, and 17.8% for development. USGS conducts basic research within DOI. R&D funding levels are unclear unless provided at the precise request level. Funding for DOI R&D is generally included in appropriations line items that also cover non-R&D activities. The USGS accounts for two-thirds of all DOI R&D funding, with funding provided through the Surveys, Investigations, and Research (SIR) account. USGS conducts R&D in seven activity/program areas. The President's FY2020 budget request for USGS is $984 million, with $481 million allocated for R&D, a decrease from the FY2018 level. Additionally, R&D funding requests for other DOI components are included in the budget. The FY2020 budget for various DOI components shows changes in applied research and development funding. BOEM received an increase of $22.1 million, FWS decreased by $17.2 million, NPS decreased by $1.1 million, BSEE decreased by $2.2 million, BLM decreased by $1.9 million, BIA remained the same at $5.0 million, and WFM had no funding requested for R&D. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing $1.4 billion for R&D in FY2020, an increase of $12 million (1%) from FY2019. VA R&D is funded through two accounts\u2014the Medical and Prosthetic Research account and the Medical Care Support account. The FY2020 budget proposal for VA R&D includes $762 million for the Medical and Prosthetic Research account and $648 million for research supported by the Medical Care Support account. Funding levels are determined after VA allocates appropriations to specific activities. Strategic priorities for VA R&D in FY2020 include increasing veterans' access to clinical research. In FY2020, VA R&D strategic priorities include enhancing veterans' access to clinical trials, improving data accessibility, and focusing on clinical research areas such as suicide prevention, chronic pain, opioid addiction, PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and Gulf War illness. The Medical and Prosthetics R&D program is managed by the Veteran Health Administration's Office of Research and Development, aiming to enhance veterans' health through various research efforts. The Office of Research and Development (ORD) conducts clinical, health services, and rehabilitative research to develop personalized care solutions for Veterans. ORD consists of four main research services: Biomedical Laboratory R&D, Clinical Science R&D, Health Services R&D, and Rehabilitation R&D. Each service focuses on different aspects of research to improve the quality of life for impaired and disabled veterans. The VA Office of Research and Development conducts research to improve the quality of life for impaired and disabled veterans. VA researchers can receive funding from various sources for their research, but VA lacks the authority to provide research grants to non-VA entities. Funding for VA's R&D programs is detailed in tables, including designated research areas important to veteran patients. The Department of Transportation (DOT) conducts research to improve mobility, reduce congestion, promote safety, and preserve the environment. Funding for DOT R&D is included in appropriations line items that also cover non-R&D activities. The allocation of funding to R&D from appropriations legislation is unclear. The Administration is requesting $1.089 billion for DOT R&D activities and facilities in FY2020, a decrease of $5.8 million (0.5%) from FY2019. Three DOT agencies\u2014the FAA, FHWA, and NHTSA\u2014would account for over 90% of DOT R&D under the FY2020 request. The President's FY2020 request of $512.3 million for R&D activities at FAA would be an increase of $10.4 million (2.1%) from FY2019. The President's budget request includes a reduction of $71.1 million (37.2%) for the Research and Development (RE&D) account in FY2020. Funding within the RE&D account aims to improve aircraft safety through research in areas such as fire safety, advanced materials, propulsion systems, aircraft icing, and airworthiness. Additionally, FHWA's contributions to transformative innovations in roads, bridges, and facilities are changing the way they are planned, designed, and managed. The President's request of $420 million for R&D activities at FHWA represents a $39 million (10.2%) increase from FY2019, with $125 million allocated to the Highway Research and Development program. The President's budget request includes $125 million for FHWA's Highway Research and Development program to improve safety, infrastructure design, data analysis, and reduce congestion. It also includes $100 million for research on connected transportation systems. NHTSA's R&D funding in FY2020 is $62.1 million, focusing on automation, vehicle safety, and human-machine interfaces. The President's FY2020 request includes funding for DOT R&D activities, including advanced vehicle safety technology, crash avoidance, reducing unsafe driving behaviors, and alternative fuels vehicle safety. The funding levels for various DOT components are lower than the FY2019 levels. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified five core missions: prevent terrorism, secure borders, enforce immigration laws, safeguard cyberspace, and ensure resilience to disasters. New technology from research and development can help achieve these goals. The President's FY2020 budget request for DHS includes $438 million for R&D activities, a 31.6% reduction from the previous year. The FY2020 budget request for DHS includes $438 million for R&D activities, a 31.6% reduction from the previous year. The S&T Directorate would receive $303 million for R&D, with smaller amounts allocated to other DHS components. The Administration's request for the S&T Directorate R&D account is a 40.7% decrease from the previous year, with cybersecurity R&D funding shifted to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency. The S&T Directorate's Research, Development, and Innovation budget line would see decreases in various thrust areas, ranging from 12.1% to 40.4%. Funding for University Centers of Excellence would decrease from $37 million in FY2019 to $18 million in FY2020. The FY2020 request for Laboratory Facilities is $116 million, down 4.9% from the previous year, with no funding allocated for the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory. The requested funding for Laboratory Facilities for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) is $29 million, the same as in FY2019. The request for R&D in the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office is $68 million, down from $83 million in FY2019. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds a broad range of R&D activities to support decisions relating to environmental pollution control laws. Congress has funded EPA through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations acts since FY2006. EPA R&D appropriations are generally included in line-items that also include non-R&D activities. EPA determines R&D funding levels by allocating appropriations to specific activities. The Science and Technology account funds EPA's scientific research, including R&D at agency facilities and external research. ORD manages R&D at EPA headquarters and labs, as well as external R&D conducted by universities and other entities receiving EPA grants. The FY2020 budget request for EPA includes reductions and eliminations of funding for various programs and activities, totaling $6.07 billion, which is $2.78 billion less than the FY2019 enacted appropriations. The Science and Technology account funds EPA's R&D activities managed by ORD, including research grants. Other EPA programs may have a research component, but it is not always the primary focus. The President's FY2020 budget request for EPA includes reductions in funding for various programs and activities, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress regarding cuts to scientific research programs. The proposed budget allocates $480.8 million for EPA's Science and Technology account, a decrease of $241.1 million from the FY2019 enacted level. The FY2020 budget request for EPA includes reductions in funding for programs and activities, with concerns raised by Congress about cuts to scientific research. The proposed budget allocates $480.8 million for EPA's Science and Technology account, a decrease of $241.1 million from the FY2019 level. The President's request proposes a rescission for EPA but does not specify within the S&T account. This accounting difference hinders direct comparisons of funding within EPA's S&T account. The conference report accompanying the FY2019 enacted appropriations did not specify funding for all subprogram areas reported in EPA's budget justification. S&T subprogram areas not reported in congressional reports are noted as \"NR\". The President's budget requests have modified program area titles, which have been generally adopted by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Members did not support some of the proposed changes during Committee hearings on the President's FY2020 budget request for EPA. The FY2020 budget request for EPA included proposed reductions in funding for scientific research programs, which were generally not supported by Members. The reductions below the FY2019 enacted levels were spread across EPA operational functions, grants for states, tribes, and local governments. The requested FY2020 amount for the S&T account for individual EPA program areas would be lower than the FY2019 enacted appropriations, with some line-item activities proposed for elimination in the FY2020 budget request. The FY2020 budget request for EPA proposed reductions in funding for scientific research programs, including eliminations of certain programs like the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program. The President's FY2020 budget request did not include funding for Research: National Priorities. P.L. 116-6 included $5.0 million for Research: National Priorities within the S&T account for FY2019, an increase compared to $4.1 million included for FY2018. The H.Rept. 116-9 provided guidance for program areas and activities within the S&T account for FY2019, including topics like Alternative Testing, Computational Toxicology, Nanomaterials Research, and Water Security Test Beds. Workforce reshaping has been a topic of debate during congressional hearings regarding EPA's FY2020 appropriations. The FY2020 request for the Operations and Administration program area within the S&T account includes $6.0 million for agency workforce reshaping and efforts to improve the management of EPA's laboratories. Proposed reorganizing strategies may impact aspects of EPA's Office of Research Development (ORD) and the operations of the EPA Office of the Science Advisor (OSA), as well as current EPA laboratories. The National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) and its interest to Members of Congress are detailed in the report, along with a list of primary CRS experts on R&D funding for covered agencies."
