The first stage involves a base guarantee funding based on prior years, while the second stage allocates remaining funds based on need-based formulas. The U.S. Department of Education allocates funds to participating IHEs in campus-based programs through a two-stage procedure. The allocation formulas for the programs determine funding based on institutional need, with each IHE receiving funding in proportion to its share of the national total of need in excess of its base guarantee. If an IHE's fair share is greater than its base guarantee, it is eligible for additional funding to reduce its shortfall. The allocation procedures for campus-based programs involve a base guarantee and fair share increase, dating back to the late 1970s. Previously, funding was allocated based on state student population and then distributed to institutions based on student need through the panel review process. In the mid-1970s, the panel review process for allocating funds to institutions of higher education (IHEs) was criticized for being complex and inequitable. The U.S. Office of Education formed a panel of experts to recommend new allocation procedures, leading to the implementation of the conditional guarantee for IHEs to receive funds comparable to past amounts. The conditional guarantee was introduced in the mid-1970s to ensure institutions of higher education received funds comparable to past amounts. Initially set based on previous expenditures, these guarantees were gradually reduced over time but ultimately evolved into the current base guarantees, which continue to be the primary allocation method for campus-based program funds. The capacity of an IHE to award campus-based aid is directly related to the amount of funds it receives, with major factors including base guarantee, COA, FSA applicants, and EFCs. All participating institutions are eligible for a base guarantee, determined by prior funding amounts. The base guarantee component of allocation procedures favors long-term participants over new entrants to the programs. Base guarantees are determined based on prior funding amounts, with institutions receiving a base guarantee equal to 100% of their previous year's amount. New participants receive a base guarantee of $5,000 or 90% of their second-year funding. The base guarantee for institutions participating in the program is determined based on prior funding amounts. New participants receive a base guarantee equal to the greater of $5,000 or 90% of their second-year funding. After determining base guarantees for institutions, any remaining funds are allocated to IHEs for fair share increases based on institutional need, such as FSEOG need, self-help need for FWS, and adjusted self-help need for Perkins Loan FCCs. Institutional need is calculated based on the relationship between the average cost of attendance and expected family contributions. The average cost of attendance (COA) at an institution is calculated based on tuition, fees, living costs, and supplies. Adjustments are made for the average time students are in attendance. The cost of attendance (COA) at institutions is calculated based on tuition, fees, living costs, and supplies, totaling $450. Adjustments are made for average time in attendance. COA is calculated separately for undergraduate and graduate/professional students. Composite EFCs are assigned based on student status, income bands, and not individual FAFSA calculations. Allocation procedures are done annually by ED. The Department of Education (ED) calculates average Expected Family Contributions (EFCs) for different student categories using FAFSA data. Institutional need is determined by comparing the Cost of Attendance (COA) with EFCs of students applying for financial aid. This calculation helps assess the overall financial need of students at the institution. The calculation of FSEOG need is based on undergraduate student income categories. For each category, subtract EFC from 75% of the average COA, then multiply by the number of students in that category. Sum across all categories and subtract Pell Grant aid. FSEOG Need is calculated by subtracting Pell Grant and LEAP/SLEAP aid from the difference between students' estimated EFCs and 75% of their institution's average undergraduate COA. It represents the financial need of FSA applicants eligible for the FSEOG program. The Self-Help Need calculation for the FWS program is based on the combination of expected family contribution and federal grant aid. It determines the financial need for all eligible students by calculating 25% of the average undergraduate COA and subtracting EFC from it. This formula is used to allocate funds fairly among participating IHEs. Step 1: Sum the results from undergraduate student income categories. Subtract EFC from average graduate and professional COA for each student category. Multiply the number of students in each category by the results. Calculate an institution's Self-Help Need as the lesser of 25% of average undergraduate COA or the difference between undergraduate students' estimated need. \n\nStep 2: The Self-Help Need calculation for the FWS program is based on expected family contribution and federal grant aid to determine financial need for eligible students.\n\nSummarized chunk: Calculate Self-Help Need by summing results from undergraduate student income categories, subtracting EFC from average graduate and professional COA, and multiplying by the number of students in each category. Determine an institution's Self-Help Need as the lesser of 25% of average undergraduate COA or the difference between undergraduate students' estimated need. Calculate Self-Help Need by summing results from undergraduate student income categories, subtracting EFC from average graduate and professional COA, and multiplying by the number of students in each category. Self-Help Need is a composite figure that expresses different characterizations of need for undergraduate students than it does for graduate and professional students. For undergraduate students, it shows the amount of aid that would need to be provided so that an amount up to 25% of undergraduate students' cost of attendance, in the aggregate, could be met by the combination of their EFC and FWS aid. For graduate and professional students, it shows the amount of aid that would need to be provided so that the entire difference between students' EFCs and their institution's COA could be met by FWS aid. Adjusted Self-Help Need is calculated similarly to Self-Help Need, with adjustments made based on an institution's collections on previously awarded Perkins Loans and cohort default rate. It expresses aggregate student need for institutions participating in the Perkins Loan program. Adjusted Self-Help Need for the Perkins Loan program adjusts an institution's need by accounting for expected collections on outstanding loans. It measures the same student need as Self-Help Need for the FWS program. Calculations for fair share funding, shortfall, and increase are straightforward compared to institutional need calculations. Fair share is determined based on an institution's need relative to the national total of all participating IHEs. The allocation of funds to institutions in the Perkins Loan program is based on fair share funding, shortfall, and increase. Institutions receive allocations based on their need compared to the national total, with adjustments made for underutilization penalties and reallocation to other institutions with funding shortfalls. This analysis focuses on the current campus-based allocation procedures. The analysis focuses on the allocation of funds to institutions in the Perkins Loan program based on fair share funding and shortfall. It utilizes information from the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) and 2004-2005 award year allocations data, with a primary unit of analysis being categories of institutions grouped by average Cost of Attendance (COA). This report highlights significant differences among institutions in the percentage of students awarded campus-based aid and average award amounts based on COA categories. The report analyzes the allocation of funds to institutions in the Perkins Loan program based on fair share funding and shortfall. It focuses on categories of institutions grouped by average Cost of Attendance (COA), showing the distribution of institutions within each category by sector. Most public two-year IHEs are in the lower cost categories, while private four-year IHEs are mainly in the high-cost categories. Some private four-year IHEs fall into the middle cost category. The allocation of funds to institutions in the Perkins Loan program is based on fair share funding and shortfall. Public two-year IHEs are mainly in lower cost categories, while private four-year IHEs are in high-cost categories. Some private four-year IHEs are in the middle cost category. The allocation formulas are based on an institution's COA, which affects the amount of funds IHEs receive and the distribution of aid to students. Base guarantees for IHEs participating in campus-based programs are expected to be phased out. The base guarantees for institutions participating in campus-based programs were expected to be phased out gradually to avoid drastic funding fluctuations. While provisions were made to decrease base guarantees under certain conditions, subsequent legislation prevented this from being implemented. As a result, base guarantees have continued to be part of the allocation procedures for campus-based programs. The campus-based allocation procedures were amended to provide IHEs with base guarantees equal to 100% of their 1985 allocation. After base guarantees were awarded, funds were allocated to IHEs based on their base guarantees. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 revised the procedures for determining base guarantees. Prior to 1986, funds were apportioned to states based on population before being allocated to IHEs. Since the 1986 Amendments, funds have been allocated directly to IHEs without state involvement. However, the legacy of base guarantee allocation procedures has led to uneven distribution of funds among institutions, with some receiving more than their fair share. This disparity is due to differences in institutional growth rates and student financial need. The distribution of funds among institutions varies across the country, with some receiving more than their fair share. Table 3 displays the number of IHEs participating in campus-based programs, those with base guarantees exceeding their fair share, and those eligible for a fair share increase. Most funding for these programs is allocated to meet institutions' base guarantees, with a significant portion going towards base guarantees in the FWS and Perkins Loan programs. There is no clear link between institutional COA and funding allocation procedures. The distribution of funds among institutions varies across the country, with some receiving more than their fair share. Table 3 shows wide variation in the proportion of funds allocated for base guarantees in the FSEOG and FWS programs. Some states allocate more than 90% of funding towards meeting base guarantees, while in others, base guarantees make up less than half of total allocations. This variation may be due to growth in institutional need in some states since the implementation of base guarantee procedures. In the Perkins Loan program, over 90% of funds are allocated for base guarantees in most states due to decreased appropriations since the 1980s. Funds for Perkins Loan FCCs have remained available for base guarantees and fair share increases through FY2004, despite declining appropriations and institutions ceasing participation. No funds were appropriated for Perkins Loan FCCs for FY2005 nor FY2006. Under the campus-based programs, funds are primarily allocated for base guarantees, with the potential for a shift in distribution if base guarantees were reduced. Fair share formulas aim to address the shortfall between an institution's base guarantee and its fair share of funds based on institutional need. Fair share increases are available to help bridge this gap, with institutional need determined by the average cost of attendance. The relationship between the average cost of attendance (COA) and expected family contributions (EFCs) of FSA applicants affects the funds received by institutions for fair share increases. Fair share formulas use average EFCs for students grouped by income bands and dependency status. This method was chosen to simplify the process as collecting individual EFCs for each student would be burdensome. The Department of Education calculates average EFCs to determine fair share allocations. The Department of Education calculates average EFCs for students grouped by income bands to determine fair share allocations. The income bands in the Table of EFCs have been adjusted only a few times since 1994. It is crucial for the average EFCs to closely reflect the actual EFCs of students at participating institutions. The income bands used in fair share formulas may no longer accurately reflect actual student EFCs, especially for upper-income students. Students in the highest income category often make up the largest group at high-cost institutions, impacting institutional need calculations. The table of EFCs also does not consider if independent students have dependents. The calculation of average EFCs for independent students may be inaccurate as it does not account for whether they have dependents, which can significantly affect their EFCs. This could lead to differences in EFCs being masked or canceled out, impacting institutional need calculations if independent students with and without dependents are unevenly distributed across institutions. The distribution of undergraduate dependent students in different income bands can impact the accuracy of EFC calculations. Additional income bands may be needed for dependent students with family incomes above $60,000 to reflect upper-income students more accurately. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of independent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students across income bands. Independent students are mainly in the highest income bracket, with uneven distribution between those with and without dependents. Breaking down the top income band into multiple categories could lead to more accurate EFC calculations for independent students. It is suggested that average EFCs be calculated separately for independent students with and without dependents to better approximate students' actual EFCs. Campus-based aid allocations are determined based on the aggregate need of all FSA-eligible students at an institution, leading to varying institutional needs based on the income levels of students. The financial need of students at different institutions varies based on their income levels. Institutional need is calculated by considering the relationship between students' Expected Family Contributions (EFCs) and Cost of Attendance (COA). Higher-cost institutions may have higher institutional need due to the EFCs of upper-income students, while lower-cost institutions may not factor in these students' EFCs. This results in significant institutional need, especially for lower-income students. The average amount of need calculated under fair share formulas for each program, by institution category, shows that higher-cost institutions have the largest amounts of need per student. This impacts the distribution of aid, with low- and middle-income students mostly attending low-cost institutions, while upper-income students are more likely to attend high-cost institutions. The fair share formulas result in higher amounts of need being calculated for students at high-cost institutions compared to low-cost institutions. This includes upper-income students at high-cost institutions receiving more need-based aid than students with very low EFCs at low-cost institutions. Need-based financial aid is relative to the cost of attendance at the institution a student attends. The allocation procedures aim to distribute campus-based funding objectively based on need, but the high cost of attendance at some institutions leads to excessive need calculations that exceed the maximum amount authorized for student awards. The allocation of federal funding for campus-based aid programs may exceed the maximum award amounts authorized for students at higher-cost institutions. Differences in financial need calculations exist between institutions with high and low costs of attendance, as well as among categories of institutions. The tabulation of institutional need is examined for each campus-based program, showing the financial need attributable to different types of students and the impact of subtracting Pell Grant and LEAP/SLEAP aid. The graph illustrates the aggregate financial need per category, with shaded areas representing student need and black bars indicating total FSEOG need. The table at the bottom of the figure displays dollar amounts of aggregate financial need for different types of students, with a focus on undergraduate independent students with incomes below $16,000. It shows that these students have the greatest amount of need in the aggregate, especially at lower-cost institutions. Additionally, significant amounts of FSEOG need are calculated for undergraduate dependent students in the highest income band at institutions with the highest COAs. In higher-cost institutions, proportionately greater amounts of need are calculated for students in higher income bands. The amount of need calculated for students is offset by Pell Grants and LEAP/SLEAP aid, with Pell Grants being the foundation of need-based aid for low-income students. Pell Grants are received in the greatest amounts by students attending the lowest-cost institutions, while FSEOG need at high-cost schools is only slightly affected by Pell Grant aid subtraction. LEAP/SLEAP aid is distributed evenly across institutions, with FSEOG need not disproportionately affected by its subtraction. The formula for calculating FSEOG need ensures that funding supplements Pell Grants and other gift aid without duplicating it. Higher education tax benefits have evolved as a new type of federal financial assistance with similarities to gift aid. The FSEOG need formula does not consider higher education tax benefits received by eligible students, which may impact the calculation of student need. Pell Grants target low-income students, while tax credits benefit middle- and upper-income students. This differential treatment could affect how accurately FSEOG represents actual student need. The FSEOG need formula may not accurately represent student need as it does not account for tax credit aid received by students. Adjusting the formula to include tax credits could improve equity in determining student need across different income levels and institutions. However, it is challenging for institutions to gather and report tax credit information for fund allocation. In the FWS program, self-help need varies significantly among different types of students and institutions based on their cost of attendance. At high-cost institutions, self-help need is mainly attributed to upper-income dependent and graduate/professional students, while lower-income dependent and independent undergraduate students contribute very little. The distribution of self-help need varies significantly across different income levels and types of students at institutions with varying costs of attendance. The treatment of graduate and professional students in calculating self-help need at high-cost institutions differs from that of undergraduate students. For undergraduates, self-help need is based on a percentage of the average COA, while for graduate/professional students, it is based on the difference between COA and EFC. This distinction helps limit the self-help need for undergraduates but not for graduate/professional students. The difference between COA and EFC for graduate and professional students at higher-cost institutions contributes to large institutional need and higher funding allocations. In the Perkins Loan program, a greater proportion of adjusted self-help need comes from students at higher-cost institutions compared to the FWS program. The majority of funding for campus-based programs is allocated to institutions based on their base guarantees, with a smaller portion allocated for fair share increases. This allocation has a greater impact on middle- and higher-cost institutions due to their larger loan portfolios. The COA at institutions may result in base guarantee funding being greater, less than, or equal to the IHE's fair share. Proposals suggest phasing out base guarantees for allocation based on institutional need, which is influenced by COA. High-cost institutions receive more institutional need per student compared to low-cost institutions, despite having higher EFCs. Currently, most campus-based funding is allocated for base guarantees, with over 40% allocated this way. The campus-based programs allocate funding for base guarantees, with a significant portion distributed based on fair share criteria for FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan FCCs. The report analyzes the potential impact of eliminating base guarantees and allocating all funds based on fair share formulas for each program. Figure 8 illustrates the comparison of AY2004-2005 FSEOG allocations and estimated distributions under the fair share system. The analysis compares AY2004-2005 FSEOG allocations with estimates under fair share procedures. There would be a redistribution of funds across categories of institutions, with middle-cost institutions receiving less funding and upper middle-cost institutions receiving more. Smaller changes in funding levels are expected for other categories of institutions. The elimination of base guarantees in favor of allocating all FSEOG funding according to fair share procedures may result in only a modest redistribution of funds across categories of institutions. While a cursory look at Figure 8 might suggest minimal impact, individual institutions could be affected differently by the changes in allocation procedures. If base guarantees were eliminated, a significant amount of funding churning would occur across all categories of institutions. More institutions would see an increase in funding than a decrease, with the low-cost category experiencing the greatest decrease. Funding increases would be less on average for institutions receiving more funds compared to those losing funds. Under the FWS program, most funds are allocated for base guarantees and fair share increases. If base guarantees were eliminated, there would be a noticeable shift in funding distribution. Middle-cost and upper middle-cost institutions would see significant funding decreases. Middle-cost (category 4) and upper middle-cost IHEs would see funding decreases if base guarantees were eliminated, while very high-cost (category 6) IHEs would receive increased funding. Churning within each category would likely occur, with more IHEs experiencing funding increases than decreases. Table 6 illustrates the estimated impact on funding for IHEs in each category if base guarantees were removed. High-cost and very high-cost IHEs would benefit more from the elimination of base guarantees compared to other categories. If base guarantees were eliminated, funding increases would be seen by lower middle-cost and very high-cost IHEs, while funding would decrease for other categories. More than 92% of funding for FCCs in AY2004-2005 was allocated for base guarantees, indicating a significant impact on funding redistribution if base guarantees were removed. If base guarantees were eliminated, funding increases would be seen by lower middle-cost and very high-cost IHEs, while funding would decrease for other categories. Table 7 shows estimates of the number of IHEs in each category that would experience changes in allocations for FCCs. The distribution of campus-based funding allocations across categories of IHEs would shift if base guarantee funding is phased out. If base guarantees were phased out, funding allocation would shift to fair share criteria, benefiting higher-cost institutions. Eliminating base guarantees would result in increased funding for many institutions, especially those with higher costs. Fair share formulas calculate greater need for high-cost institutions, leading to more allocation increases than decreases overall. Higher-cost institutions would see allocation increases in greater proportions across categories. Modifying the calculation of institutional need could also impact fund distribution. Limiting FSEOG and Perkins Loan awards on a per-student basis could reduce variations in institutional need based on cost of attendance. Revising income categories in the Table of EFCs could lead to more accurate calculations of student need. Phasing out funding for institutional base could bring significant changes in fund distribution. The report suggests that changes in fund distribution across institutions could be achieved by phasing out funding for institutional base guarantees and modifying fair share allocation procedures. It also examines the distribution of aid to students under campus-based programs, showing differences in awards based on income and dependency status. The distribution of FSEOG aid awarded to students is presented in Table 8. The distribution of FSEOG aid at different cost institutions varies by income bands and dependency status. Very high-cost IHEs award an average of $2,460 to 20.0% of aid applicants, while low-cost IHEs provide $432 to 12.2% of applicants. FSEOG grants at very high-cost IHEs cover 8.3% of COA, compared to 6.1% at low-cost IHEs. Higher institutional COA allows for larger FSEOG awards to more students across income bands. At very high-cost institutions, a greater percentage of undergraduate dependent students from families with incomes between $42,000 and $60,000 receive FSEOG aid compared to lower-cost institutions. The average FSEOG awards at high-cost institutions are four times higher than those at low-cost institutions. This is significant because even after awarding aid to Pell Grant recipients, high-cost institutions often have funds left to provide aid to students with higher incomes. In the Pell Grant program, aid is mainly awarded to students at lower- and middle-cost institutions, with less than 10% going to high-cost and very high-cost institutions. Average Pell Grant amounts increase slightly as the cost of attendance rises. In the FSEOG program, the most aid recipients are at middle-cost institutions, with higher average awards at high-cost institutions. The proportion of students receiving FSEOG aid relative to Pell Grants and average FSEOG award amounts increase with average cost of attendance. At low-cost institutions, fewer students receive FSEOG awards compared to Pell Grants, with lower average award amounts. Conversely, at very high-cost institutions, more students receive FSEOG awards compared to Pell Grants, with average award amounts close to those of Pell Grants. Pell Grant aid is evenly distributed among eligible students regardless of institution, while FSEOG aid varies based on the institution's cost of attendance. The distribution of Federal Work-Study (FWS) aid varies based on the institution's cost of attendance, with students at high-cost institutions receiving larger awards. Undergraduate students typically receive FWS awards ranging from $1,093 to $1,673, while graduate and professional students at high-cost institutions receive an average of $2,961. The proportion of students receiving FWS awards differs across institutions, with graduate and professional students receiving substantially higher amounts. The value of Federal Work-Study (FWS) awards provided to students varies across different categories of institutions, with modest variation in award amounts due to the nature of the program being compensation for part-time employment. A national study during the 1997-1998 award year found that students worked an average of 11 hours per week and earned an average wage of $6.10 per hour, with small variations across institutions. The distribution of Federal Work-Study (FWS) aid varies based on institution type, size, and location. As institutional cost of attendance (COA) increases, the percentage of students receiving FWS aid also increases, but the proportion of COA covered by the award decreases. At low-cost institutions, only 3.5% of eligible students received FWS aid, with an average award of $1,517 covering 21.3% of median COA. At very high-cost institutions, 27.0% of eligible students received awards, but the average award of $1,590 covered only 5.4% of median COA. Perkins Loan aid distribution is similar to FWS, with slightly varying award amounts across COA categories for different student types. Graduate and professional students receive larger loans due to higher maximum loan amounts for them compared to undergraduates. For graduate and professional students, Perkins Loan aid is higher compared to undergraduates, with recipients at high-cost institutions receiving more aid. The average award covers 25.4% of median COA for low-cost institutions, but only 8.4% for very high-cost institutions. Institutions can participate in three campus-based programs. Institutions can participate in three campus-based programs - FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan. More than three-quarters of IHEs participate in both FSEOG and FWS programs, with over three-quarters of high-cost institutions participating in all three programs. Eligible students can receive awards from any program their institution participates in. Institutions participating in all three campus-based aid programs can access a larger pool of aid, benefiting students at higher-cost institutions. Analysis of aid combinations awarded to students is based on institutional COA, with only institutions participating in all three programs included for comparison. Higher-cost institutions have the highest participation rates in all three programs. Data on eligible applicants, recipients, aid percentages, and average award amounts by program are presented for each COA category. Among students attending institutions participating in all three campus-based programs, the proportion of students receiving aid and average aid amounts increased with the cost of attendance. At low-cost institutions, only 15.3% of students received aid with an average award of $1,086, covering 15.4% of the median COA. In contrast, at very high-cost institutions, 44.0% of students received aid with an average award of $3,228, covering 10.9% of the median COA. Graduate and professional students received larger awards on average than undergraduate students in any category. In the very high-cost category of institutions, 37.2% of undergraduate dependent students from families with incomes of $60,000 and above receive campus-based aid, with an average award of $2,127. Allocation procedures for campus-based aid were developed decades ago to address inequitable distribution of funds. The allocation procedures for campus-based aid were designed to distribute funds proportionally to student need. Despite proposals to phase out base guarantees, they continue to be the primary method for allocating funds. Recent discussions have focused on transitioning to a fair share allocation method based on student need. This report aims to explain the current allocation procedures and potential consequences of modifying them. The report details the allocation procedures for campus-based aid, focusing on funding distribution to institutions and students. Most funding is allocated based on institutional base guarantees, with some variation across institution categories and states. The FSEOG and FWS programs primarily use institutional base guarantees, while the Perkins Loan program relies entirely on them. The analysis shows that institutional cost of attendance (COA) is crucial in determining the amount of need calculated for each student under fair share formulas. COA varies widely among institutions, leading to significant differences in calculated need per student. High-cost institutions often exceed the maximum award amount and federal share in calculated need. Low-cost institutions mainly rely on the aggregate need of undergraduate independent and low-income dependent students, while higher-cost institutions focus on upper-income students' aggregate need. At higher-cost institutions, institutional need is largely the aggregate need of upper-income undergraduate dependent students and graduate and professional students. The prospect of eliminating the allocation of funds for institutional base guarantees in favor of fair share criteria was examined, showing a modest redistribution of funds across categories of IHEs based on COA. More institutions would receive an increase in funding than a decrease under this scenario for the FWS and Perkins Loan programs. Overall, more institutions would receive funding increases than decreases if base guarantees were eliminated. Analysis shows that high-cost institutions have a higher proportion of students receiving campus-based aid compared to low-cost institutions. Award amounts in the FSEOG program are larger at high-cost institutions, while in the FWS and Perkins Loan programs, awards are similar across institutions. Higher-cost institutions are more likely to participate in all three programs. The findings reveal that higher-cost institutions are more likely to participate in campus-based programs and provide larger awards to a higher proportion of students compared to lower-cost institutions. This highlights the relative nature of student financial need based on the institution's cost of attendance. Higher-cost institutions have greater institutional need per student, allowing them to offer larger awards. Higher-cost institutions provide larger awards to a higher proportion of students compared to lower-cost institutions, covering a smaller portion of the cost of attendance. This is due to the greater institutional need per student at higher-cost institutions."
