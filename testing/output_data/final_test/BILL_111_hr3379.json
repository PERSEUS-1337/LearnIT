The Act may be cited as the \"Lowering Oil Price Speculation for Infrastructure Dedicated to Economic Development Act of 2009\" or the \"LOPSIDED Oil Prices Act of 2009\". Congress finds that the price of oil has fluctuated significantly over the last decade, with prices exceeding $145 per barrel at one point. The price of oil peaked at $145 per barrel, up 1450 percent in 10 years. Despite rising demand, the price collapsed in 2008 to just over $30 a barrel. Economists attribute this to speculative trading in oil derivatives, making crude oil the most actively traded commodity futures contract. In 2008, NYMEX facilitated 52 million oil futures contracts. In 2008, NYMEX facilitated 52 million oil futures contracts, and in 2008 NYMEX facilitated 134 million oil futures contracts. Other exchanges have seen similar increases, and there is no accurate measure for over-the-counter trades. G8 finance ministers expressed concerns about commodity price volatility. Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Bart Chilton questioned high crude oil prices despite high supplies and low demand. Economists suggest a transaction tax on speculative trading to reduce oil price volatility. Economists suggest a transaction tax on speculative trading to reduce oil price volatility. James Tobin and Larry Summers support the idea, stating it would curb speculation and benefit the economy. A well-designed oil transaction tax could reduce oil price volatility without harming legitimate traders, helping with accurate price discovery. Revenue from oil transactions could be a valuable additional source of funds for the Highway Trust Fund. Tax on transactions in oil futures and options is proposed as a way to reduce oil price volatility and provide additional funds for the Highway Trust Fund. A tax is imposed on transactions in oil futures and options to reduce price volatility and fund the Highway Trust Fund. The tax rates are 0.2% for futures contracts and 0.5% for options. The tax is paid by the trading facility or the buyer if the transaction does not occur on a trading facility. The tax imposed on transactions in oil futures and options does not apply to commercial traders classified by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or financial institutions acting on their behalf, as long as the transaction is a bona fide hedging transaction. The term 'covered transaction' refers to the purchase or sale of an oil futures contract or option in the US or by a US person. An 'oil futures contract' is a sale contract for future oil delivery, while an 'oil option' is an option on an oil futures transaction. The Secretary will implement this section in consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will consult on the amendment regarding withholding in the tax code for covered oil futures transactions. SEC. 1447. WITHHOLDING OF TAX ON TRANSACTIONS IN OIL FUTURES AND OPTIONS. In the case of an acquisition of an oil futures contract or option by a foreign person, the transferor must withhold a tax equal to what would be imposed if the transferee were a US person. Tax revenues from these transactions are deposited into the Highway Trust Fund. Clerical amendments are made to the tax code. The tax code is amended by inserting a new item after the subchapter B section. The tax code is amended to include a new section for withholding tax on transactions in oil futures and options, effective from October 1, 2009."
