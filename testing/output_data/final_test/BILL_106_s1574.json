    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"The Fairness in Medicare Home Health Access Act of 1999\". Congress finds that home health care is crucial for Medicare beneficiaries, allowing them to stay in their homes and communities. However, the interim payment system has created payment disparities, penalizing efficient providers in rural areas and not adequately compensating for complex care. This has led to reduced access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. The interim payment system has reduced access to home health services for Medicare beneficiaries by forcing agencies to limit services, shrink service areas, or restrict treatment conditions. The Act aims to improve access for beneficiaries with high medical needs by allowing agencies to exclude certain services from payment limits and receive payment based on reasonable costs. The Act aims to prevent a 15 percent reduction in Medicare payments for home health services, reduce cost limits by 10 percent, address challenges in rural areas, and refine billing provisions for Medicare beneficiaries. The Act aims to prevent a 15 percent reduction in Medicare payments for home health services, reduce cost limits by 10 percent, address challenges in rural areas, and refine billing provisions for Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, there is a provision to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receiving durable medical equipment services do not face interruptions in care during home health episodes. The Act also eliminates the requirement for home health agencies to specify the length of service visits in 15-minute increments and urges the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a uniform process for disseminating information to ensure timely and accurate information for home health agencies and beneficiaries. SEC. 3. ADEQUATELY ACCOUNTING FOR THE NEEDS OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH ACUTE, MEDICALLY COMPLEX CONDITIONS. Waiver of Per Beneficiary Limits for Outliers in Home Health Services: Amends the Social Security Act to allow providers to exceed per beneficiary limits if they demonstrate to the Secretary that the cost significantly exceeded the limit due to providing appropriate services at a reasonable cost. The amendment allows home health agencies to exceed per beneficiary limits if the cost significantly exceeds the limit due to unusual variations in necessary care. The total additional payments to agencies cannot exceed 2 percent of the amounts that would have been paid without the amendment. Effective upon enactment, the amendment applies to applications for payment of reasonable costs for outliers submitted by home health agencies after October 1, 1999. The amendment eliminates the 15 percent contingency reduction in interim payments for home health services under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Additionally, there is a provision for a phase-in of the 15 percent reduction in prospective payments for home health services to protect Medicare beneficiaries' access to these services. The amendment eliminates the 15 percent reduction in interim payments for home health services and increases the per visit cost limit to 112 percent of the national median. SEC. 6. INCREASE IN PER VISIT COST LIMIT TO 112 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL MEDIAN. Amendment to the Social Security Act raises the per visit cost limit to 112 percent of the national median. The Social Security Act is amended to change payment procedures for durable medical equipment, ensuring separate payment for such items. The effective date of this amendment is specified. The effective date for the amendment regarding payment procedures for durable medical equipment is the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 8 amends Section 1895(c) of the Social Security Act to eliminate timekeeping requirements for home health agencies under the prospective payment system. The amendments made by subsection (a) will take effect on the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 9 expresses the Senate's concern about the timeliness and accuracy of intermediary communications to home health agencies. The Senate urges the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a uniform process for fiscal intermediaries and carriers to provide accurate payment information to home health agencies and Medicare beneficiaries."
