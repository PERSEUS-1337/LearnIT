    "content": "There are no paragraphs provided in the prev_chunk, so the curr_chunk cannot be summarized. Production Certificates under U.S. Note 5(h) of chapter 91 in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule are amended to require verification of wages and watch production in insular possessions for specific calendar quarters. Certificates must be issued to producers within 30 days after the end of each quarter. The term 'applicable amount' for Production Certificates under U.S. Note 5(h) of chapter 91 in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule is defined as 90 percent of the producer's creditable wages on watch assembly, with specific conditions for units produced per calendar year. The text chunk discusses the refund of duties for watches imported into the United States, based on the difference in duties between countries eligible for normal trade relations. A certificate issued under certain conditions allows the holder to secure the refund of duties. The certificate holder can secure refunds of duties on watches, watch movements, and parts imported into the US. Refunds are subject to Treasury Department regulations, with a maximum of 5% retained for Customs Service costs. The Secretary of the Treasury may authorize refunds on jewelry or other duties if watch-related tariffs are insufficient. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay the certificate holder the face value of the certificate, minus any duty refund claimed and a discount of up to 2%. The funds must be reinvested or used to support employment in the Virgin Islands. Payments will be made from duties collected on watches and watch movements. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay the certificate holder the face value of the certificate, minus any duty refund claimed and a discount of up to 2%. Payments will be made from duties collected on jewelry under chapter 71 or other appropriate duties. Amendments are made to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule regarding jewelry. Prior to February 9, 2003, jewelry assembled in the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa will be treated as a product of those territories for tariff purposes. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on April 1, 2001 for goods imported into the US customs territory on or after January 1, 2001."
