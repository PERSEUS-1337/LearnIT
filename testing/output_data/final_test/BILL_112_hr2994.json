Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2011 establishes a research and development program for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy, including advanced systems engineering, open standards development, data transfer to industry stakeholders, and incentives for industry compliance. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include the establishment of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology test facilities through competitive grants. Preference is given to existing facilities and Centers for testing these technologies. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology test facilities through competitive grants. Grants may support modification of existing facilities or construction of new test facilities. Program objectives include demonstrating a variety of technologies at each facility, among all facilities, and on different scales. Each test facility must provide infrastructure and resources. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology test facilities through competitive grants. Grants support evaluation, technical testing, research, development, and demonstration activities for eligible entities like nonprofit institutions, governments, universities, and National Laboratories. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology test facilities through competitive grants. Eligible entities must demonstrate the ability to combine expertise from various academic fields and partner with other entities to advance marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. SEC. 4. NATIONAL MARINE AND HYDROKINETIC RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION CENTERS. Section 634 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies in the research, development, and commercial application efforts of the Centers. The Centers will also serve as information clearinghouses for the industry by collecting and disseminating best practices. The Centers will manage marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies and may serve as technology test facilities established under section 633(c). SEC. 5. MARINE-BASED ENERGY DEVICE VERIFICATION PROGRAM. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to include a marine-based energy device verification program. The Secretary will establish a marine-based energy device verification program to support the development and evaluation of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy projects. This program aims to increase experience in marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy and deploy candidate devices for commercial use. The program aims to verify the performance, reliability, and cost of new marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy device designs, provide testing opportunities for stakeholders, and share project experiences for the benefit of the renewable energy development community. The program aims to resolve environmental issues in marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy development through robust characterization, impact prediction, monitoring, adaptive management, and informing engineering design for improved environmental performance. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include a new section on Adaptive Management and Environmental Grant Program (SEC. 636). This program focuses on resolving environmental issues in marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy development through various strategies. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish a grant program for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy development. Congress recognizes the potential of these technologies to reduce global warming and promote domestic energy production. The program aims to support eligible entities in advancing marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy projects. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish a grant program for marine hydrokinetic renewable energy development. The program aims to fund environmental analysis, gather necessary data, monitor project impacts, and advance renewable marine technologies. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 establishes a grant program for marine and hydrokinetic technologies in ocean and riverine environments. Entities must submit an application to the Secretary to be eligible for a grant. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 establishes a grant program for marine and hydrokinetic technologies in ocean and riverine environments. Section 7 amends the Act by adding a new section on administration. The Secretary must coordinate activities, collaborate with industry, stakeholders, federal agencies, academic institutions, and international bodies, and share research information publicly. The Secretary is required to provide reports to Congress on findings and activities related to supported technology, excluding information protected from disclosure. The reports must be submitted within one year of enactment and every two years thereafter. Authorization of appropriations for renewable energy activities under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is specified as $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2012 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2013. No funds are to be allocated for activities already receiving funds under a specific section of the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
