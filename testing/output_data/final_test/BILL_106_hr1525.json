SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON RETROACTIVE EMPLOYMENT TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. This section adds a new provision to the Internal Revenue Code regarding limitations on retroactive employment tax reclassifications. The text discusses rules regarding the classification of individuals as employees for employment tax purposes, with specific requirements that need to be met by the taxpayer. If these conditions are satisfied, the individual will not be considered an employee for tax purposes during the specified period, unless notified otherwise by the Secretary. The taxpayer must treat individuals in similar positions as not employees for employment tax purposes, file consistent tax returns, and meet safe harbor requirements. The taxpayer can be exempt from the employment tax requirement for an individual if they relied on a written determination or an IRS audit that confirmed the individual's non-employee status. The taxpayer may be exempt from employment tax if they received written confirmation or an IRS audit supporting the individual's non-employee status. The term 'substantial authority' is defined as in section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i), excluding private rulings to others and authority not addressing similar employment positions. Special rules apply regardless of the date of determination or audit. The taxpayer may not meet the safe harbor requirement if the treatment of an individual as not an employee contradicts any published regulation, Revenue Ruling, Revenue Procedure, or other authority issued by the Secretary at least 60 days before the period in question. This applies to the type of services performed by the individual or the industry they work in. The taxpayer can meet the safe harbor requirement for services performed by an individual in 2001 or 2002 if they would have a reasonable basis for not treating the individual as an employee under section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. An IRS officer must provide notice before any audit inquiry regarding the employment status of individuals working for the taxpayer. For services performed by individuals, the taxpayer must receive written notice of the provisions of this section. Safe harbors are available regardless of the individual's employee status. Definitions include employment tax, employment status, and taxpayer. The term \"entity\" refers to any entity liable for employment tax, including predecessors or successors. Determining a substantially similar position involves considering the relationship between individuals. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this section. Sec. 3511 limits retroactive employment tax reclassifications. The amendments apply to periods after December 31, 2000. SEC. 4 establishes a statute of limitations on assessment of employment taxes based on certain information returns filed. The amendment adds a new paragraph to section 6501 of the Internal Revenue Code, stating that certain information returns filed under section 6041 or 6041A for payments made to individuals for services will begin the limitation periods on employment taxes. This applies even if these payments are not considered in determining taxes imposed by chapters 21 and 24. The amendment made by this section applies to payments made after December 31, 2000 regarding taxes on services."
