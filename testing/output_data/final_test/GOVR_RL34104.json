    "content": "The report, State E-Government Strategies, was based on research conducted in 2005-2006 by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. It focused on e-government initiatives at various levels but highlighted the lack of coordination between them, leading to potential inefficiencies. Congress is actively overseeing e-government initiatives to address the lack of coordination between levels of government. State governments serve as laboratories for experimentation in e-government, providing useful examples for federal policymakers. Graduate students from the LBJ School of Public Affairs conducted research to identify best practices in e-government strategies and management at the state level. E-government involves using IT to integrate government information and services for various users. It is seen as an evolution of traditional governance, providing quick and efficient services to people. Federal and state e-government programs have evolved significantly since the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, e-government programs evolved significantly, reflecting changes in technology and attitudes towards government-citizen-business relationships. A report by students identified key factors influencing state e-government programs: essential strategies, controversial outsourcing policies, and funding challenges due to costly IT projects. Legislatures face decisions on multiple programs during budget processes. E-government development is influenced by state politics and culture, with funding competing with other needs. Strong leadership can drive IT improvements and support e-government programs. Centralization or decentralization plays a key role in e-government management. Web portal centralization is a common trend, separate from agency organization. Performance measures are essential for evaluating e-government program success. E-government performance measures are crucial for evaluating program success and addressing challenges. Surveys and site visits conducted by students at the LBJ School of Public Affairs provided valuable insights into e-government management and strategies. They sent surveys to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, receiving back 38 completed surveys. Site visits were conducted in six case study states, revealing e-government differences among states. Most e-government leaders have access to the state governor as needed. Most e-government leaders have access to the state governor as needed. States either outsource the majority of their projects or outsource very little. The state Chief Information Officer is the most frequent leader in state e-government initiatives. Multiple departments are involved in e-government, including Finance and Accounting Offices, IT Departments, and Information Resources Departments. States finance e-government from various sources, including operating budgets, federal funds, user fees, and capital funds. Some states express security concerns for citizens and agency employees. Many states are aware of legal restrictions on certain e-services. States use multiple performance measures for evaluating program success. States use various performance measures to track e-government programs, including customer satisfaction surveys and web tracking. Strategy documents used by states vary, such as IT Plans and IT business plans. Different states have different approaches to e-government initiatives, with some outsourcing development and others emphasizing in-house development or public-private partnerships. The report includes case studies on state e-government programs, highlighting leadership, strategy documents, implementation, funding, and state politics. Best practices for successful programs are discussed, emphasizing effective communication and diversified funding methods. The importance of strong leadership in advancing e-government initiatives is also highlighted, with variations in state strategies and involvement of multiple entities in the implementation process. The implementation of e-government involves creating centralized systems for citizens to access information through state web portals. While cost savings are a goal, actual savings may not be realized until later phases with a 30% adoption rate. Identifying e-government planning concepts can aid in comparing state programs and addressing management challenges. President George W. Bush has outlined new goals for government reform, including citizen-centric online governance and the establishment of the E-Government Fund. This initiative aims to empower individual citizens by increasing interagency cooperation and reducing redundant applications. The federal government has established USA.gov as the official gateway for federal information and services, facilitating citizen interaction. E-government oversight falls under the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform and the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security. Future legislation on e-government issues, such as citizen privacy, national security, intergovernmental coordination, funding, and management innovation, will be proposed by members of Congress. States have also implemented e-government programs to improve interactions with citizens. This report focuses on state government e-government policies and strategies, emphasizing management and effective practices. Service provision and site design are crucial for e-government implementation. The report examines critical factors for state e-government evaluation through a survey sent to state Chief Information Officers. It includes a detailed review of six case study states and communication with experts to refine survey questions. The students collaborated with policy specialists to develop survey questions for the study. They used various criteria to identify potential e-government best practices, assigned ratings to each criterion, and selected case study states based on evaluation results and guidance. Geographic dispersion, population, and demographics were also considered in the selection process. Interviews were conducted with public officials and contractors using a core set of questions. The students collaborated with policy specialists to develop survey questions for the study and conducted interviews with public officials and contractors using a core set of questions. They identified factors essential in understanding state e-government programs and different strategies used to achieve e-government goals. The collected documents include intra-agency communication documents, IT plans, and other relevant materials. Some states have e-government goals and strategies embedded in their documents, with a diverse set of strategies indicating no single successful formula. Vision, defined processes, strategies, and performance measures are necessary for achieving e-government goals. Outsourcing IT projects can be contentious, with the decision depending on the complexity of the program. Governments may rely on expertise from the private and nonprofit sectors for complex systems. Outsourcing IT projects in government agencies is common due to financial incentives, lack of funding or expertise, and the need for specialized services. This reliance on external expertise can lead to a loss of control and autonomy for bureaucratic agencies. Technology companies that have pre-developed software applications are often chosen for their cost-effectiveness compared to in-house development. Outsourcing e-government projects can lead to jurisdictional limitations and uncertainties about success. While cost savings are expected, upfront technology investments are significant. The competitive bidding process and politicization of outsourcing can undermine the original goals of e-government initiatives. Outsourcing e-government projects can create controversy within administrations and among citizens. Governments fund their e-government programs through various financing options, including user fees, general fund financing, and public-private partnerships. Darrell M. West highlights the challenges of funding e-government during times of limited resources, where expenditures for e-government compete with other essential services like education and healthcare. Proponents of e-government may struggle to prioritize it over basic social services like education, healthcare, and welfare. Public officials play a crucial role in enabling or hindering state e-government programs, but organizational culture and rapid technological changes can pose challenges. Public agencies are often resistant to change and may find it difficult to adopt new systems or retrain staff. Execution of e-government objectives requires strong leadership to overcome challenges such as lack of agency approval and enthusiasm for new IT programs. Leaders must champion e-government, increase stakeholder buy-in, and advocate for the benefits of IT reforms. They need to change the status quo within the office, encourage innovative thinking, and reinforce the agency's mission. The degree of centralization in e-government programs can vary, with a mix of centralized and decentralized processes. Centralized systems can help reduce variation and duplication in e-government systems, but success is not guaranteed by either system. The pendulum may swing back and forth between centralized and decentralized approaches depending on state culture, politics, and agency cultures. Centralized e-government systems use a web portal for integrated services, while decentralized systems give agencies more control over administration and content. Decentralized information is seen as more accurate and can promote better site management. The choice between centralized and decentralized systems depends on economic and political factors and stated objectives in e-government strategies. Performance measures are crucial for evaluating the cost efficiency and effectiveness of e-government services. Agencies can use quantitative and qualitative measures like site hits, user sessions, downloads, time spent on site, and cost savings related to overhead and operating costs. Evaluating how employees manage caseloads through face-to-face versus e-government interaction is also important. Performance measures are essential for evaluating e-government services, including how employees manage caseloads. Agencies can use detailed or broad measures that can be transferred within the agency. The survey analysis and case study sections highlight differences in e-government management on a state level. Future e-government programs must consider economic and political constraints. The evolution of e-government programs can vary based on a state's circumstances, sometimes skipping developmental phases. The Gartner Group Report from 2000 identified four phases of e-government development based on the level of information technology used by the government. It described key development stages for e-government programs and noted that few countries reach the final \"transformation\" stage due to economic and political reasons. Comparing programs at different stages can help researchers and policymakers understand the next steps for their programs. The report addresses issues in e-government implementation, including leadership, outsourcing, federal initiatives, strategy development, funding, legal and security issues, usage and performance measures. Information was collected from state government documents and surveys. Leadership is defined as the will of political leaders. Leadership in e-government implementation involves political leaders, management, and staff supporting electronic government services. Various government positions can provide leadership, such as governors, CIOs, and agency managers. Sixty-three percent of states have written e-government strategy documents. The survey focuses on state CIOs' interactions with governors. State CIOs have direct access to their governors, with nearly 60% affirming this access. About 80% of respondents meet with the governor regularly. IT outsourcing in state governments involves contracts with private companies for IT services like website maintenance and help desk functions. The survey revealed that state governments outsource varying percentages of their e-government services, with some states outsourcing none, while others outsource up to 100%. Further research could provide insights into the specific services outsourced and reasons behind outsourcing decisions, which could be valuable for federal policymakers considering initiatives like the President's Management Agenda. The survey explored the potential impact of federal e-government initiatives on state e-government programs, focusing on the influence of the President's Management Agenda. Question 4 in the survey asked respondents about their familiarity with the federal government's e-government strategy. The survey found that many senior-level IT authorities in state offices were not familiar with the federal government's e-government strategy. 52% of states considered the federal government only \"Somewhat Important,\" with some states not knowing about federal e-government initiatives. This suggests that the federal government's role is not significant for many states. The federal government's role in e-government is not significant for many states, with only a few states considering it important for their planning and execution. Various players are involved in establishing e-government strategy, with different models being used across states. Six out of 38 respondents had one actor establishing the strategy, with the CIO or governor often taking the lead. The federal government is seen as \"Extremely Important\" in e-government, with the most daily unique site visits to its state portal. Other entities involved in e-government strategy include the Department of Finance, State Legislature, Council on Electronic Commerce, and State Treasurer's Office. The state CIO is the most frequent manager of state e-government, but other actors such as private contracted businesses, Comptroller, Department of Accounting and General Services, Department of Administration, and Department of Budget and Management are also involved. The close relationship between information technology and finance/accounting departments in e-government indicates a focus on online services and transactions. Funding for e-government initiatives is a key concern, with IT projects often overlooked in favor of social welfare priorities. The survey on funding methods did not include specific dollar amounts spent on services or applications. The survey on funding methods for e-government initiatives revealed that the state general fund/operating budget is the most common source of funding, with many states using multiple funding sources. IT equipment acquisitions and e-government initiatives are often combined in government financial statements. The funding models for e-government initiatives vary among states, with some states having unique approaches such as self-funding through fees or data sales to private industries. Federal government funding is also a common source, impacting state resources significantly. User fees are a significant funding model for e-government initiatives, with 22 out of 38 respondents utilizing them. However, implementing user fees may lead to a temporary decrease in adoption rates. Security concerns regarding personal information are increasing as more transactions are conducted online. Additionally, almost one-fourth of respondents outsource 50-100% of their portal management. The survey included questions about states' actions to ensure privacy and security of citizen information, with most states reporting employee training and encryption as top security measures. 50% of respondents use digital signatures, and over 40% were unaware of legal restrictions on online e-government activities. Some states have statutes limiting online services, like Iowa, which faces hurdles in providing certain services online. Iowa faces legal hurdles in providing online services due to signature requirements and credit card industry practices. Privacy, security, and identity issues also pose obstacles. In contrast, Idaho has no planned services restricted by legal barriers but some documents are not available online for privacy and security reasons. Connecticut's primary barrier to online services in the past was financial, with fees set by statute. The main legal barrier to online services in states like Iowa and Connecticut is the financial aspect, with fees set by statute. Agencies may struggle to cover costs of credit card transactions. Providing e-services securely, especially for documents needing signatures, is a key challenge. States focus on marketing their web presence and measuring performance, but determining the return on investment is difficult without usage and adoption rates for online services. Promoting an online presence is crucial for state governments to increase usage by citizens, businesses, and public agencies. States use various methods such as print advertising, email announcements, radio, television, and direct mail to promote their web portals. Marketing specific applications to target groups is effective, with examples like Kentucky Interactive educating different associations about online license renewals. States also use customer satisfaction surveys and feedback as performance measures. Almost 74% of respondents use e-government web traffic metrics to gather data on website traffic. Cost benefit analyses and return on investments are also common measures. Tracking popular pages and listening to customer feedback through surveys and requests are seen as beneficial for continuous improvement. Oregon publicly monitors its online presence with a specific web page showing visitor numbers by week. Oregon publicly monitors its online presence through a web page displaying web traffic metrics, including visitor numbers by week, visits, time spent per visit, top entry and exit pages, and downloads. Adoption rates are also tracked to measure online service usage and ensure customer expectations are met. Marketing plans can drive up adoption rates, but feedback on service functionality is crucial for success. The study analyzed how states utilize strategy documents for e-government initiatives by researching all 50 states' websites and interviewing high-level state officials. It found that over 60% of states have comprehensive IT strategic plans and policy documents, with a variety of authors including technology councils, CTO/CIO offices, governors' offices, and private businesses. These plans range from specific e-government goals to general IT strategies. Statewide IT policies, information management plans, and IT business plans are received from states or found on state websites to track progress and monitor government agencies. Some strategy documents are outdated, with officials noting the challenge of keeping up with technology advancements. Kentucky and Utah officials question the value of maintaining glossy strategy documents given the rapid pace of innovation and implementation. Despite varying approaches to strategy documents for e-government programs, success hinges on effective implementation, state culture, and stakeholder involvement. California faced IT procurement issues but continues to push forward with e-government initiatives, such as a costly software contract with Oracle in 2001. The $95 million Oracle contract for state employee computers was awarded without a needs assessment, leading to problems. The state CIO was suspended, the DOIT was eliminated, and the Oracle contract was canceled. The demise of the DOIT was described as unprecedented, with Assemblyman Dean Florez calling it unique. Following the Oracle issues and the dissolution of the DOIT by the California Legislature, the governor issued an executive order in 2002 to reassign responsibilities to other state agencies. In 2003, efforts to restructure IT in California began with support from the Office of the Governor, legislature, and cabinet secretaries. A CIO was appointed in 2002, but currently lacks budgetary and policy authority, hindering the implementation of e-government services. There is a consensus that the state CIO should have IT budget and policy authority to effectively oversee the state's e-government plan. Planning for IT programs in California resumed in 2003. In 2003, IT programs in California resumed with the release of the first strategic plan in 2004. The plan included six goals to improve services, efficiency, security, workforce development, and governance structure. The 2006 strategic plan maintained these goals with the aim of \"doing IT right.\" The 2006 strategic plan in California outlines objectives such as promoting data sharing, leveraging geospatial assets, developing a health information exchange, expanding broadband access, and implementing performance measures. The plan includes specific dates for action items and emphasizes the transition from planning to execution. The IT Council recommends statewide IT initiatives and consists of information officers. The IT Council in California recommends statewide IT initiatives and consists of information officers and representatives from various state agencies. Despite the challenges of decentralized implementation, California offers a range of online services that have been well-received by residents, such as online tax filing, DMV appointment-setting, and traffic citation payments. Residents have found these services to be a timesaver. Residents in Sacramento have found online government services to be a timesaver, with a high success rate in completing transactions online. The state CIO aims to reduce time spent on government transactions, with vital records already available online. The Department of Education also supports electronic systems for state agencies. The Department of Education supports electronic systems for state agencies, such as the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) to track academic achievement. The California State Employees Union (CSEU) limits outsourcing, negotiating with the state to ensure its utilization. The CSEU negotiated with the state to minimize outsourcing of IT projects, citing collective bargaining unit contracts as obstacles. Suggestions were made for policy and process changes to allow more flexibility in outsourcing. The current process involves multiple departments and can take up to two years, leading to delays in utilizing newer technologies. Financing for IT projects in California follows a similar process as in other states, with projects funded through the state's budget process and finance department. The Department of Information Technology (DOIT) in California was eliminated, leading to decentralized funding for IT initiatives. Subgroups of department CIOs conduct collaborative research and make recommendations to the IT Council, whose decisions are advisory. The lead person for each agency serves on the council and has decision authority within their agency. Approved projects move forward with funding from the Department of Finance, state legislature, and governor through the budget process. The Department of Finance, state legislature, and governor approve funding for state IT services through the budget process. The procurement for IT services is done by the Department of General Services. The process of screening new programs through a benefit/cost analysis can take up to two to three years. E-government initiatives may be financed through means other than state funding, such as federal formula assistance or competitive grant programs. California's IT system is currently decentralized. California's IT system in California is highly decentralized, with each agency having a CIO who is a member of the IT Council. The IT Council provides guidance to the State CIO, makes IT recommendations for implementation, and considers issues initiated by the State CIO. Planning is identified as the first step in e-government development, followed by implementation to achieve set goals. Buy-in strategies are used to promote e-government initiatives. The e-government leaders in California emphasize the importance of non-partisanship in promoting the plan within the state legislature. Strong collaboration among agencies, exemplified by the IT Council, allows for successful implementation of e-government strategies. The governor's support provides high-level leadership for advocating and promoting initiatives at different government levels. Consolidation of California's two largest data centers has been a top priority with strong support from the governor and state CIO. Enterprise portal projects benefit from strong enterprise support, especially when backed by all three branches of government. Strong leadership, such as from the governor, can drive broader acceptance and faster growth in IT initiatives. Governor Ernie Fletcher in Kentucky has emphasized the economic benefits of Internet broadband availability through his Prescription for Innovation plan, which helps coordinate efforts from various parties to develop services and promote citizen computer use. Kentucky lacks a statewide e-government strategy document, but the governor's plan, along with county strategic plans facilitated by ConnectKentucky, is seen as a suitable overall strategy for the state. Kentucky Interactive, ConnectKentucky, and the Commonwealth Office of Technology are interconnected through the governor's initiative. Governor Ernie Fletcher's Prescription for Innovation in Kentucky focuses on improving IT factors like security, services to citizens, and reducing costs while enhancing value. ConnectKentucky plays a key role in developing the e-government strategy outlined in the plan, which sets aggressive goals for broadband deployment and technology adoption. The plan serves as a framework for all planning groups to work together towards its implementation. The plan set aggressive goals for broadband deployment and technology adoption in Kentucky, aiming to make broadband available to all by 2007, improve computer and internet adoption, develop online applications for various sectors, and establish local eCommunity Leadership Teams. Kentucky, being largely rural, faced challenges in increasing broadband availability and government online presence. Governor's plan successful, leading to Kentucky leading in broadband adoption growth according to FCC report. The rate of broadband adoption in Kentucky has increased significantly over the past two years, with 77% of households having access to broadband by the end of 2005. This growth is attributed to Governor Fletcher's Prescription for Innovation implemented through ConnectKentucky, which works with local community leaders to develop county strategic plans for technology-based growth and economic development. ConnectKentucky engages in various strategic activities to assist in the adoption of appropriate technology applications. Kentucky's approach to technology involves strategic adoption of applications to enhance economic vitality, project management for successful implementation, and investment encouragement. The collaborative effort includes the COT, Kentucky Interactive, LLC, and ConnectKentucky, with the COT overseeing IT projects and system management. The COT oversees IT projects, focusing on back-end system management such as IT security, data storage, and voice communication networks. The commissioner manages e-government infrastructure and grants autonomy in portal management to Kentucky Interactive. State agencies can request online services through the COT or directly to Kentucky Interactive, with the portal manager prioritizing projects under the oversight of the Commissioner's office. Kentucky Interactive, a subsidiary of NIC, Inc., manages the state portal for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. They aim to increase public information access and online transactions. ConnectKentucky, a not-for-profit alliance, was formed in 2000 to promote technology in the state. ConnectKentucky, established in 2000 by Governor Paul Patton, collaborates with the government to track technology progress in Kentucky. They also lead e-government initiatives and focus on grassroots involvement for effective state IT planning. Governor Fletcher later tasked ConnectKentucky with leading his Prescription for Innovation program. At the local level, ConnectKentucky empowers citizens to develop an online presence for local government through a collaborative process involving local leaders and various stakeholders. This initiative aims to enhance e-government services tailored to the specific needs of each county, fostering a sense of ownership and excitement about projects. Brian Mefford, President and CEO of ConnectKentucky, emphasizes the importance of independence and public/private partnerships in this innovative strategy. President and CEO of ConnectKentucky, Brian Mefford, emphasizes the importance of independence and public/private partnerships in e-government in Kentucky. The state portal, Kentucky.gov, benefits from a true public-private partnership with Kentucky Interactive, LLC, a subsidiary of NIC. This partnership allows for the integration of proven applications in a shorter time frame, thanks to shared knowledge and resources from other states where NIC operates. Kentucky Interactive, LLC, a subsidiary of NIC, finances its own research and development for new applications through enhanced access fees. This self-funding model encourages the development of a wide range of free services that benefit the public. The partnership with the Commonwealth focuses on building online services that constituents want, efficiently creating new services, and driving e-government adoption through marketing activities. Increased online service adoption is crucial for the private partner due to the reliance on fees. Increased online service adoption is crucial for the private partner as fees drive the return on investment. The Commonwealth renewed its e-government services contract with Kentucky Interactive for two more years, with the possibility of renewal for three additional two-year periods. If the contract is not renewed, Kentucky Interactive can grant a perpetual use license to the Commonwealth for the software-based applications. Kentucky Interactive will own the intellectual property rights to the software and continue to receive revenue from the applications developed during the term of the contract. The \"All State Agency Contract\" with Kentucky Interactive allows public agencies and offices to use the contract without going through an RFP process every time they want to provide a new service. Kentucky Interactive works directly with state agencies and local government to develop personalized services and websites with a common look and feel. The end result is an aesthetically fluid state portal with the new state brand incorporated on nearly every page. Kentucky Interactive creates and manages websites for state and local government agencies, providing content management tools and training for agencies to maintain their own sites. Employees can make various content changes after receiving training on the tools. Kentucky Interactive partners with NIC to provide e-government services, allowing employees to update websites without bureaucratic processes. The state has existing infrastructure for expanding e-government, prioritizing secure systems and widespread access. The governor supports a comprehensive strategy involving various stakeholders.

Kentucky's regional approach focuses on target marketing to drive adoption rates for online services. ConnectKentucky's marketing strategy emphasizes availability, affordability, awareness, applications, and adoption. The state's information technology foundation is crucial for the continued effectiveness of state government. The CIO under the Executive Office of Administration and Finance is responsible for setting IT standards, reviewing and approving IT strategic plans, managing central IT systems, and coordinating e-government initiatives within the executive department. The Information Technology Division (ITD) includes subdivisions like Operational Services, Portal and Customer Outreach, Applications Services, and Enterprise Security, each with its own management structure. The ITD and the CIO, although part of the Executive Department, do not influence IT planning in other branches and constitutional offices due to the separation of powers. However, they have collaborated on multibranch efforts to address IT issues. The CIO reports to the Secretary of Administration and Finance and can influence key policy initiatives. IT leadership involves input from all stakeholders, not just the CIO. The IT Commission advises the CIO on IT governance, involving key stakeholders like the Department of Revenue and Health and Human Services. A 75-member E-Government Task Force led by the governor published the \"E-Gov Strategic Plan\" in March 2001, outlining the long-term vision for e-government services. The \"E-Gov Strategic Plan\" outlined the long-term vision and roadmap for e-government services in the Commonwealth, with additional guidance provided by the Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM) and the IT Commission's \"Enterprise IT Strategy.\" The \"IT Strategy\" guides the Commonwealth's IT initiatives, addressing challenges such as e-government services, homeland security, economic environment, and leadership transitions. Massachusetts aims to improve coordination among governmental agencies through open standards, ensuring interoperability and uniformity in technology and decision-making. The Commonwealth aims for uniformity in technology and decision-making across agencies, considering all possible alternatives including open source solutions. Massachusetts has no defined benchmarks but is interested in subjects that impact how agencies manage Mass.Gov and e-government. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts focuses on uniformity in technology and decision-making across agencies, with an interest in how agencies manage Mass.Gov and e-government. They consider various performance measures, including user satisfaction and ease of operation, and look to other states like Utah, Texas, and Virginia for peer examples. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts utilizes a combination of in-house and outsourced approaches for IT project implementation. They have an office within the Application Services group for small to mid-sized projects, but engage IT vendors for solutions requiring specific expertise. Jobs that can be done by state employees are not outsourced due to the 1993 Privatization Law. The Pacheco Law, introduced by State Senator Marc Pacheco, raises concerns about e-government funding and demographic changes in Massachusetts. With an aging population of 1.85 million citizens aged 62 or older, the ITD must find creative ways to provide services with potential budget cuts. Currently, ITD finances projects through legislative appropriations, IT bonds, and charge-back fees, constantly seeking efficient strategies to meet agency IT needs. The Massachusetts government is working on a framework of guidelines and open standards to improve interoperability among its agencies for e-government services. While the implementation of e-government is currently decentralized, efforts are being made towards greater integration. The CIO and ITD are trying to coordinate agencies, but not all are on board yet. Agencies will be more convinced when they see the effectiveness of open standards. Massachusetts government focuses on efficiency and facilitation through Mass.Gov, enabling citizens to interact with multiple government organizations on one platform. Open standards policy prevents the need for constant re-architecting, promoting coordination and cost-effectiveness. The state seeks efficient IT solutions, utilizing private vendors or open source software for flexibility. ITD maintains in-house decision-making without outsourcing management workload. The ITD does not outsource management workload, only money transfer transactions. Mass.Gov aims to provide easy access to frequently requested services. ITD promotes cross-agency coordination for open standards and cooperation. Effective planning and management are crucial for judicious use of taxpayer funds in IT initiatives. The Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) manages IT initiatives for the state government, focusing on efficient operations and reaching constituencies. The DIR Board of Directors, led by the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Larry Olson, oversees strategy and performance quarterly. The DIR Director, along with the Board led by the CTO, provides leadership for a large enterprise portal project in Texas. The governor plays an interested role but does not lead actively. Despite a decentralized system, the DIR maintains a working relationship with the governor's office, sharing IT and e-government ideas for mutual benefit. The DIR has authored the State Strategic Plan FY2005-FY2009.

The DIR is responsible for procurement and management of technical services to support agency execution, reducing overall costs. Texas maintains a unique public-private partnership with BearingPoint for managing online content, with an exit strategy designed to expire in 2009, giving Texas ownership while generating revenue for the state. TexasOnline generates revenue for the state of Texas through user fees for online service transactions, with cumulative revenue expected to exceed $3.4 billion by September 2006. The site receives over two million unique visitors monthly and has collected over $35 million in unappropriated general revenue by 2009. Non-revenue generating services like veteran's affairs and voter registration are supported by fee-for-service transactions. Texas House Bill (HB) 1516, passed in 2005, mandates the DIR to negotiate statewide contracts for hardware, software, and technology services with outside vendors to reduce IT costs, maximize value, and create common IT procurement processes. All state agencies are required to procure necessary items through DIR centrally-negotiated contracts. The Texas Legislative Budget Board estimates that HB1516 will have a two-year net positive impact of $15,436,963 towards the state's general revenue. Texas has a decentralized governance system without a cabinet, leading to challenges in coordinating state technological initiatives. The Department of Information Resources (DIR) has been working to integrate different agencies under shared applications while maintaining individual agency autonomy. The Department of Information Resources (DIR) in Texas has a centralized management structure, but its relationship with BearingPoint creates a more decentralized overall setup. The DIR's internal hierarchy includes a head, the CTO, and five main divisions. BearingPoint manages day-to-day portal activities and marketing, with final budget and project decisions made by the DIR Board of Directors, a body that includes input from the public and private sectors, non-profits, and academia. The DIR delegates responsibilities to smaller internal bodies to focus on the Board of Directors' initiatives.

The DIR focuses on management and decision-making, achieving cost minimization and profit maximization through the partnership. They maintain control over intellectual property rights while providing technical support for state agencies to pursue their mission objectives. Texas has studied online services to identify potential cost savings, such as saving $1.9 million with a 30 percent adoption rate for online tax services. The Texas Department of Agriculture has studied adoption rates in relation to cost savings, with potential savings of up to $6.3 million at a 100 percent adoption rate. Utah's IT strategic direction is based on articulated strategies and business plans, aiming to optimize both state-wide and local agency needs. Former Governor Mike Leavitt championed e-government incorporation in state governance as early as 1993, leading to the creation of the Utah Information Technology Commission (ITC) encompassing all three branches of government. The Utah Technology Commission (UTC) was formed from the Information Technology Commission (ITC) to propose legislation for transparent and efficient government. The Product Management Council, consisting of state agency product managers, collaborates with the CIO on e-government initiatives. Key actors in e-government strategy development include the Product Management Council, business leaders, and the CIO. The CIO works with the Product Management Council to develop the state's e-government strategic direction. The CIO and Product Management Council collaborate on e-government initiatives, monitoring state services and agency perspectives.
