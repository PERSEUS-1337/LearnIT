    "content": "UNRWA, established in 1949, provides relief assistance and programs for Palestinian refugees. Its mandate has been renewed annually since 1950, currently extended to June 2005. UNRWA offers relief and social services to over 4.1 million registered Palestine refugees in various countries, operating approximately 900 facilities and managing microfinance and infrastructure projects. Not all registered refugees receive all benefits, and only one third live in camps. Services are provided directly to beneficiaries in coordination with public services. UNRWA provides relief assistance and social services to over 4.1 million registered Palestine refugees. It has developed a human development program to address their ongoing needs. The organization is a subsidiary of the United Nations, with the Commissioner General reporting directly to the General Assembly. The United States is a member of the 10-member Advisory Commission overseeing UNRWA's operations. The United States participates in semi-annual reviews of the UNRWA program and budget, funded mostly by voluntary contributions. Funds support education, health, relief services, and operational costs. Refugees also contribute through co-payments and self-help projects. The UNRWA's budget for CY 2003 is $344 million, with over half allocated to education and health programs. UNRWA's budget is mostly funded by donors, with over half allocated to education and health programs. Recent internal changes have improved resource management. The Department of State's PRM assists refugees worldwide with services ranging from basic needs to community projects. Refugee protection and quick impact projects are key programs funded by the regular Migration and Refugee Assistance budget. The regular Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account through PRM funds refugee emergencies lasting over a year. The MRA includes Overseas Refugee Assistance, Refugee Admissions, Humanitarian Migrants to Israel, and Administration. UNRWA receives funding under Overseas Refugee Assistance, primarily through contributions to international organizations and private voluntary organizations. U.S. contributions to UNRWA come from the regular MRA account and the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) account for refugee emergencies. The U.S. contributes to UNRWA through the regular MRA account and the ERMA account for refugee emergencies. The FY2004 MRA account request is $760.2 million, with $555.95 million for Overseas Refugee Assistance and $102.32 million for the Near East. U.S. funding usually covers 22-25% of UNRWA's total budget. See the table below for historical U.S. contributions to UNRWA. The Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, provides legislative authority for U.S. refugee relief programs. UNRWA appeals for additional contributions to cover emergency expenses and emphasizes the importance of consistent funding. The volatile situation in Gaza and the West Bank has increased demands on UNRWA's emergency and refugee assistance. The escalating violence in Gaza and the West Bank has disrupted humanitarian deliveries and affected UNRWA staff's security. The budget for UNRWA, funded by voluntary contributions, fluctuates based on timing and exchange rates. Deteriorating socio-economic conditions have led to rising unemployment and poverty, increasing demands on UNRWA's services. The humanitarian crisis in the occupied Palestinian territory is evident in deteriorating health conditions, poverty, and displacement. The deteriorating health conditions, rising poverty, and displacement of Palestinians in the Palestinian territory have particularly affected refugees. Concerns have been raised about the lack of efforts to permanently settle the refugees, with some questioning the accuracy of refugee rolls. While UNRWA provides relief and social services, it does not focus on resettlement. There are suggestions that the UNHCR might be better suited to provide ongoing assistance and pursue long-term solutions for the refugees. However, a settlement between Palestinians and Israelis is seen as necessary for any lasting resolution. The Palestinians argue for a return to their homes or compensation based on U.N. Resolution 194, while Israelis believe the international community should find a solution as they did not cause the displacement. Concerns have been raised in Congress about ensuring UNRWA funds are used appropriately and not for terrorist activities. Refugee camps are controlled by host countries, not UNRWA, and efforts are being made to ensure UNRWA programs comply with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. UNRWA is required to comply with Section 301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and report to Congress by November 1, 2003. Concerns have been raised about the content of textbooks used by UNRWA, with claims of promoting anti-Semitism. The host country provides the textbooks, not UNRWA, as students must take exams in host country degree programs. In addition, the Secretary of State is required to report to Congress on procedures to enforce section 301(c) to the fullest extent possible. In a House debate, an amendment was proposed to withhold one third of the funding to UNRWA until textbooks promoting anti-Semitism were replaced. The amendment also called for UNRWA to establish a refugee resettlement program, but it failed on a point of order."
