    "content": "DISPOSITION OF WEAPONS-USABLE PLUTONIUM AT SAVANNAH RIVER SITE, AIKEN, SOUTH CAROLINA. Congress finds that in September 2000, the US and Russia signed an agreement to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium. This agreement is crucial for safeguarding nuclear materials and preventing their misuse. The Department of Energy plans to convert this plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel for commercial nuclear power reactors by the end of 2019. The Department has a plan in place to implement this agreement with Russia through the construction of necessary facilities. The United States and the State of South Carolina have a strong interest in the safe and efficient operation of plutonium disposition facilities at the Savannah River Site, including a fuel fabrication facility and a pit disassembly and conversion facility. South Carolina aims to ensure safe storage of transferred plutonium, maximize economic benefits from the MOX facility, and expedite processing or removal of defense plutonium materials at the site. The Secretary of Energy must submit a plan to Congress by February 1, 2003, for the construction and operation of the MOX facility at the Savannah River Site. The plan should include a schedule to achieve the MOX production objective by January 1, 2009, and process 34 metric tons of defense plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel by January 1, 2019. Additionally, annual reports on the facility's operations must be submitted to Congress starting in 2004. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the MOX production plan, including assessments of compliance with production objectives and progress towards meeting obligations under the Plutonium Management Agreement. Reports after 2017 must also address compliance with production objectives and plans for achieving them if not met. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the MOX production plan. If construction or operation at the MOX facility is behind schedule by 12 months or more, corrective actions must be implemented to ensure meeting production objectives. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the MOX production plan. Corrective actions with milestones are required to address delays in achieving production objectives. If milestones are not met, transfers of defense plutonium to the MOX facility will be suspended until the risk is addressed and production objectives can be met by 2009. The Secretary will suspend transfers of defense plutonium to the MOX facility until production objectives can be met. A report on options for removing plutonium from South Carolina will be submitted to Congress. If the MOX production objective is not achieved by January 1, 2009, the Secretary will remove defense plutonium from South Carolina for storage or disposal elsewhere. This includes transferring a certain amount of plutonium by specific deadlines if production goals are not met. Economic/impact assistance will also be provided. If the MOX production objective is not achieved by January 1, 2011, economic/impact assistance will be provided to South Carolina until the goal is met or defense plutonium is removed. If by January 1, 2017, the MOX facility has not processed a specified amount of mixed-oxide fuel, additional measures will be taken. If the MOX production objective is not achieved by January 1, 2011, economic assistance will be provided to South Carolina until the goal is met or defense plutonium is removed. If by January 1, 2017, the MOX facility has not processed a specified amount of mixed-oxide fuel, additional measures will be taken, including payment of economic assistance to the State of South Carolina. If the MOX facility fails to process the required amount of defense plutonium by July 1 of each year starting from 2020, a plan must be submitted to Congress to either complete the processing or remove an equivalent amount of plutonium from South Carolina. The MOX facility at the Savannah River Site must remove any remaining mixed-oxide fuel one year after ceasing operations. The Secretary must report to Congress on transferring the fuel for commercial use or removing it from South Carolina. The MOX production objective is defined as producing at least one metric ton of mixed-oxide fuel per year from defense plutonium. The MOX facility at the Savannah River Site produces mixed-oxide fuel at a determined rate for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The facility is defined as the mixed-oxide fuel fabrication facility in Aiken, South Carolina. The term \"defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials\" refers to weapons-usable plutonium. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board will study the adequacy of the K-Area Materials Storage facility for storing defense plutonium in connection with the disposition program. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board will study the suitability of KAMS for monitoring stored plutonium and related materials, including provisions for remote monitoring and retrieval. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board will assess the adequacy of KAMS for monitoring and handling stored plutonium and related materials, including recommendations to enhance safety and functionality. The Secretary and the Board will provide reports to Congress on actions taken in response to these recommendations."
