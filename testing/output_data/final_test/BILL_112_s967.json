The Act titled the \"Regulation of Mortgage Servicing Act of 2011\" defines key terms related to foreclosure, borrowers, covered foreclosure actions, the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, and independent reviewers. The Act \"Regulation of Mortgage Servicing Act of 2011\" defines key terms related to foreclosure, borrowers, covered foreclosure actions, the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, and independent reviewers. An independent reviewer is an entity with expertise to determine borrower eligibility for loan modification programs, including entities not servicers and divisions within servicers independent of those making modification decisions. Loan modification programs are procedures designed to change loan terms. Loan modification programs are designed to change mortgage terms in case of default, delinquency, or imminent default/delinquency of a borrower. This includes programs established by the Federal Government and servicers. A mortgage is a federally related loan secured by a lien on residential property. The term \"servicer\" refers to a person responsible for servicing a pool of mortgages, with the same meaning as in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. SEC. 3. SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT. A servicer must assign a case manager to each borrower seeking a loan modification or alternative to foreclosure. The case manager manages communication, decides on borrower eligibility, is available during business hours, and stays assigned until the borrower accepts a modification, faces foreclosure, or other specified events. The servicer assigns a case manager to borrowers seeking loan modifications or alternatives to foreclosure. The case manager communicates with borrowers, determines eligibility, and remains available by phone and email. Additionally, a servicer may assign an employee to assist the case manager. Before foreclosure, eligibility for loan modification program or alternative must be determined. Before initiating a covered foreclosure action, a servicer must review the borrower's file, make efforts to determine eligibility for a loan modification or alternative to foreclosure, and offer such options if eligible. Additionally, a servicer must suspend a covered foreclosure action initiated before a certain date. The Act requires servicers to review borrower files, determine eligibility for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure, notify borrowers, and offer options. During suspension, servicers cannot send foreclosure notices or schedule property sales. The servicer is not required to suspend a foreclosure action if reasonable efforts have been made to determine borrower eligibility for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure, and documentation shows information was not received before the end of the applicable period. The servicer is not obligated to delay an unavoidable foreclosure, such as when a borrower abandons the property. To determine borrower eligibility for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure, the servicer must make reasonable efforts within a 30-day period, including multiple phone calls at different times of the day. The servicer must make reasonable efforts to contact the borrower within a 30-day period, including sending written notices and requesting necessary information for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure. The servicer must contact the borrower within 30 days to request necessary information for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure. If the borrower does not provide the requested information within 30 days, a written request must be sent, giving the borrower an additional 15 days to submit the required information. If the borrower does not provide requested information within 15 days of the servicer's request, the servicer will notify the borrower of their intent to start or continue a foreclosure action. SEC. 5. Before denying a borrower a loan modification or alternative to foreclosure, a servicer must have an independent reviewer assess the borrower's file for eligibility. SEC. 6. Violating this Act will prevent a foreclosure action, but compliance allows the servicer to proceed with foreclosure. SEC. 7. Regulations will be implemented. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, the Director, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of the Treasury, will issue regulations to implement the Act. Additionally, within 1 year of enactment, the Director must submit a report to Congress evaluating the Act's impact on State law and communication between servicers and borrowers, as well as detailing any implementation issues."
