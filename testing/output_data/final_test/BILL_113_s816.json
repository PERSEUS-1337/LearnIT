    "content": "The Act titled \"Stewardship End Result Contracting Project Act\" is introduced, amending the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to include provisions for Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects. The Act introduces definitions for 'Chief' and 'Director', and defines 'eligible land' as land west of the 100th meridian. The Chief and Director can enter into stewardship contracting projects for land management goals on eligible land, including road and trail maintenance for water quality. The Act allows for stewardship contracting projects on eligible land west of the 100th meridian. These projects can include activities such as prescribed fires, vegetation removal, watershed restoration, wildlife and fish maintenance, and control of noxious weeds. Agreements or contracts for these projects are selected based on best value considerations. The Act allows stewardship contracting projects on eligible land west of the 100th meridian, including activities like prescribed fires, vegetation removal, and wildlife maintenance. Contracts can be considered for the sale of property under terms set by the Secretary of Agriculture, with a maximum term of 10 years. The Chief and the Director may use the value of timber or forest products removed as an offset against the cost of services received under the agreement. Appraisal methods must be appropriate to the quantity of products and contracts. The Chief and the Director may collect monies from an agreement or contract under subsection (b) if the collection is a secondary objective of negotiating. The Chief and the Director can collect monies from agreements or contracts under subsection (b) for project site expenditure without further appropriation. Services received under stewardship contracts are valued, and payments/resources provided by the contractor, Chief, or Director are not affected by other laws. The Knutson-Vanderberg Act does not apply to agreements or contracts under subsection (b). The Chief may collect deposits from a contractor for the costs of removal of timber or forest products. The Chief and Director may require performance and payment guarantees. The Chief and the Director may require performance and payment bonds in an amount sufficient to protect the government's investment in receipts generated by the contractor from forest products. If the forest products' value exceeds resource improvement costs, they can collect residual receipts and use the excess for other stewardship projects. The Chief and the Director will establish a monitoring and evaluation process for stewardship projects involving various participants, including governmental agencies and interested groups. They are required to report annually to specific committees on the progress of these projects. The Chief and the Director will report annually to Congress on the development and results of agreements or contracts related to stewardship projects, including the involvement of local communities. Section 347 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 is repealed."
