    "content": "Recent congressional discussions on patent system reform have included provisions to restrict the types of inventions eligible for patents. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to prohibit patenting tax planning methods and business methods. Previous bills also sought to ban patents related to genetic materials. Despite these efforts, none of the legislation has been passed. The current law requires inventions to consist of a \"process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\" to be eligible for a patent. The courts and the US Patent and Trademark Office have interpreted this broadly, allowing for a wide range of patentable subject matter, including living organisms, genetic materials, and tax avoidance strategies. The debate over the scope of patentable subject matter includes concerns about business method patents, tax strategy patents, and ethical issues with patents on genetic materials. Some believe the patent system promotes innovation effectively, while others argue for restrictions. The current discussion introduces the range of patentable subject matter and its impact on promoting advances in various disciplines. The report discusses the patent system, including business method and tax planning method patents, genetic material patents, and innovation policy concerns. It also outlines the process of seeking a patent through the USPTO. The USPTO procedures require examiners to determine if an invention meets patent standards such as novelty, nonobviousness, and usefulness. This prevents patents for obvious or previously disclosed subject matter. The USPTO requires inventions to meet patent standards of novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. An invention must fall within a patentable subject matter category to be patented. Certain subject matter like abstract ideas and laws of nature are not patentable. The application must fully disclose and distinctly claim the invention for consideration. The USPTO requires inventions to meet patent standards of novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. The application must disclose the \"best mode\" of practicing the invention. If a patent is issued, the owner has the right to exclude others from using the invention. Infringers may be liable for damages and an injunction. Patent protection lasts for 20 years. The Patent Act of 1952 allows patents to be issued for processes, defined as a series of steps to achieve a specific result. Patent owners must enforce their rights through litigation in federal courts. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Process patents involve methods of manufacture or use, such as making a product or using a chemical compound for treatment. Courts and the USPTO limit what processes can be patented, excluding abstract ideas, algorithms, mental processes, and scientific principles. The Supreme Court views these as essential tools for scientific and technological advancement that should be accessible to all. In recent years, controversial process patents like business method patents and tax strategy patents have emerged. Business method patents involve methods of operating a business, while tax strategy patents aim to reduce a taxpayer's tax liability. Prior to 1998, some courts did not consider methods of doing business as patentable subject matter. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that business systems are not patentable without practical means for implementation. In 1998, the Federal Circuit overturned this decision in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, allowing for the patenting of business methods. This decision involved a data-processing system for an investment structure called the \"Hub and Spoke\" system. The patented \"Hub and Spoke\" investment system allowed for efficient administration and tax advantages through a partnership structure. Litigation ensued between Signature and State Street Bank over the alleged use of the patented invention, with State Street Bank arguing that the patent did not cover statutory subject matter. The district court sided with State Street Bank in a patent dispute over an accounting system for financial investments, ruling that the invention lacked physical transformation and was not patentable. The court found that patenting such systems would be akin to patenting the business itself. The Federal Circuit reversed the district court's decision on a patent dispute involving an accounting system for financial investments. The court of appeals found that the invention constituted patentable subject matter as it produced a useful, concrete, and tangible result through a programmed machine. The transformation of data into a final share price was considered a practical application of a mathematical algorithm. The court of appeals overturned the district court's rejection of a patent for an accounting system, stating that the invention produced a tangible result through a programmed machine. They also dismissed the idea of restrictions on patents for business methods, stating that they should be subject to the same patentability analysis as any other process. The curr_chunk discusses patents involving four categories: administrative, customer service, personal/professional service, and intangible products. Business method patents have sparked controversy, with some supporting them for promoting innovation and others questioning their necessity. Congressional response has been limited, with the enactment of the First Inventor Defense Act in 1999. The First Inventor Defense Act, part of the American Inventors Protection Act, allows an earlier inventor of a business method later patented by another to defend against patent infringement. It addresses the issue of firms maintaining innovative business methods as trade secrets due to the belief that business methods couldn't be patented before the State Street Bank decision. If a competitor independently patents the same business method, the trade secret holder could be liable for patent infringement. The First Inventor Defense Act was created to provide a defense for the first inventor/trade secret holder against patent infringement in business methods. While Congress acknowledged the validity of these patents, the exact scope of this defense remains undefined. The State Street Bank case, which rejected a per se rule against business method patents, may be considered the first tax patent case. There has been an increase in tax strategy patents requested and approved. The increase in tax strategy patents requested and approved by the USPTO followed the State Street Bank case. These patents disclose methods for reducing or deferring taxes. As of January 6, 2011, there were 130 issued patents and 155 published applications in this category. Tax strategy patents represent a small share of the USPTO's workload, with titles like forecasting tax effects of financial transactions and tax-efficient investment management. Tax planning method patents have sparked debate, with some finding them \"ridiculous\" and others seeing positive outcomes. Three bills in the 111th Congress aim to exclude tax planning inventions from patenting. H.R. 2584 aims to prevent patents on tax planning methods, defining them as strategies to reduce tax liability. The legislation would apply to applications filed at the USPTO after enactment. Increased scrutiny on business and tax strategy patents has led to a focus on patent eligibility issues by the USPTO and courts, highlighted by the Supreme Court's decision in Bilski v. Kappos on patentable subject matter. Bilski's patent application involved a method for hedging risk in commodities trading, which was rejected by the USPTO for claiming non-patentable subject matter. The USPTO rejected Bilski's patent application for claiming non-patentable subject matter under section 101. The Federal Circuit determined that Bilski's claimed process did not meet the requirements for patent eligibility as it was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus and did not result in a physical transformation. The Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO's decision to deny Bilski's patent application, stating that the claimed process did not achieve a physical transformation. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case, with Justice Kennedy's opinion agreeing that Bilski's invention could not be patented. The plurality rejected the Federal Circuit's machine or transformation test as the sole standard for identifying patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court rejected the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes, stating it was just a clue. They also confirmed that laws of nature, physical phenomenon, and abstract ideas are not patentable. Business methods can be patentable subject matter, as shown by the First Inventor Defense Act. Justice Stevens issued a concurring opinion on his retirement, agreeing with the decision. Justice Breyer issued a concurring opinion on his retirement from the Supreme Court, agreeing that the machine-or-transformation test is useful but not the exclusive standard for patentability. He emphasized that methods of doing business should not automatically qualify for patents. All nine justices agreed that patentable subject matter is broad but not limitless, the machine-or-transformation test is helpful but not the only criteria, and not all processes achieving a tangible result are patentable. The impact of Bilski v. Kappos on tax strategy patents is debated. Attorney Marvin Petry believes it ended concerns with tax strategy patents, while Ellen P. Aprill thinks it created more uncertainty. Future developments will provide better perspectives on the effect of the Bilski opinion on business method and tax strategy patents. Controversy extends beyond business method and tax strategy patents to include biotechnology patents, particularly those involving genetic materials. Advances in biotechnology have led to numerous patents claiming rights to DNA sequences, genetic mutations, testing kits, proteins, and their medicinal uses. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty in 1980 allowed for patents on genetically engineered microorganisms, breaking the traditional rule that products of nature are not patentable. The Diamond v. Chakrabarty decision in 1980 allowed for patents on genetically engineered microorganisms, establishing that discoveries made by scientists are patentable subject matter. This ruling also applies to genetic materials, allowing patents for isolated or artificially produced substances. However, a 2010 court decision raised doubts about the scope of proprietary rights over genes naturally possessed by humans and other living organisms. Judge Sweet's opinion in Association for Molecular Pathology v. USPTO challenged the practice of granting patents on isolated DNA, including human BRCA1/2 gene sequences. This practice, based on treating DNA like any other chemical compound, has been criticized as a way to circumvent prohibitions on patenting DNA in our bodies. The court ruled that patents on isolated DNA, including human BRCA1/2 gene sequences, are invalid as they do not change the fundamental quality of DNA or the information it encodes. Comparisons of DNA sequences are also considered unpatentable as abstract mental processes under Section 101. This decision challenges the practice of treating DNA like any other chemical compound to patent it. The broad language used by Judge Sweet suggests that most gene patents may be invalid under \u00a7101. This issue is currently under appeal at the Federal Circuit. Genetic material patents are controversial, with critics arguing they should be accessible to all to avoid hindering research and public health. Others believe these concerns are exaggerated. Congress has previously considered limiting patents on genetic materials. In the 110th Congress, Representative Becerra introduced the Genetic Research and Accessibility Act, H.R. 977, which aimed to restrict patents on nucleotide sequences and naturally occurring products. The Genomic Research and Diagnostic Disability Act of 2002, introduced in the 107th Congress, proposed exemptions for genetic research and diagnostic testing. The controversy over patenting genetic materials, business methods, and post-industrial technologies continues. The controversy surrounding patenting genetic materials, business methods, and post-industrial technologies has raised concerns about whether these inventions should be patented. Some argue that these inventions should be excluded from patenting, while others believe that patenting such inventions will benefit innovation and competition. Proponents of a broad notion of patentable subject matter argue that the patent system incentivizes innovation across various industries. The patent system incentivizes innovation across various industries such as electronics, manufacturing, telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals. It also ensures public disclosure of inventions to prevent them from being concealed as trade secrets. Trade secret protection does not require public disclosure like patents. Maintaining secrecy can be costly and may not benefit society. Distinguishing between patentable and unpatentable inventions can be challenging, leading to complex patent drafting to make software inventions appear as hard-wired machines. Expansive patent systems have their supporters. Supporters of an expansive patent system argue that patents facilitate markets by providing inventors with tangible assets to sell or license, allowing them to police the conduct of contracting parties, and preventing appropriation of technology without compensation. Patent protection reduces transaction costs, making transactions for information goods more feasible. Excluding certain inventions from patents could deny industries potential benefits, and studies show that entrepreneurs and small firms rely more on the patent system than larger enterprises. Small firms and individual inventors heavily rely on the patent system as they lack alternative means for protecting their technology. Legal experts emphasize that patents grant the right to exclude others from using the invention, not the right to use it themselves. Granting a patent does not imply government approval or control over the technology. Some argue that patents on tax strategies or genetic materials may not be necessary to promote innovation in those areas. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants believes that people already have incentives to comply with tax laws without the need for patents. Some commentators argue that patents in certain areas, like business methods and tax strategies, may not be necessary and could be socially detrimental. They believe that broad patents could limit competition and discourage innovation. William A. Drennan contrasts tax strategy patents with Treasury Department regulations that aim to reduce tax loopholes, suggesting conflicting approaches to incentivizing innovation. The Treasury Department is working to discourage loopholes, while the Patent Office is creating incentives for loopholes. Experts argue that tax strategy patents could give private control over public laws, potentially hindering government revenue and taxpayer behavior. The AICPA has raised concerns about the impact of tax strategy patents on Congress's authority. Tax strategy patents give patent holders control over how tax law provisions are used, impacting tax professionals and taxpayers. Compliance with these patents could be costly and impractical for many taxpayers. Several objections have been raised against patenting genetic materials, including concerns about devaluing the worth and dignity of living beings, likening patent rights to slavery, and the potential negative impact on healthcare and research. Human genetic materials are seen as a common heritage of humanity and should be publicly owned rather than subject to proprietary rights. Some patents claim human genes indicating disease susceptibility and diagnostic tests. Concerns arise about the public interest in having only one proprietary diagnostic test for a disease and how gene patents may hinder further research. Professors Heller and Eisenberg fear an \"anticommons tragedy\" where overlapping intellectual property rights on genetic materials impede research and product development. In the context of gene patents and diagnostic tests, concerns arise about multiple owners having exclusive rights, hindering research and product development. The debate over the scope of patentable subject matter continues, with no clear method to measure the impact on innovation and competition. The determination of patent eligibility remains a legal matter influenced by innovation and competition policies. If Congress decides current patent eligibility rules are satisfactory, no action is needed. Options include amending the Patent Act to specify non-patentable subject matter or limiting remedies for patent infringement. Other legislative responses are also possible. Several legislative responses are possible regarding patents on business methods, tax strategies, or genetic materials. Proposed reforms include hiring USPTO examiners with expertise in sensitive areas and encouraging cooperation between USPTO and other federal agencies. Consideration of the TRIPS Agreement, an international agreement on intellectual property rights, is also suggested. The TRIPS Agreement allows patents for inventions in all fields of technology, with some exceptions like diagnostic methods and plants. Compliance with TRIPS may limit the ability of WTO member states to legislate on patentable subject matter, sparking debates in areas like business methods and genetic materials. The debate over patents in various fields like business methods, tax strategies, and genetic materials has sparked strong objections from some experts. However, others argue that there is no direct evidence of negative consequences and believe that patents in these areas could benefit society. Despite individual views on patenting in these fields, common policy issues are raised, leading to further inquiry into what types of inventions should be eligible for patents."
