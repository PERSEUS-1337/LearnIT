    "content": "The Act titled \"Justice for Victims of Fraud Act of 2016\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that Wells Fargo implemented sales incentives leading to improper sales practices, including opening accounts without customers' consent between May 2011 and July 2015. Wells Fargo customers were unable to hold the bank accountable in court for fraud claims related to unauthorized accounts due to forced arbitration clauses. Despite the opening of thousands of unauthorized accounts, courts have upheld the arbitration clauses based on the Federal Arbitration Act. The Federal Arbitration Act, originally intended for disputes between commercial entities, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply to claims of fraud. Consumers often have no real choice but to submit to arbitration, unaware that they are giving up their right to file claims in court. SEC. 3. ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER DISPUTES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include a section on the validity and enforceability of predispute arbitration agreements in covered disputes related to credit cards not issued in response to a request or application. The validity and enforceability of predispute arbitration agreements in covered disputes related to credit cards not issued in response to a request or application shall be determined by a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction. SEC. 920A. VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY of predispute arbitration agreements in covered disputes related to credit cards not issued in response to a request or application will be determined by a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction. In this section, a covered account refers to a personal or family account, excluding trust accounts. A covered dispute is a non-judgmental dispute, and a predispute arbitration agreement is defined as any agreement before a dispute arises. The term 'predispute arbitration agreement' refers to an agreement between a financial institution and a consumer for arbitration of future disputes. Such agreements are not valid or enforceable in covered disputes related to accounts not requested or applied for. The determination of applicability is left to State or Federal courts. SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. The amendments made by this Act do not authorize the imposition of a requirement to submit a dispute to arbitration or restrict any court from ruling that a requirement to submit a dispute to arbitration is invalid or unenforceable."
