    "content": "The \"Sports Antitrust Reform Act of 1996\" is cited as the short title. The Clayton Act is amended to include a new section on the application of antitrust laws to professional sports. The term 'home territory' refers to the metropolitan area where a team operates and plays most home games. An 'interested party' includes political subdivisions providing financial assistance for team facilities, representatives of those areas, team members, and stadium owners. The term 'member team' refers to a professional sports team organized to play football, basketball, or hockey and is a member of a professional sports league. The term 'person' includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, and states. A 'professional sports league' is an association composed of multiple member teams that regulate their contests and exhibitions. Professional sports leagues can establish rules allowing member teams to decide on relocation outside their home territory with league approval. Stadium and arena are defined as the main facilities where member teams play home games. Professional sports leagues can establish rules for member teams to relocate with league approval. Requests for approval must be submitted at least 210 days before the season starts. Requests for approval to relocate a member team must be submitted in writing, delivered to interested parties within 30 days, made available to the news media, published in newspapers, and include the proposed location of the team. Each professional sports league must establish rules and procedures for approving or disapproving requests to relocate a team. Criteria for approval or disapproval must be included, along with a summary of reasons for the change in home territory and the effective date of the proposed change. Criteria for approving or disapproving requests to relocate a team include fan loyalty, support, and good faith negotiations with appropriate persons regarding terms and conditions for playing games in the home territory. The criteria for approving or disapproving requests to relocate a team include factors such as ownership or management contributions, public financial support, stadium adequacy, and willingness of stadium authorities. The criteria for approving or disapproving requests to relocate a team include factors such as ownership or management contributions, public financial support, stadium adequacy, net operating losses, location of other teams, and proposed relocation to a new territory. The professional sports league considers various criteria when deciding on team relocations, including ownership contributions, public support, stadium adequacy, financial factors, and the location of other teams. Hearings are conducted where interested parties can provide written testimony and exhibits, with a written record kept. Judicial review is available for decisions made by the league. Judicial review of professional sports league decisions on team relocations can only be done through a civil action filed by an interested party. The action must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, except if the team's home territory is within a 50-mile radius of the District of Columbia, then it must be filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The filing deadline for a civil action regarding professional sports league decisions on team relocations is 14 days after the league's formal vote. The district court must issue an order within 30 days of the filing. Judicial review is limited to determining if the league complied with the regulations. The court can grant relief in a civil action if a professional sports league's decision on team relocation is found to be arbitrary or capricious. The court may remand the matter for further consideration by the league and enjoin any relocation until the league has reconsidered the decision according to the court's order. The court can only grant relief in a civil action regarding a professional sports league's decision on team relocation by enjoining or approving enforcement of the league's decision."
