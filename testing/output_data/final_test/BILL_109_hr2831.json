    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pension Preservation and Portability Act of 2005\" and includes improvements in benefit accrual standards. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 include rules regarding the reduction in accrued benefits due to age attainment. A plan must ensure that a participant's accrued benefit is equal to or greater than that of a similarly situated, younger individual. An individual is considered similarly situated if they are identical to the participant in all aspects except for age. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 mandates that a participant's accrued benefits cannot be reduced solely based on age. The plan must ensure that the accrued benefit is equal to or greater than that of a younger individual in all aspects except for age. Additionally, any subsidized portion of an early retirement benefit should be disregarded when determining the entire accrued benefit. Allowable offsets against benefits attributable to employer contributions are permitted, including benefits from Social Security, the Railroad Retirement Act, or other government retirement programs. The plan can provide offsets against benefits based on actual payment amounts, projections, or actuarial equivalents. Disparity in contributions or benefits is allowed if it meets IRS requirements. Pre-retirement indexing of accrued benefits is also permitted under the plan. Pre-retirement indexing of accrued benefits is defined as adjusting the benefits to protect against inflation before distribution. Defined benefit plans can express accrued benefits as the balance of an account without failing to meet requirements, as long as the distribution amount aligns with the plan terms. The Internal Revenue Code allows for the distribution of accrued benefits under defined benefit plans, as long as the interest rate used for discounting to present value is not greater than a market rate of return. The Secretary of the Treasury can establish rules for calculating the market rate of return and crediting interest to accounts. Rules regarding reduction in accrued benefits due to age under the Internal Revenue Code are amended to include a comparison to younger individuals to ensure compliance with plan requirements. The rules are amended to compare a participant's accrued benefit to that of a similarly situated, younger individual to ensure compliance with plan requirements. The rules require comparing a participant's accrued benefit to a younger individual's to ensure plan compliance. The plan must not fail to meet requirements solely due to allowable offsets against benefits provided by the plan. The rules require comparing a participant's accrued benefit to a younger individual's to ensure plan compliance. Benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions are compared to benefits provided under specific programs or other qualified retirement plans. The defined contribution plan must meet specific requirements for offsets, which are determined by a formula that does not increase based on the participant's age. Allowable offsets can be based on actual benefit payment amounts, projections, or actuarial equivalents. The defined contribution plan must meet requirements for offsets based on benefit payment amounts, projections, or actuarial assumptions. The plan can provide disparity in contributions or benefits as long as it complies with section 401(l) rules. Pre-retirement indexing is also allowed under certain conditions. The defined contribution plan can allow pre-retirement indexing of accrued benefits under certain conditions, which involves adjusting benefits periodically to protect against inflation before distribution. The amendment to section 411 of the Code allows defined benefit plans to maintain nonforfeitability of benefits expressed as an account balance for distribution without failing to meet minimum vesting standards. The amendment allows defined benefit plans to distribute benefits under certain conditions, with regulations governing interest rates and methods of crediting interest. The amendment allows defined benefit plans to distribute benefits with regulations on interest rates, resulting in effective rates meeting requirements. The amendments apply to plan years before, on, or after the enactment of the Act."
