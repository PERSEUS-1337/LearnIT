    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Children from Identity Theft\" aims to reduce identity fraud. The purpose of this section is to reduce synthetic identity fraud, especially among vulnerable populations, by validating fraud protection data through a database maintained by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Key definitions include the Commissioner, financial institution, and fraud protection data. The permitted entity includes financial institutions or their affiliates, contractors, or assignees. The Commissioner will assess the feasibility of modifying existing databases for efficiency. The Commissioner will establish a system to carry out the purpose of this section and meet the requirements of subsection (d) by developing or modifying a database. The database will compare fraud protection data provided by permitted entities to confirm validity. The Commissioner will establish a system to confirm the validity of information provided by permitted entities to deter fraudulent use of the database. The system must be scalable, accommodate verification requests with reasonable uptime, and allow for real-time electronic responses within 24 hours. Certification is required before confirming fraud. Before confirming fraud protection data, the Commissioner requires a certification from permitted entities stating compliance with privacy and data security requirements, as well as retaining records to demonstrate compliance. Permitted entities must demonstrate compliance with certification and retention of records for at least 2 years. Consumer consent is required for submitting requests to the database, with electronic consent needed for certain circumstances under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Permitted entities must obtain electronic signatures for consent, following federal laws. Electronic consent can be used for verification purposes. The Commissioner is responsible for audits and monitoring. The Commissioner conducts audits and monitoring to ensure proper use of the database by permitted entities, deter fraud and misuse, and may terminate services for entities that prevent audits. The Commissioner may terminate or suspend services for any permitted entity to enforce violations of the section or certifications made under it. Enforcement of violations will be done in accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act by relevant agencies. The Commissioner may forward relevant information on violations to the appropriate agency for enforcement. Amounts to carry out this section will be recovered from users through advances, reimbursements, or user fees as determined by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will establish prices for users to pay for services and work performed, including upgrades and maintenance, to support the administration of the Social Security Administration without fiscal year limitation. Prices will be adjusted periodically to ensure full offsetting collection. The Commissioner will establish prices for users to pay for services and work performed to support the administration of the Social Security Administration. Amounts collected must fully offset the cost of administration. Development of a verification system will not begin until 50% of start-up costs are collected. Existing resources can be used, but full reimbursement is required. An annual report on indirect costs must be submitted to the Committees on Ways and Means and Finance. The Senate will report on the indirect costs to the Social Security Administration resulting from the implementation of this section. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 17, 2018. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
