Congress finds that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) was established in 1949 to provide relief services to Palestinian refugees. Unlike the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNRWA does not work towards resettling Palestinian refugees. The United States has contributed over $2 billion to UNRWA since 1950, with a significant contribution of $108 million in 2005. Additionally, UNRWA has never allowed an independent third-party audit by an internationally-recognized auditing firm. The last audit conducted by UNRWA's own Board of Auditors and certified by the United Nations Board of Auditors provided only summary totals which were vague and left at least $43 million in expenditures completely undefined. Limitations on US voluntary contributions to UNRWA. Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 limits US voluntary contributions to UNRWA to periods with a certification in effect, with a waiver option for national security interests.
