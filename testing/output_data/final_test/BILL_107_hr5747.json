    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act\". Congress finds that approximately 2 percent of adults and 5 percent of infants and young children in the United States suffer from food allergies. Each year, 30,000 individuals require emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die due to allergic reactions to food. Eight major foods account for 90 percent of food allergies, with no cure currently available. Allergic consumers must avoid the specific food they are allergic to. In 1999, the FDA found that 25% of sampled foods in Minnesota and Wisconsin failed to list peanuts or eggs as ingredients. Nationally, recalls due to unlabeled allergens increased to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier. A study showed parents of children with food allergies struggled to identify allergens on food labels. Ingredients in foods must be listed by their common or usual name, which may be unfamiliar to consumers. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated condition causing damage to various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment involves avoiding gluten-containing foods. The prevalence of celiac disease in the US is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 percent of the population. Food labeling requirements include information on allergenic substances. Food labeling requirements now mandate that non-raw agricultural commodities containing major food allergens must clearly state the allergen source either next to the ingredient list or within parentheses after the allergen name. Food labeling requirements state that the major food allergen source must be clearly labeled next to the ingredient list or within parentheses after the allergen name, as specified in section 201(ll)(1). All major food allergens must be labeled consistently either as specified in clause (A) or clause (B). The required information may appear in labeling instead of on the label if the Secretary deems it sufficient for public health protection. The Secretary can modify or eliminate labeling requirements for major food allergens if necessary for public health protection. The law requires disclosure of any food additive containing a non-major food allergen as determined by the Secretary. This does not affect the Secretary's authority to label other food allergens. Major food allergens include milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts. The law mandates labeling of major food allergens such as milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans in food products from January 1, 2006 onwards. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act require compliance with allergen labeling regulations. The law mandates labeling of major food allergens in food products from January 1, 2006 onwards. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act require compliance with allergen labeling regulations. SEC. 4. REPORT ON FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report by June 30, 2004, analyzing unintentional contamination of major food allergens in food manufacturing. This includes contamination from shared production lines and dedicated production lines. The report analyzes unintentional contamination of major food allergens in food manufacturing, including contamination from shared and dedicated production lines. It estimates the prevalence of these practices in the food industry and recommends good manufacturing practices to reduce cross-contact. Additionally, it describes various types of advisory labeling used by food producers and the extent to which they are being used on food products. The curr_chunk discusses consumer preferences for communicating cross-contact risk on food labels and the appropriate use of advisory labeling. SEC. 5. INSPECTIONS RELATING TO FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services prioritizes increasing inspections of food facilities to ensure compliance with practices to reduce cross-contact of allergens and proper labeling of major food allergens. Biennial reports are submitted to relevant committees on inspection numbers and facility compliance. The biennial reports detail compliance with allergen practices, food labeling, violations found, voluntary recalls for undeclared allergens, advisory language use, and cross-contact issue resolution efforts. SEC. 6. LABELING OF GLUTENS AND CELIAC DISEASE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review on glutens associated with celiac disease, prevention and treatment methods, and gluten detection in foods. The Institute of Medicine must submit a report to the Secretary and relevant committees within 2 years. The Institute of Medicine will review celiac disease with experts in various fields and issue a proposed rule for gluten labeling within 4 years of the Act's enactment, with a final rule within 6 years. The Secretary will submit a report to assess if additional gluten labeling requirements are necessary to better inform individuals with celiac disease. SEC. 7. DATA ON FOOD-RELATED ALLERGIC RESPONSES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study within a year to determine if current systems accurately capture data on food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. New systems or enhancements may be identified to improve data collection. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to improve data collection on the prevalence of food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. This includes educating healthcare providers and enhancing national data reporting. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the prevalence of food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. A report will be submitted to Congress on the progress made, and appropriations are authorized for this purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a panel of experts to review food allergy research efforts and develop a plan for expanding research activities. A report will be submitted to Congress within a year. SEC. 9. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will work with the Conference for Food Protection to revise the Food Code for preparing allergen-free foods in various food establishments. SEC. 10. Recommendations will be made for responding to food-related allergic reactions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide technical assistance on different modes of treatment and prevention for food-related allergic responses to State and local agencies."
