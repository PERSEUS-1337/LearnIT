The African American civil rights movement aimed to end segregation and discrimination, ensuring basic constitutional rights for African American citizens, including the right to vote. It helped bridge divides of race, religion, and nationality, spanning State lines and aligning with ideals of liberty and freedom in key legislation. The National Park Service and Organization of American Historians conducted a theme study identifying sites related to the Civil Rights movement, finding many sites related to the African American civil rights movement in existing National Park System units. Many important sites related to the African American civil rights movement are not recognized or adequately protected, with some in imminent danger of being lost. There are high potential sites for preservation and visitor use in various states, the District of Columbia, and territories. The African American civil rights movement involves networks, regions, and territories of the United States rather than individual sites. Partnerships among the Federal Government, State, and local units, along with the private sector, are crucial for the protection and interpretation of the African American Civil Rights Network. The National Park Service can play a vital role in this effort. The National Park Service can facilitate the creation and success of the African American Civil Rights Network by linking historic sites, geographic areas, interpretive centers, and programs related to the civil rights movement. The National Park Service can coordinate activities related to the African American civil rights movement, recognizing its importance and honoring those who fought against discrimination and segregation. This includes programs, exhibits, and multimedia materials. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of the African American civil rights movement in the evolution of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its role in promoting social justice and national reconciliation. The curr_chunk introduces the U.S. Civil Rights Network Program under Chapter 3084 in the United States Code. The U.S. Civil Rights Network Program, established under Chapter 3084, defines the term 'Network' as the African American Civil Rights Network. The program includes reviewing studies, producing educational materials, and entering into cooperative agreements. The African American Civil Rights Network can enter cooperative agreements, create an official symbol, and encompass units related to the civil rights movement from 1939 to 1968. It includes federal, state, local, and private properties connected to the movement. The African American Civil Rights Network can establish cooperative agreements and memoranda of understanding to coordinate with federal and non-federal entities related to the civil rights movement. This includes educational, research, and interpretive facilities and programs directly linked to the movement. The African American Civil Rights Network can collaborate with various entities, including Federal agencies, States, local governments, and private organizations. A clerical amendment is made to the table of chapters for title 54, United States Code.
