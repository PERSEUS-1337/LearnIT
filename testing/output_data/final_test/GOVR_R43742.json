State public utility commissions oversaw rates and approved infrastructure development, leading to a virtual monopoly in most states. The modern electric utility industry in the United States emerged as a virtual monopoly with vertically integrated companies generating and delivering electricity. Large power plants were built using coal or hydropower, with nuclear and natural gas plants later developed to meet demand. Petroleum use declined, and the industry remained regulated across the country. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) ended the near utility monopoly on electric power in the United States by encouraging fuel efficient cogeneration and alternative fuels for electricity generation. PURPA required electric utilities to purchase power from new generators, leading to the growth of the nonutility power sector. The power generation sector in the United States has various ownership structures, including publicly owned utilities, investor-owned utilities, electric cooperatives, federal power agencies, and nonutility generators. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 allowed for the emergence of nonutility producers, leading to increased competition in the industry. Power pools were developed to allow electric utilities to share generation resources and exchange power. Power pools can be \"loose\" or \"tight,\" with the level of independence being the primary differentiator. FERC Order 2000 led to the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the United States, creating wholesale power markets and industry restructuring. Retail competition was introduced in some states, giving consumers a choice between incumbent utilities and competitive suppliers. Utility transmission systems are regulated by the RTO under FERC jurisdiction. The electric utility model is facing pressure due to aging assets, new environmental regulations, and evolving technologies. This could lead to significant changes in how electricity is acquired, generated, and used in the United States. Some advocate for a reinvention of the industry under a \"Utility 2.0\" paradigm. The utility industry is looking to reinvent itself under a \"Utility 2.0\" paradigm, focusing on meeting society's needs for electric power and services. States like Maryland and New York are exploring new regulatory frameworks to achieve a more reliable, cost-effective, and green energy future. Utility 2.0 aims to incorporate more renewable energy sources and reduce reliance on traditional power plants. The report explores the need for a transition to the grid of the future in the U.S. power sector, discussing changes in electricity production and regulations over the past 40 years. The growth in electric power sales used to be directly linked to economic growth, but energy efficiency measures have changed this relationship. The decoupling of growth in electricity demand from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is evident, with energy efficiency increasing in homes and appliances. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes a declining linkage over the last 60 years, as economic growth outpaces electricity use growth. EIA projects a continued decline in electricity use relative to economic growth, attributing factors such as slowing. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes a declining linkage over the last 60 years between economic growth and electricity use, attributing factors such as slowing population growth and improving efficiency of appliances. Despite flat demand for electricity, even a small annual growth rate can lead to a significant increase in demand over the next 30 years, potentially requiring new power plant capacity. The Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments in 1970 mandated the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish standards to reduce health and environmental impacts of fossil fuels. The EPA is working on regulations to reduce health and environmental impacts of fossil fuel use by limiting emissions. Coal-fired power plants, a major source of air pollution, may face retirement decisions due to these regulations. Compliance with the Clean Air Act varies depending on factors like plant location, construction date, and fuel type. The EPA is implementing regulations to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule, coal combustion residues rule, and Clean Water Act guidelines. The MATS rule requires plants over 25 MW to use control technologies by April 2015 to reduce mercury and toxic emissions. Compliance with multiple CAA programs can be complex for utilities and regulators. The MATS rule requires coal-fired power plants to reduce airborne emissions of mercury, acid gases, and toxic metals by using control technologies. State agencies can grant a one-year compliance extension. Around 71% of U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has installed or plans to install environmental control equipment to comply with MATS. Economic pressures, low natural gas prices, and slow electricity demand growth are leading to coal plant retirements. EPA is developing regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The EPA proposed new standards in 2013 to control CO2 emissions from new power plants using fossil fuels, suggesting the use of CCS for compliance. These standards do not apply to existing power plants. Regulations to reduce GHG emissions from existing power plants were finalized in 2015 under the Clean Power Plan, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, a major source of U.S. GHG emissions. Under the Clean Power Plan, states must prepare plans to reduce CO2 emissions from power generation by 32% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The plan may increase renewable energy capacity to 28% and electricity generation to 20% by 2030. EPA also proposes regulations for managing coal combustion residuals. The EPA is proposing to revise effluent limitations guidelines for power plant wastewater and issue a final Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) rule to reduce pollutants released from coal-fired power plants. Power plants are typically retired after 40 years of service, with the average age of U.S. power plants now over 30 years. The average age of power plants is about 40 years, with transmission components also aging. Electric utilities recover costs from ratepayers over a 40-year period. Older plants are well-maintained but less efficient than newer ones. The costs of modernizing older coal-fired power plants to meet new regulatory requirements can be high, leading many to face retirement decisions. Electric utilities are facing increasing costs to replace aging power plants and infrastructure due to higher construction and materials costs. Maintaining and modernizing coal-fired plants is becoming more expensive due to environmental requirements. The U.S. electric utility industry is facing challenges such as increasing costs for modernizing power plants, declining revenues from electricity markets, and the need to control costs to maintain returns on investment. Utilities are focusing on minimizing operations and maintenance costs, downsizing workforces, and preparing for retirements of workers. Opportunities for higher returns on investment are coming from unregulated markets and new transmission projects with approved incentives. The U.S. electric utility industry reflects fuel resources, economics, and physical limitations in different regions. Changes in regulatory regimes have shifted towards a competitive environment for power plants. New technologies challenge traditional practices, driving changes in the industry influenced by federal and state public policy goals. Policy goals and requirements, such as PURPA and EPACT92, have significantly impacted electric utilities by introducing competition through allowing nonutility entities to generate and sell power. State governments have also played a role by mandating renewable electricity generation through various Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. The availability of federal tax incentives, combined with state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements, has led to a proliferation of utility-scale projects using wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV). EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA) also impact power plant operations. Distributed Generation (DG) refers to power generated at or near the point of consumption, differing from traditional base load power plants. Distributed Generation (DG) includes traditional backup power sources, combined heat and power facilities, and renewable electricity power systems used by businesses and residences. DG technologies are also known as distributed energy resources (DER). Residential applications of renewable electricity technologies have grown due to lower prices of solar panels and incentives. New wind power designs for urban environments are being developed. New wind power units optimized for urban environments are being developed, offering increased deployment opportunities. The choice of distributed generation (DG) technology depends on the end-use application, with rooftop solar PV being the most common in residential settings in the United States. By 2017, distributed solar PV capacity could reach 20 GW, with total solar PV penetration potentially reaching 50 GW by 2020. However, this would still only represent a small portion of overall U.S. electricity generation, which had a capacity of 966 GW in 2013. The abundance of natural gas from unconventional resources has led to expectations of continued lower prices for natural gas. The abundance of natural gas from unconventional resources has led to expectations of continued lower prices for natural gas, stimulating a switch from coal to gas-burning facilities. Electricity costs are still increasing in many regions, with prices expected to rise, creating an opportunity for residential combined heat and power units. Fuel cell and microturbine applications may become more cost-competitive, leading to increased development. Large fuel cell installations are providing power to data centers for improved reliability. New, smaller scale power generation technologies could change how consumers obtain power. Power generation technologies, including microgrids, are changing how consumers access electricity. The convergence of electric power and natural gas utilities may lead to a customer-focused energy industry. Microgrids allow for localized distribution of power generation, giving users the ability to choose their energy source and manage costs effectively. Microgrids offer flexibility in power generation technology, allowing users to manage energy costs and operate independently. The U.S. Department of Defense is interested in their ability to function as a \"power island\" during outages. While microgrids can be costly to build and operate, they are valuable for reducing energy expenses. In 2012, San Diego Gas and Electric Company began constructing a microgrid in Borrego Springs, CA with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy and California Energy Commission. The project aimed to integrate various DG technologies for grid resiliency. Microgrids proved beneficial during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, as they were able to provide uninterrupted power to users, highlighting their potential for storm recovery efforts. Some states were considering implementing microgrids post-Sandy to enhance electricity reliability. Some states were considering microgrids to support emergency workers during power outages post-Sandy, aiming to reduce electricity needs and emissions. Cleaner energy sources are being explored, but they also have drawbacks like impacting animal habitats or requiring secure storage for nuclear waste. The average U.S. household consumed 11,320 kiloWatt-hours of electricity in 2009, with the largest portion of power consumption in homes now being for appliances, electronics, lighting, and other miscellaneous uses. Research on increasing energy efficiency is ongoing, funded by federal and state programs. Energy efficiency programs in approximately 27 states aim to offset demand growth by 2025. New programs will focus on smart appliances controlled by home-based systems, smartphone apps, and devices to adapt energy use. Zero Net Energy Homes will advance residential energy management. Zero Net Energy Homes, as defined by the U.S. Department of Energy, are highly energy-efficient homes that can offset their annual energy consumption with renewable energy systems, resulting in zero net energy costs. This concept can also be applied to new commercial buildings, reducing the need for utility-generated electricity. The rise of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) presents opportunities for vehicle-to-grid energy storage and grid services, potentially helping to address increasing electricity demand. When parked, vehicles can provide grid services by controlled charging, timed to renewable energy output. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) allows EVs to discharge stored energy to the grid, focusing on short-term response services. V2G's role is an active area of research due to battery limitations and high cycling costs. The potential of electric vehicles (EVs) for grid flexibility is being researched, despite challenges like high costs and limited travel range. Building a national EV charging infrastructure could help overcome these barriers. Regulatory issues also exist regarding the sale of electricity from private EV charging stations. Some state jurisdictions are debating whether EV charging stations should be classified as electric utilities. A United Nations study suggests a potential shift to EVs by 2050 for significant greenhouse gas reduction, depending on electricity generation sources. Fuel cell vehicles could offer an alternative to EV dominance in the future. However, projections show EVs may only reach a 2% market penetration by 2040. Energy storage technologies like batteries, compressed air, and pumped hydro schemes are currently limited in use due to cost, efficiency, and siting issues. Increasing energy storage could reduce power generation levels and costs, benefiting consumers. Newer, more economic large-scale energy storage solutions are being tested, including advancements in battery production for cheaper options. Increased energy storage through economies of scale for advanced battery production can lead to cheaper and more effective storage options. This would benefit the deployment and efficiency of renewable technologies by storing surplus energy for use when needed, addressing load and demand balancing issues. California's ambitious renewable generation plans highlight the importance of storage in integrating renewable resources, especially during peak demand times. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) expects increasing solar power generation from 2015 to 2020 due to RPS requirements. However, customer demand for electricity during the daytime may not match the power being generated by solar resources, leading to potential over-generation issues. To address this, California may need more fast-ramping natural gas power plants to meet the new base load demand. The electric utility industry may require more fast-ramping natural gas power plants or energy storage to manage the variability of renewable generation. Pricing strategies for energy storage are crucial for stand-alone projects. Technological advances in the power sector are driving changes, but the industry's economies of scale have hindered significant transformation. The aging power generation infrastructure, new environmental regulations, and potential alternative power technologies are prompting questions about the future of the electric utility industry. Government roles in this potential change are also being considered, as utilities currently hold a dominant position with their infrastructure and customer bases. Regional differences in regulatory regimes and infrastructure add complexity to the industry's evolution. The electric utility industry is facing potential changes due to aging infrastructure, new regulations, and alternative power technologies. Some companies are considering embracing distributed generation (DG) technologies to meet customer demands for clean energy. This shift is causing utilities to reevaluate their position in the electricity business, with some focusing on traditional services while others explore renewable generation options. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) is concerned about the potential rise in distributed generation (DG) and its impact on the current regulatory paradigm in the electric utility industry. They propose changes in state regulatory policies to address this issue and transition towards a Utility 2.0 model. However, the industry is also worried about recovering costs from current infrastructure while facing new infrastructure building and costs in the future. The electric utility industry has concerns with state net metering programs for residential solar PV installations. Net metering, mandated by EPACT05, allows customers to generate their own electricity and receive compensation. It is intended to promote distributed generation adoption. The electric utility industry is concerned about the impact of state net metering programs for residential solar PV installations. Net metering allows customers to generate their own electricity and receive compensation, potentially leading to a threat to the centralized utility service model. Utilities fear that their current investments in power generation infrastructure may not be fully recovered if more customers opt for distributed generation. This threat could be exacerbated by new technologies or changes in customer behavior that reduce electricity demand. The ongoing competitive threat of disruptive alternatives, such as distributed energy resources (DER), poses challenges for utilities in recovering costs. Revising tariff structures to address lost load recovery faces opposition, as it may lead to cross-customer subsidies and stranded costs for utilities. While regulatory processes aim to allow for revenue recovery in future rate cases, non-DER customers are often required to absorb lost revenues, potentially incentivizing the exit of legacy customers from the system. As DER penetration increases, there is political pressure to undo cross subsidies for non-DER customers, leading to potential utility stranded cost exposure. Some argue that less affluent residential customers may be affected, but data shows middle-income customers are adopting rooftop solar PV systems in states like Arizona, California, and New Jersey. Based on an analysis of solar installation data from Arizona, California, and New Jersey, it was found that installations are mainly in middle-class neighborhoods with median incomes between $40,000 to $90,000. The areas with the most growth from 2011 to 2012 had median incomes ranging from $30,000 to $50,000. Solar installations are not just for the wealthy but are mostly in neighborhoods with median incomes of $40,000 to $90,000. This analysis is based on solar PV installations in states with good solar resources and favorable state incentive policies. The EPA's regulations for carbon emissions from power plants may lead to a transition in the electric power sector towards more natural gas and renewable energy. The focus is on reducing GHGs from central station generation, but the use of natural gas may hinder these goals. The future of electricity generation may rely on carbon capture and sequestration from fossil fuels. The future of electricity generation may rely on carbon capture and sequestration from fossil fuels. Renewable electricity generation could be a long-term solution, but the US grid still needs central station generation and energy storage. Natural gas is seen as a transition strategy to a clean energy future, with hydrogen potentially replacing it. Hydrogen could be sourced from coal, natural gas, nuclear power, or renewable electricity. Fuel cells using hydrogen may become a significant residential energy choice in the future. The future of electricity generation may rely on carbon capture and sequestration from fossil fuels. Renewable electricity generation could be a long-term solution, but the US grid still needs central station generation and energy storage. Natural gas is seen as a transition strategy to a clean energy future, with hydrogen potentially replacing it. Hydrogen could be sourced from coal, natural gas, nuclear power, or renewable electricity. Fuel cells using hydrogen may become a significant residential energy choice in the future. Approximately one-third of today's U.S. nuclear power plants will see their operating licenses expire by 2030, leading to potential retirements due to competitiveness and aging plant costs. Only five new nuclear reactors are under construction in the United States, raising questions about the need for a longer-term national or regional energy policy to promote lower GHG emissions and higher renewable energy use. Requiring federal policy guidance for the electric utility industry may be necessary if energy markets fail to transition smoothly to a clean power future. Market failures, such as stranded assets and company bankruptcies, could potentially disrupt the industry. While major disruptions to the nation's power supply are unlikely, the financial markets could be affected by a company failure. Similar transitions have been seen in other industries without significant congressional intervention, like the telecommunications industry in the early 1990s. Electric utilities are already implementing cost control strategies to adapt to changing market dynamics. Electric utilities are considering cost control strategies as demand for electricity decreases. Changing asset depreciation rates authorized by state commissions can help deal with stranded assets. The Uniform System of Accounts defines depreciation as the loss in value due to various factors like wear and tear, obsolescence, and changes in demand. Concerns over rate base erosion from net metering policies and distributed generation growth are related to changes in demand and public authorities' requirements. A potential switch to distributed energy resources (DER) affects all customer rate classes, leading to competition for electricity customers. EEI suggests increasing depreciation rates to help utilities cope with DER competition, but these issues fall under state jurisdiction. Making changes to depreciable service life early is preferable for minimizing impacts. The aging U.S. grid needs modernization as new technologies enter the electricity market, offering consumers more choices in power sources. The average age of coal power plants is 43 years, and transmission systems are also aging. Switching to a shorter service life recovery early can minimize the impact on customer rates. The modernization of the aging U.S. grid is necessary to accommodate new technologies in the electricity market, providing consumers with more power source options. Renewable electricity, fuel cells, and EVs are gaining acceptance, supported by regulations like RPS requirements, net metering, and tax incentives. A more flexible grid is essential to incorporate renewable generation and meet evolving customer needs. Regulators must plan for potential changes and costs, as economic development remains tied to low-cost energy availability. The electric utility model has proven to provide low-cost electricity, making it likely that most consumers will remain utility customers if grid infrastructure is modernized and costs are kept reasonable. Some customers may switch to DG solutions if grid electricity costs become too high. Telephone companies adapted to change by offering a variety of services, similar to how utilities may need to evolve in the future. The telecommunications marketplace expanded with technological offerings, evolving from plain old telephone wires to cellular and fiber optic infrastructure. Customers underwrote the cost of infrastructure build-out by paying for added value services. The \"Smart Grid\" in the electric utility industry may enable significant change, offering two-way intelligence capabilities for monitoring and controlling systems. The Smart Grid system is viewed positively by most electric utilities for its intelligence and communication capabilities, despite concerns about cybersecurity. It has the potential to reduce operational costs, improve system resiliency, and integrate renewable resources at a lower cost. Some anticipate a gradual modernization of the system with older components being replaced, rather than a formal transition. The Smart Grid could enable renewable generation in one region to support another, showcasing its potential for greater change. The Smart Grid system could enable renewable generation in one region to support another, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency. The cost of building a fully functional Smart Grid could be compared to building a new natural gas-based generation system. Modernization of the grid with digital systems has been successful in some areas. The Smart Grid has seen success with some components like synchrophasors and smart inverters, but Smart Meters have faced challenges due to cost, performance issues, and resistance from customers. Legislation has been enacted to recognize new electricity technologies and their potential impact on consumer usage. Legislation, including states-must-consider standards, has been added to PURPA, requiring state utility regulators to consider proposed actions for electric utilities. EPACT05 and EISA added standards like net metering and Smart Grid investments. Responses to these standards have varied among states, with some adopting them, others surpassing them with their own policies, and some declining to adopt or adapt them. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for renewable electricity technologies and plug-in vehicles, while also advancing the Smart Grid. Recent legislation in Congress focuses on modernizing the grid, with bills like the Energy Policy and Modernization Act and the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act including provisions for customer-side technologies and grid-scale energy storage. The bills focus on grid-scale energy storage, increasing reliability, and integrating new technologies in the electricity industry. Challenges such as new environmental regulations and aging infrastructure are driving the need for a new Utility 2.0 model to provide customer choice in a clean energy future. The shift to Utility 2.0 in the electric utility industry is seen as the next logical step, but considerations must be made for the current Utility 1.0 model's obligations. These include unrecovered costs of power plants, environmental responsibilities, and the need for cost control to keep electricity prices competitive. As customers look to control costs, service choices may increase, especially with the attractiveness of distributed generation options. The shift to Utility 2.0 in the electric utility industry is the next step, considering current obligations of the Utility 1.0 model. Customers may have more service choices, especially with distributed generation options becoming more attractive. Congress has introduced competitive providers with PURPA and EPACT92 to promote competition in the industry. Future legislative initiatives may be considered to move towards a clean energy power system or address market failures."
