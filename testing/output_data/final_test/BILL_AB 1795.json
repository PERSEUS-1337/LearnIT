    "title": "AB 1795",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 104150 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require providers in the CDC breast and cervical cancer early detection program to only offer screening services to individuals with family incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. Providers must offer information on how to apply for insurance affordability programs to applicants and beneficiaries. This includes details on application submission, open enrollment periods for the California Health Benefit Exchange, and continuous enrollment for the Medi-Cal program. The department will provide breast and cervical cancer screening services based on budgeted funding, not as an entitlement. Eligibility for breast cancer screening includes symptomatic individuals and those within recommended age ranges. \"Symptomatic\" refers to abnormal breast changes. The department may contract with public and private entities to implement the federal breast and cervical cancer early detection program. The Medi-Cal program's fiscal intermediary can be utilized under certain conditions, but contracts with other entities shall not be subject to specific public contract code regulations. Contracts by the department with entities other than the Medi-Cal program's fiscal intermediary are exempt from specific public contract code regulations. The department will transfer a portion of the grant from the federal CDC breast and cervical cancer early detection program to the State Department of Health Care Services. Treatment services for breast cancer patients are covered for up to 18 months under this article. When an individual is diagnosed with cervical cancer, treatment coverage lasts for 24 months. If there is a reoccurrence of breast or cervical cancer, additional treatment coverage is available."
