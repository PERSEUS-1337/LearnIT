    "content": "The \"Child Support Assurance Act of 1994\" may be cited as such. The Congress finds a significant increase in single-parent households, with a high correlation between childhood poverty and growing up in such households. Family dissolution often leads to lower standard of living for custodians and children, with children being nearly twice as likely to be in poverty after such dissolution. One-fourth of single mothers owed child support receive none, and another one-fourth receive only partial payments. Single mothers, whether above or below the poverty line, are equally likely to not receive the child support they are owed. The purpose of this Act is to establish child support assurance systems to improve the economic circumstances of children who do not receive adequate support from noncustodial parents. This approach aims to strengthen the establishment and enforcement of child support awards through intensive support services and national program administration. Establishment of Child Support Assurance Demonstration Projects. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants to up to 6 states for demonstration projects to establish or improve a system of assured minimum child support payments. Applications must include details of the proposed project, assured benefit level, activities, and involved agencies. The project application must specify details such as the agencies involved, project scope, estimated number of eligible children, child support guidelines, commitment duration, and state paternity establishment rate. The project application must specify details such as agencies involved, project scope, estimated number of eligible children, child support guidelines, commitment duration, and state paternity establishment rate, which should improve agency performance by at least 4 percent annually in cases of paternity establishment, child support orders, and collections. The project application must detail agencies involved, project scope, eligible children, child support guidelines, commitment duration, and state paternity establishment rate. It should involve multiple agencies and use job training assistance to help individuals meet child support obligations. A State awarded a grant under this section must use the funds for a child support assurance project to provide a minimum monthly child support benefit for eligible children when the noncustodial parent fails to pay. The project must ensure that any child with a living noncustodial parent and those meeting specific criteria are eligible for the benefit, which is paid promptly to the custodial parent at least once a month. The State must provide a minimum monthly child support benefit to eligible children when the noncustodial parent fails to pay. The amount ranges from $1,500 to $3,000 per year for the first child, with adjustments for inflation and offsets if the custodial parent receives child support. The child support payment from a noncustodial parent is applied only to their children. Half of the child support payment is disregarded from income until it equals the Federal poverty level. The child's caretaker must apply for the State's child support enforcement program to participate in the child support assurance project. The term \"child\" refers to an individual eligible for child support based on age, disability, or educational status in the State of residence. For the child support assurance project, the caretaker must apply for the State's child support enforcement program. A child support order is considered sought when services are applied for through the State agency or legal representation. The Secretary will approve up to 6 demonstration project applications that contribute significantly to the program's purpose. The child support assurance project prioritizes states with recent improvements in establishing paternity, enforcing child support awards, and collecting payments. Projects must demonstrate effective automation and efforts to link child support systems with other service delivery systems. The projects should be of sufficient size to measure their effects. The child support assurance project prioritizes states with recent improvements in establishing paternity, enforcing child support awards, and collecting payments. Projects must demonstrate effective automation and efforts to link child support systems with other service delivery systems. States selected for the demonstration projects should give priority to operating on a statewide basis and use a variety of approaches for child support guidelines. Additionally, at least 2 states should provide intensive integrated social services for low-income participants to improve employment, housing, and health. During fiscal year 1995, the Secretary will select states to participate in a demonstration project aimed at improving employment, housing, health, and educational status. At least 2 states must adopt the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. The projects will run for 3-5 consecutive fiscal years, with the Secretary having the authority to terminate projects if states are not in compliance. The Secretary will also develop a methodology to identify any state cost savings realized. The methodology to identify State cost savings from child support assurance projects will be used for child support enforcement improvements or Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program. The evaluation will assess the impact of assured benefits on income, government support usage, and resource accumulation. The evaluation of child support assurance projects includes assessing the impact on resource accumulation, children's well-being, and state paternity and support order establishment. Reports will be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees 3 and 5 years after project commencement. States conducting projects must provide annual operation information to the Secretary. The evaluation of child support assurance projects includes assessing the impact on resource accumulation, children's well-being, and state paternity and support order establishment. States conducting projects must provide annual operation information to the Secretary, including maintaining expenditures for child support collection and Aid to Families With Dependent Children. The section discusses maintaining Aid to Families With Dependent Children benefits at current or higher levels under a demonstration project. States must contribute at least 10% of project costs in subsequent years. Coordination with certain means-tested programs is also outlined. Under the demonstration project, certain payments for child support within the project area are not considered as income or resources for the recipient. Assured child support benefits received under this Act are treated as child support for tax purposes. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1995-2000 to support the purposes of the Act regarding child support under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
