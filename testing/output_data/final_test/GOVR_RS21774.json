    "content": "The 1995 Dayton peace agreement ended the war in Bosnia, leading to the deployment of NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR) to enforce compliance. IFOR was later replaced by the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in December 1996, with a gradual reduction in troop strength over time. NATO extended SFOR's mission in June 1998 with no specified end-date, focusing on benchmarks for self-sustaining peace in Bosnia. The U.N. Security Council authorized NATO's IFOR mission in 1995, followed by the SFOR mission in 1996, with annual renewals. The U.S. initially contributed 20,000 troops to IFOR, reducing to 15% of the total force in later years. The Bush Administration emphasized maintaining transatlantic unity on Balkan peacekeeping operations. The U.S. initially contributed 20,000 troops to IFOR, reducing to 15% of the total force in later years. Throughout SFOR's existence, the United States retained command over the NATO force in Bosnia. EU officials expressed readiness to lead a follow-on peacekeeping force in Bosnia as part of the EU's European Security and Defense Policy. Bosnia is in negotiations with the EU for eventual membership. The EU has experience in fielding a police training mission in Bosnia, with the EU Police Mission in Bosnia comprising over 150 international police personnel. The EU aims to further develop ESDP through peacekeeping duties in Bosnia and complement the EU integration strategy for the country. NATO and the EU reached consensus on a follow-on EU military mission in Bosnia, with the understanding that any EU military mission should align with agreed-upon principles. A key principle agreed upon early on was that any EU military mission in Bosnia should fall within the Berlin Plus framework, allowing the EU access to NATO planning and assets. The first test case for Berlin Plus was the EU's takeover of the NATO mission in Macedonia in 2003. Plans for a seamless transition from NATO's SFOR mission to a new EU mission with broader reform objectives were developed for mid-2004 summit meetings. The EU mission in Bosnia aimed to emphasize broader reform objectives and closer association with the EU. There was initial contention over the form and function of the residual NATO presence, which was proposed to assist with defense reform, training, intelligence collection, counterterrorism, and apprehension of war criminals. Some European officials resisted plans that could have overlapped with the EU force's functions, emphasizing the need for the EU to maintain full operational control. The EU mission in Bosnia aimed to maintain full operational control and autonomous decision-making authority over the military mission. EUFOR took on the primary military stabilization role, while NATO focused on defense reform. The unresolved war criminals issue, particularly regarding Radovan Karadzic, clouded the transition. Despite efforts to increase pressure on Karadzic, he and Ratko Mladic continue to evade capture. The United States showed mixed signals on its desired level of engagement. Some U.S. officials are conflicted about the level of U.S. engagement in the Balkans. While some see handing over security matters to the EU in Bosnia as an opportunity for global burden-sharing, others are wary of European aspirations to build separate military structures from NATO. There are concerns that successful EU missions could diminish NATO's primacy and U.S. influence in Europe. Some U.S. officials are conflicted about the level of U.S. engagement in the Balkans. Handing over security matters to the EU in Bosnia could diminish NATO's primacy and U.S. influence in Europe. Bosnian officials emphasize the need for a continued NATO and U.S. presence despite the transition to the EU force. U.S. forces remained in Bosnia after the handover, maintaining a presence at NATO headquarters in Sarajevo and the U.S. Eagle Base in Tuzla. The U.S. maintained a presence in Bosnia at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo and the U.S. Eagle Base in Tuzla, providing intelligence support, detaining war crimes suspects, and countering Islamist extremists. In 2006, the U.S. announced the withdrawal of forces from Eagle Base, with some intelligence officers remaining at NATO Headquarters. The handover ceremony in December 2004 marked a significant milestone for Bosnia's future and the EU's security responsibilities. EUFOR serves as a precedent for potential mission handovers from NATO to the EU. EU members continue to support a safe environment in Bosnia, shifting focus from military presence to political engagement. EUFOR conducts operations to collect illegal weapons, coordinate with NATO, combat organized crime, and support de-mining programs. Liaison and Observation Teams increase EUFOR visibility in local communities. EUFOR and NATO work together to pursue war crimes fugitives and their support networks, in cooperation with Bosnian authorities and the international war crimes tribunal. EUFOR, a war crimes tribunal, transitioned in 2007 with a force of 2,500 troops from 22 EU and 6 non-EU states. Germany and Italy lead troop contributions, with Gen. Ignacio Martin Villalain of Spain as the current force commander. EUFOR focuses on political engagement and supports de-mining programs in Bosnia. EU officials emphasize EUFOR's effectiveness in Bosnia, with the ability to enforce mandates and add reinforcements quickly. NATO's presence in Bosnia supports the country's aspirations to join NATO. Tensions in the region may rise with Kosovo's status resolution in 2008. EU endorsed a concept for a 7,000 troop EU-led mission in Bosnia in 2004, focusing on fulfilling the Dayton peace agreement tasks. The military tasks of the Dayton peace agreement are mandated by the U.N. Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter and fall under the EU Council's Political and Security Committee. NATO nations decided to conclude SFOR by the end of 2004, with NATO's residual presence focusing on defense reforms, counter-terrorism, supporting the ICTY, and intelligence sharing with the EU. The U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1551 welcoming the EU's plan to launch a military mission in Bosnia from December 2004. EU members adopted a \"Joint Action\" for the EU military operation in Bosnia. On July 12, EU members adopted a \"Joint Action\" for the EU military operation in Bosnia, named Althea, designating key commanders and reaffirming support for EU integration. The U.N. Security Council authorized EUFOR to succeed SFOR under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter for peace stabilization. NATO formally concluded the SFOR mission in Sarajevo on December 2, launching Operation Althea. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1639 extended EUFOR and NATO's presence in Bosnia for twelve months. EU Council decisions on Bosnia's relationship were made on November 21-22. On November 21-22, the EU Council made decisions regarding Bosnia, including opening negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement, continuing an EU police mission, and maintaining unchanged EU military presence for the next year. EUFOR's troop strength reduction proposal was postponed due to concerns about Kosovo's status and regional unrest. The U.N. Security Council extended EUFOR's and NATO's mandates in Bosnia until November 2007. The EU confirmed a decision to reconfigure EUFOR, reducing its size from 6,500 to 2,500 troops by the end of May 2007. On November 21, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1785 extending EUFOR's and NATO's mandates in Bosnia. In December, the EU welcomed the successful reconfiguration of EUFOR and agreed to maintain a military presence in Bosnia as needed."
