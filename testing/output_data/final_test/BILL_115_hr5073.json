    "content": "The \"Clean Water for Rural Communities Act\" aims to provide a safe water supply for specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The \"Clean Water for Rural Communities Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator and Authority, specifying entities like the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority and the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System. The \"Clean Water for Rural Communities Act\" defines the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System as a nonprofit entity formed in accordance with specific regulations, with a project service area covering several counties in Montana. The \"Clean Water for Rural Communities Act\" defines the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System as a system authorized under specific regulations, with a project service area covering multiple counties in Montana and North Dakota. The \"Clean Water for Rural Communities Act\" defines the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System as a non-Federal distribution system providing electricity to specific counties in Montana. The \"Pick-Sloan program\" refers to the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. The \"Secretary\" is the Secretary of the Interior, and the \"State\" is Montana. The \"Water System\" includes the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System and the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System. SEC. 4. Establishes the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System and Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System. The Secretary is authorized to carry out the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System and Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System projects in accordance with feasibility studies. A cooperative agreement will be entered into with the Authority for Federal assistance, and a cost-sharing requirement is in place. The Federal share of costs for the planning, design, and construction of the Water Systems shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost for the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System, as determined by the Secretary. The Water Systems can use Federal funds for water pumping, treatment, storage, and transmission pipelines. Amounts provided for the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System are not returnable or reimbursable under reclamation laws. The Water Systems can use Federal funds for various facilities including transmission pipelines, pumping stations, buildings, maintenance equipment, access roads, interconnection facilities, electrical power facilities, and other necessary services determined by the Secretary. The Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System can use Federal funds for facilities related to water intake, distribution, pumping, and storage that serve the needs of citizens using public water systems. The Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System can utilize Federal funds for water supply wells and related facilities under a cooperative agreement with the Secretary. The Federal funds can be used for water supply wells, distribution pipelines, and control systems, but not for operation, maintenance, or replacement of the Water Systems. Title to the Water Systems will be held by the Authority. The Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System can use power from the Pick-Sloan Program. Congress finds that McCone and Garfield Counties were designated as impact counties during the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, entitling them to impact mitigation benefits under the Pick-Sloan program. The Administrator is required to provide up to 1.5 megawatts of power to the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System for pumping and operation needs from May 1 to October 31 each year. The Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System is eligible to receive power for its operations if it operates on a not-for-profit basis and is constructed under a cooperative agreement. The Administrator will establish the cost of the power provided. The Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System can receive power at a firm power rate. Additional power needed for pumping can be purchased at the best available rate, reimbursed by the Authority. The Authority is responsible for power payment. The Regional Water Authority is responsible for power payment and non-Federal delivery costs. The Authority is also responsible for all non-Federal transmission and distribution system delivery arrangements, including funding any necessary transmission upgrades. SEC. 6. WATER RIGHTS. This Act does not preempt or affect any State water law or the authority of a State to manage water resources within that State. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization is granted for the appropriation of funds for planning, designing, and constructing Water Systems in accordance with cost estimates from feasibility studies. The allocated amount can be adjusted based on fluctuations in development costs post specified dates, using engineering cost indices. The appropriation of funds for planning, designing, and constructing Water Systems is authorized based on cost estimates from feasibility studies. Adjustments to allocated amounts can be made post specified dates using engineering cost indices. The specified dates are January 1, 2008 for the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System and November 1, 2014 for the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water Authority System."
