    "content": "Since late 2007, U.S. and international markets for major grains and oilseeds have experienced tight supplies, strong demand, and high prices not seen since the mid-1990s. Agricultural commodity prices rose sharply in 2007 and jumped even higher in early 2008, with wheat and rice prices surging significantly. This report focuses on the factors behind the market conditions for major agricultural commodities during the 2007/2008-crop-year, particularly U.S. farm program crops. The text discusses the impact of higher commodity prices on farm incomes, government programs, hedging activities, and food prices. It also reviews the near- and longer-term commodity price outlook and policy options in response to high prices. Supply and demand circumstances vary widely across crops, readers are encouraged to review commodity overviews for background information. The global food crisis worsened due to high commodity prices, leading to a plea for aid from the United Nations. The situation was deemed an emergency by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, threatening progress in poverty reduction. World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick also highlighted the severity of the crisis. The surge in food prices could push 100 million people into deeper poverty, with 37 countries in food crisis requiring assistance, mainly in Africa. The World Food Programme's funding gap rose to $755 million due to increasing commodity prices, impacting global food security and raising concerns about food price inflation. The rising prices have led to significant price volatility and increased risks and costs in grain merchandising. High commodity prices have also raised the cost of routine hedging activities, reducing forward contracting opportunities for producers. Various factors such as weather-related supply shortfalls and unexpected demand surges have contributed to high market prices, particularly for wheat due to international crop failures. The primary reasons for high prices in U.S. and global stock levels are government policies limiting exports and growing demand in developing markets. For rice, export restrictions and panic buying have driven prices up, while for cotton, a \"bull market\" mentality has contributed to high prices despite abundant supplies. High prices for agricultural commodities are influenced by various factors such as global economic growth, lack of investment in the agricultural sector, and record oil prices. Bans on exports by one country can impact markets for other crops, while high prices for one crop can spill over into others. The last period of similarly high commodity prices was in 1995-1996 due to government stock reductions and global supply-reducing weather events. The current commodity market conditions for major U.S. farm program crops are reminiscent of the 1972-1974 period, with global stocks projected to reach historic lows by mid-2008. Commodity prices have approached or surpassed historic highs, showing heightened sensitivity to crop supply. The current commodity market conditions have led to record price volatility in agricultural markets, with historically high and unpredictable commodity prices impacting business costs unevenly. While U.S. farm income reached record levels in 2007 and is expected to rise in 2008, concerns have been raised in the livestock sector and food processing industry about the availability of grain and oilseed supplies and the impact of high input prices on profitability. Historic high price levels and volatility have sharply increased the costs of routine hedging activities for commercial elevators, grain merchandisers, and food processors. Consumers from low-income households and import-dependent nations have expressed concerns about food price inflation and the ability of agricultural producers to meet demand growth. Global stocks for major U.S. program commodities are expected to be at historically low levels before the next harvest in 2008. Global stocks for major U.S. program commodities are expected to be at historically low levels before the next harvest in 2008. End-of-year stocks for coarse grains and wheat are projected to drop to the lowest levels since 1977, with total grains falling to the lowest level since 1981. Stocks-to-use ratios for grains are at record lows, while global corn and vegetable oils are projected to have the tightest ratios since the early 1970s. Rice stocks are slightly up from the previous year but still represent a significant decrease from 2000 levels. Pipeline supplies are essential to maintain a continuous flow of grain to processors and exporters before the new crop is harvested. Market analysts speculate about desirable pipeline levels for major grain and oilseed crops. U.S. pipeline stocks are estimated to be around 9.5 to 11 million tons for wheat, 10 to 12 million tons for corn, and 4 to 5.5 million tons for soybeans. When USDA ending stock projections approach these levels, market prices become very sensitive to unexpected news, leading to increased price volatility. U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2007/2008 are projected to reach their lowest level at 239 million bushels or 6.5 million tons. In 2007/2008, U.S. soybean and corn stocks are projected to fall to their lowest levels since 1947, with corn supplies impacted by biofuels mandate. Cotton is an exception with abundant global and U.S. ending stocks. Global coarse grain stocks are expected to tighten, while wheat and rice stocks may slightly rebuild on record harvests in 2008/2009. Ending stocks are a key indicator of a commodity's price outcome, with high stocks relative to use leading to lower prices and low stocks relative to use raising prices. Tight supply situations have driven up commodity prices globally. The global marketing chain has seen higher commodity prices due to tight supply situations. Prices in different markets respond differently to new information, with agricultural futures markets reacting almost instantly, farm prices being influenced by local conditions, and wholesale/export market prices falling in between. Futures exchanges allow trading of commodity futures contracts. Commodity futures exchanges serve as central hubs for trading contracts to buy or sell commodities at fixed prices for future delivery. They play a crucial role in determining commodity price movements and provide real-time market information for participants to make quick buy or sell decisions. The transparency of futures exchanges allows for immediate reactions to new information on commodity supply and demand, with prices adjusting almost instantly. This market activity is reported electronically by major exchanges and through national and international news media. Commodity futures exchanges play a crucial role in price discovery and risk management for agricultural commodities. In early 2008, prices for corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean oil, and rice reached historic highs at the Chicago Board of Trade. The market has seen unprecedented volatility in response to global supply tightening over the past two years. The CBOT volatility index shows that corn and wheat futures have experienced high price volatility since 1980, with record levels in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, price levels and volatility for agricultural commodities continued to rise, with wheat showing the highest monthly average price volatility. USDA projects record high farm prices for major crops in 2007/2008, with rice prices expected to be the highest since 1973. Minor oilseeds, oats, and hay crops also projected to reach record highs. Tight market conditions expected to continue into 2008/2009, leading to higher farm prices. The season average farm price (SAFP) is influenced by lower-priced early marketings, reported monthly by USDA, not daily like commodity futures exchanges. The 2008/2009 prices for major program crops have raised concerns due to deviation from average prices and previous record SAFPs. For example, the corn SAFP midpoint is projected at $5.50 per bushel. The 2008/2009 corn SAFP midpoint is projected to be significantly higher than the previous five-year average and the previous record high. Most grains and oilseeds are also projected to be well above the previous five-year average prices, with rice projected at 155% above its average. Long-run commodity price projections suggest prices will settle at levels 19% to 110% above the recent five-year average. Export prices for major agricultural commodities rose 34% in 2006 and another 23% according to the FAO. Export prices for major agricultural commodities rose 34% in 2006 and another 23% in 2007, with food prices in the international marketplace increasing by nearly 18% in the first three months of 2008. This rise is driven by price increases in cereals and oils. The FAO predicts a 56% increase in the cereal import bill for the world's poorest countries in 2007/2008, following a 37% increase in the previous year. Rising food prices are attributed to increasing demand from emerging economies, competition between biofuels and food production, high fuel prices, and climatic shocks like droughts and floods. Global grain production declined in 2005 and 2006 due to decreasing global productivity, leading to reduced exportable supplies. Australia's grain exports were severely impacted in 2007 due to consecutive years of low production caused by drought. This, along with international government policies and a weak U.S. dollar, contributed to high commodity prices, particularly affecting agricultural commodities. Global grain production declined in 2005 and 2006 due to decreasing global productivity, leading to reduced exportable supplies. Australia's grain exports were severely impacted in 2007 due to consecutive years of low production caused by drought. This, along with international government policies and a weak U.S. dollar, contributed to high commodity prices, particularly affecting agricultural commodities. In 2007, weather conditions also curtailed grain crops in various regions, leading to a global decrease in grain supplies. The EU shifted from a net exporter to a net importer of grains due to declining supplies, while increasing global demand for food, especially in developing countries like China and India, further strained grain supplies. The dietary shift towards higher-value foods like meat and dairy products is increasing demand for grains used for livestock feed. Under-investment in agricultural sectors in developing countries has led to slowing yield growth. Population-driven demand growth has outpaced crop yields, depleting global agricultural surplus stocks. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar has made U.S. export products more competitive since January 2002. The declining value of the U.S. dollar has led to a surge in U.S. agricultural exports, reaching a record $101 billion in FY2008. This includes record bulk shipments of $44.7 billion and 135.8 million tons. Corn exports are projected to increase by 18%, wheat by 40%, sorghum by 82%, and rice by 23%. These record shipments have helped reduce U.S. stocks and drive up commodity prices. The decline in the U.S. dollar's value has made U.S. grains and oilseed more attractive despite rising commodity prices. Governments are promoting biofuels to address concerns over high oil prices, energy security, and climate change. Countries like the United States, Brazil, and the EU have implemented biofuel programs with specific standards and targets. Brazil, for example, requires a minimum use of sugar-cane-based ethanol in its gasoline supply and mandates a blend of biodiesel in diesel oil. The EU aims to have a 5% blend of biodiesel by 2008, increasing to 10% by 2020. EU's focus is on vegetable-oil-based biodiesel production, leading to incentives favoring rapeseed over other grain crops. Thailand, India, and China also have biofuel mandates but have suspended programs due to high commodity prices. In the US, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded Renewable Fuel Standards, requiring an increasing volume of biofuels to be blended. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates increasing biofuel blending with conventional fuels in the U.S., starting at 9 billion gallons in 2009 and reaching 36 billion gallons by 2022. The U.S. biofuels sector is supported by tax credits, import tariffs, and federally-subsidized grant programs. Current production is mainly corn-based ethanol, with a cap of 15 billion gallons by 2015. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates increasing biofuel blending with conventional fuels in the U.S., reaching 36 billion gallons by 2022. This places pressure on crop production systems, with 24% of the U.S. corn crop used for ethanol in 2007/2008, projected to grow to 33% next year. Higher corn prices bid supplies away from livestock feed, leading to bidding wars for crop land globally. Increased biofuel production is a principal cause of these market dynamics. Increased biofuel production, particularly in the United States, has significantly contributed to the rise in food prices. A study by FAPRI indicates that the Renewable Fuel Standard and ethanol tax credits have raised corn prices by about 20% through their joint implementation. The joint implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and ethanol tax credits supports corn prices by about 20%, with significant effects on other commodities like soybean oil. Competition for land in the Corn Belt drives price effects to the soybean market, influencing planting decisions in regions outside the Corn Belt. Studies by FAPRI and the Center for Agricultural Research and Development (CARD) show varying levels of support for corn prices, dependent on petroleum prices. Studies found that petroleum prices greatly influence the impact of government incentives on corn prices. The effects of the U.S. import tariff on Brazilian ethanol were not evaluated, but it was noted that eliminating the tariff would increase corn price impacts. The studies did not consider the effects of grants and subsidized loans on the biofuels sector. CARD Director Bruce Babcock highlighted the difference between short-run and long-run impacts of federal biofuels policy, noting that federal incentives encourage new ethanol plant construction, which would not shut down even if incentives were removed. Ethanol plants will continue producing as long as they cover expenses, regardless of federal incentives. The impact of biofuels policy on corn prices depends on crude oil prices and the number of ethanol plants. Foreign government responses to high commodity prices have reinforced, not alleviated, market conditions. Since late 2007, traditional wheat and rice exporting countries have limited exports to stabilize domestic prices, inadvertently driving international market prices higher. Over 40 food-exporting countries imposed restrictions or bans on crop exports to control internal inflation. Export bans have significantly impacted the global rice market, where only a small percentage of production is typically traded internationally. Since late 2007, traditional rice exporting countries like Vietnam, India, China, Egypt, and Cambodia have limited exports, removing over a third of available supplies from world markets. This led to panic buying by the Philippines and sharp increases in international rice prices. Similar actions were taken in the wheat market by Ukraine, Argentina, and Pakistan to control food price inflation. In early 2008, countries like Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Argentina implemented export restrictions to control food price inflation. Kazakhstan initially slowed wheat exports with higher custom duties, eventually leading to an outright ban. Argentina banned wheat and beef exports, imposed procedural barriers on corn exports, and heavily taxed soybean exports. These policies sparked a nationwide farmers' strike, temporarily suspended but leaving export controls in place. The uncertainty in Argentina as a reliable export supplier led to a shift in demand to U.S. commodities, boosting U.S. export numbers. Argentina's strict export controls impacted its agricultural prospects, with a predicted decline in planted area for wheat, corn, and soybeans in 2008. Several countries began removing barriers to imports to meet food needs, such as India authorizing duty-free rice imports in March 2008. In late March 2008, India allowed duty-free rice imports, following other nations in lowering tariffs on food imports. This led to increased international demand amid restricted supplies. Petroleum prices doubled since January 2007, reaching over $130 per barrel by late May 2008, impacting operating costs for energy products. High petroleum prices have increased operating costs along the marketing chain for agricultural inputs and outputs, inflating prices everywhere. Energy-driven higher marketing costs accumulate at the retail outlet, translating into higher consumer food prices. High oil prices may be the single most important factor in driving up food costs, boosting the popularity of biofuels. U.S. fiscal policies intended to stave off economic recession have indirectly contributed to the global \"food crises.\" The U.S. recession indirectly contributed to the global \"food crises\" by weakening the U.S. dollar through interest rate cuts. This led to higher commodity exports and oil prices, as a weaker dollar increased the price of oil in international markets. The weakening U.S. economy due to the recession has impacted capital and stock market prices, leading to bullish commodity markets attracting speculative investment money. This investment has been accused of reinforcing rising prices, with agricultural commodity markets now seen as a safe haven for investors. The past six years have seen the six highest farm income years on record. The past two years have seen significant gains in farm income, with national net farm cash income expected to reach a record $96.6 billion in 2008. Higher commodity prices have driven this increase, outpacing rising input expenses. Government direct payments are forecasted to be $13.4 billion in 2008, slightly up from the previous year. Government direct payments are expected to be around $17.4 billion in 2008, with projected market prices limiting payments under price-triggered programs. Fixed direct payments are estimated to increase slightly to $5.3 billion. FAPRI's more current estimates for 2008/2009 show government direct payments at $5.8 billion, down slightly from the previous year. Price contingent outlays on CCP and LDP are projected to be around $0.5 billion. In 2008, government direct payments are projected to be around $17.4 billion, with fixed direct payments comprising the majority at $5.3 billion. Price contingent outlays on CCP and LDP are estimated at $0.5 billion. Higher commodity prices in 2008 lead to increased crop insurance premiums, with corn prices rising from $4.06 to $5.25 per bushel. This results in higher per-acre returns being insured. In 2008, higher commodity prices lead to increased crop insurance premiums, with per-acre returns being insured substantially higher. Farmers can guarantee corn revenues in the $500 per acre range for a 75% coverage level, with guarantees over $600 possible with higher coverage levels. Government support for federal crop insurance rises with higher prices, as the government subsidizes premiums by 50% to 60% and reimburses insurance companies for a share of their administrative costs. The government reimburses insurance companies for a share of their administrative and operating expenses in delivering crop insurance policies, based on a percentage of total premiums. FAPRI projects net federal outlays at $4.7 billion in 2008 and $7.1 billion in 2009, compared to $3.6 billion in 2007. Rising feed costs have impacted profit margins in all livestock sectors. Rising feed costs have impacted profit margins in all livestock sectors, with Tyson Foods reporting its first loss in six quarters due to increased corn and soybean costs. Texas Governor Rick Perry highlighted the harmful effects of rising corn prices on livestock producers, with every one-cent rise costing the state's livestock sector over $6 million. The U.S. livestock sector faces challenges as biofuels production lowers grain supplies. The expansion of the biofuels industry is impacting feed supply logistics and composition, leading to a shift towards higher protein supplies. Futures contract prices are losing effectiveness in price discovery and risk management due to volatile agricultural futures prices since 2005. Demands for routine hedging operations have increased with rising commodity prices, leading to higher margin requirements and strains on market participants. Lack of convergence between cash and futures contract prices, especially for corn, soybeans, and wheat contracts at the CBOT, is raising risks for grain buyers offering futures-price-based forward contracts. This is concerning for traditional commercial interests in the agricultural marketing chain, as well as agricultural producers facing potential declines in efficiency of the futures market. Producers are facing challenges as grain and oilseed buyers are not offering forward contracts due to high prices. The lack of convergence between cash and futures prices is a concern, but there is no clear evidence of a decline in hedging operations. Agricultural interests are accusing the growing issue. Some agricultural interests blame speculative money in futures markets for artificially increasing prices and volatility, calling for more federal regulation and trading limits on speculative funds. Other issues like electronic trading and price limits have also been accused of worsening market efficiency. The CFTC held a special public \"Round Table\" to discuss issues in commodity futures exchanges and the importance of efficient functioning in agricultural futures markets. The increase in demand is considered permanent, and commodity prices may only return to lower levels through an expansion in aggregate supply. This can be achieved by increasing yields or cultivated area. The strong market price signals are expected to increase both planted area and yield per unit in 2008. Yield increases accumulate slowly over time through the use of fertilizers, pesticides, improved seeds, and better farming practices. However, limitations like availability and cost of fertilizers can hinder short-term yield gains. Intensive cultivation practices may have harmful environmental consequences. Area increases for a crop can happen more quickly than yield increases by shifting land use. In 2008, high commodity prices are expected to bring marginal land back into production, potentially leading to environmental consequences such as reduced wildlife habitat, lower soil fertility, and increased erosion. In 2007, 321 million acres were planted to principal crops in the United States, with 315 million acres for major program crops and 62 million acres of hay harvested. In 2008, USDA estimates a shift of over 2 million acres from minor crops to program crops, with nearly 1 million acres expected to move from hay to program crop area. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the United States provides payments to farmers to conserve soil and water resources by taking highly erodible land out of production. National enrollment in the CRP was 34.6 million acres in February 2008, with enrolled acres eligible for renewal or removal based on market conditions and owner preferences. In March 2007, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced no penalty-free release of acreage from the CRP in 2007. About 130,000 acres were withdrawn early in 2007, subject to penalty. Secretary Schafer reiterated the no-penalty-free-release-of-CRP position for FY2008, with a decision for FY2009 pending. In May 2008, USDA announced over 24 million acres of CRP land eligible for use as hay in 2008. In 2008, more than 24 million acres of land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) will be available for use as hay or forage after the nesting season for grass-nesting birds. CRP provides various environmental benefits such as wildlife habitat, erosion control, wetlands protection, carbon sequestration, and water quality improvements. Between September 2007 and February 2008, 2.1 million acres opted out of CRP, with another 27.8 million acres set to expire by 2010. Despite 83% of these acres having their contracts renewed or extended, high commodity prices may deter future re-enrollments and extensions. High commodity prices may discourage future re-enrollments and extensions in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Environmental and wildlife organizations advocate for maintaining or expanding CRP levels, while livestock groups and food processors seek to reduce early-out penalties to maximize cropped land. The Alliance for Agriculture Growth and Competitiveness has lobbied USDA to allow landowners to exit CRP contracts without penalty. If CRP policy remains unchanged, up to 2 million acres of CRP land per year could return to crop production over the next decade. USDA's March Prospective Plantings report predicts a 2% increase in program crop planted acreage in 2008 due to high commodity prices. In response to high commodity prices, there was a 2% increase in program crop planted acreage in 2008. Economists suggest that U.S. farmers' ability to respond to high prices is limited by a lack of viable cropland. They recommend \"re-optimizing\" the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) by eliminating penalties on expiring contracts and aggressively rebidding CRP holdings to free up funds for environmentally sensitive land. The rise in agricultural prices and high energy costs have led to increased food inflation in the United States and globally. Higher food prices impact consumers' dietary choices, especially for households that spend a larger proportion of their income on food. Rich industrial nations typically allocate 6% to 20% of their budgets to food, while middle-income countries spend 20% to 30%. In low income countries, food price increases pose a significant hardship as they spend a higher percentage of their budgets on food compared to middle and high income nations. The United States experienced a 4.2% increase in food prices in 2007, with a predicted inflation rate of 4.5% to 5.5% in 2008. The trend of rising food prices has been consistent since 2005, with the 11-month moving average reaching its peak in June 2007. In June 2007, the 11-month moving average of food prices reached its highest point since June 1990. Energy costs, especially fuel prices, have had a larger impact on food price inflation than commodity prices. Retail food prices are less volatile than farm-level prices due to other costs like transportation and processing. Food price increases are easily absorbed in the short run by U.S. households, as they spend about 6% of their total expenditures on food. In 2006, U.S. households spent about 10.5% of their income on food, with lower-income families spending over 20%. Food assistance programs like Food Stamps help qualifying individuals, but rising food prices can still lead to difficult spending choices. In 2007, $33.2 billion was spent on the Food Stamp program, with recipients receiving an average of $95.63 per month. Rising food prices lead to higher federal spending on food assistance programs, as benefits are indexed to consumer food basket prices. High commodity prices impact international markets differently based on import dependence and financial ability to respond. For example, Japan can better accommodate rising food import prices compared to Mauritania. Japan has the financial means to accommodate rising food import prices, unlike import-dependent developing countries. Higher food prices affect lower-income households in foreign markets severely. Humanitarian groups are concerned about the impact of higher grain prices on developing countries. The grain import bill for vulnerable nations is forecast to reach $169 billion in 2008, a 40% increase from 2007 due to rising international cereal prices. The cost of food imports has increased by 40% from 2007 due to higher international cereal prices, freight rates, and oil prices. Despite a slight retreat in ocean freight rates in 2008, the rise in crude oil prices suggests shipping costs may not significantly decline. The political consequences of food shortages have led to hoarding, theft, and civil unrest in various countries. In Haiti, food-price rioting resulted in the toppling of the prime minister. Higher commodity and food prices have impacted the international community's ability to provide food aid to other countries. The UN's World Food Program estimated it would need $2.9 billion to cover its 2008 project needs, including feeding 73 million people in 78 countries. However, rising prices led to emergency appeals for additional funding, totaling $755 million. In 2008, the World Food Program faced difficulties with rice suppliers breaking contracts to sell at higher market prices. The United States provided $2.1 billion in food aid in 2006, delivering over 3 million tons of commodities to 65 countries, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Rising food and fuel prices led to a projected $200 million shortfall in emergency aid funding in 2008. According to press reports in March 2008, USAID expects a $200 million shortfall in funding for emergency food aid. President Bush directed the Secretary of Agriculture to access grain supplies from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust valued at $200 million to meet the emergency needs. The FAO forecasts a 3.8% expansion in world cereal production to a record 2.192 billion tons in 2008, with wheat leading the increase. Global supplies are expected to rebuild by late 2008, easing the tight cereal supply situation. Immediate price moderation can be achieved by repealing government policies limiting grain and oilseed exports. Export-prohibiting policies on grain and oilseed supplies are being repealed to prevent distortions in international market prices. Ukraine has already lifted its wheat export ban, and Russia and Kazakhstan may follow suit by September. In the rice market, concerns arose after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma's rice-growing regions, but Japan plans to export rice to the Philippines. Japan, China, Thailand, and Cambodia have substantial rice stocks available for export. India is waiting for the monsoon rains before deciding on easing export restrictions. The easing of rice export bans, combined with projections for record production, is expected to lower international rice market prices in the latter half of 2008. High biofuel feedstock demand has increased prices for competing crops like corn and soybeans in the United States. Both USDA and FAPRI outlooks for 2008 predict expanded acreage globally and in the US due to high prices bringing marginal land back into production. Expectations for increased double cropping and a return to crop production on pasture land and former CRP acres are projected to boost planted area for corn, soybeans, and wheat by nearly 7 million acres to 224.6 million acres. In response to strong price incentives and government policies, there is a boost in planted area for corn, soybeans, and wheat by nearly 7 million acres to 224.6 million acres. Worldwide, similar area expansions are expected, with projections for record grain production in 2008. Despite this, only marginal global stock building is projected due to continued growth in demand. Demand for livestock products and feedstuffs is expected to continue growing due to rising global population and income levels. Increased government biofuel-usage policies in the US and EU will also drive demand for corn and vegetable oils. This will lead to high price volatility in commodity markets. Prices for feed grains and oilseeds are expected to remain high due to increased demand for biofuel production in the US and EU. FAPRI's 10-year projections suggest that major US program crops will continue to have elevated prices. A sustained period of agricultural output growth is needed to return to abundant supplies and lower prices. Increased agricultural production requires investment in research, extension, and marketing infrastructure. Policy choices on agricultural productivity and renewable energy will shape commodity markets. The U.S. and international response will vary based on targeted beneficiaries. The U.S. and international response to agricultural challenges varies by beneficiary and time period. Various policy responses are being suggested or implemented, including changes in agricultural and food policy, reversal of biofuels policy, and reduction in crop land retirement. The U.S. milling and baking industry has expressed concerns about short grain supplies and price rises in commodity markets. The American Bakers Association (ABA) has raised concerns about short grain supplies and price rises in U.S. commodity markets. They propose a three-point congressional action plan: reducing CRP land by 7 million acres, supporting early out-of-contract provisions, and identifying viable cropland for production. The ABA also recommends EPA to waive RFS requirements and drop tariffs on imported ethanol, and urges Congress and USDA to prioritize domestic food industry needs over export markets. In April 2008, the U.S. Grocery Manufacturers Association urged Congress, the EPA, and states to freeze and rollback biofuels mandates due to their impact on food prices. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association opposes the national biofuels RFS and calls for a market-based approach for ethanol production from livestock feedstuffs. They support sun-setting biofuels tax credits and ethanol import tariffs as scheduled. In April 2008, the International Food Policy Research Institute proposed a moratorium on global grain- and oilseed-based biofuels to reduce corn and wheat prices. Texas Governor Rick Perry requested the EPA to waive 50% of the RFS' ethanol requirements to alleviate the impact on corn prices. The EPA has the authority to suspend part of the RFS for one year under the Federal Clean Air Act. The National Chicken Council also expressed concerns about the biofuels mandates. The National Chicken Council's President, George Watts, praised Governor Perry's petition for an ethanol waiver due to rising food costs. Republican senators questioned EPA about ethanol mandate regulations and food inflation concerns. Some groups blame high oil prices and global factors, not just biofuels, for food cost increases. Congress held hearings on these issues since May 1, 2008. Congress has held hearings since May 1, 2008, on the causes and effects of the rise in agricultural prices, with a focus on the impact of high food prices on American families and the role of fuel subsidies in affecting food supply and prices. Several bills have been introduced in response to high commodity prices and their alleged causes, including bills to repeal biofuels mandates and tax credits, as well as to freeze the Renewable Fuel Standard at its 2009 level. The U.S. response to the global food crisis includes legislative proposals for emergency funding, new farm legislation, and increased food aid requested by President Bush. The Farm Bill (P.L. 110-234) enacted in May 2008 has implications for funding related to domestic and international food concerns. The U.N. Secretary-General announced a task force to address the global food crisis, coordinating efforts of U.N. agencies, funds, and programs, as well as the World Bank and IMF. The United Nations, World Bank, IMF, and experts collaborate on international agricultural development and food aid. The UN agencies responsible are FAO and WFP. WFP focuses on emergency operations, relief projects, and logistics, while FAO works on long-term goals like improving nutrition and agricultural productivity through research and extension support. FAO supports developing countries in modernizing agriculture, forestry, and fisheries practices for better nutrition. The Initiative on Soaring Food Prices provides technical and policy assistance to Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries. Collaboration with other organizations like WFP and IFAD is aimed at integrating new projects and interventions. The WFP, FAO, and IFAD will present strategies for the food-price crisis at a U.N. meeting in Geneva. Governments will discuss policy responses at a gathering in New York. The FAO's \"Summit on Food Security\" in Rome will coordinate global response. Proposed actions include establishing a U.N. task force, providing emergency food aid, and supporting poor food importers with seed and fertilizer. The World Bank and IMF are exploring financial assistance for poor countries. The IMF proposes a rapid financing facility for poor countries facing balance of payments gaps. The U.N. calls for lifting food export restrictions. Suggestions include increasing investment in international agricultural productivity and eliminating government policies that distort market signals. Key themes include reversing protective export bans, reducing subsidies that divert agricultural land to biofuel production. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) issued policy recommendations to address high international commodity prices and food insecurity.
