    "content": "The federal government increased its involvement in domestic law enforcement through grant programs and anti-crime bills, expanding the FBI's role in fighting domestic crime. The federal government's assistance to state and local law enforcement has declined in recent years, with a focus on countering terrorism post-9/11. Congress is debating the federal government's role in crime control, including broadening federal jurisdiction over hate crimes, restructuring the DOJ's COPS program, providing funding for court security and victim protection programs, reintegrating ex-offenders, and prosecuting identity theft. The federal government is debating its role in various crime control issues, including prosecuting identity theft, equitable penalties for crack and powder cocaine, combating methamphetamine abuse, addressing gang-related violence, juvenile offender treatment, funding for mentally ill offenders, broadening federal jurisdiction over child pornography crimes, decreasing DNA evidence backlog, and opening federal inmate products/services to competitive bidding. The 110th Congress is considering various crime-related issues such as competitive bidding for federal inmate services, federal sentencing reform post U.S. v. Booker, funding for fugitive database maintenance, and oversight of DOJ grant programs. This report excludes topics like homeland security, terrorism, abortion, and gun control, focusing on traditional state and local government responsibilities in crime prevention and control. The federal government started taking a more active role in crime control due to the increase in violent crime rates. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report program collects data on major violent crimes and property crimes from state and local law enforcement agencies. The UCR collects crime data from state and local law enforcement agencies. Another measurement, the National Crime Victim Survey (NCVS), addresses under-reporting issues by surveying victims of crime. The NCVS surveys households to gather data on criminal victimization in the US, including rape, assault, theft, and more. It helps estimate victimization likelihood for different population segments. The UCR reports a rise in violent crime rates from the 1960s to the 1990s, followed by a decline. In the early 1990s, the violent crime rate began to decline, reaching a 30-year low despite slight increases in 2005 and 2006. Congress has revisited federal funding for law enforcement due to the decreasing crime rate, but has also passed tougher measures for certain offenders. Legislation in the 110th Congress and hate crime laws are among the crime-related issues being considered. In 2006, there were 7,722 reported incidents of hate crimes, leading to a debate in Congress about expanding federal jurisdiction over hate crimes. Law enforcement must provide evidence of bias motivation before labeling a crime as a hate crime. There is disagreement on the level of federal intervention needed to address these crimes. The 110th Congress is considering legislation to stiffen penalties for bias-motivated crimes, such as the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 (H.R. 1592). The COPS program, established in 1994, aims to enhance community policing by providing grants for hiring new officers and developing crime-prevention technology. The 109th Congress reauthorized the COPS program through FY2009. The 110th Congress is considering legislation to restructure and reauthorize the COPS program. Two bills have been introduced, the COPS Improvement Act of 2007 (H.R. 1700) and a Senate version (S. 368). Both bills aim to expand the scope of the COPS grant programs, make COPS an exclusive component of the DOJ, and authorize appropriations for COPS. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, which is part of the COPS program, receives its appropriations under DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance. The House considered legislation to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, which provides benefits for the purchase of body armor by state and local law enforcement entities. Legislation was enacted in the 110th Congress to improve court security and increase penalties for crimes against federal employees, including federal judges. The Act increases penalties for illegal acts against jurors, witnesses, victims, and informants to combat witness intimidation, which can hinder the criminal justice system and erode public confidence. P.L. 110-177, enacted in 2008, incentivizes states to enhance victim/witness protection programs. The Act expands grant programs for victim/witness protection, aiming to reduce recidivism rates among released offenders by providing assistance for reentry into communities. Discussions include reinstating federal parole for non-violent drug offenders and enhancing existing programs for offender support. The Second Chance Act of 2007 expands offender reentry grant programs at the DOJ, providing funding for pilot programs to support ex-offenders as they reintegrate into society. The Act focuses on preparing offenders in prison, connecting them with services upon release, and offering long-term support in communities. The Second Chance Act of 2007 expands offender reentry grant programs at the DOJ, focusing on preparing offenders in prison, connecting them with services upon release, and offering long-term support in communities. The Act includes grants for state and local reentry courts, substance abuse treatment, health care services, family unification, and education programs. Identity theft is a significant issue, with approximately 8.3% of the U.S. adult population falling victim in 2005. Policymakers are working on strengthening criminal statutes for effective prosecution and restitution for victims, as recommended by The President's Identity Theft Task Force in 2007. Legislation enacted in the 110th Congress, the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008, aims to prosecute identity theft-related offenses more effectively. This Act allows for restitution to victims and expands prosecution of identity thieves by removing certain provisions in the U.S. Code. It also broadens the definition of \"cyber-extortion\" and extends jurisdiction for prosecuting computer fraud offenses. Policymakers continue to introduce bills addressing identity theft, showing ongoing concern for data protection. The House passed multiple bills aimed at safeguarding data, including eliminating Social Security numbers on Medicare cards and advancing Internet safety education. Critics argue that mandatory minimum sentencing laws disproportionately affect nonviolent, minority offenders. The 1986 and 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Acts established mandatory minimum sentencing for federal drug offenses, including the 100-to-1 quantity ratio between powder and crack cocaine. Proponents argue that mandatory minimums deter crime and provide certainty in the criminal justice system. The 1988 Act mandated a minimum sentence for first-time simple possession of crack cocaine, with possession of over 5 grams resulting in a minimum of five years. Congress directed the U.S. Sentencing Commission to study the penalties for crack and powder cocaine offenses due to concerns about their disproportionate impact on minority offenders. The Commission recommended raising the trigger quantities for mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine in their 2002 and 2007 reports. The U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended raising the trigger quantities for mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine in an effort to reduce sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine. Some states have also taken steps to address these discrepancies in state law. Additionally, there have been proposed amendments to federal sentencing guidelines to lower penalties for crack cocaine offenses, although mandatory minimum penalties remain unchanged. Bills in Congress aim to reduce mandatory minimum penalties for both crack and powder cocaine. The illicit manufacture and abuse of methamphetamine (MA) is a longstanding issue in certain states, particularly in the West, Midwest, and Southeast regions of the country. Concerns have been raised about the spread of this problem nationwide, making it a significant national concern. According to the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there were approximately 529,000 current users of MA aged 12 or older. Congress has enacted legislation over the past 30 years to address the illicit abuse and manufacture of MA in clandestine labs. The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA) was enacted during the 109th Congress to address the illicit abuse and manufacture of methamphetamine (MA). It included provisions to curb MA use, trafficking, and production by imposing stricter regulations on precursor chemicals and requiring retailers to track purchases of over-the-counter medications containing these substances. The 110th Congress introduced legislation to address issues related to methamphetamine abuse, manufacture, treatment, and trafficking. Two targeted measures were enacted to further regulate the tracking of retail purchases of over-the-counter medications containing methamphetamine precursor chemicals. The Drug-Endangered Children Act of 2007 extends the authority of the grant program for youth gang problems in urban and rural America. Gang activity is pervasive, with 785,000 gang members and 26,500 gangs active in the US in 2006. Policymakers are considering solutions to youth gang violence. Policymakers are exploring new approaches to address the increasing youth gang violence, including expanding law enforcement tools and federal prosecution authority for gang members. Congress has passed legislation to enhance penalties for gang-related crimes and prevent youth from joining gangs. Several bills targeting the gang issue have been introduced in the 110th Congress. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aim to address the gang problem by broadening federal prosecution of violent crimes committed by gang members, including provisions for prosecuting gang enterprises similar to RICO statutes. Controversial measures include transferring juveniles to adult criminal prosecution at age 16, increasing mandatory minimum penalties for gang-related offenses, and allowing the death penalty for certain gang crimes. Some bills in the 110th Congress focus on addressing gang activity by creating designated high-intensity gang areas, reauthorizing the G.R.E.A.T program, and authorizing grant programs to prosecute gang violence more effectively. Only one bill, the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007, has received congressional action. There is a shift towards focusing on young offenders in the criminal justice system, with questions raised about the treatment of this population. The juvenile justice system has shifted from rehabilitation to holding juveniles accountable. The national debate revolves around rehabilitation versus retribution. The Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act (JJDPA) expired in 2007 and has not been reauthorized in the 110th Congress. The last reauthorization in 2002 restructured grant programs aimed at preventing juvenile delinquency. The 108th and 109th Congresses focused on lowering the age of culpability for certain gang-related offenses. The core debate in juvenile justice remains whether rehabilitation or a punitive approach should be emphasized for young offenders. The issue of funding for grant programs also continues to be a concern. S. 3155 would reauthorize the major provisions of the JJDPA from FY2009 through FY2013, making slight modifications to existing grant programs and creating a new Incentive Grants for State and Local Programs. The bill aims to expand mental health and substance abuse services for juveniles, addressing the strain mentally ill offenders place on the criminal justice system. In jails and prisons, health, mental health, and substance abuse issues are more prevalent than in the community. A 2006 report found that a significant percentage of inmates had mental health problems. Mentally ill inmates were more likely to have committed violent offenses or had multiple prior incarcerations. Policymakers are focusing on providing treatment to mentally ill offenders during and after incarceration, and preventing them from entering the criminal justice system. The Bureau of Justice Assistance awards grants for programs that increase public safety by collaborating with the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse systems to provide treatment for mentally ill offenders. The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2008 reauthorizes funding for collaboration programs. The Act authorizes $50 million annually for the Adult and Juvenile Collaborations Program grants, allowing the Attorney General to award grants to state, local, and tribal governments for mental health treatment services for non-violent, mentally ill adult or juvenile offenders facing criminal charges. The Act authorizes funding for programs to provide specialized training for law enforcement on handling incidents involving individuals with mental illness, developing receiving centers for assessing individuals in custody for mental health needs, improving information systems for mentally ill offenders, promoting cooperation between justice and mental health agencies, and offering campus security personnel training on dealing with individuals with mental illness. The Internet has facilitated the proliferation of child pornography, making it easier to reproduce and disseminate images. Child pornography cases accounted for a significant portion of federal sexual exploitation cases, with the growth in such cases attributed to the Internet's role in distribution. Between 1994 and 2006, 82% of the growth in sex exploitation cases referred to U.S. Attorneys offices was related to child pornography. Congress has focused on reducing child pornography through increased penalties and funding initiatives. The PROTECT Act of 2003 increased penalties for producing and possessing child pornography. The FBI investigates child pornography cases through its Innocent Images National Initiative to rescue victims and prosecute predators using the Internet. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) funds Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task forces to investigate and prosecute sexual predators exploiting children online. The ICAC program helps enhance state and local law enforcement responses to offenders using the Internet for exploitation. Legislation aims to expand federal authority to prosecute crimes related to child pornography and sexual exploitation of children. Subtitle D of the legislation aims to prosecute individuals using interstate or foreign commerce for crimes related to sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The bills amend current laws to include these offenses under specific sections. The bills aim to amend current laws to prosecute offenses related to child pornography and exploitation, expanding the federal government's ability to combat these crimes. They also require the Attorney General to create a national strategy for child exploitation prevention. The bills authorize a national Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force program to combat online enticement of children by sexual predators. They also expand federal authority to prosecute crimes related to broadcasting live images of child abuse and provide funding for ICAC task forces. The bills enacted in 2008 target individuals altering images of minors for child pornography. DNA evidence analysis has impacted crime investigations, with backlogs in testing due to resource limitations. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program was established in response to backlogs in DNA testing for crime investigations. It provides grants to states to analyze DNA evidence from backlogged crime scenes, authorized under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and reauthorized under the Justice for All Act. Grants help state and local governments collect and analyze DNA samples to reduce backlogs. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program provides funding to analyze DNA samples for inclusion in the national DNA database, CODIS. It helps increase laboratory capacity for DNA analysis, collect samples from individuals required to submit them, and ensure timely testing for crimes, including sexual assault. The program was reauthorized in 2008 with appropriations of $151 million. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program, reauthorized in 2008 with $151 million appropriations, mandates 40% of grants for analyzing DNA samples from crime scenes without suspects for CODIS. UNICOR, a government-owned corporation, employs inmates and competes with private businesses in the federal market, sparking debate over preferential treatment. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) has a mandatory source clause that requires federal agencies, except the Department of Defense, to procure products from FPI. Congress has taken legislative action to mitigate FPI's competitive advantage over the private sector, including modifying the mandatory source clause for certain agencies. In recent years, legislation has been introduced in Congress to limit federal agencies' use of funds for products or services from Federal Prison Industries (FPI) unless they offer the best value. Proposed bills aim to phase out FPI's mandatory source clause and end its preferential treatment for services. Additionally, other crime-related issues have emerged in the 110th Congress, including the creation of federal sentencing guidelines in 1984. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established federal sentencing guidelines through the creation of the United States Sentencing Commission. The Commission was tasked with addressing disparity in federal sentencing policy by considering factors such as the harm caused by the offense, the offender's prior record, public perception of the offense, deterrent effect of the sentence, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The U.S. Sentencing Commission considers various factors in federal sentencing, including offender characteristics and statutory directives. The Supreme Court's ruling in U.S. v. Booker made federal sentencing guidelines advisory rather than mandatory, giving judges discretion in sentencing. The Supreme Court's ruling in U.S. v. Booker gives federal judges discretion in sentencing offenders by making sentencing guidelines advisory rather than mandatory. This decision allows judges to consider individual circumstances when handing down sentences, leading to debates on whether Congress should amend laws to require guided sentences or allow judicial discretion under certain circumstances. The Senate Judiciary Committee amended the FIND Act in 2008 to improve state-federal information sharing on fugitives and increase funding for U.S. Marshals Service regional fugitive task forces. The bill aims to improve state-federal information sharing on fugitives and increase funding for U.S. Marshals Service regional fugitive task forces. It addresses the issue of outstanding felony warrants not being entered into the NCIC, leading to public safety concerns such as fugitives committing crimes in other states and law enforcement officers not being aware of potential dangers. The lack of funding is cited as a reason for the failure to upload warrants into the NCIC. S. 3136 aims to provide grants to upgrade computer systems for easier entry of outstanding warrants into NCIC and validate them. It authorizes yearly appropriations of $15 million for FY2009 and FY2010, and $20 million for FY2011. Additionally, it authorizes an extra $50 million in annual appropriations for FY2009 and FY2012, and an extra $25 million for FY2013-FY2015 to increase resources for U.S. Marshals Service regional fugitive task forces. The bill, S. 3136, authorizes additional funding for the US Marshals Service and grants for fugitive extraditions. It also requires reporting on missing felony warrants and apprehended fugitives. DOJ grant programs and appropriations oversight is highlighted. In the 109th Congress, the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance and Local Law Enforcement Block Grant programs were combined to create the Justice Assistance Grant program. Funding for the JAG program in FYs 2005-2006 was less than previous appropriations for the Byrne Formula and LLEBG programs. Congress has also reduced funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services since FY2002, leading to concerns among law enforcement officials. Critics argue that despite funding reductions, these programs remain crucial for state and local law enforcement. In the 109th Congress, funding for state and local law enforcement programs has seen reductions, while grants for countering terrorism have increased. Critics are concerned that the decrease in funding has made it harder for law enforcement to combat violent crime, with some calling for more federal assistance. Legislation in the 109th Congress focused on registration and notification laws and federal funding. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 was signed into law, establishing a national public registry for sex offenders and tightening registration requirements. It also created grant programs for states to enhance civil commitment programs and passed legislation reauthorizing agencies under DOJ's jurisdiction. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 authorizes appropriations for DOJ for FY2006 through FY2009, restructuring grant programs and creating new offices. Congressional attention was given to federal funding for state and local law enforcement assistance during the 109th Congress. In the 108th Congress, two federal grant programs were consolidated into the newly created Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2005. Funding for both programs decreased in FY2005 and FY2006. The COPS program, created during the 103rd Congress, provides funding for community policing efforts by state and local law enforcement agencies. At least 85% of the grant money must be used for hiring police officers, equipment procurement, overtime pay, or support systems. Although the program's authority lapsed in FY2000, Congress has continued to appropriate funding for it. The 109th Congress reauthorized the program. The 109th Congress passed legislation reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), encouraging collaboration among law enforcement and addressing the special needs of victims of domestic and sexual violence. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorized by the 109th Congress provides emergency leave and transitional housing for victims of domestic and sexual violence. It also includes provisions for DNA fingerprinting, allowing federal authorities to take samples from a broader range of individuals, but requires expunging the data for those with dismissed charges or acquittals. The Violence Against Women Act reauthorized by the 109th Congress provides emergency leave and transitional housing for victims of domestic and sexual violence. It includes provisions for DNA fingerprinting, allowing federal authorities to take samples from a broader range of individuals. The act also requires expunging DNA analysis from CODIS for individuals with dismissed charges, acquittals, or overturned convictions."
