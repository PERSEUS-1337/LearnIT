    "content": "MEDICAL INCENTIVES ACCOUNTS: Section 137 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 establishes medical incentives accounts. The employer's contributions to an employee's medical incentives account are excluded from the employee's gross income. There is a limit of $3,000 for contributions in a taxable year, with adjustments for medical care costs after 1994. The medical care cost adjustment is based on the percentage difference in the Consumer Price Index for medical care components between August of the preceding year and August of 1993. Any increase not a multiple of $50 is rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. This adjustment does not apply to employees without employer-provided health insurance. The subsection exempts employees covered by employer-provided medical insurance from certain requirements. A medical incentives account is defined as a trust for paying medical expenses of the account beneficiary, their spouse, or dependents. The trust governing instrument must meet specific requirements, including accepting only cash contributions within the annual limit, having a trustee who meets certain criteria, ensuring nonforfeitable interest for individuals, prohibiting investment in life insurance contracts, and restricting trust assets from being used for life insurance. The trust assets must not be commingled except in a common trust fund. Medical expenses refer to deductions under section 213. An account beneficiary is the employee for whom the medical incentives account is established. Distributions from the account are taxable unless used for qualified purposes. The medical incentives account beneficiary's income is only tax-exempt if used for medical expenses. If not, a 10% penalty applies. The medical incentives account is tax-exempt unless certain prohibited transactions occur, in which case it loses its tax-exempt status. If a medical incentives account ceases to be tax-exempt, all assets are treated as distributed on the first day of the taxable year. If the account is used as security, it may affect its tax-exempt status. The custodial account is treated as a trust if the assets are held by a bank or another person who will administer it according to the requirements. If a custodial account is treated as a trust, the custodian is responsible for it. The trustee of a medical incentives account must report to the Secretary and the account holder on contributions, distributions, and other relevant matters as required by regulations. Exclusion for employment tax purposes includes amending certain sections of the tax code. The tax code is amended to include medical incentives accounts in various sections, such as Social Security, railroad retirement, unemployment, and withholding taxes. Additionally, a special rule is added for medical incentives accounts in the context of prohibited transactions. The tax code is amended to exempt individuals with medical incentives accounts from certain taxes on transactions if the account ceases to be a medical incentives account. Additionally, failure to provide reports on medical incentives accounts is addressed in the code. The tax code is amended to exempt individuals with medical incentives accounts from certain taxes on transactions if the account ceases to be a medical incentives account. It also addresses penalties for failure to report on medical incentives accounts. The tax code is amended to exempt individuals with medical incentives accounts from certain taxes on transactions if the account ceases to be a medical incentives account. The effective date for these amendments applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
