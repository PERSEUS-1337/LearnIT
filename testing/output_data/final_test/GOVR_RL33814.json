    "content": "The first section discusses the debate on extending public financing to congressional elections, highlighting the presidential public financing system since 1976 and the interplay with campaign spending limits. Arguments for and against public financing are shaped by these political realities. The second section provides a historical review of efforts in Congress to enact public financing of its elections, focusing on key periods of congressional activity such as the Watergate-focused 93rd Congress and the 100th-103rd Congresses. Public finance bills were passed during these periods, with a shift towards emphasizing public benefits over public funds. Major features of congressional proposals are presented as policy options for consideration. The third section analyzes public subsidies for state office candidates in 16 states, including a table detailing these systems and the impact of public finance programs. The report does not cover recent legal challenges to state public financing programs. The fourth section discusses public opinion on public financing of elections and campaign spending limits, noting less extensive data compared to the 1970s. The report discusses public financing systems in the 1970s and offers observations for Congress to consider. It includes details of public finance measures passed in Congress from 1973-1993 and summaries of recent public financing legislation. Two bills, H.R. 1404 and S. 750, propose publicly financing congressional campaigns in the 112th Congress. A third bill, S. 749, suggests funding the public financing program through a 0.5% tax on government contracts over $10 million. Discussions on public financing of congressional elections have been ongoing for a century. Public financing of congressional campaigns has been discussed for a century. Since 1976, public funds have been used to finance presidential elections, with the level of funds determined by taxpayer designations on a voluntary check-off. The Supreme Court's Buckley v. Valeo ruling in 1976 resulted in a closer linkage between public subsidies for election campaigns and limitations on campaign spending. The presidential public financing program was established in 1971 and expanded in 1974 under the Federal Election Campaign Act. Candidates meeting eligibility requirements and agreeing to expenditure limits can receive matching funds in primaries and full subsidies in the general election. Minor party and independent candidates may also qualify for public funds. Political parties can receive funding for nominating conventions. Legislative proposals for public funding are typically tied to candidates' adherence to spending limits. Public financing and spending limits are linked, but they have distinct benefits and drawbacks. Public financing aims to reduce politicians' reliance on private money, while expenditure limits aim to curb excessive spending on elections. The impetus for public financing stemmed from concerns over the source of campaign money rather than the overall amount spent. The landmark ruling in Buckley v. Valeo allowed for spending limits in conjunction with public funding, as candidates voluntarily accepted them. Public financing is seen as the most realistic way to control campaign expenditures in congressional elections, as Congress has rejected mandatory limits. Some goals of public funding and spending limit measures have been addressed in other legislation with bipartisan support. Proposals to lower campaign costs have been prominent in Congress, such as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. Measures like tax credits for small contributions aim to encourage citizen involvement without arbitrary limits. Public financing is supported for its potential to reduce the threat of money in politics. Supporters of public financing argue that it can reduce political corruption, enhance electoral competition, and allow candidates to focus on issues rather than fundraising. The current amount of money spent in elections is seen as corrupting the political system, leading to candidates spending excessive time raising funds and potentially relying on affluent individuals and special interests for support. Public financing aims to reduce corruption and the appearance of corruption in politics. Public subsidies to candidates aim to minimize undue influence and corruption from contributors and partisan fundraising. Testimony in McConnell v. FEC lawsuit highlighted concerns about corrupting influences from private money in campaign politics. Public financing also promotes electoral competition by providing candidates with financial resources to run for office, regardless of personal wealth. Public financing programs require candidates to demonstrate political viability before receiving funds, which supporters believe will increase electoral competition. It is seen as a constitutional way to limit campaign spending, as candidates could be required to limit spending in exchange for public funding. Some major candidates fear that adhering to spending limits associated with public financing will hinder their ability to run competitive campaigns. Public financing opponents raise objections rooted in philosophical opposition to taxpayer-funded elections, concerns about administrative challenges in implementing a fair system across diverse districts and states, and fears that public financing could distort elections by giving incumbents even greater advantages. Opponents of public financing argue that it could give incumbents even more advantages, decrease election competitiveness, and be seen as \"welfare for politicians.\" They believe it may coerce candidates to limit campaign spending in exchange for funding, force taxpayers to support objectionable messages, and waste money on fringe candidates with little chance of winning. Opponents of public financing argue that campaign spending is not high compared to commercial advertising budgets, and worthy candidates can win public support without government intervention. They also suggest that concerns about rising campaign costs are overstated, with most fundraising coming from individuals giving less than the legal limit. Additionally, opponents claim that proponents of public financing fail to adequately support their arguments and rely on its appeal without sufficient evidence. Public financing for federal elections has been a topic of legislative proposals since 1907, with bills introduced in Congress starting in the 1950s. Despite varying levels of legislative activity, bills to extend public financing to congressional elections have passed one or both houses in active periods like the 93rd Congress (1973-1974) but were never enacted. In the 93rd Congress (1973-1974), bills for public funding in congressional elections were passed by the Senate in response to the Watergate scandal. The bills provided subsidies to major party candidates in House and Senate elections. However, these provisions were later removed due to opposition in the House. In the 100th through 103rd Congresses (1987-1993), debates on voluntary spending limits and public financing took place, with bills passing in the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses. In the 102nd Congress, bills for public funding in congressional elections were vetoed by President George H.W. Bush. Efforts in the more recent period focused on reducing public treasury funds going to campaigns and shifting towards providing public benefits financed with public resources or mandated by government action. President Theodore Roosevelt suggested public subsidies for election campaigns in 1907 to limit corporate contributions and deter wealthy individuals from buying their way into office. He proposed providing federal funds to national political parties with fixed limits on individual contributions, all disclosed to the public. President Theodore Roosevelt proposed public subsidies for election campaigns in 1907 to restrict corporate contributions and prevent wealthy individuals from influencing elections. He suggested providing federal funds to national political parties with set limits on individual donations, all of which would be made public. President Theodore Roosevelt proposed public subsidies for election campaigns in 1907 to restrict corporate contributions and prevent wealthy individuals from influencing elections. He suggested providing federal funds to national political parties with set limits on individual donations, all of which would be made public. Roosevelt believed that this measure would improve the system of conducting campaigns by eliminating the need for large campaign funds and ensuring transparency in political financing. President Theodore Roosevelt proposed public subsidies for election campaigns in 1907 to restrict corporate contributions and prevent wealthy individuals from influencing elections. He suggested providing federal funds to national political parties with set limits on individual donations, all of which would be made public. Roosevelt believed that this measure would improve the system of conducting campaigns by eliminating the need for large campaign funds and ensuring transparency in political financing. Roosevelt's proposal faced challenges in implementation due to the complexity of the machinery and the need for strict regulations on campaign funds. Various committees were established from the mid-1920s to the 1970s to investigate campaign expenditures and make recommendations for improving campaign finance practices. The Senate's Special Committee recommended public funding for federal elections in 1936, proposing to prohibit private contributions. Despite no action taken by Congress, interest in public funding was sparked by concerns over unethical conduct in accepting campaign contributions. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. introduced a resolution in 1949 for a study on public funding of presidential campaigns to address government corruption rumors. The resolution authorized the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration to investigate and formulate a bill for financing presidential election campaigns with governmental funds. Lodge supported the concept of public funding, envisioning details to come from a congressional study. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. introduced a resolution in 1949 for a study on public funding of presidential campaigns to address government corruption rumors. Lodge believed that eliminating private contributions to presidential campaigns would lead to a cleaner political atmosphere and encourage public-spirited individuals in public office. He suggested applying the same principle to other offices but focused on presidential races due to the significant number of appointments at the President's disposal. Lodge's resolution aimed to combat corruption in government. During the 84th Congress, public funding bills were introduced almost 50 years after Theodore Roosevelt suggested them. Senator Richard Neuberger introduced S. 3242 for direct public subsidies for major party campaigns, co-sponsored by other senators. No action was taken on S.Res. 132 regarding government corruption rumors. During the 84th Congress, Senator Richard Neuberger introduced S. 3242 for public financing of major party campaigns, co-sponsored by other senators. The bill was also submitted in the House as H.R. 9488 by Representative Frank Thompson. Neuberger and Thompson referred to the bill as the Theodore Roosevelt Campaign Contributions Act of 1956. Neuberger emphasized the need to remove financial influence from government processes, citing a recent bribery attempt by an oil company on a Senator. Senator Neuberger proposed public financing of major party campaigns to address the influence of private contributions on public officials' independence and integrity. He argued that the current system creates inequality in access to voters and can allow a candidate to win based on financial resources rather than ability or policies. This proposal aimed to prevent public officials from being influenced by private interests, similar to how Presidents and Senators are not paid by private sources. Neuberger's bill proposed public financing of major party campaigns to reduce the influence of private contributions on public officials. The bill allotted federal funds to parties for campaign expenses of candidates for federal office, based on their past election performance. This aimed to address the inequality in access to voters and prevent candidates from winning based solely on financial resources. Neuberger proposed a system of public financing for major party campaigns to reduce the influence of private contributions on public officials. The system would be voluntary, with parties allowed to accept donations from private sources as long as individual contributions did not exceed $100. A Federal Campaign Contributions Board would administer the system, with federal funds allocated based on past election performance. During the 1950s and 1960s, Congress focused on improving campaign finance laws, including the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. Various bills were introduced to address limitations in fundraising transparency and amounts spent in elections. Proposals for indirect public financing through tax credits and deductions were more common than direct public financing. In 1962, President Kennedy's Commission on Campaign Costs released a report with recommendations for enhancing campaign finance practices. The 1962 report by President Kennedy's Commission on Campaign Costs recommended tax incentives for individual donations to political parties, but did not support direct public subsidies. The commission favored a \"matching incentive system\" where small donations would be matched with U.S. Treasury funds. The 1962 commission report recommended tax incentives for individual donations to political parties and proposed a \"matching incentive system\" where small donations would be matched with U.S. Treasury funds. In 1966, Congress passed the Presidential Campaign Fund Act, providing public subsidies to major political parties for presidential campaigns. The Presidential Campaign Fund Act (H.R. 6950) was made inoperative until Congress provided guidelines on fund distribution, effectively killing the act. The Honest Elections Act of 1967 (H.R. 4890) provided optional public financing for general election campaigns of presidential, vice presidential, and senatorial candidates, with funds directly provided to candidates. The 92nd Congress marked a milestone in election finance with the enactment of FECA to replace the Corrupt Practices Act of 1925. Public financing in presidential general elections was also established through the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, financed by a $1 tax. The bill for direct funding to candidates, not parties, was opposed by Republican committee members for its financial burden on taxpayers. The Revenue Act of 1971 established the Presidential Election Campaign Fund through a $1 tax check-off to fund presidential general election campaigns. It also included tax credits and deductions for political contributions. The amendment survived Senate debate and the House-Senate conference, and was signed into law on December 10, 1971. This public financing system became a major issue in Congress in response to the Watergate scandal in 1973 and 1974. Many Members viewed the FECA of 1971 as inadequate in preventing campaign finance abuses revealed by the Watergate scandal. Focus shifted to limits on contributions and expenditures, and extending public financing to congressional elections. In July 1973, Senators Kennedy and Scott proposed an amendment for public subsidies in House and Senate general elections. In 1973, the Senate passed an amendment for mandatory public financing in House and Senate general elections, providing subsidies for major party candidates. Major party House candidates could receive 15 cents per eligible voter or $90,000, while major party Senate candidates could receive 15 cents per eligible voter or $175,000. Private contributions were essentially eliminated in the general election. In 1974, support for public financing of elections grew in Congress after the Watergate scandal. The Senate reported a new version of the FECA Amendments, creating a system for federal elections with matching funds in primaries and fixed funding in general elections. The Senate reported a new version of the FECA Amendments in 1974, proposing a voluntary system of public funding for presidential elections, funded by the check-off on federal tax returns. The committee emphasized the importance of public financing to reduce reliance on large private contributions and ensure fair competition among candidates. Senator Mansfield highlighted the necessity of using public funds for the public business of elections. Senate debate on the issue lasted for 13 days, with proponents successfully defending against amendments to eliminate or reduce public financing. The Senate passed S. 3044 on April 11, 1974, with amendments to reduce public funds and add free mass mailings to general election candidates. Public financing of congressional elections was a contentious issue in the House-Senate conference on S. 3044, but ultimately dropped. Amendments to add a voluntary matching system for House and Senate general elections were defeated. The bill S. 3044 initially included spending limits for congressional elections, but ultimately dropped public financing provisions. Spending limits remained for House and Senate elections, with restrictions on personal and family resources. Public financing support waned after the 93rd Congress, despite unsuccessful attempts to revive the issue in subsequent Congresses. During the 94th through 96th Congresses, there were unsuccessful attempts to include congressional public financing in bills. In the 95th Congress, public finance supporters had initial success with key figures supporting public financing of congressional elections. During the 95th Congress, a bill proposing public financing of congressional elections was considered by the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. The original bill included matching funds for Senate primaries and subsidies for general elections, but funding for primaries was removed to increase chances of passage in the House. Despite strong opposition, the Senate voted to delete public financing for Senate general elections after failed cloture votes. The House held hearings on public financing but no consensus was reached on the approach to take. During the 95th Congress, public financing of congressional elections was considered, but no consensus was reached on the approach. An attempt to report a bill for partial public funding of House general elections failed in October 1977 due to amendments adding to costs and making the bill harder to pass. Chairman Thompson discontinued the markup, citing lack of votes. The House narrowly defeated rules to consider public finance measures twice. In March 1978, an amendment proposing a matching fund system in House general elections was offered. During the 95th Congress, public financing of congressional elections was considered, but no consensus was reached on the approach. In March 1978, an amendment proposing a matching fund system in House general elections was offered by Thomas Foley and Barber Conable. The amendment faced controversy and a defeat in a vote, leading to a closed rule that prohibited amendments on the floor. Efforts by public finance supporters to pass the amendment were hindered by the closed rule. During the 95th Congress, public financing of congressional elections was considered, but no consensus was reached on the approach. In the 96th Congress, a bill proposed by public finance advocates led by Representatives Foley, Conable, Anderson, Udall, Mikva, and Tim Wirth, aimed to provide matching funds in House general elections with voluntary spending limits. Despite efforts to gain more support, the bill failed to be reported on May 24, 1979, with a vote of 8-17, halting momentum for extending public financing. The momentum for extending public financing to congressional elections came to an end with a vote of 8-17. The 97th through 99th Congresses saw no concerted effort in pursuit of this goal, as Senate control shifted to Republicans who were generally less supportive of public financing. Advocates of campaign finance reform focused on restricting the role of political action committees (PACs) in financing congressional elections. Despite partisan stalemate on the PAC issue in the 97th through 99th Congresses, the 100th Congress saw a shift with a Democratic majority in the Senate. This led campaign reform advocates to push for public financing and campaign spending limits in congressional elections, moving beyond just curbs on PACs. The new focus included voluntary spending limits and participation incentives such as public funds. In the 105th Congress, reform proposals focused on public funding and spending limits for congressional candidates. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd and Senator David Boren cosponsored S. 2, which gained support from 50 additional cosponsors. The bill included public funding for Senate general election candidates who agreed to spending limits and aggregate PAC receipts limits for House and Senate candidates. Despite strong Republican opposition, the measure was brought to the floor in June 1987. After facing opposition and failed cloture votes, sponsors of S. 2 attempted to amend the bill by changing the public funding component to a matching fund system. Despite multiple attempts to scale back the public funds component to overcome the filibuster, the substitute amendment only provided subsidies to candidates whose opponents exceeded voluntary limits, along with offering lower postal and broadcast rates as incentives for participation in the system. In an effort to reduce campaign costs and increase participation, spending limits and public benefits were included in bills presented by House and Senate leaders. Despite facing opposition and failed cloture votes, the measure was ultimately withdrawn from consideration in February 1988. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee reported a bill with spending limits, public benefits, and a PAC receipts cap, aiming to broaden the concept of public financing to include public benefits. A substitute amendment in May 1990 aimed to garner more support for a system with public benefits and spending limits. The proposed system included public funds for candidates triggered on a contingency basis, broadcast communication vouchers, reduced broadcast and postal rates, and spending limits based on a population-based formula. No direct cash payments were made to candidates, with benefits aimed at compensating against free-spending opponents and independent expenditures. The Senate passed S. 137 on August 1, 1990, with voluntary spending limits, communication vouchers, and subsidies for independent expenditures. Senate debate included amendments by Senators McConnell and Kerry, both defeated. The House Democratic leadership offered a more extensive measure than the Senate bill. The House Democratic leadership offered a measure, H.R. 5400 (Swift), that reduced the role of public funds as an incentive for spending limits. Candidates would receive benefits such as lower mailing rates, free radio or TV spots, and tax credits for in-state contributors. The bill passed the House on August 3, 1990, by a 255-155 vote. During the 102nd Congress, public financing of congressional elections progressed further than ever before. Bills similar to those passed in the previous Congress were approved by the Senate and House but were vetoed by President George H.W. Bush. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee reported S. 3 (Mitchell-Boren) on March 20, 1991, which incorporated the Boren substitute amendment. Senate debate on the bill lasted six days and included 21 roll-call amendment votes. During the 102nd Congress, public financing of congressional elections progressed with the Senate passing S. 3 on a 56-42 vote. The bill included voluntary spending limits, allowances for small in-state donations, broadcast communication vouchers, and conditional subsidies. The House introduced H.R. 3750, which replaced free TV and radio time with a matching fund system. The 101st Congress bill on public financing of congressional elections included voluntary House spending limits, matching funds, and lower postal rates. The House passed H.R. 3750 with provisions for extra spending in runoffs or close primaries, and a conference committee reconciled the differences between the House and Senate bills, maintaining spending limits and public benefits for their own candidates. The conference version of the bill focused on issues like PAC contribution limits, soft money, and bundling, with delayed implementation of spending limits and public funding systems. The House and Senate passed the bill, but President Bush vetoed it due to his opposition to spending limits and public financing. The Senate override vote failed, ending debate on the issue for the 102nd Congress. In the 103rd Congress, similar bills were introduced with improved reform prospects. In the 103rd Congress, President Clinton made recommendations to improve the reform prospects of the bill S. 3, which focused on Senate elections and included provisions like congressional broadcast vouchers and an increased tax check-off. The Senate debate lasted three weeks, with a filibuster broken after the addition of the Durenberger/Exon Amendment. The Durenberger/Exon Amendment was added to S. 3, removing broadcast vouchers and allowing subsidies for independent spending. This amendment led to a successful cloture vote and passage of the bill the next day. The House leadership bill, H.R. 3, focused on House elections with voluntary spending limits and communication vouchers. The House passed H.R. 3 by 255-175 after defeating a rule to allow votes on more alternatives. House and Senate compromise efforts were impeded by differences on PAC limits and funding sources. Senate Republicans led a filibuster against appointing conferees, ending with a failed cloture vote on September 30, 1994. The shift to Republican control in 1995 effectively killed the momentum for public financing in Congress. In the 104th Congress, Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold introduced a campaign finance reform bill (S. 1219) to address the high cost of congressional elections and replace private funds with other sources. The 1996 election highlighted the need for regulation as unregulated campaign activities overshadowed regulated ones. In response, significant changes were made to proposed legislation at the start of the 105th Congress, with the introduction of S. 25 (McCain-Feingold). In the 105th Congress, S. 25 (McCain-Feingold) and H.R. 493 (Shays-Meehan) proposed federal regulation of election-related activity, including issue advocacy. A revised S. 25 in 1997 focused on party soft money and issue advocacy, eliminating provisions on congressional spending limits and PACs. The campaign finance debate shifted from improving the regulatory system to preserving it against new campaign practices. The campaign finance debate shifted from improving the regulatory system to preserving it against new campaign practices. In the wake of the 1996 elections, the debate lasted until 2002 when BCRA, known as McCain-Feingold, was enacted. Appendix B summarizes four public finance bills introduced in the 109th Congress, all focusing on House elections. Two bills, H.R. 2753 (Andrews) and H.R. 4694 (Obey), proposed public funding only in the general election with different criteria and spending limits. The 109th Congress introduced four public finance bills focusing on House elections. H.R. 3099 and H.R. 5281 offered benefits in primary and general elections, with the Leach bill matching in-state contributions and imposing a $500,000 spending limit. The Tierney bill, known as Clean Money, Clean Elections, provided public subsidies equal to spending limits, free broadcast time, and additional time at reduced rates for candidates who raised small donations. Five congressional public financing bills were introduced in the 110th Congress: H.R. 1614 (Tierney), H.R. 2817 (Obey), H.R. 7022 (Larson), S. 936 (Durbin), and S. 1285 (Durbin), proposing comprehensive public financing programs in different ways. H.R. 2817 aimed to make public financing mandatory in general elections, while the other bills allowed candidates to choose to participate and meet specific criteria. H.R. 1614, H.R. 7022, S. 936, and S. 1285 also proposed public financing for primary elections. H.R. 2817 proposed replacing private campaign financing in general elections and included spending limits for primary elections. It also aimed to ban independent expenditures in House elections. Other bills like H.R. 1614, H.R. 7022, S. 936, and S. 1285 proposed \"fair fight funds\" to counter high-spending opponents. S. 1285 was the only bill to receive a hearing during the 110th Congress. During a hearing on the bill, Senators Durbin and Specter testified in favor of it, highlighting the need to reduce the influence of money in elections. Minority Leader McConnell opposed the bill, citing concerns about public financing for politicians. The National Association of Broadcasters expressed concerns about fringe candidates receiving public funds. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) expressed concerns about proposed LUC reductions for participating candidates and sections of S. 1285 that would restrict broadcasters from preempting candidate advertising and fund public financing through spectrum usage fees. Five public financing bills were introduced in the 111th Congress, including H.R. 158 and H.R. 2056, which aimed to mandate public financing during House general elections by limiting candidate spending to a proposed public financing fund. H.R. 2056 (Tierney) and H.R. 158 aimed to mandate public financing during House general elections by limiting candidate spending. H.R. 2056 was similar to H.R. 1614 from the previous Congress, proposing full public financing for candidates. Additionally, three other bills focused on voluntary public financing with a base subsidy and matching funds. These bills received attention in the 111th Congress, with a hearing held on H.R. 1826. The 111th Congress held a hearing on H.R. 1826 and later marked up a successor bill, H.R. 6116, which offered incentives for public financing. Candidates would receive a base subsidy and a 400% match of small contributions under the proposed Fair Elections Now Act. The current versions of FENA, S. 750 and H.R. 1404, are similar to previous bills from the 111th Congress. The current versions of the Fair Elections Now Act (FENA) from the 111th Congress propose providing candidates with base subsidies, matching funds, and incentives in exchange for limiting private fundraising to small contributions. S. 750 and H.R. 1404 do not require spending limits as long as campaign funds are within the public financing allocation and small-dollar contributions. However, other forms of spending would be limited, such as party coordinated expenditures, joint fundraising, and leadership PAC activities. Publicly financed House candidates would receive two major benefits for financing their campaigns. Publicly financed House candidates would receive a base subsidy of 80% of the national average of spending by winning House candidates during the previous two election cycles (approximately $1.1 million based on 2010 and 2008 data) and a 500% match of small contributions of $100 or less raised from individuals. Senate candidates under S. 750 would be eligible for a base subsidy of $750,000 plus $150,000 for each congressional district in the state, a 500% match of small contributions, and broadcast vouchers. The Senate bill would not limit coordinated party expenditures made on behalf of publicly financed candidates if the funds used for those expenditures came from individual contributions of no more than $500. The House and Senate versions of FENA are similar, with differences in application to House and Senate campaigns, allocation of base subsidies, and broadcast provisions. H.R. 1404 applies to House campaigns, while S. 750 applies to Senate campaigns. The House bill allocates subsidies based on previous House candidate spending, while the Senate bill emphasizes funding for candidates from states with multiple congressional districts. The Senate bill includes broadcast-advertising vouchers for each congressional district, while the House bill does not. The Senate bill extends the lowest unit charge to national party committees, offering a 20% discount and preventing preemption of purchased time. It allows unlimited coordinated party expenditures funded by individual contributions of $500 or less. The bill would be financed through a 0.5% tax on government contracts over $10 million, capped at $500,000 annually. The 112th and 111th Congress versions of FENA are similar, with a few key differences. The matching rate in the 111th Congress was 400%, while the current proposal is 500%. The 112th Congress caps matching-fund benefits at 300% of the base subsidy, compared to 200% in the 111th Congress. S. 750 for Senate campaigns does not limit coordinated party expenditures if funded by individual contributions of $500 or less. Broadcast provisions vary, with spectrum auctions omitted in the 112th Congress versions. The 112th Congress version of the legislation, H.R. 1404, omits lowest unit charge provisions and has changed broadcast-voucher provisions. Congress faces various options in considering public finance proposals, with campaign expenditure limits being a challenging aspect. Considerations for congressional public financing are discussed, with CRS taking no position on the options presented. Establishing limits on campaign expenditures is a challenging aspect of devising a public financing system. Low spending limits can hinder competition by favoring incumbents with higher visibility and name recognition. House campaign limits are typically set at a specific amount, while Senate limits are based on population. Critics often label spending limit proposals as \"incumbent protection\" measures. The Senate limits on campaign expenditures are based on a population-based formula. The challenge for policymakers is to set spending limits that allow for genuine competition while serving the public's interest. Increasing the generosity of these limits could offset potential damage to the electoral process. The Senate limits on campaign expenditures are based on a population-based formula to allow for genuine competition while serving the public's interest. Some legislation in the 111th Congress proposed not imposing spending limits on participating candidates due to concerns about viability post the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in Davis v. FEC. Recent measures have focused on general elections rather than primaries, not due to lack of support but strategic decisions. Some sponsors have not favored coverage of primaries in recent proposals due to strategic decisions about enacting a more complicated and expensive system. The lack of inclusion of primaries may lead to private money entering the electoral system earlier to evade restrictions. Previous bills conditioned benefits on adherence to spending limits in both the primary and general elections. Proposals for campaign finance reform often require candidates to adhere to spending limits in elections and limit personal and family funding. Additional requirements may include participating in debates, meeting fundraising thresholds, and including closed-captioning in broadcast ads. Candidates for campaign finance reform are often required to meet fundraising thresholds through small donations or petition signatures. The choice between fixed subsidies and matching funds can impact campaign costs and planning. Fixed subsidies offer simplicity but can result in higher costs, while matching funds are generally less expensive. The matching fund approach for campaign finance reform offers the advantage of linking public money with voter appeal by candidates. It avoids complex judgments about candidate seriousness and can match contributions on an equal or higher percentage basis. In contrast to direct subsidies, recent measures have moved towards matching funds for candidates. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a shift away from direct public funding for candidates towards indirect forms of public funding and cost-reducing benefits. These measures were designed to increase support for spending limits and public benefits packages, including tax credits for contributions to candidates who agree to limit their expenditures. The shift in the late 1980s and early 1990s moved towards indirect public funding for candidates, including a 100% tax credit for contributions to participating candidates decided by citizens. This form of funding is seen as advantageous as it is determined at the grassroots level rather than by a government agency. The prospect of easier fundraising through small donations would incentivize candidates to limit spending, with many believing that individual citizen contributions in small amounts are the best kind of political money. The rise in campaign costs, particularly due to broadcast advertising, has led to proposals for candidates to receive broadcast vouchers funded by the federal treasury. This indirect public funding aims to address the high cost of media in campaigns. Another proposal suggests lower postal rates for candidates who adhere to spending limits to encourage campaign cost control. The proposal offers candidates lower postal rates to encourage acceptance of campaign spending limits. This may not be a significant inducement due to postage's small role in campaign budgets, but it can help reduce overall campaign costs, especially in House races. Proposals in Congress aimed to incentivize candidate participation by requiring broadcasters to offer lower rates to candidates participating in public funding, as part of their license agreements and at no cost to the U.S. treasury. Some proposals even suggested broadcasters provide specified amounts of free time to participating candidates, reducing overall campaign costs. Proposals in Congress aimed to reduce election costs by offering lower broadcast rates to candidates participating in public funding. However, these proposals face strong opposition from the broadcast industry. Protection for candidates facing high expenditures from non-participating opponents or outside groups is a common provision in bills since the 100th Congress. Proposals in Congress aim to reduce election costs by offering lower broadcast rates to participating candidates. Additional public funds may be provided to match excessive spending by opponents or independent expenditures, with potential caps on overall funds. However, the increased costs to a public funding system and the activity of outside groups like 527 political organizations may need to be addressed in future proposals. In future proposals, there is a focus on addressing the activity of outside groups like 527 political organizations that spend money outside federal election law. Recent proposals aim to add disincentives for candidates not participating in the public finance system, in addition to offering benefits. Critics view these measures as heavy-handed attempts to force participation, raising questions about the voluntary nature of participation. Some proposed disincentives include requiring disclaimers on campaign advertisements. The Senate bills in the 101st-103rd Congresses included provisions such as requiring disclaimers on campaign advertisements for non-participating candidates, removing the lowest unit rate requirement, and taxing campaigns of non-participating candidates. The proposal suggests providing public funds only as a last resort. The Senate bills in the 101st-103rd Congresses included provisions such as requiring disclaimers on campaign advertisements for non-participating candidates, removing the lowest unit rate requirement, and taxing campaigns of non-participating candidates. The proposal suggests providing public funds only as a last resort, aimed at curbing excessive campaign spending without incurring taxpayer expenses. This selective provision would act as a strong inhibitor against excessive spending. The decisions made about the variables will determine the cost of any public finance system. The Senate bills in the 101st-103rd Congresses proposed various provisions for campaign finance reform, including disclaimers on campaign ads, removing the lowest unit rate requirement, and taxing non-participating candidates. The bills aimed to curb excessive campaign spending without burdening taxpayers, with public funds being a last resort. The cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for these bills were based on the details of the systems envisioned, with benefits for House and Senate elections outlined. The cost estimates for campaign finance reform proposals range from $90 million to $190 million in different election cycles. The \"Clean Money, Clean Elections\" measure advocates for public funds to lower candidate spending in primary and general elections. The cost of implementing a system for Congressional elections is estimated to be less than a billion dollars per year, which amounts to less than $10 per taxpayer annually. Most proposals rely on a tax check-off system, similar to the presidential model, to fund congressional elections. The 101st-103rd Congresses explored creative ways to offset any potential losses to the U.S. The 101st-103rd Congresses sought creative ways to offset losses to the U.S. Treasury, proposing broadcast licensing fees, a tax on lobbyists, and a tax on corporate income. State public financing programs emerged in the 1970s, with some states offering direct public financing to candidate campaigns. States vary in their approach to public financing. State public financing programs emerged in the 1970s, with some states offering direct public financing to candidate campaigns. Seven states fund only statewide races, while nine states fund legislative and statewide races. Two major public-financing frameworks include the \"clean money, clean elections\" model, which offers fixed subsidies to candidates meeting qualifying requirements. State public financing programs have two major frameworks: the \"clean money, clean elections\" model and other state public financing mechanisms. The clean money model provides fixed subsidies to candidates meeting qualifying requirements, while other programs vary in design and offer less full public financing. States fund these programs through various sources like tax check-offs and direct appropriations. The clean money model of public financing offers full public funding to candidates who agree to spending limits. Seven states currently have this model, with specific amounts determined by each state. Public Campaign, an interest group, advocates for the clean money program at various levels of government. In Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Vermont, public financing is offered to candidates for various offices. These programs were approved between 1997 and 2005 and have similar components nationwide. On the other hand, 10 states have public financing programs that differ from the clean money model, with variations dating back to the 1970s. In the 1970s, public financing programs were initiated post-Watergate. Clean money models differ from other programs in how candidates receive funding and the amount available. Clean money funds are fixed subsidies, while other programs use matching funds based on private contributions. States limit the percentage of contributions matched or cap total funds disbursed, influenced by available revenues. Michigan uses a tax check-off system for public financing. In Michigan, a tax check-off system funds public financing for qualifying gubernatorial candidates. General-election funding takes priority, with additional funds available for primary candidates on a pro-rated basis. Public financing proponents argue against unlimited private funding to prevent corruption and excessive time spent fundraising. Recipients must adhere to campaign conduct conditions to increase public confidence and limit private fundraising. Candidates receiving public funding must adhere to spending and fundraising limits, participate in debates, and demonstrate political viability by raising a minimum level of private contributions. Once eligible for public funding, they may use privately raised contributions directly or transfer them to a central state fund for redistribution. The extent of public financing utilization depends on opponents' participation, state program structures, and candidate choices. Public financing programs can become dormant if spending limits are perceived as too low by candidates. In Maryland, gubernatorial candidates have not accepted public funding since 1994 due to the 30-cent-per-voter spending limit being considered inadequate. Low candidate participation in public financing does not necessarily mean the program is ineffective. Nebraska's public financing program, rarely utilized since 1992, offers matching funds to candidates but is not often accepted. Public financing in Nebraska is available if one candidate adheres to spending limits while the other does not. If both candidates exceed limits or neither does, they are not eligible for public financing. This system encourages candidates to limit spending voluntarily to avoid opponents receiving public funds. The impact of public financing in Nebraska is more about keeping private spending down rather than injecting more public money into elections. Research on the effects of campaign finance laws, including public financing, is limited and outdated. Public financing programs in different states vary widely in terms of implementation and terminology, making it difficult to compare data. There has been no comprehensive evaluation of public finance systems to determine their effectiveness. Current knowledge is limited to narrow evaluations of specific states or races, and recent legal challenges to public financing programs are not addressed in this report. Public financing programs aim to make elections more competitive by providing funding to candidates. Research shows mixed evidence on whether publicly funded campaigns are more competitive in terms of campaign spending and election outcomes. While public financing can lead to lower-cost campaigns and closer races, most programs are still in their early stages. Public financing programs aim to reduce financial disparities among candidates, with research showing that it can provide ballot access for candidates who may not otherwise be able to run. While public financing may not always lead to closer races, it does promote consistent competition in elections. Comparatively, studies on legislative elections in states like Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have shown varying impacts of public financing. Public financing in states like Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin has been found to increase competition in elections, with more incumbents facing challengers and more competitive races. However, the effectiveness of public financing depends on sufficient funding to attract candidates. Anecdotal evidence suggests public financing may benefit challengers or Democrats, but this is not consistently supported by research. Initial findings indicate that female candidates are more likely to accept public funds in state house races, but the availability of funds does not necessarily encourage more women to seek office. Overall, the popularity and impact of public financing diminish if not all candidates are eligible for funding. Public financing in states like Wisconsin and Hawaii has not increased competitiveness as expected due to insufficient funding. Supporters argue that public financing can lead to more substantive campaigns by freeing candidates from raising large private contributions. Research shows that full public financing decreases the time spent on fundraising for state legislative candidates. The national survey of candidates in 2000 found that full public funding can reduce the time spent on fundraising, while partial public funding may not alleviate the constant need for fundraising. Full public financing can free candidates from soliciting donations and allow them to focus on campaigning, but it is unclear if this leads to more substantive campaigns. Public financing may democratize campaigns by providing resources for average people to run, allowing minorities and women to participate. Clean Money programs require small private contributions, expanding the donor pool. Recent attention to public financing stems from notable ballot initiatives. The recent attention to public financing has increased due to ballot initiatives in Maine and Arizona, the first states to provide full public financing for candidates. These programs, modeled after the clean money program, have been implemented in other states like Connecticut. It is too early to fully assess the impact of public financing in Connecticut. The impact of public financing in Arizona and Maine is still being assessed. The Government Accountability Office found inconclusive and mixed results in their report on the public financing programs in these states. It is too early to draw causal linkages to any changes resulting from the programs. The Government Accountability Office found inconclusive and mixed results in their report on public financing programs in Arizona and Maine, assessing voter choice, electoral competition, interest group influence, campaign spending, and voter participation. The 2010 report noted increased participation over time but could not definitively attribute findings to public financing. The 2010 report found inconclusive results regarding the impact of public financing in Arizona and Maine. Recent research suggests that public financing has increased competition and diversity among candidates and donors in both states. Studies show a rise in contested races in Arizona and more diverse small donors supporting publicly financed candidates. Maine's Ethics Commission reported that public financing tightened competition between incumbents and challengers. The Ethics Commission report found that public financing reduced private contributions to candidates, increased candidate communication with voters, and encouraged more first-time candidates, including women, to run for office. A Brennan Center study showed increased competition in states with public financing, with Maine's program slightly boosting vote share for challengers and incumbents. Some critics question public financing programs on ideological or legal grounds. Some critics argue that public financing programs could indirectly force citizens to support politicians they disagree with, as Arizona's program is funded through fines and fees. Critics also suggest that increased competition in elections may be influenced by factors like term limits. Maine's program has been criticized for allowing private contributions to candidate leadership PACs. Political scientists warn that public financing could lead to more independent expenditures by interest groups. Despite mixed data on effectiveness, candidate participation in public financing programs in both states has been consistent. Candidate participation in public financing programs in Arizona and Maine has steadily increased over time, with over 50% of legislative candidates choosing to participate by 2008. Data on differences between Democrats and Republicans or House versus Senate candidates are not uniformly available, but more Democrats typically participate in public financing. In Maine in 2008, 94% of Democratic House candidates and 81% of Democratic Senate candidates accepted public funds, compared to 70% and 75% of their Republican counterparts, respectively. Connecticut's legislative public financing program was fully implemented in 2008, with approximately 75% of all candidates participating. Americans generally support campaign finance reform and are concerned about the amount of money in campaigns. Public opinion on campaign finance can be contradictory, with surveys showing support for public financing in principle but hesitation to invest tax dollars. The wording, source, and timing of questions greatly influence polling results. Support for public financing is higher when questions are framed positively or conducted for pro-reform clients, while negative responses are more common when focusing on costs or taxation. Survey respondents are generally supportive of public financing when it limits special interests' influence or campaign costs. However, disapproval arises when taxpayer dollars are mentioned. Support for public financing increases after scandals, with polls showing favor for fixed public funds for campaigns and banning private contributions. In a poll, 48% opposed public funding for presidential and congressional elections financed by public funds with spending limits. When spending limits were not mentioned, only 26% favored government financing with tax money. Americans consistently support limiting campaign spending over public funding. For example, in a 1997 poll, 60% prioritized limiting campaign spending, and 79% favored limits on congressional candidates' fundraising and spending. Public financing for congressional candidates has been a topic of debate for decades. Polls show that the majority of Americans support stricter laws controlling campaign finance. Interest in public financing remains high as Congress considers potential changes. The state and federal public financing systems offer potential lessons, but interpreting them is challenging due to the diversity among state programs. The presidential public financing system provides matching funds in primaries and fixed subsidies in the general election. State programs vary in eligibility, funding availability, candidate requirements, and implementation timelines. Both systems rely on fixed subsidies or matching funds, but program details can differ significantly. While state and federal public financing systems offer potential lessons, interpreting them is challenging due to program diversity. Only Arizona and Maine provide full public financing for legislative elections, with others offering partial financing. Research focuses on individual program components, with limited systematic comparisons across states. Uncertainties exist on how public financing might apply to congressional campaigns, but potential considerations remain. State models suggest two approaches to national public financing: infusing public money to limit private money's impact and providing candidates with funds to reduce fundraising needs. Some state models suggest two approaches to national public financing: distributing money to limit private money's influence and incentivizing candidates to spend less by observing spending limits. Congress faces a choice between funding primary or general elections, with most state programs supporting both types. Nebraska's program, for example, reserves public financing for candidates whose opponents exceed spending limits. Public financing for elections, whether for primary or general elections, aims to reduce costs and program complexity. While private fundraising is still necessary for viability, public financing does not eliminate private money entirely. Concerns exist about increased financial influence from non-candidate sources under public financing compared to the current system of private financing. Public financing systems aim to reduce costs and program complexity for elections. Concerns exist about increased financial influence from non-candidate sources compared to private financing. Congress should address fundraising and spending regulations, and ensure sufficient funding to attract candidates for public financing programs. Public financing systems aim to reduce costs and program complexity for elections. Despite congressional interest since the 1950s, disagreements have hindered efforts to adopt public financing in legislative elections. Effective public financing requires adequate resources for candidate participation and administration. Administrators play a crucial role in determining fund qualifications, disbursement, and enforcement. Public administrators have successfully handled candidate qualifications and fund disbursement in presidential elections. The key question is whether they can enforce spending limits that come with public funding. Congressional public financing would require significant resources for the Federal Election Commission. Public financing only regulates one aspect of campaign conduct, so additional regulations would still be needed for areas like political advertising and party activities. Public financing alone will not impact other factors influencing individual races. Public financing of congressional elections may not solve the issue of uncompetitive races, but it can level the playing field for challengers. It has been shown to reduce financial disparities between candidates and lead to closer margins of victory in some states. However, the impact of public financing on elections varies and further research is needed. Public financing of congressional elections can reduce candidates' time spent on fundraising. However, it may not affect activities by 527s, political parties, or other organizations. Evidence from states suggests that implementing public financing would require faith in the system and patience. The impact of public financing is largely unknown due to variations in state programs. Public financing programs for congressional elections require sufficient funding to attract serious candidates and maintain competitiveness. Spending limits must be high enough to allow candidates to compete in modern campaigns. Lessons from state programs will become clearer as more states experiment with legislative public financing over time. H.R. 2753 (Andrews)\u2014Public Campaign Financing Act of 2005 aimed to provide public funding for House general elections based on media costs, up to $750,000, with conditions for candidate eligibility and fundraising restrictions.
