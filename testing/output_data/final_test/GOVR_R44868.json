    "content": "Short-term, small-dollar loans are consumer loans with low initial amounts and short repayment periods. They are used to cover cash flow shortages caused by unexpected expenses or inadequate income. These loans can be offered by banks, credit unions, and nonbank lenders like payday or title lenders. Affordability is a concern due to higher costs compared to longer-term loans. Debt traps can ensnare borrowers who struggle to repay small-dollar loans, leading to repeated borrowing and accumulating fees. This cycle can worsen financial situations, especially with nonbank products like payday loans or credit cards with minimum payments. Borrowers' financial behaviors need close monitoring to address frequent use of small-dollar loan products. Determining how borrowers habitually get into cash flow shortages requires knowledge about their cash management practices and perceptions of prudent spending and savings decisions. Policy initiatives to protect consumers from expensive borrowing costs could result in less credit availability for financially distressed individuals, potentially leading to worse financial situations like bankruptcy. Academic literature is inconclusive on whether access to expensive small-dollar loans contributes to or alleviates financial distress, with some research suggesting temporary benefits but potential harm with extended use. Congress has passed laws like the CARD Act and Dodd-Frank Act to address concerns about excessive credit card rates and fees. The creation of the CFPB has led to rules on small-dollar lending products. The CFPB proposed rule would require lenders to underwrite small-dollar loans for borrower affordability, potentially reducing offerings. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 aims to limit CFPB authority over payday loans and similar products. This report covers small-dollar consumer lending markets, product descriptions, and market metrics. The report covers small-dollar consumer lending markets, product descriptions, market metrics, and regulatory approaches to consumer protection. It examines pricing dynamics in the small-dollar lending market, revealing insights on market competitiveness and affordability concerns. Some research shows evidence of competition in the payday lending industry, while other factors suggest pricing may not be competitive due to restrictions on banks and credit unions. Small-dollar lending markets include competitive and noncompetitive price dynamics, making it challenging to determine if borrowers pay \"too much\" for loan products. The report discusses product features, delivery methods, and how to calculate APR. Depository institutions offer credit cards, overdraft protection, and installment loans, while AFS providers offer payday loans, auto title loans, and tax-refund anticipation loans. Table 1 provides descriptions of various small-dollar and short-term lending products. Small-dollar loan products, including payday loans, auto title loans, and tax-refund anticipation loans, are used by individuals facing income shortfalls or with impaired credit. Studies show that a significant percentage of households experience economic hardship, leading them to use these loans for recurring or unexpected expenses. Full payment is typically expected when these loans are due, and the costs can accumulate quickly. The costs of small-dollar loans can quickly escalate if repeatedly renewed without repaying the principal amount. Rollovers result in additional interest charges and fees, leading to rising levels of indebtedness for borrowers. Data on average loan sizes and costs for various small-dollar loan products vary in availability due to nonstandardized reporting requirements. Comparing the relative costs of small-dollar loan products is challenging due to varying maturity lengths and data collection methods. Consumer lending is heavily regulated to protect consumers and ensure fair lending practices. Both bank and nonbank lenders must comply with federal consumer protection and fair-lending laws when offering covered credit products. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau plays a key role in enforcing these regulations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enforces federal consumer financial protection laws for a range of products and services. Different lenders are supervised by various regulators based on their asset size. Banks and credit unions with assets below $10 billion are supervised by prudential regulators, while those above $10 billion are supervised by the CFPB. State-chartered banks and credit unions may also be subject to regulation. Nonbank lenders, such as payday and auto-title lenders, may be supervised by the CFPB or state financial regulators. Different approaches are used to regulate small-dollar products, including disclosure requirements, usury laws, product-feature requirements, underwriting requirements, and unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) requirements. Disclosure laws are a form of consumer protection. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) ensures borrowers are aware of loan costs by disclosing total credit cost as APR. TILA doesn't regulate loan rates but applies to most consumer credit. Usury laws cap loan interest rates, often at the state level. Financial institutions in some states face additional disclosure requirements. The National Consumer Law Center reports that state usury laws cap loan interest rates, with some states having multiple rates for different types of credit. The Military Lending Act of 2006 protects military personnel from predatory lending by capping interest rates and fees for consumer loans. Federal law prohibits the CFPB from setting usury limits. The Military Lending Act of 2006 protects military personnel from predatory lending by capping interest rates and fees for consumer loans. The final rule implementing the MLA in 2007 set terms for payday loans and vehicle title loans, and limited short-term small-dollar loans to a 36% annual interest rate for military personnel. The Department of Defense extended the Military APR to credit cards in 2015. Lenders can receive safe harbor protection by verifying eligibility through the MLA database. The MAPR will apply to credit card products for military servicemembers starting October 3, 2017. Some states have restrictions on lending, while payday lending is allowed in 38 states with limits on rollovers. The CARD Act of 2009 protects credit card users from complex finance charges. Underwriting and UDAAP regulations aim to protect consumers by verifying documents and setting federal underwriting requirements for small-dollar loans. The CFPB issued a proposed rule for federal underwriting requirements for small-dollar loans, utilizing its UDAAP authority to regulate add-on products with credit cards. Established by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB aims to enforce consumer financial laws and protect consumers while ensuring access to financial products and services. The CFPB proposed a rule on small-dollar lending to prevent payday debt traps by setting underwriting requirements for lenders. The rule aims to ensure loan payments are affordable and not leading borrowers to default, take out more loans, or neglect other financial obligations. The comment period ended on October 7, 2016, and the proposal covers loans lasting 45 days or less, including payday loans and auto-title loans. The proposed rule by the CFPB aims to regulate small-dollar lending, including payday loans, auto-title loans, and direct deposit advances. It covers loans lasting 45 days or less, with a cost of credit exceeding 36% and lenders having a security interest. Excluded are loans for durable goods, mortgages, credit cards, student loans, overdrafts, and pawnshop loans. Lenders must conduct a Full-Payment Test to verify borrowers' income, financial obligations, and borrowing history to ensure loan repayment. Lenders must ensure borrowers can repay loans and finance charges without needing to borrow again within 30 days. Borrowers cannot refinance the same amount of debt or take out multiple short-term loans successively. An alternative compliance option allows loans up to $500 without underwriting if certain conditions are met, with the option for two extensions as long as a portion of the principal is repaid each time. The lender must confirm no outstanding loans with other lenders, limit customers to six loans in 12 months. Two alternative compliance options for longer-term loans: 1) based on criteria for payday alternative loans offered by credit unions, 28% interest rate, $20 application fee. 2) Loans must have a maturity of 46 days to 24 months, APR not exceeding 36%, no origination fee. The APR for loans must not exceed 36%, with a maximum origination fee of $50. Lenders must refund fees if default rate exceeds 5%. Advance notice required before collecting payment from borrowers. Payday loan charges are considered expensive due to high APRs. Understanding market dynamics can inform policy debates. The small-dollar lending markets exhibit competitive and noncompetitive pricing dynamics, making it challenging to determine if loan prices are \"too high.\" The CFPB focuses on affordability, stating that financial harm occurs when lenders offer unaffordable loans. Data shows that 37% of a payday borrower's biweekly paycheck may be needed to repay the loan. The CFPB found that payday and vehicle-title loans require a significant portion of borrowers' biweekly paychecks for repayment. Borrowers were not informed about the potential long-term obligations due to frequent rollovers. The CFPB opted for lenders to assess loan affordability instead of just disclosing financial harm risks. Automated underwriting for loan affordability incurs costs for lenders. The CFPB estimates that complying with the proposed rule may not be costly for lenders already using automated underwriting. However, payday lenders, who often serve customers with weak credit histories, may face significant expenses due to manual underwriting requirements. This process includes verifying income, major financial obligations, and potentially increasing staffing for manual underwriting. The CFPB predicts a significant decrease in small-dollar loans offered by AFS providers, with a potential revenue decrease of 71% to 76%. A study commissioned by the AFS industry forecasts an 82.5% contraction in small-dollar loan offerings. The CFPB suggests that fewer rollovers will benefit consumers by reducing defaults and worsening financial situations. The AFS industry argues that the small-dollar market may contract due to compliance costs, leading to unmet credit needs for borrowers. In response to the CFPB's proposed rule, AFS providers are increasing medium- and longer-term installment loan offerings. Installment loans are preapproved for a specific amount with a term of 6 to 12 months, considered medium-term consumer loans. Repayment is in regular installments, allowing for principal amortization and smaller payments. Some borrowers prefer smaller loans with the option to roll them over, while others find installment loans more favorable. Affordability is a key issue in the small-dollar loan debate, with high prices being a concern. Market competitiveness plays a role in determining if prices are reasonable. Competition in the small-dollar loan market may indicate that prices, although high, are more likely to be competitive. The small-dollar loan market's competitiveness influences pricing, with costs driven closer to lenders' expenses. Payday lenders face high loan loss rates, impacting profitability dependent on volume. Rollovers increase loan volumes but also raise loan-loss-rate risks. Recent academic research has shown that publicly traded payday firms have risk-adjusted returns comparable to other financial firms. Pricing practices do not generate significantly higher revenues than costs, but there is evidence of noncompetitive pricing practices like price collusion. State usury ceilings may lead to implicit price collusion among alternative financial service providers, with many payday lenders charging the maximum allowed rates even if they could offer lower costs. This behavior is incentivized by usury caps, as firms may set prices at the ceiling to avoid legal issues. The small-dollar loan market reflects competitive and noncompetitive pricing dynamics, with factors like permissible activities and borrower preferences influencing pricing. Depository institutions may face restrictions on offering small-dollar loan products similar to those from alternative financial service providers. Subprime credit cards, similar to payday loans, are offered to individuals with impaired credit by depositories. The CARD Act limits fees on subprime credit cards to 25% of the initial credit limit, potentially restricting options for borrowers with impaired credit. Federal banking regulators raised concerns about deposit advance products resembling payday loans, leading to supervisory guidance from the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve to address high costs and credit risks for borrowers. The guidance recommended that customers with impaired credit should not be eligible for deposit advances, each advance should be repaid before getting another loan, and only one loan per monthly cycle. Most banks stopped offering deposit advances due to credit risks. Credit unions face limitations in the small-dollar loan market due to membership restrictions. They can offer payday alternative loans with lower APRs and longer maturities compared to traditional payday loans, protecting consumers according to the CFPB. The CFPB argues that PALs protect consumers with lower APRs and fees. NCUA requested an exemption for PALs to avoid lending reductions to military customers. Mainstream depositories may struggle to compete with AFS providers due to limitations on permissible activities. Banks and credit unions offer small-dollar loans with longer maturities and underwriting standards. Depositories offer products with longer maturities to adopt loan underwriting standards, which may hinder competition with AFS lenders in the small-dollar loan market. Consumers may face less competitive prices when comparing products with different fees, loan amounts, and maturities. Borrowers may prioritize certain product features over price. Ideal comparison for borrowers involves comparing prices of similar loans or small-dollar products. The APR is considered the key metric for comparing small-dollar loans, with higher APRs for smaller loan amounts and shorter maturities. Ideal comparisons are challenging due to slight differences in pricing and maturities, making it difficult for borrowers to compare costs effectively. Banks offer overdraft products with varying pricing structures and repayment periods, making APR comparisons challenging. Borrowers may have preferences for certain product features or conveniences that affect loan comparisons based solely on prices. Some borrowers may prioritize nonprice factors over total loan price, such as convenience of locations, business hours, and application process length. Some find flat-fee pricing easier to understand than APRs, and may value actual dollar cost of credit. Unbanked individuals may choose AFS lenders for easier small-dollar credit application process. Borrowers prefer applying for small-dollar credit from alternative financial service (AFS) lenders due to the perceived ease compared to traditional banks. Millennials and high-income individuals also use AFS products for convenience. Some borrowers consider the impact on their credit scores when choosing between bank and AFS products, looking beyond just APR comparisons. Some borrowers consider the impact on their credit scores when choosing between bank and AFS products, looking beyond just APR comparisons. Factors like product functionality and convenience also influence their choices, with some willing to pay a premium for unique features. However, survey respondents are rarely asked about the value they place on different factors when selecting financial products. The APR is calculated based on interest rates and origination fees, making it challenging to determine if small-dollar loans are less affordable than larger loans solely based on the APR metric. Borrowers may be willing to pay higher prices for products with preferred features or delivery methods, reflecting relative scarcities in the market. The APR is calculated using a standard formula based on interest rates and origination fees. Borrowers can ask lenders to disclose these separately for negotiating costs, but ultimately care more about total costs compared to other offers. Higher APRs are influenced by demand and supply factors, with borrowers potentially willing to pay more for preferred features or delivery methods. The APR is influenced by higher supply-side costs or demand-side factors. The formula shows that APR is inversely related to loan amount and length of time the loan will be outstanding. The interpretation of APR for loans originated for less than 365 days has been debated. An APR based on a term length of one year or greater accurately reflects the annual cost of credit. The APR for loans with different maturity lengths can be misleading. Comparing APRs of loans with identical maturity lengths is more meaningful. Loans with longer terms may have lower APRs but could result in higher costs for borrowers due to increased loan amounts or longer outstanding periods. Table A-1 provides examples of estimated costs for short-term and installment loans. Borrowers may be charged $15 on every $100 borrowed, resulting in an APR of 391%. Implementing a price cap at 36% would lower costs for borrowers. Lenders profit when costs are below what borrowers pay. The comparison between payday and installment loans shows a trade-off between total costs and affordability. The comparison between payday and installment loans highlights a trade-off between total costs and affordability. An installment loan with a 36% APR for a year on $1,000 would cost $360, while a payday loan for $500 with $75 in total costs could increase significantly with rollovers. Borrowers who can't qualify for installment loans may use payday loans as a substitute. The total cost of Payday 3 with rollovers could be similar to an installment loan. Payday 3 may be more expensive due to shorter repayment time and potential for more charges. Regulations promoting longer-term loans may not significantly reduce costs for borrowers using payday loans with rollovers."
