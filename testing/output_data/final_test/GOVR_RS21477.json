    "content": "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low-wage workers, available to childless adults and families with children. Recipients do not need to owe taxes to receive the benefits but must file a tax return. Eligibility and credit size are based on income, age, and qualifying children. Policy issues include compliance, refund anticipation loans, marriage penalty, and poverty relief. Compliance with EITC provisions has been a concern since 1990. The IRS released a study on 1985 tax year returns with the EITC, showing an over-claim rate of 39.1%. Subsequent studies in 1997 and 1999 estimated lower over-claim rates of 23.8% to 31.7%. Common errors included not meeting residency requirements for a qualified child. The most common errors in claiming the EITC were related to the child not meeting residency or relationship tests. Prior to 2005, the definition of a child for the EITC differed from that for claiming a child as a dependent. This led to complexity in claiming the child for different tax benefits. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 created a uniform definition of a child for tax purposes, including the EITC, effective from tax year 2005. The IRS conducted a pre-certification effort in 2003 for EITC claims to ensure children met residency requirements. The IRS conducted three compliance studies related to the EITC, uncovering and preventing over $275 million in erroneous claims. The automated underreporter study reviewed 300,000 tax returns claiming the EITC in 2003, resulting in a reduction or disallowance of the credit for 83% of returns. The IRS requires paid tax preparers to register and obtain a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) since January 1, 2011. They must renew their registration annually and pass a competency test starting in 2012. This measure aims to improve services and compliance, especially for EITC recipients who may face language or literacy barriers. The EITC may impose a \"marriage penalty\" on low-income parents if they choose to marry, as seen in tax year 2012. The penalty was addressed by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The American Recovery and Relief Act of 2009 increased marriage penalty relief for the EITC by raising the phase out income level for married couples. The increase in relief to $5,000 was extended for five years but will sunset in 2017. The EITC is designed to help families stay above the poverty threshold, but larger families may struggle over time due to the limit on the adjustment for family size. In tax year 2011, married couples with children earning $25,000 a year have net income above the poverty threshold, but income exceeding the threshold decreases with more children. Low-income childless adults working full-time at minimum wage may not receive EITC, resulting in an after-tax income above the poverty threshold. The ARRA created a new credit rate for taxpayers with three or more eligible children. The ARRA created a new credit rate of 45% for taxpayers with three or more eligible children for tax years 2009 and 2010. The EITC changes made by EGTRRA were made permanent by ATRA, including the definition of earned income, elimination of the reduction for AMT, and simplifying the calculation using AGI. The ARRA introduced a 45% credit rate for taxpayers with three or more eligible children for tax years 2009 and 2010. This provision was extended through 2017 by ATRA."
