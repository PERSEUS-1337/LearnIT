    "content": "Poland's political landscape has seen significant changes in recent years, with five prime ministers since 2001. The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) government, despite leading the nation into the EU and fostering a strong economy, faced scandals that damaged its reputation. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the SLD suffered defeat, with the Law and Justice party (PiS) winning a plurality of seats in the Sejm. PiS focused on family values, social justice, and asserting Poland's interests internationally, positioning itself as the agent of change. Law and Justice (PiS) was founded in 2001 by identical twin brothers, Jaroslaw and Lech Kaczynski. The party prioritizes improving the judicial system, fighting corruption, and favors social spending while distrusting privatization and foreign ownership of certain state assets. Lech Kaczynski, a former Warsaw mayor, became the successful PiS presidential candidate in 2005, defeating Donald Tusk. Their differing brands of conservatism reflect their parties' orientations, with Kaczynski advocating for economic nationalism and active government. Kaczynski and Tusk had differing economic beliefs, with Kaczynski supporting economic nationalism and active government intervention, while Tusk believed in market-based reforms. Kaczynski's anti-corruption policies gained approval from older, rural voters, while Tusk appealed to younger, urban voters. Jaroslaw initially declined the prime minister position to avoid voter unease over having two siblings in power. Marcinkiewicz became prime minister but resigned in 2006, possibly due to the Kaczynskis' concerns over his growing popularity and independence. After Marcinkiewicz resigned as prime minister in 2006, a poll showed low public approval for Lech's appointment of his twin brother. PiS and PO failed to form a coalition after the elections, leading PiS to rule from a minority position with support from smaller parties. In April 2006, PiS, Self Defense party, and League of Polish Families formed a formal coalition with a majority in parliament, causing domestic and continental repercussions. In 2006, Poland's Foreign Minister resigned in protest, and the European Parliament accused LPR leaders of inciting hatred and violence. Amid budget disagreements, SO left the coalition in September but rejoined later. The Kaczynskis consolidated power by appointing loyalists to high-level government positions. Lepper was dismissed on corruption charges in July 2007, leading SO to merge with LPR to form LiS. PiS rejected LiS's conditions for remaining in the coalition on July 30. Poland's economy has seen rapid growth in recent years, with GDP increasing by 3.4% in 2005, 5.3% in 2006, and predicted to rise by 6.3% in 2007. Unemployment is at 12.4%, the lowest in several years. PiS is facing budget disagreements with coalition partners over social program funding and concerns over reducing the central bank's independence. The dispute within the coalition may lead to early elections. Leszek Balcerowicz criticized the government's desire to reduce interest rates, while PiS aimed to stimulate demand and growth through rate cuts. The Polish government has not set a target date for adopting the euro, with Prime Minister Kaczynski stating it is risky without a strong economy. Warsaw requested more time to lower its deficit to qualify for euro adoption. Balcerowicz's term expired in January 2007, and Slawomir Skrzypek, a Kaczynski ally, was approved as the new central bank governor. In January 2007, Balcerowicz's term expired, and Slawomir Skrzypek, a Kaczynski ally with little monetary policy experience, became the new central banker. PiS, despite being center-right, has a statist approach to governance, nurturing \"national champions\" and considering overturning labor code reforms. They also aim for vertical integration in the state-owned energy sector to reduce dependence on Russian gas and oil. Poland aims to reduce dependence on Russian gas and oil by exploring pipelines with Norway and constructing LNG terminals. They are also considering a joint nuclear power project with the Baltic states. Poland has contributed troops to U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. Despite valuable military experience gained, Poland's presence in Iraq is unpopular at home. Poland, a member of the EU since 2004, has benefited economically, especially in agriculture. The government has been assertive in various issues, showing skepticism towards the EU at times. In 2006, Poland opposed an energy agreement with Russia, proposing an energy security treaty involving EU and NATO countries without Russia. In 2007, Poland vetoed talks over the EU-Russia partnership agreement due to frustrations with Russia's energy policies and trade bans. Poland also pushed for changes in the EU voting system, proposing a voting formula based on the square root of each country's population. Only the Czech Republic supported Poland's solution. During negotiations, Poland argued for a new voting formula based on population size, claiming Germany's WWII invasion hindered its growth. A compromise was reached, but Poland's behavior was criticized. The new government strained relations with Germany and Russia, especially over a gas pipeline agreement. The Polish government's decision to construct a natural gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea rather than overland through the Baltics and Poland was influenced by historical tensions with Germany. Lech Kaczynski, during the 2005 presidential campaign, emphasized maintaining a \"firm but friendly\" relationship with Russia. A satire on the Kaczynski brothers by a German newspaper led to diplomatic tensions, with Poland demanding an apology. This incident also caused Lech to cancel his attendance at a summit meeting with France and Germany. Poland has historically close relations with the United States, being a reliable supporter and ally since 9/11. Since 9/11, Warsaw has been a reliable supporter and ally in the global war on terrorism, contributing troops to U.S.-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Poland cooperates with the United States on issues such as democratization, nuclear proliferation, human rights, and UN reform. The Bush Administration began negotiations with Poland and the Czech Republic in 2007 to establish missile defense facilities on their territory to protect against missiles from countries like Iran and North Korea. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the two countries as \"the best of friends.\" If agreements are reached and approved by the Polish and Czech parliaments, construction on missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic could begin in 2008, with deployments expected in 2011. Poland seeks additional security guarantees in exchange for hosting U.S. launchers, amid concerns about Russia's response. The Polish government has requested Patriot missiles from the U.S. for protection against missiles. Despite public opposition, President Kaczynski expressed support for the program during a meeting with President Bush in 2007. President Bush acknowledged a secret CIA program to detain terror suspects worldwide, with allegations of secret prisons in Poland and Romania. European Parliament found no clear proof of prison sites in Europe but couldn't rule out Romania hosting U.S. detention operations. A Council of Europe report in 2007 claimed evidence of U.S. detention facilities in both countries, but President Kaczynski denied the existence of secret prisons during his term. Some Poles feel their loyalty to the United States has not been rewarded despite their sacrifices in Iraq and Afghanistan. They hope for increased military assistance and changes to the visa policy, which currently imposes a $100 fee and an interview requirement for Poles, unlike most western European countries."
