    "content": "A stable, democratic, prosperous Pakistan is vital to U.S. interests due to concerns about regional and global terrorism, stability in Afghanistan, democratization, human rights protection, Kashmir problem, Pakistan-India tensions, and economic development. In 2008, Pakistan's economic stability declined sharply, leading to a need for capital assistance. President Asif Ali Zardari and his economic advisor, Shaukat Tarin, have been working to address these economic challenges. U.S. officials and analysts fear that a failing Pakistani economy could hinder efforts to stabilize South Asia and combat Islamist radicalism. In September 2008, acting finance minister Naveed Qamar released new economic policies in Pakistan to achieve macroeconomic stability without IMF assistance. The policies included removing subsidies on fuel, electricity, and food, as well as reducing the government deficit. Shaukat Tarin announced tax reforms, including taxing large landowners to combat tax evasion. Despite these efforts, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves dropped significantly in 2008, posing economic challenges for President Zardari. Pakistan faced a severe financial crisis in 2008, with foreign exchange reserves of only $3 billion by October, risking default on debt payments. Seeking assistance from various sources including the IMF, China, Saudi Arabia, and the US, Pakistan secured a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement with the IMF in November 2008, providing immediate aid of $3.1 billion with the rest to be distributed over two years. Pakistan secured a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement with the IMF in November 2008, providing immediate aid of $3.1 billion with the remainder to be distributed over the next two years. The assistance was subject to conditions such as reducing fiscal and current account deficits, tightening monetary policy, and improving social assistance. Pakistan continued to seek additional aid from sources like the IMF and China, requesting $4.5 billion in assistance from the IMF and aid from China. Pakistan's economic problems are worsening due to the global economic recession, leading to a slowdown in merchandise trade. Despite lower global food and energy prices, inflation remains high, causing hardship for urban and rural poor. There are concerns that these economic conditions are fueling support for Islamist extremists like al Qaeda and the Taliban. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair highlighted the government's loss of authority in certain regions and mounting economic hardships. The Atlantic Council warned of dire economic and security threats in Pakistan, calling for immediate financial aid of $4-5 billion to prevent an economic meltdown. Senator John Kerry and Senator Richard Lugar are expected to introduce legislation similar to the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2008 to address these challenges. After a period of strong economic growth, Pakistan's economy faced challenges in 2008 with a decline in GDP growth to 2.5% and a sharp increase in the consumer price index to over 25%. Foreign exchange reserves dropped significantly, leading to concerns of default on sovereign debt. Legislation was introduced in the 111th Congress to address Pakistan's economic situation. Pakistan faced a capital crisis in 2008 and sought assistance from various sources including the ADB, China, the IMF, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and the World Bank. Initially unable to secure firm commitments, Pakistan was hesitant to accept IMF support due to concerns about the conditions attached. They explored alternative sources of support before eventually considering IMF assistance. Pakistan faced a capital crisis in 2008 and sought assistance from various sources including the ADB, the World Bank, DFID, and IDB. The ADB provided a $500 million loan to address economic challenges caused by food and fuel price hikes. The World Bank initially offered $1.4 billion in assistance, but it was insufficient. Pakistan then turned to the \"Friends of Pakistan\" group for support, seeking $100 billion in aid. The \"Friends of Pakistan\" group, consisting of representatives from 11 nations, the EU, UN, and IMF, did not offer financial support to Pakistan in their meetings in September and November 2008. President Zardari visited Beijing to seek financial assistance, and China expressed willingness to help within their capability. China pledged to provide Pakistan with $500 million in financial assistance, aiming to increase bilateral trade to $15 billion by 2011. Pakistan also sought support from Saudi Arabia for up to $6 billion in deferred oil payments to ease financial burdens. Pakistan sought financial assistance from Saudi Arabia and China, with China pledging $500 million and Pakistan requesting up to $6 billion in deferred oil payments from Saudi Arabia. Despite cool relations with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan did not receive public support during President Zardari's visit. After failed Plans A and B, Pakistan moved to Plan C, formally requesting IMF assistance, although the government initially denied making a formal request. Informal talks between Pakistan and the IMF had been ongoing in Dubai before the formal request was made. Pakistan sought financial assistance from Saudi Arabia and China, with China pledging $500 million and Pakistan requesting up to $6 billion in deferred oil payments from Saudi Arabia. Despite cool relations with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan did not receive public support during President Zardari's visit. After failed Plans A and B, Pakistan moved to Plan C, formally requesting IMF assistance. The Pakistani government was reluctant to accept formal IMF assistance due to historical poor relations and concerns about undesirable consequences of IMF conditions. However, on November 15, 2008, Pakistan reached a tentative agreement with the IMF to borrow $7.6 billion over the next 23 months. Pakistan reached a tentative agreement with the IMF to borrow $7.6 billion over 23 months. The loan was expected by the end of November, with repayment by 2016. The IMF's only condition was for Pakistan to raise interest rates to counter inflation. President Zardari acknowledged the loan as necessary medicine. However, the loan faced strong opposition in Pakistan's parliament, with concerns about leading the country into a debt trap and harming the economy and living standards. The IMF's Executive Board approved a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement for Pakistan on November 24, 2008, providing $3.1 billion in immediate aid to avert a capital crisis. The IMF provided $3.1 billion in immediate aid to Pakistan, averting a capital crisis. The assistance came with strict conditionalities, raising concerns about economic growth and living conditions for the poor. Pakistan is set to receive up to $7.6 billion over 23 months, with quarterly tranches subject to economic performance criteria and conditionalities. Repayment of the loan is scheduled from 2011 to 2015. The IMF provided $3.1 billion in immediate aid to Pakistan with strict conditionalities to avert a capital crisis. Pakistan's progress is evaluated based on performance criteria including fiscal deficit, government debt, and structural economic changes. Failure to meet criteria may result in withholding of IMF assistance. IMF projected Pakistan's economic performance through fiscal year 2009/2010 and requires implementation of changes in fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies for assistance. The IMF conditions for Pakistan include changes in fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, as well as expanding the social safety net. Pakistan must lower its fiscal deficit through tax increases and subsidy eliminations. Measures such as integrating income and sales tax, increasing GST rate, and adopting a value-added tax are expected to raise revenues by 0.5% of GDP. Pakistan is implementing measures to raise revenues by 0.5% of GDP through tax increases and subsidy eliminations. This includes raising petroleum prices, eliminating electricity subsidies, and ending a research and development subsidy for the textile industry. The IMF is requiring Pakistan to raise its discount rate by 2% to 15% and refrain from financing the federal deficit through the purchase of government securities. Pakistan is also reducing its intervention in the exchange rate under the terms of the stand-by agreement. Pakistan is required to reduce intervention in foreign exchange markets under a stand-by agreement with the IMF. To offset inflation and economic slowdown, expenditures on social safety net programs will increase. Pakistan recently established the Benazir Income Support Program and requested an additional $4.5 billion in IMF assistance. Prime Minister Zardari visited China to strengthen ties and seek financial aid due to Pakistan's ongoing capital crisis. Economic data showed that the global recession and IMF conditions were impacting Pakistan's economy more than expected. The target GDP growth rate was lowered, and despite the economic slowdown, the current account deficit increased. An analyst predicted a significant deficit for the fiscal year. Pakistan's current account deficit for fiscal year 2008/2009 is predicted to be around $12.1 billion, exceeding the IMF goal. Merchandise trade figures for January 2009 showed declines in exports and imports, casting doubt on reaching trade projections. President Zardari and advisor Tarin attribute economic issues to high costs of military operations against Taliban and al-Qaeda, exacerbated by a decline in U.S. support. Pakistan is facing a capital shortfall of $4.5 billion, with a potential need for over $5 billion to avoid default risk. President Zardari calls for a modern day \"Marshall Plan\" to address the economic challenges, exacerbated by a current account deficit of $1 billion over the last two months. Pakistan's recent economic growth was driven by export expansion and inward foreign direct investment (FDI), helping to finance trade and capital deficits. However, rising fuel and food prices, political instability, and a global recession have led to inflation, deficits, and a devaluation of the Pakistani rupee. Inward FDI has declined by over 32% in 2009, impacting exports and remittances from overseas Pakistanis. The economic stabilization package announced in September 2008 aimed to create jobs, promote agriculture and manufacturing, and reduce poverty in Pakistan. However, concerns arise over the higher interest rates imposed by the IMF, potentially leading smaller businesses to bankruptcy and hindering future economic growth. The government's current focus is on addressing the country's economic challenges, exacerbated by high inflation and unemployment rates. A United Nations study revealed that 10 million Pakistanis are undernourished, highlighting the widespread food insecurity in the country. The price of wheat and palm oil has significantly increased in Pakistan, leading to food insecurity and hindering access to medical care for the poor. This economic hardship has also contributed to political unrest, with a majority of people feeling the country is heading in the wrong direction. In response to worsening economic conditions, 73% of respondents reported a decline in their personal situation. 59% expect the economic situation to deteriorate further, with inflation being the most pressing issue according to 58% of respondents. Unemployment and suicide bombings were also significant concerns. The survey conducted showed that poverty, electricity, water, and law and order were top concerns. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of a stable Pakistan due to economic crisis potentially leading to instability. Recent events have strained US-Pakistan relations as Pakistan seeks support from other nations like China and Saudi Arabia. Pakistan's trade relations have shifted with China as its largest trading partner, followed by Saudi Arabia and the United States. The US remains Pakistan's largest export market, but tensions have arisen due to military incursions and nuclear cooperation with India. Some analysts believe the US orchestrated negotiations with the IMF to impose tougher conditions on Pakistan. There is a call for the US to increase non-military assistance to demonstrate commitment to a stable and democratic Pakistan. The United States may provide financial support to Pakistan to help cover its capital shortfall, estimated to be between $2 billion to $7 billion. Some suggest that aid should be contingent on Pakistan's efforts to combat Islamist militancy. Congress could consider various approaches, such as short-term assistance, long-term economic support, or trade policy changes. Senator Kerry is reportedly planning to introduce legislation offering Pakistan $4 billion to $5 billion in emergency aid. Kerry plans to introduce legislation providing Pakistan with $4 billion - $5 billion in emergency assistance. The United States has given Pakistan over $12 billion in aid since 2001, with most being military aid. The \"Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2008\" aimed to triple non-military aid to Pakistan to $1.5 billion annually from 2009 to 2013. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2008 aimed to provide $4 billion - $5 billion in emergency assistance to Pakistan for fiscal years 2009 to 2013. The funds were intended for promoting governance, economic freedom, and investments in people. Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar plan to reintroduce a similar bill soon. Congress could also aid Pakistan's economic recovery by adjusting U.S. trade policies to boost bilateral trade and investment, such as creating Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The \"Afghanistan and Pakistan Reconstruction Opportunity Zones Act of 2009\" and the \"Afghanistan-Pakistan Security and Prosperity Enhancement Act\" aim to promote economic growth in border regions by creating duty-free zones for imported goods. Other suggestions include conducting a geological survey to identify mineral resources for development in Pakistan. Congress could recommend that the Obama Administration take actions to encourage other nations to provide greater assistance to Pakistan, such as through the Friends of Pakistan meeting in Tokyo. Additionally, Congress could support negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with Pakistan to boost U.S. foreign direct investments in the country."
