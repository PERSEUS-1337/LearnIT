This legislation aims to incentivize private sector development and commercialization of federally funded research and development by allowing contractors to obtain patents on their inventions. The Bayh-Dole Act, passed in 1980, awards title to inventions made with federal support. The government retains rights in inventions and has march-in rights to grant licenses if needed, although these rights have never been exercised in the Act's 35-year history. Some believe march-in rights should be rarely used to protect private sector investments in early-stage inventions, while others argue they are necessary to prevent excessive profiteering on technologies developed with public funding. The report reviews the availability of march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act, which grants federal agencies authority to intervene in patents. It discusses past efforts to obtain march-in authorization from NIH and identifies potential issues for congressional consideration. The patent system is based on promoting innovation and granting exclusive rights to inventors. Inventors must apply to the USPTO for patent protection, where examiners assess the application's merit. The process, known as \"prosecution,\" requires full disclosure and distinct claims of the invention. Patentability hinges on usefulness, novelty, and nonobviousness. The USPTO grants patent protection to inventions that are nonobvious and not readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan. Patent holders have the right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing the patented invention. Infringers may be liable for damages and may be enjoined from further infringement. Patent protection typically lasts for 20 years from the filing date. Patent protection typically lasts for 20 years from the filing date. Patent rights require enforcement through litigation in federal courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the U.S. Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. The patent system aims to promote innovation and address public goods problems. The patent system addresses public goods problems by incentivizing innovation through protection against free riders and copyists. This correction of market failure encourages individuals to innovate by ensuring they can capitalize on their inventions. The patent system incentivizes innovation by providing exclusive rights to inventors, promoting disclosure of new products and processes, and contributing to the growth of information in the public domain. Patents can lead to the development of new technologies and industries as others build upon the disclosed inventions. The patent system provides exclusive rights to inventors, facilitating markets and preventing unauthorized use of inventions. Patent protection reduces transaction costs, making it easier for parties to engage in transactions involving information goods. It also encourages enterprises to commercialize and market existing inventions. The patent system encourages commercialization and market entry by providing exclusive rights to inventors. Unlike trade secret protection, patents require disclosure of publicly available information, leading to the invention of new technologies and their commercialization. Trade secrecy guards against improper appropriation of valuable information but does not require disclosure. The patent system has long been criticized for potentially unproductive costs and barriers to entry in some markets. While it encourages innovation and the development of new medicines, it also contributes to rising healthcare costs. Arguments for and against the patent system have intuitive appeal but are challenging to analyze empirically. The patent system is criticized for costs and barriers to entry, impacting the economy. Analyzing its impact empirically is challenging. The Government Patent Policy allowed the U.S. government to retain rights to inventions from government contracts. The Government Patent Policy allows the contractor to acquire principal or exclusive rights to inventions developed under government contracts in specific circumstances, with the government retaining at least a non-exclusive royalty-free license for governmental purposes worldwide. This policy contrasts with the 1963 approach, which granted significant government rights in privately held patents resulting from publicly funded projects. The 1963 policy granted the government rights to inventions from publicly funded projects, leading to today's march-in rights. The Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 changed patent and government-sponsored R&D landscape by allowing contractors to acquire patent rights to encourage private enterprise in advancing technologies. Under the Bayh-Dole Act, nonprofit organizations and small businesses can retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization within a specified timeframe, incentivizing private enterprise in advancing technologies. Under the Bayh-Dole Act, nonprofit organizations and small businesses can retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization within a specified timeframe. The government may keep title under exceptional circumstances, such as when the contractor is not located in the United States, for national security reasons, or for naval nuclear propulsion or weapons programs. The government retains certain rights, including a nonexclusive license to practice any subject invention worldwide. The Bayh-Dole Act allows nonprofit organizations and small businesses to retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization. The government also has \"march-in rights\" to require licensing under certain circumstances. Ronald Reagan extended the Act's framework to all contractors, regardless of size, in 1983. The Act allows the government to withhold public disclosure of information for a \"reasonable time\" for patent application. The Bayh-Dole Act allows contractors to retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization in the US. The Secretary of Commerce can issue regulations for implementing the Act, including \"march-in\" rights to grant licenses for patents resulting from publicly funded R&D. If the patent owner refuses, the government may grant the license itself. The Bayh-Dole Act allows contractors to retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization in the US. If the patent owner refuses, the government may grant the license itself under certain circumstances specified by the Act. The Bayh-Dole Act allows contractors to retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization in the US. If necessary, the government may grant a license if certain conditions are not met, such as failure to obtain required agreements or breach of licensing agreements. The Act defines \"practical application\" and emphasizes the importance of making inventions available to the public on reasonable terms. The Bayh-Dole Act allows contractors to retain title to federally funded research inventions for commercialization in the US. March-in rights may be appealed to the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the exercise of these rights does not invalidate the patent but grants a license to a designated entity for practicing the invention under specified conditions, such as payment of a royalty. March-in rights, distinct from the Bayh-Dole Act's license to the U.S. government, provide a legal mechanism for entities like generic drug companies to practice a patented invention. They are also different from 28 U.S.C. \u00a71498(a), which allows the owner to seek compensation if the U.S. uses their patented invention without permission. The Bayh-Dole Act's march-in rights apply to patented inventions developed with public funding, while 28 U.S.C. \u00a71498(a) applies to all U.S. patents. Unlike march-in rights, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71498(a) allows private enterprises to request compensation if the U.S. government or its contractors use their patented invention without permission. The Bayh-Dole Act grants march-in rights for patented inventions developed with public funding, while 28 U.S.C. \u00a71498(a) applies to all U.S. patents. March-in rights have never been exercised in the 35-year history of the Act, with the NIH receiving petitions but denying them, citing concerns over drug development. The NIH has denied six requests for march-in rights, citing concerns over drug pricing as not sufficient to trigger the rights. Examples include CellPro, Inc. in 1997 and Norvir/ritonavir in 2004, where the agency declined to initiate march-in procedures despite concerns over high drug prices. The NIH declined to initiate march-in proceedings for Xalatan/latanoprost (2004) and Fabrazyme/agalsidase beta (2010) due to drug availability and manufacturing issues. The petition for Norvir/ritonavir (2012) was also denied despite concerns over high drug prices. The NIH declined to invoke march-in rights for Norvir/ritonavir (2012) and Xtandi/enzalutamide (2016) despite concerns over high drug prices in the United States compared to other high-income nations. The agency cited reasons such as increasing sales and no evidence of product shortage for not initiating investigations. The NIH expressed reluctance to undermine patent exclusivities in response to a petition, citing the importance of the patent system for investment and commercial development of new technologies. They are mindful of the potential impact on public health and future investments in federally funded medical technologies. The NIH is cautious about interfering with patent exclusivities to protect investment in new technologies. They believe that controlling drug pricing, especially for products developed with federal funds, should be addressed by Congress legislatively rather than through march-in rights. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug companies to develop products without infringing on patents, but concerns over march-in rights have been raised. The Bayh-Dole Act mandates reasonable prices for inventions from federally funded research, according to Arno and Davis. According to Arno and Davis, the solution to high drug prices lies in the unenforced march-in provision of the Bayh-Dole Act, which mandates reasonable prices for inventions from federally funded research. Former Senators Bayh and Dole clarified that the law did not intend for the government to set prices on resulting products. The Bayh-Dole Act did not intend for the government to set prices on resulting products. The government's ability to revoke a license is not tied to pricing or profitability, but rather to the successful commercialization of the invention. Dialogue over march-in rights was renewed in 2016, leading to exchanges between Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2016, Representative Lloyd Doggett and 51 Members of Congress requested NIH to provide guidance on when march-in rights should apply. Secretary Burwell responded, stating that march-in rights are limited to specific criteria like addressing health or safety needs. She concluded that additional guidance was not necessary. Lloyd Doggett and 11 other Members of Congress sent a letter to NIH urging a public hearing on invoking march-in rights for the cancer drug Xtandi/enzalutamide. The drug, developed with taxpayer support, is priced higher in the U.S. than in other countries. The NIH denied the march-in rights request on June 20. The NIH denied march-in rights for Xtandi/enzalutamide on June 20, 2016. Congress could clarify the circumstances for invoking march-in rights, define availability on reasonable terms, and transfer oversight of administering march-in rights. Transferring decision-making authority for exercising march-in rights to a distinct entity could eliminate conflicts of interest. Former federal agency employees transitioning to the private sector may influence decisions on march-in rights. Some suggest Congress should establish a centralized authority for overseeing march-in rights. Some commentators propose creating a centralized database of inventions under the Bayh-Dole Act to track R&D investments. They suggest requiring patent licensees to report on introducing inventions and pricing policies. Reconsideration is urged for the requirement to exhaust all judicial appeals before exercising march-in rights. The current process of patent disputes can lead to significant delays, hindering the timely practical application of inventions and addressing health or safety needs. Some suggest reforms to ensure that the best candidates receive licenses for patents under the Bayh-Dole Act, as the current system may not place inventions in the most capable hands. The debate over march-in rights in intellectual property law revolves around balancing patent incentives for innovation with the distribution of benefits to the public. Critics fear that using march-in rights could deter private investment, while others see it as a way to prevent excessive profiteering and ensure public access to technologies developed with government funding. March-in rights aim to prevent excessive profiteering and ensure a fair return on public R&D investments during a patent's term, requiring a balance between commercialization and public benefit in federally funded research."
