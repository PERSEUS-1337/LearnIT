    "content": "Congress considered FY2013 discretionary appropriations for federal departments and agencies, including the EPA, in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Due to the failure to enact deficit-reducing legislation, a sequestration of FY2013 budgetary resources was required. No regular appropriations bill for FY2013 for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, including the EPA, was passed by the House or Senate. Funds for these agencies were included in a continuing appropriations resolution instead. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 112-175) provided funding for EPA and other federal agencies at a slightly higher level than FY2012 until March 27, 2013. It was replaced by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) which provided discretionary appropriations for the full fiscal year until September 30, 2013. The actual funding amount for EPA and other agencies for FY2013 was subject to reductions due to sequestration and an across-the-board rescission. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) specified funding levels for EPA and other agencies for FY2013, subject to sequestration and rescission. The act treated EPA's eight appropriations accounts differently, with four accounts funded at FY2012 levels and subject to same authorities, while the other four had lower \"anomalies\" funding levels with different conditions for FY2013. Section 1113 of P.L. 113-6 determined the final funding levels. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) specified funding levels for EPA and other agencies for FY2013, subject to sequestration and rescission. Section 1113 of P.L. 113-6 required EPA and other federal departments to report funding allocations within 30 days of enactment. EPA submitted its FY2013 Operating Plan, reporting enacted discretionary appropriations of $7.90 billion, 5.3% below the President's request and 6.5% below the FY2012 level. The EPA Operating Plan for FY2013 included supplemental appropriations from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, totaling $577.3 million post-sequestration. This increased the total enacted discretionary appropriations for EPA to $8.48 billion, with funds allocated for water infrastructure, cleanup, and recovery efforts in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The report details funding levels for EPA's appropriations accounts compared to the President's request and FY2012 appropriations. The EPA's Operating Plan for FY2013 included supplemental appropriations from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, totaling $577.3 million post-sequestration. This increased the total enacted discretionary appropriations for EPA to $8.48 billion, with funds allocated for water infrastructure, cleanup, and recovery efforts in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The report also summarizes action on EPA appropriations for FY2013 in the 112th Congress leading to the enactment of P.L. 113-6. The EPA's FY2013 appropriations were debated during the 112th Congress. Historical funding trends and full-time-equivalent employment data for EPA are provided in the report. Enacted appropriations for prior fiscal years were not adjusted for inflation, leading to potential decreases in real dollar values. The term \"appropriations\" in the report refers to total discretionary funds available to EPA. The term appropriations in this report refers to total discretionary funds available to EPA for obligation, excluding permanent or mandatory appropriations. EPA's annual funding mainly consists of discretionary appropriations requested by the Administration and appropriated by Congress within eight statutory accounts. The FY2013 appropriations levels are based on EPA's Operating Plan provided to CRS by the House Committee on Appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations provided EPA's Operating Plan reflecting sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and an additional across-the-board rescission of 0.2%. Congress considered FY2013 discretionary appropriations in the context of the BCA, which established limits for discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021. The BCA also required a federal deficit reduction plan, triggering automatic spending reductions when not enacted by January 15, 2012. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending reductions on January 2, 2013, through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The American Taxpayer Relief Act delayed the sequester implementation to March 1, 2013, and reduced the dollar amount by $24 billion. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending reductions on January 2, 2013, through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The dollar amount of the joint committee sequester was reduced by $24 billion, and statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014 were lowered. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with reductions applied at the program, project, and activity level within each account. The OMB estimated budget authority to be canceled in FY2013 from non-exempt funds. The sequestration calculations were based on the annualized level of appropriations provided by the FY2013 Continuing Resolution. The reductions in discretionary budgetary resources for EPA and other federal agencies in FY2013 were dependent on amounts specified in P.L. 113-16. The EPA Operating Plan detailed the reductions applied to the agency's funding under sequestration at the account and program level. FY2013 enacted appropriations were compared to the President's request and FY2012 amounts across eight appropriations accounts. Automatic spending reductions and a 0.2% rescission were applied to EPA's baseline amounts in Division F of P.L. 113-6. The FY2013 enacted appropriations for EPA included rescissions and supplemental funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The EPA Operating Plan detailed the allocation of funds among the agency's appropriations accounts, comparing it to FY2012 amounts. The FY2013 appropriations for EPA included supplemental funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The enacted appropriations for selected EPA programs and activities are discussed following the enactment of P.L. 113-6, which provided discretionary appropriations for the full fiscal year. The EPA provided detailed allocations of FY2013 appropriations to Congress, including spending reductions and sequestration impacts. The FY2013 enacted funding level for EPA was $7.90 billion. The EPA reported a FY2013 enacted funding level of $7.90 billion, which is $443.4 million below the President's request and $548.3 million below the FY2012 level. With supplemental funding, the total discretionary appropriations for EPA in FY2013 were $8.48 billion. The final enacted funding levels were not specified in P.L. 113-6, leading to reductions due to sequestration and an across-the-board rescission. The EPA's FY2013 funding level was $7.90 billion, $443.4 million below the President's request and $548.3 million below FY2012. P.L. 113-6 specified anomalies for some accounts, not subject to FY2012 conditions. EPA's appropriations were at FY2012 levels for four accounts. The FY2013 EPA funding level was $7.90 billion, with anomalies specified in P.L. 113-6 for certain accounts. Appropriations accounts were set at FY2012 levels for some EPA accounts, with specific amounts outlined for Science and Technology, Environmental Programs and Management, Hazardous Substance Superfund, and State and Tribal Assistance Grants. Additionally, a rescission of $50.0 million was required from unobligated balances of prior appropriations for Hazardous Substance Superfund and STAG accounts. In FY2013, there were rescissions of unobligated balances from various EPA accounts, including $5.0 million from categorical grants, $10.0 million each from Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund grants, and $10.0 million from Brownfields grants. Similar rescissions have been included in EPA appropriations since FY2006. In FY2012, there was a $50.0 million rescission from unobligated balances in the Hazardous Substance Superfund and STAG accounts, with specific amounts outlined for different grants within the STAG account. In FY2013, P.L. 113-6 provided funding from various grants including Clean Water SRF, Brownfields, Diesel Emission Reduction Act, and U.S.-Mexico Border water infrastructure. Preceded by P.L. 113-2, which allocated $50.7 billion for disaster assistance, mainly for Hurricane Sandy relief. EPA accounts received $1.44 billion in disaster relief appropriations from P.L. 113-2 before sequestration reductions. In FY2013, sequestration reduced disaster relief funding for EPA accounts to $577.3 million. $570.0 million was allocated for State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) to aid affected states in capitalizing their SRFs, with $475.0 million for Clean Water SRF grants and $95.0 million for Drinking Water SRF grants. New York and New Jersey received funds for wastewater and drinking water treatment works impacted by Hurricane Sandy. In FY2013, sequestration reduced disaster relief funding for EPA accounts to $577.3 million. $570.0 million was allocated for State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) to aid affected states in capitalizing their SRFs, with $475.0 million for Clean Water SRF grants and $95.0 million for Drinking Water SRF grants. The affected states receiving these funds must use 20-30% of the SRF capitalization grant funds to provide additional subsidization to SRF loan recipients through forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants. The remaining supplemental funds within other EPA accounts included amounts for Environmental Programs and Management, Hazardous Substance Superfund, and Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund accounts. Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175, H.J.Res. 117), provided appropriations through March 27, 2013, for EPA and other federal departments and agencies. Funding was continued at 0.612% above the FY2012 enacted level, with exceptions for certain activities. EPA and other agencies were required to submit spending plans 30 days after enactment. The House Committee on Appropriations reported the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013, with a total of $7.06 billion for EPA for FY2013, which was less than the President's request. The proposed decreases were largely attributed to reductions in the STAG account. The House Committee on Appropriations reported the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013, with a total of $7.06 billion for EPA for FY2013, which was less than the President's request. H.R. 6091 included reductions for grants to help states capitalize Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs, as well as decreases and increases in funding for many individual EPA programs and activities compared to the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee released a draft bill with $8.52 billion for EPA in FY2013, $1.46 billion more than the House recommended. The focus was on federal financial assistance to states for wastewater and drinking water. The FY2013 appropriations for EPA focused on federal financial assistance for environmental programs, air pollution control, climate change, and environmental cleanup. Congressional interest also included funding for specific initiatives like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and Chesapeake Bay restoration. The FY2013 appropriations for EPA focused on federal financial assistance for environmental programs, air pollution control, climate change, and environmental cleanup. Funding levels were impacted by the enactment of P.L. 113-6 and automatic spending reductions triggered by sequestration. The EPA Operating Plan provides a detailed breakdown of funding for all EPA programs and activities, including grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The State Revolving Funds (SRFs) have accounted for a significant portion of EPA appropriations, ranging from one-fourth to one-third in recent fiscal years. In FY2013, SRF grants made up about 28% of total EPA appropriations, increasing to over 33% when including disaster relief funding. The President's FY2013 budget requested SRF grants to be 24% of total EPA funding. SRF grants in FY2011 and FY2012 also constituted over 28% of total EPA appropriations, supporting local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. In FY2013, the EPA awarded State Revolving Fund (SRF) grants for projects related to municipal sewage and drinking water treatment plants to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. A total of $2.24 billion was available for the Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs, which was $212.4 million more than the President's request but $147.0 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. An additional $570.0 million was provided for disaster relief in FY2013. In FY2013, disaster relief supplemental appropriations totaling $570.0 million were allocated for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy, specifically New York and New Jersey. Funding was not distributed based on the usual state-by-state allotment formula, but rather directed to areas impacted by the hurricane. A requirement in P.L. 113-2 mandated that affected states use 20-30% of the SRF funds for additional subsidization to loan recipients through forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, grants, or a combination of these. Table 2 shows FY2013 funding levels for Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF grants in P.L. 113-6, after rescissions and sequestration. It compares funding to the President's FY2013 request and FY2012 enacted amounts. P.L. 113-6 also allocated funds for water infrastructure projects in Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico Border region. $9.5 million was designated for wastewater and drinking water facilities in Alaska Native Villages. For FY2013, funding for Alaska Native Villages programs was $9.5 million after reductions. An additional $4.7 million was available for wastewater projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. $1.03 billion was allocated for state and tribal grant programs in the STAG account, which was below the President's request and FY2012 levels. For FY2013, funding for state and tribal grant programs in the STAG account was allocated below the President's request and FY2012 levels. These funds support the day-to-day implementation of federal environmental laws and regulations, including activities such as monitoring, permitting, training, pollution control, and prevention. Grants also assist multimedia projects like pollution prevention incentive grants and environmental information. Table 3 shows FY2013 funding levels for EPA grant programs after budget cuts, covering categories like air quality, water quality, hazardous waste, and climate change activities. The funding comparison includes the President's FY2013 request and FY2012 enacted amounts. Some EPA activities focus on regulations under the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Title IV of H.R. 6091 also addressed these issues. IV of H.R. 6091, reported by the House Committee on Appropriations in July 2012, included provisions limiting EPA's use of FY2013 funds for Clean Air Act regulations. EPA, among 17 agencies receiving climate change appropriations, has a small share but significant policy and regulatory roles. The funding for EPA air quality and climate change activities in FY2013 is difficult to compare due to variability in activities and account structures. However, comparisons can be made for specific activities specified by Congress in appropriations bills. Table 4 shows the funding levels for these activities in P.L. 113-6, compared to the President's request and FY2012 enacted amounts. EPA has a small share but significant policy and regulatory roles among 17 agencies receiving climate change appropriations. The EPA's \"clean air and climate\" activities received $386.2 million in FY2013, $54.1 million less than the President's request and $24.3 million less than FY2012. State and Local Air Quality Management grants received $223.4 million, $78.1 million less than the President's request and $12.3 million less than FY2012. States use these grants for air pollution control programs. The state and local agencies implement pollution control programs under the Clean Air Act authorities delegated by the EPA. The STAG account allocated $18.9 million for the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants program in FY2013, which was $11.1 million below the FY2012 enacted level. Funding for these grants has decreased in recent years, with additional funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 originally authorized $200.0 million annually for these grants. The Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund) account receives funding for assessment and cleanup of contaminated sites. The program is authorized by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). In FY2013, $1.11 billion was allocated for the Superfund account, with an additional $1.9 million for Superfund sites affected by Hurricane Sandy. In FY2013, the Superfund account received $1.11 billion in funding, which was $63.1 million less than the President's request and $100.5 million less than the FY2012 level. Funding for the Superfund program has been decreasing since FY2010, with some attributing this trend to inflation. The program, authorized by CERCLA, aims to clean up hazardous sites and hold responsible parties liable for cleanup costs. Many states have their own cleanup programs to address contaminated sites not handled at the federal level. The Superfund program aims to clean up hazardous sites and hold responsible parties liable for cleanup costs. State programs complement federal cleanup efforts, with sites financed by responsible parties not relying on Superfund appropriations. If responsible parties cannot be found or do not have the ability to pay, Superfund appropriations may be used for cleanup under a cost-share agreement with the state. \"Orphan\" sites refer to those with no viable parties to assume responsibility for cleanup. Superfund appropriations focus on cleaning up contamination from hazardous substances at high-risk sites. The Superfund program focuses on cleaning up hazardous sites and holding responsible parties liable for cleanup costs. Federal facilities on the National Priorities List (NPL) are funded separately from the Superfund program by federal agencies. EPA oversees the cleanup of these facilities through the Superfund program in collaboration with states. Remedial actions address long-term risks, while removal actions are for immediate response. The Superfund program addresses long-term risks to human health and the environment through remedial actions, while removal actions are for more immediate hazards or emergencies. Only sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) are eligible for Superfund appropriations for remedial actions. Removal actions can be funded with Superfund appropriations regardless of NPL listing. Superfund funds also cover EPA's homeland security responsibilities, operational expenses, and enforcement of cleanup liability under CERCLA. Enforcement ensures responsible parties pay for contamination cleanup. The Superfund program focuses on cleanup of contamination, with responsible parties paying for cleanup whenever possible. Funding within the Superfund account is also used for research, development of cleanup technologies, and independent auditing. FY2013 funding levels for the Superfund account are provided in P.L. 113-6, with appropriations for major program areas after across-the-board rescission and sequestration reductions. The EPA administers a cleanup program for brownfields sites where contamination may hinder economic development. Responsible parties at these sites are not eligible for federal financial assistance. The EPA's Brownfields program provides federal financial assistance for \"orphan\" sites with unaddressed cleanup needs. Grants are awarded competitively or formula-based for assessment, remediation, job training, and technical assistance. Funding comes from the STAG account, while program administration costs are covered by the EPM account. The FY2013 funding for EPA's Brownfields program was $158.2 million, which was $8.3 million less than the President's request and $9.6 million less than the FY2012 appropriation. The funding is divided between the STAG account for grants and the EPM account for program administration. EPA's Office of Underground Storage Tanks addresses cleanup of releases from underground storage tanks. The EPA's Office of Underground Storage Tanks manages regulations to prevent leaks from USTs containing petroleum or hazardous substances. Funding comes from the LUST Trust Fund and the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The LUST Trust Fund provides most of the funding for cleanup and enforcement activities, while the EPM and STAG accounts support other regulatory activities. P.L. 113-6 allocated $98.7 million from the LUST Trust Fund for FY2013. The FY2013 enacted level of appropriations from the LUST Trust Fund was $98.7 million, with an additional $4.8 million provided for disaster relief. The FY2013 enacted level for EPA staff and extramural costs to prevent releases from underground storage tanks was $12.1 million. This was less than the President's FY2013 request and the FY2012 enacted level. The FY2013 enacted level for the LUST Trust Fund was $1.5 million, slightly lower than the President's request and the FY2012 level. The fund supports state implementation of underground storage tank leak prevention regulations and cleanup efforts. The LUST Trust Fund, supported by a motor fuels tax, had a balance of $1.16 billion available for appropriation as of FY2013. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded UST leak prevention provisions and imposed new responsibilities on states and EPA, such as requiring tank inspections every three years. The fund also supports state implementation of leak prevention and detection requirements, as well as cleanup efforts. The LUST Trust Fund, funded by a motor fuels tax, had $1.16 billion available for appropriation in FY2013. Congress now allocates money from the trust fund for cleanup and underground storage tank leak prevention and detection regulations. Before EPAct 2005, regulation of underground storage tanks was supported by general revenues, but now only a small portion of funding comes from general revenues. Table 7 shows FY2013 funding levels for the LUST Trust Fund, EPM, and STAG accounts after budget cuts and sequestration. The FY2013 funding levels for selected geographic-specific/ecosystem programs administered by EPA are compared to the President's FY2013 request and the FY2012 enacted amounts. These programs aim to address water quality and pollution sources in specific areas of the United States through collaboration among various entities. Funding for the restoration of the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay is also discussed. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was established in FY2010 to address significant ecosystem problems in the Great Lakes region. It aims to improve coordination among federal programs and target issues like invasive species and pollution through grants and cooperative agreements with multiple agencies. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, established in FY2010, consolidates funding for federal programs to address ecosystem problems in the Great Lakes region. Projects are implemented through grants and cooperative agreements with various organizations, including EPA and other federal agencies. Initially appropriated $475 million, funding has continued at lower levels since FY2010. In FY2013, $283.7 million was available for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is $16.3 million less than the President's request. President Obama's Executive Order 13508 directed federal agencies to lead in restoring the Chesapeake Bay, which remains degraded despite past efforts. EPA had $54.3 million available for Chesapeake Bay restoration. In FY2013, $54.3 million was available for EPA's Chesapeake Bay program, $18.3 million less than the President's request and $3.0 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. The increase requested by the President aimed to accelerate pollution reduction and habitat restoration efforts in line with the 2009 executive order. EPA was established in 1970 to address environmental pollution concerns, with Congress enacting numerous environmental laws since then. The EPA receives annual appropriations from Congress to carry out its responsibilities under environmental laws, regulating air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, waste management, and cleanup. Congress funds EPA programs through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies annual appropriations bill. EPA also awards grants to assist state, tribal, and local governments in controlling pollution to comply with federal environmental requirements. Authorization of appropriations for EPA programs has expired, but Congress continues to fund them through the appropriations process, even if not authorized. Rules may be waived to allow funding for programs without authorization. In the 112th Congress, the House Committee on Appropriations proposed limiting funding for unauthorized programs in FY2013. In FY2013, Congress decreased or terminated appropriations for unauthorized programs, including EPA's U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure grants and environmental education grants. Funding was provided in P.L. 113-6 to continue these grant programs. Table A-1 shows enacted appropriations for EPA from FY2008-FY2013, while Figure A-1 displays EPA's discretionary budget authority from FY1976-FY2012 and the President's FY2013 budget request. EPA's funding has increased over time to fulfill statutory responsibilities, reflecting the agency's evolving roles in addressing environmental issues. Despite representing a small portion of the federal budget, EPA's funding grew from $1.0 billion in FY1970 to a peak of $14.86 billion in FY2009. EPA's funding has increased over time to meet statutory responsibilities, reaching $14.86 billion in FY2009. In real terms, FY1978 funding was comparable to FY2009 levels. Staff levels also increased, with FTEs rising by 18% from FY1990 to FY1999. EPA's funding and staff levels have shown fluctuations over time. Funding increased to $14.86 billion in FY2009, with FTEs rising by 18% from FY1990 to FY1999. However, there have been decreases in FTEs since FY2001, with the largest single-year decrease occurring from FY2011 to FY2012. EPA's funding has been requested and appropriated under eight statutory accounts since FY1996."
