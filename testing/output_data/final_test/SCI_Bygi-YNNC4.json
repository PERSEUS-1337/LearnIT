Through simulations of 10 related tasks, it was found that nets show promise in scaling up from learning single skills to becoming domain experts. Two key phenomena were observed: forward facilitation, where learning task n+1 is accelerated after learning n tasks, and backward interference, where forgetting previous tasks diminishes as more tasks are learned. This research aligns with metalearning and ameliorating catastrophic forgetting goals. Research on ameliorating catastrophic forgetting aims to achieve backward interference. Broad exposure to a domain helps in mastering new tasks while retaining mastery of previous tasks. Simulations with convolutional neural nets show optimism in scaling up to become domain experts. Forward facilitation accelerates learning of new tasks with increasing mastery, while backward interference diminishes as more tasks are learned. This aligns with goals of metalearning and preventing catastrophic forgetting. In multitask learning, neural networks are trained to perform various tasks by having multiple heads to produce outputs for each task. This approach reflects the breadth of human intelligence, allowing for the capability to perform arbitrary tasks in a context-dependent manner. Multitask learning involves training neural networks to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging shared structure and acting as a regularization method. This approach contrasts with the sequential nature of how humans and artificial agents typically tackle tasks, needing to maintain mastery of previous tasks while acquiring new ones. In this article, the machine-learning analog of students is studied, showing that a neural network trained sequentially behaves similarly to human learners. It exhibits faster acquisition of new knowledge and less disruption of previously acquired knowledge with diverse domain experience. Early research observed catastrophic forgetting, where performance on task 1 drops dramatically after training on task 2. The article discusses catastrophic forgetting in machine learning, where performance on task 1 drops after training on task 2. It also explores metalearning approaches to reduce forgetting and improve transfer between tasks. The article examines the relationship between catastrophic forgetting and metalearning in machine learning. It views them as complementary, with catastrophic forgetting focusing on interference from new tasks and metalearning focusing on facilitation of previously learned tasks. The study investigates a continuum from the first task to the nth task, measuring the training trials required to learn each new task while maintaining performance on previous tasks. The study focuses on measuring performance drop on previous tasks when introducing a new task in sequential multitask learning. It emphasizes the importance of scaling behavior in assessing the efficacy of deep learning algorithms. Tasks involve yes/no responses to questions about images with synthetic shapes. The study introduces a series of 10 episodes with new tasks in each episode. A model is trained on each episode until reaching 95% accuracy on a hold-out set for all tasks. Training involves a mix of examples from previous tasks and the newest task in each episode. In each episode, a model is trained on a single task with a mix of examples from previous tasks. Training involves balancing yes and no target responses for each task. Images are generated using the CLEVR codebase, with 4 or 5 objects varying in shape, color, and texture. 45,000 training images and 5,000 hold-out images were synthesized, with 10 feature values per dimension. Each image can be used for any task. In addition to the 45,000 training images, 5,000 more images were generated for a hold-out set. Each image could be used for any task. Training involved one pass through all images per epoch, with random task assignments to satisfy task distribution constraints. Replications were done using a Latin square design to reduce result sensitivity to task order. 180 simulation replications were conducted across three dimensions, collapsing results across dimensions. The experiments used a basic vision architecture with convolutional and fully connected layers. The model is generic and not specialized for specific tasks. Task representation is included in the input, and accuracy for new tasks is shown in a graph based on training trials. The experiments utilized a generic vision model with task representation in the input. Task accuracy improves over training trials, showing metalearning as accuracy increases for each new task introduced. Catastrophic forgetting diminishes by the tenth episode, indicating relearning savings. The experiments show that as tasks are introduced in episodes, the number of times they are trained decreases, with the final task only trained once. The data suggests a power-law decrease in retraining effort needed to reach accuracy criterion. Backward interference decreases with task relearning and domain experience. The experiments show a decrease in retraining effort needed to reach accuracy criterion as tasks are introduced in episodes. Forward facilitation is observed for newer tasks, with reduced examples required and higher accuracy. Strong backward interference is seen for older tasks. This suggests the need to look beyond training on just two tasks for understanding neural net properties. The experiments demonstrate forward facilitation for newer tasks, requiring less training and achieving higher accuracy. The network shows improved performance with a power function of tasks learned, indicating the need to go beyond training on just two tasks. Power-law learning is observed in human skill acquisition, with catastrophic forgetting primarily seen when learning task 2 after task 1. The model becomes more robust with domain experience, and relearning effort becomes negligible. Task 2 exhibits anomalous behavior, resembling the \"zero one infinity\" rule. These phenomena were identified through simulations examining scaling behavior. The study examined scaling behavior across tasks, finding evidence for improved learning with broader domain expertise. Further investigations will explore how similar tasks facilitate each other and how scaling behavior changes across different task dimensions. Preliminary results suggest acquired domain knowledge is general and extends to other image dimensions. The study also looks at the scaling properties of metalearning methods designed for transfer facilitation. These results can serve as a baseline for future measurements. The specialized methods presented in this article aim to measure facilitation in transfer learning. The goal is to identify methods that show backward facilitation and compositional generalization, which are rare in humans."
