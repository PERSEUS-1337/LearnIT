    "content": "The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 caused damage to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, leading to a significant release of radiation into the oceans. Concerns arose about the impact on the U.S. marine environment. The North Pacific Current, formed by the collision of the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents, could potentially carry radiation from Japan to U.S. waters, although the flow is slow. Radioactive contaminants from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident have not been detected in U.S. waters yet. However, concerns remain about long-lasting contaminants like cesium-137 being transported by ocean currents. Monitoring by TEPCO revealed high levels of iodine-131 near the discharge points of the plant, with readings of 130,000 Bq/l. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident resulted in high levels of radioactive contaminants being discharged into the ocean, including iodine-131 and cesium-137. The leak was eventually stopped, but discharges continued for weeks. Concentrations of radioisotopes decreased over time, with cesium-137 being of greater concern due to its longer half-life. Monitoring showed concentrations between 5 and 38 Bq/l for iodine-131 and 1 to 11 Bq/l for cesium-137 in offshore sampling points. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident released high levels of radioactive contaminants into the ocean, including iodine-131 and cesium-137. The largest accidental release of radiation to the ocean was recorded. Atmospheric transport can carry radiation eastward, settling into U.S. marine waters. The U.S. Department of Energy and EPA monitor atmospheric radiation. Trace amounts of radioactive substances were detected in rainwater in California, Idaho, and Minnesota after the incident. Concentrations have been below concern levels. A study estimated a total release of 35.8 petabecquerels of cesium-137, with the highest release from March 12 to 19. Marine organisms' response to the incident is unknown. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident released high levels of radioactive contaminants into the ocean, including iodine-131 and cesium-137. Marine organisms that migrated through Japanese waters may have been exposed to radiation. Two minke whales harvested off the coast of Hokkaido in May 2011 had elevated cesium-137 levels. Bluefin tuna off the coast of California in August 2011 also showed slightly elevated levels of cesium-137 and cesium-134. Radioactivity in the Pacific Ocean is expected to dilute to very low levels due to tides and currents. Significant radiation from cesium-137 was detected 400 miles offshore of Japan three months after the tsunami. There is a possibility of bioaccumulation of radioactive elements by fish, but radiation in the ocean quickly dilutes and should not be a problem beyond the coast of Japan. Scientists advise monitoring seafood radiation levels, but radiation from Fukushima has dispersed over time and should not pose a serious health risk. Radiation from Fukushima has dispersed over time and should not pose a serious health threat elsewhere, unless bioaccumulated in migratory fish or transferred through food products. Extensive monitoring will determine the exact dispersion of radioactive contaminants, but it is unlikely to be a food safety issue for consumers in the United States due to limited seafood production in affected areas, dilution of radioactive material before reaching U.S. fishing grounds, and examination of seafood imports from Japan by the FDA. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused damage to infrastructure, halting food exports from the affected region, including the fishing industry. A fishing ban was enforced around the damaged nuclear facility, raising concerns about radioactive contamination in seafood. While U.S. fisheries are unlikely to be affected, vigilance is advised for seafood from nearby areas. Cesium-137 and strontium-90 accumulation in fish are potential concerns. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare has reported fish samples from Fukushima prefecture that are above the provisional regulation values for cesium-134 and cesium-137. Contaminated fish samples have included various types of fish such as greenling, flounder, skate, rock fish, seabass, and hakeling. The United States imported 40.1 million pounds of seafood from Japan in 2011, valued at $268.3 million. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of domestic and imported food products. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of seafood imports, with a focus on identifying risks from production processes, specific types of seafood, and certain countries or firms. An import alert was issued for food products from four Japanese prefectures in 2011, with ongoing updates to reflect changing conditions. FDA's import tracking system is used to monitor shipments from Japan, particularly from affected areas. As of March 2012, no radionuclide contamination had been found in FDA field examinations and tests of food products. FDA categorized food products from Japan into four categories based on safety levels. Category 1 includes products restricted by the Japanese government, Category 2 allows for detention under Import Alert 99-33, Category 3 covers products from specific prefectures subject to examination, and Category 4 includes all other FDA-regulated food products from Japan not listed in the import alert. The import alert includes sand lance from Fukushima Prefecture, not allowed in the US due to radiation concerns. Radioactive elements from the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident may have reached US marine waters through atmospheric transport and rainfall. Slow ocean currents could also carry additional radiation, posing a long-term concern due to the half-life of radioactive cesium isotopes. Continued monitoring of radiation levels is necessary. If higher levels are detected, measures will be taken to prevent human exposure. Debris from the tsunami in Japan is projected to reach the US west coast in three years. For more information on radiation, refer to CRS Report R41728. Debris from the tsunami in Japan is projected to reach the US west coast in three years, potentially contaminating beaches with radiation from Fukushima Dai-ichi. The debris plume could affect California, British Columbia, Alaska, and Baja California. Recent observations suggest some debris is traveling faster than predicted, with an initial estimated 1.5 million tons of debris dispersed over a wide area. Debris from the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, estimated to be 1.5 million tons, has become widely dispersed as it moved offshore. Initial debris, including fishing vessels and large pieces, began appearing on Pacific Northwest beaches in late 2011. Concerns about hazards to navigation led to the sinking of a Japanese fishing vessel and a dock grounding on an Oregon beach in 2012. Most of the debris is not expected to reach U.S. shores until 2013. Members of Congress are addressing concerns about the arriving debris. Members of Congress requested additional action from the Administration to address concerns about arriving debris from the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. A joint federal-state-provincial tsunami debris information center has been established, along with a website by NOAA to coordinate efforts in managing the debris. Legislation in the 112th Congress may lead to modifications in the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act to better deal with emergency situations. NOAA has also announced $250,000 in grant funds for debris removal activities in five Pacific coastal states. The 188-ton dock grounded on an Oregon beach in 2012 was encrusted with marine life from Japan, including over 90 species. Volunteers removed 1.5 tons of marine life from the dock, which was then sterilized with flames. This dock was one of three similar docks dislodged by the tsunami in Misawa, Japan."
