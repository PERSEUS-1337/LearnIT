Different agencies have varying regulatory structures for chemicals, focusing on safety, environmental protection, and security. Agencies collect information on chemical inventories at facilities, with interest in the West Fertilizer Company's holdings. The West Fertilizer Company reported the presence of anhydrous ammonia and ammonium nitrate to the EPA and Texas in 2012. However, they did not inform the Department of Homeland Security about these chemicals stored at the facility, which may not have met all reporting requirements. States and local governments have laws and regulations for handling ammonium nitrate and anhydrous ammonia, covering worker and environmental protection, product safety, storage, and security. Federal regulatory programs oversee the storage of these chemicals by retailers, focusing on occupational safety, environmental protection, and security statutes. The federal regulatory programs oversee the storage of chemicals like ammonium nitrate and anhydrous ammonia, focusing on safety, environmental protection, and security. Ammonium nitrate is stable but can become explosive when combined with a fuel source. It is widely used as a blasting agent and fertilizer, with the potential for accidents like the explosion at the West Fertilizer Company. The explosion at the West Fertilizer Company is suspected to be caused by nitrate. Ammonium nitrate accidents have resulted in loss of lives and property destruction, with a notable incident in 1947 in Texas City. Federal agencies regulate the use of ammonium nitrate, with the ATF overseeing blasting agents but not fertilizer. The ATF regulates the distance between ammonium nitrate and explosives, with joint efforts to secure it. Ammonium nitrate can be used for legitimate purposes but also in improvised explosive devices, as seen in the Oklahoma City bombing. The ease of transforming it into a blasting agent has led to increased scrutiny by DHS to prevent misuse. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulates ammonium nitrate for security purposes through two main authorities: securing facilities and tracking transfers. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) oversees security at certain stationary facilities near waterways under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA). Congress authorized DHS to regulate high-risk chemical facilities in 2006 and oversee the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate in 2008. DHS, through the USCG, regulates security at facilities near U.S. waters. The USCG implements the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) to regulate security at facilities near waterways, including those storing ammonium nitrate. The MTSA requires the creation of security plans, vulnerability assessments, and plan updates every five years. The DHS issued a rule in 2007 for chemical facility security. In 2007, DHS established the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) to regulate security at chemical facilities. The program determines security requirements based on the risk posed by each facility, considering threats like release, theft, and sabotage. It lists 322 \"chemicals of interest\" with screening thresholds to assess compliance. This includes pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate with combustible substances as theft or diversion and release threats. Facilities with specified quantities of ammonium nitrate or fertilizer mixtures containing ammonium nitrate are considered high-risk and must comply with CFATS regulations to ensure security against theft or diversion threats. The screening threshold quantity varies based on the type of ammonium nitrate present. Facilities with specified quantities of chemicals of interest must submit information to DHS through the \"Top-Screen\" process to determine risk status. High-risk facilities must comply with CFATS regulations, including security assessments and inspections by DHS. Some facilities are exempt from CFATS, such as water systems or wastewater treatment works. Facilities subject to CFATS regulations include those owned or operated by the Department of Defense or Department of Energy, regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), or regulated under MTSA. DHS has extended regulations to agricultural chemical users but not distributors or retailers. The CFATS rule does not restrict the sale or transfer of ammonium nitrate, but Congress has authorized DHS to regulate its sale to prevent misuse. The DHS is developing regulations to prevent the misuse of ammonium nitrate in terrorism. Sellers and purchasers must register with DHS, be screened against the TSDB, verify identity, keep records, report theft, and comply with audits. The proposed rule imposes conditions on the sale or transfer of ammonium nitrate. The proposed rule for the sale or transfer of ammonium nitrate would require registration with DHS, screening against the TSDB, and transactions regulated at the point of sale. Sellers must only sell to registered individuals, retain records for two years, and report any theft or loss of the substance. The proposed rule for the sale or transfer of ammonium nitrate would require sellers to retain records for two years and report theft or loss to federal authorities within 24 hours. DHS would ensure compliance with these standards for public safety and legitimate commerce. The rule has received 132 comments, and DHS is still reviewing feedback before issuing a final rule. OSHA regulates employers using ammonium nitrate under the General Duty Clause. Employers must provide a safe workplace free from hazards, including those associated with ammonium nitrate. OSHA requires workplaces to have an emergency action plan with specific procedures in place. According to its EPA Risk Management Plan, West Fertilizer Company had an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place. Employers regulated by OSHA must meet specific safety standards for the storage, use, and transportation of explosives, including ammonium nitrate. The standard prohibits storing, handling, or transporting explosives in a way that poses a hazard to life, with specific rules for the storage of ammonium nitrate. The standard for storing ammonium nitrate includes height and spacing requirements, separation from other materials, and building parameter identification. It applies to those storing 1,000 pounds or more of the chemical. Employers must classify, label, and identify workplace chemicals for employee safety. OSHA updated this standard in 2012 to align with regulations. In 2012, OSHA updated the standard for storing chemicals to align with the United Nations GHS. The Process Safety Management (PSM) standard aims to prevent catastrophic releases of hazardous chemicals. Ammonium nitrate is not regulated under the PSM standard as it is not classified as a highly hazardous chemical. EPA also plays a role in chemical regulation. The EPA regulates the production, distribution, storage, and release of chemicals. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act address risks from facilities with chemical hazards. The EPCRA was enacted in 1986 to reduce the risk of chemical accidents following the Bhopal, India industrial accident in 1984. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) established a framework for collaboration between the EPA, state and local governments, and the private sector to control and respond to hazardous chemical releases. It created state emergency response commissions (SERCs) and local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) to develop and implement local plans for handling chemical releases. Ammonium nitrate is regulated under EPCRA Sections 311 and 312, requiring facilities to submit material safety data sheets (MSDS) to the SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. An MSDS must be provided upon request and updated for significant changes. EPCRA Section 311(e)(5) excludes certain substances from the definition of hazardous chemicals. Section 312 requires employers to submit an emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form annually. EPA can establish threshold quantities for chemicals not requiring reporting. In 1990, Congress amended Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to address chemical accidents. Owners of facilities handling hazardous substances must submit a risk management plan to the EPA. Ammonium nitrate is not regulated under this act. The 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act requires facilities with certain levels of toxic substances or flammable gases to submit risk management plans to the EPA. The law excludes retail fuels and substances regulated under other sections of the Act. The EPA Administrator has the authority to adjust thresholds for agricultural nutrients held by farmers. Ammonia, a nutrient used in agriculture, is not included on the RMP chemical list by the EPA Administrator. It is used as a fertilizer, industrial refrigerant, and in manufacturing other nitrogen-containing chemicals like ammonium nitrate. Anhydrous ammonia is a gas form of pure ammonia used in agriculture and refrigeration systems. It is a toxic inhalational hazard, unlike ammonium nitrate which poses explosion and theft risks. Domestic and worldwide production of ammonia is significant. Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic inhalational hazard stored as a liquid under pressure, becoming a toxic gas when released. It can harm individuals and is regulated to prevent environmental release. It is encountered in illegal drug synthesis operations and regulated by DHS using MTSA and CFATS authorities. The USCG regulates security at facilities adjacent to waterways, regardless of the presence of chemicals. The MTSA requires security plans and vulnerability assessments for these facilities. The DHS regulates ammonia through the CFATS program, which determines security requirements for chemical facilities based on risk. The program lists specific chemicals and quantities to assess compliance. The DHS regulates ammonia through the CFATS program, which sets security requirements for chemical facilities based on risk. Facilities holding specified amounts of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia must submit information to DHS and comply with CFATS regulations, including security assessments and plans. Some facilities are exempt, and an extension has been granted for agricultural chemical users. Retail establishments are not included in the extension. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates employers using anhydrous ammonia, requiring compliance with specific safety standards. These standards cover the design, construction, and operation of ammonia systems, including storage. Additional rules apply to different types of storage systems. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates the use of anhydrous ammonia, including requirements for storage systems and containers, transportation, and use in farm vehicles. The PSM standard mandates prevention of catastrophic releases of hazardous chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia. Facilities with over 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia must comply with 14 elements of the process safety management regulation. For the purposes of the PSM standard, a process involves activities with highly hazardous chemicals, including use, storage, manufacturing, handling, and on-site movement. Employers must follow requirements to prevent accidental releases or mitigate their consequences. The standard includes 14 elements, such as developing written safety information on workplace hazards and equipment. The PSM standard requires employers to develop written safety information on workplace hazards, perform hazard assessments, consult with employees, establish a response system, and periodically review assessments and responses. The PSM standard mandates developing written safety information, hazard assessments, consulting with employees, establishing a response system, periodic review, written operating procedures, employee training, contractor information, emergency response training, quality assurance program for equipment maintenance. The PSM standard requires establishing maintenance systems for critical equipment, conducting safety reviews for new equipment, managing changes to process chemicals, and investigating workplace incidents. The standard does not apply to retail facilities. The PSM standard sets limits on employee exposure to hazardous chemicals. West Fertilizer Company was reportedly not covered by this standard. The EPA regulates the production, distribution, storage, and release of most chemicals. The EPA relies on the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act to address risks from facilities with chemical hazards. EPCRA Section 302 lists \"extremely hazardous substances\" (EHS) for emergency planning, with threshold planning quantities. Facilities with EHS above the threshold must notify their SERC, which then informs the EPA Administrator. Anhydrous ammonia is an EHS with a threshold planning quantity of 500 pounds. EPCRA Section 303 requires LEPCs to work with facilities handling EHS to develop response procedures, evacuation plans, and training. EPCRA Section 304 mandates immediate reporting of any release of an EHS or hazardous substance exceeding the reportable quantity to state, local, and federal officials. Facilities must also report to the National Response Center under CERCLA Section 103(a). LEPCs collaborate with facilities to develop emergency plans and training programs for first responders. EPCRA Section 304 requires reporting of releases above the threshold for anhydrous ammonia. EPCRA Section 311 mandates submission of MSDS for hazardous chemicals to local authorities. EPCRA Section 312 requires employers to submit an annual chemical inventory form. West Fertilizer Company reported their inventory to Texas. The CAA Section 112(r)(7) requires facilities to submit Risk Management Plans (RMPs) to the EPA, summarizing potential threats of chemical releases. Policy issues may arise from challenges in reporting chemical inventories and regulatory gaps. Congressional policymakers may need to address data quality issues in regulatory reporting by facilities, which can lead to omission and duplication. There are concerns about the effectiveness of sharing information among government agencies and public access to regulatory information. Self-reported chemical holdings by facilities create the risk of regulatory agencies being unaware of unreported information, especially at the federal level relying on state or local implementation. The quality of self-reported information may also be questioned. DHS does not use self-reported vulnerability assessment information to determine security risk at chemical facilities, leading to different reporting requirements among regulating agencies. This lack of central overview of facility chemical holdings may result in inefficient regulation. Congressional focus may be needed on the rate of inspection under various regulatory programs, as some federal programs have not met expected inspection levels. The EPA has approved site security plans for only a small percentage of regulated facilities. Inspections of facilities reporting chemical holdings are crucial for ensuring accurate information and promoting compliance with regulations. Increased inspections would require more resources, and delegation to state agencies could shift costs. Efficiency could be improved with a cross-trained inspectorate. Efficiency in regulatory inspections could be enhanced by a cross-trained inspectorate. Information sharing among federal regulators, highlighted by gaps in knowledge between EPA, DHS, and the state of Texas regarding the West Fertilizer Company, is a priority post-9/11. DHS is working on sharing CFATS-regulated facility information with various partners and improving coordination with EPA to identify non-compliant facilities. President Obama issued an executive order to improve chemical facility safety and security, focusing on federal agency coordination and information sharing. Congressional policymakers are concerned about balancing public access to chemical hazard information with the risk of malicious use. Reporting under EPA regulation aims to increase community and first-responder awareness of hazardous material releases. The DHS restricts information on security efforts at chemical facilities to prevent misuse by malicious actors. The level of awareness among residents and first responders in West, TX, about potential hazards can shed light on the effectiveness of community outreach efforts."
