    "content": "On July 8, 2012, international donors and the Afghan government met in Tokyo to discuss non-military assistance requirements post-2014. Donors pledged $16 billion in development aid through 2015. House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported on FY2013 State, Foreign Operations appropriations, and Defense appropriations for Afghanistan. In its report, the committee recommended a total assistance level of $1.6 billion for FY2013 State, Foreign Operations appropriations, including $1.1 billion in ESF, $450 million in INCLE, $54.3 million in NADR, and $1.5 million in IMET. The NATO summit in Chicago defined a post-transition 2014 security forces budget of $4.1 billion, with Afghan government financial responsibility by 2024. The Administration's FY2013 budget request included $2.5 billion in Foreign Operations assistance and Defense aid appropriations for Afghanistan. The U.S. aid program in Afghanistan has received nearly $83 billion in assistance since 2001, with two-thirds provided in the past four years. The aid aims to stabilize and strengthen the country through various development programs and support for the Afghan police and military. This report gives an overview of the aid program and congressional actions, without evaluating the effectiveness of the programs. The U.S. aid program in Afghanistan has received nearly $83 billion since 2001, with two-thirds provided in the past four years. The aid aims to stabilize and strengthen the country through development programs and support for the Afghan police and military. The U.S. assistance program in Afghanistan has multiple objectives, mainly focused on stabilizing and strengthening the economic, social, political, and security environment to counter extremist forces in the region. The bulk of U.S. assistance in Afghanistan since 2001 has been directed towards security-related activities, with nearly two-thirds going to the Afghan Security Forces Fund. Economic, social, and political development efforts account for the second-largest portion of aid, mainly provided by USAID. Humanitarian aid, implemented through USAID and international organizations, represents a smaller portion of total aid. The fourth main component of the aid program in Afghanistan is counter-narcotics, accounting for about 5% of total aid since 2001. The Afghan government's development strategy, known as the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), set specific goals and benchmarks in various sectors from security to poverty reduction to be achieved from 2008 to 2013, with a total estimated cost of $50 billion. The international donors aimed to provide most funds through the central government to enhance its legitimacy. However, concerns about corruption and government effectiveness hindered full adoption of this approach. Donors agreed at the 2010 London and Kabul conferences to channel half of all aid directly to the government within two years, contingent on progress in financial management and reducing corruption. The goal was to align 80% of aid with Afghan government priorities within two years. Additional pledges of troops and police were made at the 2010 London conference. The 2010 London conference and Kabul conference saw pledges of troops, police trainers, and funding to support Afghan security forces. The international community supported a phased transition to Afghan government lead in security, increased civilian surge, and targets for Afghan Army and Police forces. The Afghan government agreed to enact laws to curb corruption at the Kabul conference, but none had been enacted as of November 2011 due to a lack of legislative work. The international community pledged support for Afghanistan's security forces at conferences in 2010 and 2011. Despite a lack of legislative work, steps were taken through executive decree. Donors committed to sustaining support for Afghanistan at the Bonn conference in December 2011. The Chicago NATO summit in May 2012 predicted a $4.1 billion annual budget for Afghan security forces post-2014, with the US expected to provide $2 billion annually. In July 2012, international donors and the Afghan government discussed non-military assistance requirements for the 10-year period following the planned withdrawal of US and NATO forces in 2014. At a conference in 2012, donors pledged $16 billion in development aid for Afghanistan through 2015 and committed to continued support through 2017. U.S. assistance accounted for a significant portion of the total aid, with the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund playing a key role in distributing funds for government salaries and infrastructure projects. In June 2011, donors, including the United States, stopped paying into the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) due to concerns about Kabul Bank. In November 2011, the IMF approved a credit program, leading the U.S. to release around $650 million to the ARTF. The bulk of aid contributions comes from NATO nations and Japan, with the World Bank and European Union also major donors. The World Bank and European Union are major aid agencies in Afghanistan, with NATO countries, Sweden, and South Korea leading Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghan provinces. PRTs help extend government authority by fostering a secure environment and improving governance and basic services. District Support Teams (DST) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) were introduced in Afghanistan to improve governance and provision of basic services. PRTs are composed of civilian and military personnel, with civilian leadership increasing in recent years. Civilian representation in the field has risen substantially. In recent years, civilian representation in District Support Teams (DST) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan has significantly increased. The civilian team at the PRT and DST includes officers from the State Department, USAID, and Department of Agriculture. U.S. PRTs utilize funding under various programs to address local needs and concerns, provide management training, and ensure national-level development efforts reach the local population. Despite significant progress in Afghanistan since 2001, insurgent threats to the government escalated starting in 2006. As international security forces withdraw, Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and District Support Teams (DSTs) will gradually be terminated or integrated into individual country aid programs. The PRTs are shifting focus from service delivery to capacity building due to concerns about \"parallel structures\" vis-\u00e0-vis local governments. Aid projects in Afghanistan are implemented by U.S. or Afghan non-governmental organizations and for-profit entities. The Obama Administration conducted a strategic review in response to escalating militant threats in Afghanistan, leading to a new aid strategy focused on adding U.S. troops and enhancing assistance efforts. This new approach was encapsulated in an Integrated Civilian-Military Campaign Plan for Support to Afghanistan published in August 2009. The Obama Administration implemented a new aid strategy in response to escalating militant threats in Afghanistan, outlined in an Integrated Civilian-Military Campaign Plan for Support to Afghanistan. This strategy, jointly published in August 2009, emphasized economic development, coordination among international donors, building local governing structures, and reforming Afghan security forces. It led to increased U.S. assistance, focused on unstable regions along the southern and eastern borders, and a significant rise in civilian aid personnel. The number of government personnel in Afghanistan tripled from 320 in early 2009 to 992 in March 2010, with a total of 1,142 staff by December 2011. The Department of State plans to maintain a civilian presence at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and four field offices after 2014. USAID and DOD have focused on Afghanization of assistance, directing aid through Afghan entities. In 2009, USAID aimed to move 40% of assistance through the Afghan government by 2010. By 2012, the goal was to provide 50% of aid through the Afghan government. In 2010, the US provided $2 billion in direct aid, with $1.4 billion from USAID and $576 million from DOD. As of June 2011, 38% of USAID funding was going through the Afghan government to enhance its administrative capabilities and public perception. USAID and DOD are shifting procurement funding towards the Afghan private sector. In November 2010, the U.S. Embassy, U.S. military, and UNAMA launched an \"Afghan First\" effort to solicit Afghan suppliers for procurement needs. $654 million in reconstruction funds were awarded directly to 214 Afghan business firms between January 2008 and May 2011. Assistance policy shifted in 2009 to allocate more funds to regions and sectors previously less supported, especially in the southern and eastern parts of the country. Beginning in FY2009, more funding was directed towards agriculture in high-priority regions of the counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan. The main goal of U.S. economic aid is to support military stabilization efforts and build Afghan government capacity for sustainability post-2014 transition. USAID has achieved progress in education, health, transportation, power, media, and private sectors, including road rehabilitation and increased electricity supply. The USAID has made significant progress in various sectors in Afghanistan, including education, health, transportation, power, media, and private sectors. This progress includes increasing access to basic health services, training teachers, improving school enrollment, establishing community radio stations, and supporting new businesses. However, Inspector General audits in 2011 and 2012 highlighted delays, high costs, misuse of funds, and uncertain outcomes in some projects. The SIGAR and USAID IG found delays, high costs, and mixed results in the Governance and Community Development Project. The USAID IG also identified questionable costs in the Support to the Electoral Process Project, while noting achievements in strengthening electoral capacities but mixed progress in desired outcomes. Significant delays were found in the Construction of Health and Education Facilities Program due to security threats and lack of skilled labor. The USAID IG found issues in the Skills Training for Afghan Youth Project, including inadequate materials and questionable sustainability of facilities. While the project enabled training centers to continue training youths, little progress was made in strengthening technical capacity or empowering youth. Hindered by extreme underdevelopment and conflict in Afghanistan, USAID faces challenges in achieving positive development outcomes. The assistance program faces challenges due to lack of capacity in Afghan government personnel and concerns about corruption. USAID is supporting civilian advisers and implementing vetting processes to ensure funds are used as intended. USAID has set performance standards for funds and established a vetting process for Afghan companies. They limit sub-contracts and increase monitoring responsibilities in field offices. Concerns include the sustainability of development efforts due to uncertain Afghan government commitment and lack of financial resources. The USAID Administrator issued guidance in June 2011 for projects to align with Afghanistan's National Development Strategy, address cost concerns, and build capacity for maintenance. Security challenges have led to project cancellations and casualties among USAID partner organizations. The USAID Administrator's guidance in June 2011 aimed to align projects with Afghanistan's National Development Strategy, address cost concerns, and build maintenance capacity. Security challenges have led to project cancellations and increased expenses due to the use of security contractors. President Karzai's decree in August 2010 disbanded private security contractors, impacting the ability of aid workers to access local communities for project development and monitoring. According to USAID, only 32 out of 91 projects as of March 2012 require protection by the Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF) and are transitioning from private contractors. The APPF requirement is estimated to be 16% more expensive than private contractors, with labor costs potentially rising by 46% in the first year. The United States is implementing a range of assistance programs in Afghanistan to address various needs in the country. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has allocated a significant amount of assistance towards economic infrastructure in Afghanistan, particularly in road construction. USAID, along with other international donors, has constructed or rehabilitated over 1,800 kilometers of roads, including portions of the Ring Road. Additionally, a 105-megawatt power plant has been built in Kabul to support the country's energy needs. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported the construction of a 105-megawatt power plant in Kabul and efforts to improve the national electric utility's sustainability. This includes doubling revenues by outsourcing operations and maintenance to an international contractor, installing meters to reduce losses, providing technical experts, assessing gas availability in Sheberghan, and funding the Kajaki dam rehabilitation project in Helmand province. These infrastructure efforts aim to increase electricity output and benefit millions of Afghans. The Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund, established by Congress in FY2011, received $400 million in DOD appropriations for infrastructure projects in sectors like health, education, governance, and security. Projects include power generation, roads, and provincial justice centers, but are behind schedule according to a July 2012 audit. The funds are intended to support U.S. counterinsurgency efforts, particularly in Kandahar province. The National Solidarity Program, funded by international donors and implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, aims to strengthen Afghan governance at the local level. Despite significant funding from the United States, the program mainly focuses on constructing village infrastructure and may not show impact until after the 2014 withdrawal of U.S. forces. The National Solidarity Program, funded by international donors and implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, aims to strengthen Afghan governance at the local level. Nearly 30,000 CDCs have been established and received over $1 billion in program grants for infrastructure projects. The chief challenge facing the NSP is expanding into insecure areas where oversight may be difficult. U.S. assistance supports efforts to stimulate Afghan economy, including agriculture and legal framework reform. The U.S. aid in Afghanistan focuses on improving the legal framework for businesses, providing access to credit, promoting bank reform, and supporting specific industries like marble and gemstones. They also work on building business associations and improving land titling through simplification of the registration process. The USAID Rule of Law project in Afghanistan focuses on simplifying land titling, establishing a legal framework for land administration, and providing assistance to commercial courts in resolving land disputes. Programs also address immediate needs in unstable areas through the Community Development Program, which offers temporary employment and income generation activities. The Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative channels funding through the Afghan government for local community projects. The Task Force for Business and Stability Operations focuses on stimulating private sector growth and encouraging foreign investment, including a study on mineral deposits. The United States supports agriculture efforts nationwide and in alternative development. The United States supports agriculture efforts nationwide and in alternative development, including distribution of chickens, training in poultry management, vaccination of livestock, establishment of Veterinary Field Units, seed distribution, capacity building for extension services, loans to farmers, cash-for-work, establishment of food processing plants, repair of farm-to-market roads, and rehabilitation of irrigation systems. The United States supports agriculture efforts nationwide by increasing commercial agricultural opportunities for licit crops and providing expertise to produce those crops. USAID implements most agriculture programs, while DOD fields Agribusiness Development Teams (ADTs) and USDA provides advisors to U.S.-run PRTs to build provincial agricultural capacities and assist local farmers. The Embassy provides technical expertise to the Agriculture Ministry, extension service, and agricultural associations. It also works with the Ministry of Higher Education to improve agriculture education. Health sector assistance, largely by USAID, focuses on expanding access to basic public health care and specific health concerns like polio prevention. About 68% of Afghans now have access to basic health services compared to 9% in 2002. Technical expertise is provided to the Ministry of Health, which handles U.S. assistance funds transparently. USAID supports health and education efforts in Afghanistan. They fund the Basic Package of Health Services and Essential Package of Hospital Services, as well as education programs including school construction, teacher training, and literacy programs. Additionally, they have rehabilitated the women's dorm at the University of Kabul and established the American University of Afghanistan and the International School of Kabul. U.S. assistance in Afghanistan includes democracy programs supporting civil society organizations, independent radio stations, and NGO development. Funds also supported elections and government institution strengthening efforts. The United States is providing technical assistance and cash transfers to the Civil Service Commission and Ministry of Finance in Afghanistan to build civil service competency, improve legislation drafting, identify problems, and enhance social service delivery. A Performance-Based Governors' Fund and Afghan Social Outreach Program are also supporting government services at the provincial and municipal levels. The U.S. program in Afghanistan has established local representative councils to focus on service delivery and justice, with various agencies involved in rule of law programs. The U.S. Embassy appointed a Director for Rule of Law and Law Enforcement to coordinate these efforts. USAID is working on improving legal education as part of the overall objectives to support the Afghan National Justice Program. USAID and INL are working on improving legal education in Afghanistan by redesigning the core curriculum for law faculties, providing training in teaching methodology, legal writing, and computer research. They have also trained judges, renovated courthouses, and supported village elder councils in transmitting their decisions in writing. INL focuses on reforming the criminal justice and corrections system. INL focuses on reforming the criminal justice and corrections system in Afghanistan. Its Justice Sector Support Program trains Afghan justice professionals and brings Afghan law professors to the United States for degrees. The Corrections Systems Support Program addresses prison capacity issues by building prisons in all provinces and providing training for Afghan corrections staff. Congress often directs funding to programs specifically assisting Afghan women and girls. In addition to programs assisting Afghan women and girls, USAID supports projects to raise awareness of women's rights, provide legal education and aid, offer financial support to NGOs, and establish a Women's Leadership Development Institute. The Leadership Development Institute trains women for leadership roles in Afghanistan. The CERP, funded by DOD appropriations, offers grants for urgent relief and reconstruction in local villages. Most of the CERP funds have been used for infrastructure projects, with a shift towards smaller projects and decreased funding from FY2011 onwards. U.S. funds address humanitarian situations in Afghanistan stemming from years of war. The U.S. provides assistance in Afghanistan through international organizations and NGOs to address humanitarian situations caused by years of war and insurgency. This includes aid for internally displaced persons, returning refugees, and vulnerable populations in areas affected by the insurgency. USAID's Civilian Assistance Program plays a role in providing support. The USAID's Civilian Assistance Program in Afghanistan provides targeted assistance to individuals or communities affected by military incidents, including medical care, vocational training, and repair of damaged homes. The NATO/ISAF Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund, to which the United States contributes, offers immediate food, shelter, and infrastructure repair assistance. The DOD's CERP provides battle damage repair and condolence payments for deaths or injuries. U.S. food assistance addresses short- and long-term food security needs, including aid during droughts and chronic malnutrition through programs implemented by international organizations. The United States supports various programs in Afghanistan, including a school feeding program, demining efforts, and counter-narcotics programs. These efforts aim to protect civilians, clear land for agriculture, and combat insurgency funding from narcotics profits. Counter-narcotics programs are managed through different departments and follow a \"5 Pillar Strategy\" to address concerns. The United States supports counter-narcotics programs in Afghanistan through a \"5 Pillar Strategy\" which includes alternative development, rewards for progress in reducing poppy cultivation, eradication efforts, capacity building for law enforcement, and public awareness campaigns. Recent emphasis has shifted towards alternative development over eradication efforts. The United States supports counter-narcotics programs in Afghanistan through a \"5 Pillar Strategy\" which includes alternative development, rewards for progress in reducing poppy cultivation, eradication efforts, capacity building for law enforcement, and public awareness campaigns. Eradication efforts have been diminished for fear of alienating farmers, while interdiction aimed at drug lords has been increased. The amount of opium produced in Afghanistan increased from 3.6 million kg in 2010 to 5.8 million kg in 2011, and the total area under opium cultivation had risen from 123,000 hectares in 2010 to 131,000 hectares in 2011. Areas with international and Afghan security presence have seen a decline in cultivation. The United States provides security assistance to Afghan police and army forces through the Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF), totaling $50.6 billion since FY2005. This assistance includes equipment, training, and mentoring to enhance their capabilities. The Afghan National Security Force level is expected to increase from 344,108 to their planned level. The Security Force level is expected to increase to 352,000 by October 2012. Concerns have been raised about the speed and effectiveness of training, with obstacles including high attrition rates, leadership inadequacies, and limitations in management and logistics. Control of police training was shifted from the State Department to DOD in 2009. The State Department's NADR account supports training and equipping the Afghan Presidential protection service and funds counter-terrorist finance efforts. The IMET program exposes Afghan officers to U.S. practices. Congress approved the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act in 2002, authorizing economic assistance programs for Afghanistan's development. The development of Afghanistan includes support for security forces and economic assistance. Funding for civilian and defense assistance has been provided through regular appropriations and emergency supplemental appropriations bills. In FY2011 and FY2012, funding for both types of assistance was included in regular appropriations. Afghan civilian aid was channeled to Overseas Contingency Operations in the FY2012 State, Foreign Operations appropriations. In FY2012, the Administration issued a budget request including $3.2 billion in foreign operations assistance to Afghanistan and $13.9 billion in DOD aid. The foreign operations request included $2.8 billion in ESF. Security aid and the CERP fall under the 050 Defense budget function, while economic and humanitarian aid are in the 150 International Affairs function. The Administration's FY2012 budget request for Afghanistan included $2.8 billion in ESF, with $1.6 billion for regular costs and $1.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. Other requests for regular costs included funds for State and USAID Global Health, food aid, INCLE, NADR, and IMET. Additionally, $948 million was proposed for State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) operational expenses in Afghanistan. In December 2011, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2012 allocated $50 million for rule of law programs in Afghanistan, with $10 million for the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program and $5 million for the Office of Global Women's Issues small grants program. Congress shifted most of the Administration's regular funding request to the off-budget OCO category. The Administration allocated $1.8 billion in ESF OCO, $324 million in INCLE OCO, $41.8 million in regular NADR funds, and $23 million in NADR OCO funds. Congress also appropriated $1 billion for State Department D&CP operations in Afghanistan. Additionally, Division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2012 provided Department of Defense OCO appropriations to Afghanistan, including $11.2 billion for the ASFF, $400 million for the CERP, and $400 million for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund. The Administration allocated $258 million for the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations. In February 2012, the Administration issued its FY2013 budget request, seeking a total of $2.5 billion in ESF, INCLE, NADR, and IMET. The Administration's FY2013 budget request includes funding split between regular and OCO categories. It requests $811.4 million in regular ESF, $1 billion in OCO ESF, $400 million in regular INCLE, $200 million in OCO INCLE, $54.3 million in regular NADR, and $1.5 million in regular IMET. Additionally, $1.9 billion is requested for OCO State operations to support needs associated with the pending U.S. military withdrawal, including civilian facilities in Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Defense appropriations request includes $5.7 billion for the ASFF, $400 million for CERP, $400 million for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund, and $179 million for the Task Force. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a total assistance level of $1.6 billion for FY2013 State, Foreign Operations appropriations, below the $2.5 billion request. The committee proposed funding for various programs including ESF, INCLE, NADR, IMET, Afghan Civilian Assistance Program, Global Women's Issues small grants program, democracy, human rights, State operational D&CP, and SIGAR. The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 5857 for FY2013 State, Foreign Operations appropriations, with $1.6 billion for State operational expenses and $49.9 million for SIGAR. It also included $200.8 million for USAID operational expenses. The committee supported plans to reduce personnel and rule of law programs in Afghanistan. The legislation did not specify amounts for Afghanistan, leaving final country allocations to the Administration based on priorities. The House Appropriations Committee supported USAID's Accountable Assistance for Afghanistan initiative, emphasizing accountability for programs and legislative conditions on aid. They also addressed concerns about implementing partners, tax bills, and population displacement. Additionally, they voiced support for programs focusing on women, rule of law, media training, and regional trade efforts. In FY 2013, Congress allocated funds for various programs in Afghanistan, including the ASFF, CERP, Afghan Infrastructure Fund, and Business Task Force. Conditions and reporting requirements were imposed on aid, such as reducing corruption and protecting women's rights. ESF and INCLE funds were to be used to strengthen Afghanistan's capacity to reduce corruption and involve civil society and government representatives. The 2008 Defense Authorization requires reporting on aid activities in Afghanistan, including a quarterly report by SIGAR and a biannual report on progress towards security and stability."
