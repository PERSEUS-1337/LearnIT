The curr_chunk defines terms related to alternative and renewable energy, coastal political subdivisions, and coastal states within the context of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The curr_chunk defines terms related to coastal States, including the distance from leased tracts and leasing moratoriums. The curr_chunk defines the outer Continental Shelf region as areas including Alaska, North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic planning areas for oil, natural gas, and renewable energy development. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of revenues from oil, natural gas, and renewable energy development on the outer Continental Shelf. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for depositing 37.5 percent of these revenues into a special Treasury account. The Secretary of the Interior disburses 27.5 percent of revenues to coastal States and political subdivisions, and 10 percent to coastal States for energy-related projects. Exclusions include the outer Continental Shelf. The excluded revenues do not include qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues, revenues from bond forfeitures, or revenues generated from certain leases. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (43 U.S.C. 1331 note; Public Law 109-432) allocates funds among coastal states based on a formula established by the Secretary. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 allocates funds to coastal states based on a formula that considers the distances between the coastline and leased tracts. Coastal states are limited to receiving revenues from tracts within 200 nautical miles and the outer Continental Shelf region.

The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 allocates funds to coastal states based on a formula considering distances from the coastline to leased tracts.

The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 allocates funds to coastal states based on a formula considering distances from the coastline to leased tracts. 90 percent of the funds are allocated inversely proportional to distances between the closest point in each coastal political subdivision to the leased tract's center. The remaining 10 percent is divided equally among county-equivalent subdivisions in Alaska within the region. The State of Alaska determines significant staging areas for oil and gas servicing, supply vessels, operations, suppliers, or workers more than 200 nautical miles from the leased tract's center within the coastal zone. SEC. 3 amends the Mineral Leasing Act to require 50% of revenues from onshore alternative or renewable energy sources to be shared with the state where the energy source is located.
