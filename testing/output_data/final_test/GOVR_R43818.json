    "content": "Federal executive branch agencies own a vast real property portfolio with over 871,000 buildings and 40 million acres of land globally. These assets serve various purposes such as barracks, health clinics, warehouses, laboratories, national parks, boat docks, and offices. As agency missions evolve, some properties become less useful or unnecessary. For instance, the Department of Veterans Affairs has shifted from hospital-based care to outpatient services, impacting space needs. The Department of Defense also downsized its force structure post-Cold War, leading to base realignments. After the Cold War, federal agencies engaged in base realignments and closures. Real property disposition is the process of transferring or selling unneeded facilities and land to save costs. In FY2013, 21,464 properties were disposed of, saving $411 million in operating costs. Disposition allows for the transfer of federal property to state, local governments, nonprofits, and businesses. The General Services Administration (GSA) plays a central role in disposing of federal real property. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) have unique disposal processes due to their independent statutory authority. The Federal Real Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 gives GSA the authority to dispose of real property no longer needed by federal agencies. GSA has the authority to dispose of federal real property that agencies no longer need. Agencies without independent disposal authority conduct annual surveys to identify excess properties, which are then inspected and appraised by GSA. GSA evaluates the fair market value of excess federal properties and notifies other agencies through a Notice of Availability. Agencies can acquire excess properties by responding within 30 days and submitting a formal request within 60 days. If no agency wants the property, it is declared surplus and made available to state and local governments and nonprofits. Surplus federal properties can be transferred to state and local governments, and nonprofits for a discount of up to 100% of fair market value for public benefit purposes such as homeless services, law enforcement, education, and more. Each public benefit category has a sponsoring federal agency overseeing conveyances. Under Title V of the McKinney-Vento Act, surplus properties must first be considered for homeless use by HUD before other public benefit uses. If deemed suitable, a notice is published in the Federal Register, giving 60 days for state/local governments and nonprofits to express interest in using the property for homeless services. If no interest is received, the property can be used for other purposes. The GSA advertises surplus property availability to state and local officials and nonprofits. The sponsoring agency reviews applications and monitors property use after transfer. If the recipient fails to use the property as agreed, it may revert back to the federal government. Surplus property not disposed of through public benefit conveyance may be sold to state and local entities. State and local governments have the right of first refusal to purchase surplus federal property before it is offered to the public. Negotiated sales can occur for public benefit, such as economic development. Surplus properties not sold through public benefit conveyance or negotiated sale may be offered to the general public through advertising in various publications. The U.S. Real Estate Sales list, GSA's website, and newspapers are sources where properties for sale are listed. DOD and USPS are among the largest federal landholding agencies, with DOD owning over 1.7 billion square feet and USPS owning 197 million square feet. USPS has autonomy in disposing of its properties, while DOD's disposal authorities are more limited and complex. The USPS has independent authority to manage its real estate holdings, allowing it to acquire, maintain, sell, lease, or dispose of properties as needed. This autonomy is a key aspect of the USPS as outlined in the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, which transformed it into a financially self-supporting entity with the general duty to maintain an efficient mail system nationwide. The USPS has the authority to manage its real estate holdings to maintain an efficient mail system nationwide. This includes determining the need for post offices, facilities, and equipment, adjusting its network to accommodate changes in mail volume and technology, and disposing of excess property for the greatest value. The USPS has the authority to manage its real estate holdings efficiently, including disposing of excess property through various means. The closure process for post offices involves notifying the public, a 60-day comment period, and a 30-day appeal period to the Postal Regulatory Commission. The USPS has the authority to manage its real estate holdings efficiently, including disposing of excess property through various means. After a closure decision, the agency may shut down a post office without public comment for non-post office properties. The DOD comprises various defense entities, with real property under the jurisdiction of military departments and managed by local installation military officers. The process of identifying and disposing of military real property involves routine practices and special procedures authorized under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. This includes Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds where officers review the utilization of land and facilities, and recommend excess property to be declared by the Secretary of Defense. The final authority for declaring real property as excess lies with the Secretary of the relevant military department, with management usually delegated to an Assistant Secretary. Once identified as excess, the property is reported to GSA for potential transfer to other defense organizations or federal agencies. If no interest is shown, GSA oversees the disposal process as per statutory restrictions and reporting requirements codified in Title 10 of the United States Code. Title 10 of the United States Code outlines requirements for reporting and transferring real property with values exceeding $750,000, including notifying congressional committees, waiting before transactions, and conveying surplus property for conservation purposes to states or nonprofit organizations. The process of transferring real property between military departments and federal agencies is governed by various laws, including 10 U.S.C. 2696, which allows for transfers without compensation under certain conditions. The closure of a military installation can have significant economic and social impacts on surrounding communities, leading to challenges in reducing defense real property. The closure of military installations and challenges in reducing defense real property have been problematic. Congress has authorized five Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds to evaluate and reduce excess inventory. The most recent BRAC round expired in 2006, requiring a new provision of law for any future efforts. While the general three-step process of BRAC rounds remains unchanged, temporary statutes have added complexity. During BRAC rounds, temporary statutes have enhanced oversight of DOD, provided assistance to affected communities, and increased transparency in reconfiguring garrisons. Provisions from the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and the National Environmental Policy Act apply to closed BRAC properties. The differences between GSA's normal property disposal process and DOD's BRAC disposal process revolve around three phases: identification, screening, and disposal. These details pertain to the 2005 BRAC round under the FY2002 reauthorization of the Defense Base. During the 2005 BRAC round, the Secretary of Defense had to submit a force-structure plan to Congress based on threats to national security, end-strength levels, and funding availability. The plan also included a worldwide inventory of military installations for each military department. During the 2005 BRAC round, the Secretary of Defense had to submit a force-structure plan to Congress based on threats to national security, end-strength levels, and funding availability, including a worldwide inventory of military installations for each military department. DOD used eight final selection criteria, including military value and other factors, for recommending closure or realignment of installations. The military value criteria focused on mission capabilities, facility availability, surge capacity, and cost of operations, while other criteria considered timing of savings, economic impact, community support, and environmental impact. The Secretary of Defense's recommendations were then reviewed by an independent nine-member commission appointed by the President. The independent nine-member commission, appointed by the President with congressional input and confirmed by the Senate, held public hearings on the Secretary's recommendations. The commission could amend the closure or realignment lists if it found substantial deviation from the force-structure plan. It had to submit its report to the President by a specific date, who then had a set time to approve or disapprove the recommendations. The commission had one month to revise its recommendations if the President disapproved, with a second disapproval halting the process. Congress had 45 days to pass a joint resolution of disapproval to prevent closures or realignments. The Secretary of Defense had to initiate closures within two years and complete them within six years of the President's approval. Economic adjustment assistance could be offered to affected communities. The Defense has the authority to provide economic adjustment assistance to communities near closing or realigning military installations. This assistance is usually channeled through local redevelopment authorities designated by the Secretary of Defense. The base closure acts also provide special authorities for the disposal of surplus properties. The Secretary of Defense can provide economic adjustment assistance to communities near closing military installations. Surplus federal property transfer may be subject to environmental requirements to protect human health, natural resources, and cultural resources. Remediation may be required if contamination is present. Federal facilities, including industrial sites, may require remediation to address contamination before transfer to prevent harmful exposures. Unique hazards like unexploded ordnance or radiological wastes may be present at some federal facilities. Hazardous substances like asbestos or lead-based paint could also pose challenges for transfer and reuse. Consideration must be given to protecting natural and cultural resources during transfer. Compliance with environmental and historical requirements may vary in terms of time and resources needed. The process of determining federal environmental requirements for compliance varies among properties. This includes assessing past activities, potential hazards like mold or asbestos, and ensuring compliance with regulations. The management of federal properties involves evaluating criteria such as past activities, environmental hazards, location in floodplains or endangered species areas, and historical significance. Agencies must assess these factors to determine compliance with environmental laws before deciding on property disposition. The disposition of federal properties involves compliance with environmental laws, including the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before making decisions. Other federal and state laws may also apply depending on site-specific conditions. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) for federal agencies to clean up contaminated federal property before transferring it out of federal ownership. The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires federal agencies to consider the impact of proposed undertakings on historic properties listed in or eligible for the National Register. Compliance with NHPA is necessary if the property being disposed of is included in the National Register or if its disposal would affect such a property. Compliance with NEPA and CERCLA is also generally required to assess environmental impacts and hazardous substances for federal surplus property disposal. NEPA, signed into law in 1970, requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before making final decisions on actions. It aims to inform decision-making processes without prioritizing environmental concerns over others. Regulations implementing NEPA were established by the Council on Environmental Quality. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before making decisions on actions within their control. This includes agency plans, project approvals, closure of facilities, and property disposition. GSA is responsible for NEPA compliance in disposal-related activities, while the landholding agency must review actions related to reporting property as excess. The NEPA review for surplus property disposal actions is usually limited, with an EIS rarely required unless significant environmental impacts are expected. Federal real property disposal typically does not involve major environmental impacts, except for actions related to the BRAC process. The NEPA review for surplus property disposal actions is usually limited, with an EIS rarely required unless significant environmental impacts are expected. Federal real property disposal typically does not involve major environmental impacts, except for actions related to the BRAC process, which may require the preparation of an EIS due to the closure of one military property and potential expansion of another. Regardless of EIS requirement, agencies must identify potential impacts to ensure no significant effects. The NEPA compliance for surplus property disposal actions is usually limited, with an EIS rarely required unless significant environmental impacts are expected. Agencies may use an environmental assessment (EA) to determine the need for an EIS or issue a finding of no significant impacts (FONSI). Compliance can also be documented through a categorical exclusion (CATEX) for actions with no significant environmental effects. Each federal agency's procedures list actions likely to be approved as a CATEX or an EA. GSA's NEPA procedures include a \"CATEX checklist\" to determine compliance with NEPA for certain actions, such as property disposal for another federal agency or disposal required by public law. Compliance with NEPA does not guarantee no regulated impacts, especially for properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The NEPA compliance process may involve ensuring protection of resources like cultural or historical sites, which may be required by laws other than NEPA, such as the NHPA. Public involvement is a key aspect of NEPA to inform about environmental impacts of proposed actions. Public involvement is crucial in NEPA compliance for proposed actions, even for actions that may not require an EIS. Agencies have the discretion to determine the level of public participation needed, especially for surplus property disposal where public opposition may arise due to concerns about future development. After federal ownership transfers, future development of land may no longer be subject to federal requirements, such as NEPA or NHPA review. The Archeological and Historical Preservation Act (AHPA) mandates federal agencies to protect archeological sites, which may not be required by nonfederal landowners. Public involvement is important in ensuring proper surveying of archeological sites on the property. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires the United States to clean up contaminated federal property before transferring it out of federal ownership. This provision ensures that the responsibility for cleanup remains with the federal government, not the recipient of the property. Section 120(h) applies to all contaminated federal property declared surplus to the government's needs. The agency with administrative jurisdiction over the property is responsible for the cleanup. The recipient may agree to pay for cleanup of contaminated surplus federal property in exchange for a discounted purchase price or other ownership conditions. Funding for cleanup is subject to availability of appropriations to federal agencies like the Department of Defense. The EPA's Superfund program does not typically cover cleanup funds for nonfederal sites, but federal facilities are cleaned up through the program in partnership with states. The administering federal agency is responsible for cleanup at federal facilities, and reuse agreements are negotiated between the agency and the recipient. Disagreements may arise if the recipient's intended use requires costly cleanup. The federal agency may find cleanup costs too high relative to available funds. Cleanup technologies may limit reuse of surplus federal property if achieving necessary cleanup levels is impractical. The United States retains liability for insufficiently remediated contamination after property transfer. Liabilities are specified in a covenant in the deed transferring the property out of federal ownership. Before the date of transfer, actions to protect human health and the environment are taken, with the United States conducting any necessary additional remedial actions afterward. The deed must grant the United States access for cleanup actions and may include limitations on the continuing responsibility, warranting cleanup only to a level suitable for negotiated land use. Some deeds may restrict certain unsuitable uses, with the United States assuming responsibility for additional cleanup as needed. The new owner may need to assume responsibility for additional cleanup costs if the property is to be used for a different purpose. Deeds may prohibit certain land uses, such as residential, due to limitations on cleanup technologies. Surplus federal properties may have a mix of contaminated and uncontaminated land parcels, with clean parcels ready for reuse but contaminated parcels requiring cleanup. The Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act (CERFA) allows for the transfer of uncontaminated parcels on surplus federal properties while cleanup continues on contaminated parcels. This approach aims to prevent delays in transferring clean lands for economic redevelopment, especially on closed military installations. If new contamination is found post-transfer, the deed for uncontaminated parcels must still address it. Section 120(h)(4)(D) requires a deed for uncontaminated parcels to include a covenant warranting cleanup actions by the United States if contamination from past federal activities is found. The cleanup of contaminated parcels can be lengthy, and delays in transfer out of federal ownership may occur. However, Section 334 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997 allows for the transfer of contaminated parcels on surplus federal property before cleanup is complete under certain conditions. The authority to transfer contaminated parcels on surplus federal property before cleanup is complete is granted by Section 334 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997. This allows for a deferral of the cleanup covenant, known as an \"early\" transfer, with assurances that cleanup will still be carried out after the property leaves federal ownership. Funding for cleanup must be identified in annual budget requests, and the deed must restrict the property's use to specific purposes. The early transfer of contaminated surplus federal property for cleanup purposes requires funding identified in annual budget requests. The property must be restricted to protective uses until cleanup is complete, with a covenant provided by the United States warranting suitability for intended use. The early transfer of contaminated surplus federal property for cleanup purposes requires the concurrence of the Administrator of EPA and the governor of the state where the facility is located. When federal property is sold, a review under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) may be necessary to assess potential adverse effects on historic properties. The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires federal agencies to conduct a Section 106 review before undertaking projects that may affect historic properties. This review involves identifying consulting parties and considering a broad range of alternatives during the planning process. The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) mandates a Section 106 review by federal agencies before projects impacting historic properties. Consulting parties, including SHPO, THPO, local/tribal officials, and applicants, are invited. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is identified, with historic properties within it considered. If no historic properties are present, the process continues. The Section 106 process under the National Historic Preservation Act involves identifying historic properties within the Area of Potential Effects (APE) and assessing if the undertaking will adversely affect them. Adverse effects can be direct, indirect, or cumulative, even if the project doesn't physically touch a historic property. NHPA applies not only to federally owned historic buildings but also to non-historic buildings that could impact historic areas. If the sale of a non-historic federal building could change the character of a historic area, it might be considered an adverse effect under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In such cases, further analysis is required, and the agency must document its findings of adverse effects, make it public, and allow for comments. The Advisory Council on Historic Places (ACHP) may be involved as a consulting party to develop alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects. If agreements are reached, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is entered into between the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer/Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO/THPO). The Section 106 process concludes with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the agency and SHPO/THPO. If parties cannot agree on adverse effects, termination is possible. The agency can continue the project despite harm to historic properties, but must document rationale and consider Council comments. The agency may proceed with its project despite harm to historic properties, implementing any mitigation measures it deems necessary."
