    "content": "The Trade and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act of 1997 defines trade and professional associations as organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. Qualified immunity from civil liability is provided under this Act. The Trade and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act of 1997 provides qualified immunity from civil liability for acts related to transmitting information among trade and professional associations. This immunity can be challenged if the acts involve fraudulent or knowingly false statements. Additionally, the Act allows for a special motion to strike claims in judicial proceedings based on immune acts, with the option to move the case to Federal court. Required procedures for this special motion are outlined in the Act. The Trade and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act of 1997 provides immunity from civil liability for transmitting information. A special motion can be filed under section 4, treated as a summary judgment, with expedited appeal rights, suspended discovery, and burden of proof on the responding party. The court shall make its determination based on the facts in the pleadings and affidavits filed. The motion will be granted and the claim dismissed unless the responding party proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the moving party's acts are not immune from liability under section 3. The prevailing moving party will be awarded costs of litigation, including attorney and expert witness fees. Trade and professional associations are protected from complying with subpoenas in civil actions related to product defects unless clear evidence of relevance and compelling need is provided. They can file a special motion to quash a subpoena and move the case to Federal court if necessary. SEC. 8. REQUIRED PROCEDURES REGARDING SPECIAL MOTION TO QUASH. On the filing of any motion under section 7, the trial court must hear the motion promptly, the moving party has the right to an expedited appeal if the motion is denied or not ruled on quickly, compliance with the subpoena is suspended during the motion and appeal process, the responding party has the burden of proof, the court makes its decision based on pleadings and affidavits, and the subpoena is quashed unless the responding party proves otherwise. The court shall award costs of litigation, including attorney fees, to the prevailing party in connection with the motion if the responding party fails to prove that the materials are not immunized from third-party discovery under section 6. Qualified association members are protected from disclosing confidential information related to product defects, quality, or performance received from their trade or professional association, unless the information is directly relevant to litigation and the party seeking it has a compelling need for it. SEC. 10. PREEMPTION: This Act overrides state laws that apply to the same matters covered by this Act."
