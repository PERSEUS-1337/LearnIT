    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 6.7 (Section 6970) in the Public Contract Code introduces the Construction Manager/General Contractor method for regional transportation projects. This method allows a regional transportation agency to involve a construction manager during the design phase to provide input on scheduling, pricing, and phasing for a more constructible project. The Construction Manager/General Contractor method in regional transportation projects shifts liability and risk for cost containment and project schedule to the construction manager. Definitions for \"construction manager\" include entities providing licensed contracting and engineering services under this method. The \"Construction Manager/General Contractor method\" involves a construction manager providing preconstruction and construction services for a project. Preconstruction services include advice on scheduling, pricing, and phasing to assist in designing a more constructible project. The project refers to the construction of an expressway not on the state highway system, overseen by a regional transportation agency. A regional transportation agency is defined as a transportation planning agency, county transportation commission, or other designated entity involved in transportation projects. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority can use the Construction Manager/General Contractor method for projects approved by voters. The agency must evaluate different construction methods before adopting the procurement strategy in a public meeting. Maintenance of the expressway falls under the responsibility of the entity maintaining local streets and roads. Construction Manager/General Contractor method projects authorized by the regional transportation agency follow the same process as outlined in Sections 6703, 6704, and 6705 to 6708. After project completion, a progress report is prepared for the governing body, detailing project description, awarded entity, costs, and completion schedule. The progress report for Construction Manager/General Contractor method projects includes details such as the schedule for project completion, protests, prequalification assessment, bid evaluation method, challenges faced during construction, and recommendations for improvement. The report is made available on the regional transportation agency's website. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution. The costs incurred by local agencies or school districts will be due to creating a new crime, eliminating a crime, changing penalties, or altering crime definitions."
