    "content": "The European Union (EU) and the United States are major agricultural trading partners and competitors in world food markets. Both provide significant government support for their agricultural sectors, with the EU offering more extensive support for a wider range of farm and food products. Together, they account for over 60% of all government support to agriculture among major developed economies. The United States and EU have faced criticisms for their farm support programs, impacting trade negotiations in the WTO. Both countries have made some changes by expanding non-commodity support programs, but these still make up a small portion of total farm-level support compared to production support. The report compares farm support in the United States and the EU, using data from the OECD's PSE, AMS estimates, and budget expenditures. The EU provides more government support to agriculture than the US, with total EU agricultural support being higher. The EU provides more government support to agriculture than the US, with significant differences in farm sectors between the two. The EU has more farm operators across its member countries and supports a broader range of farm commodities compared to the US. Farm program support in the EU and US differs in size, scope, and how it is provided. In the US, federal farm support, food assistance, agricultural trade, marketing, and rural development policies are governed by separate laws, with the omnibus farm bill providing an opportunity for policymakers to address agricultural and food issues. The omnibus farm bill (P.L. 110-246) covers various areas such as commodity crops, livestock, conservation, nutrition, trade, research, and rural development. It provides support for selected commodities like corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans, dairy, and sugar through price and income support programs. Grains, cotton, oilseeds, dairy, and peanuts are eligible for fixed payments and counter-cyclical assistance. The 2008 farm bill provides producer subsidies, crop loans, and minimum pricing systems for commodities like dairy and sugar. The average cost of commodity programs is estimated at $8.3 billion per year. Conservation programs aim to preserve the environment through land retirement and working lands initiatives. Farmers may also receive crop insurance and disaster assistance payments. The 2008 farm bill includes land retirement and easement programs, working lands programs, rural development programs, and farm conservation programs. These aim to convert land back into forests, grasslands, or wetlands, improve natural resource conservation practices, and support infrastructure and business development in rural areas. The average cost of these mandatory programs is estimated by the CBO. The 2008 farm bill includes various programs aimed at land conservation and rural development, with an estimated cost of $4.8 billion per year. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) governs agricultural policies for the EU, focusing on increasing productivity, fair living standards for farmers, market stabilization, food availability, and reasonable prices. EU interventions in commodity markets, variable tariffs on imports, and export subsidies are used to achieve these objectives. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU has faced criticism for high prices, budget expenditures, and distorting world markets. Policy changes since 1992 aim to make the CAP more market-oriented, reduce budget costs, and align with WTO rules. Recent reforms also focus on rural life quality, environmental improvement, and animal welfare. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU underwent reforms in 1992 and 1999 to reduce commodity support prices, require farmland to be taken out of production, and establish budget disciplines. Farm income support is now contingent on meeting agricultural and environmental norms introduced in 2003. Direct aid and market support are the first pillar of the CAP, while rural development measures constitute the second pillar. Total spending for EU farm programs in 2008 was estimated at nearly $68 billion (\u20ac54 billion), accounting for over 40% of the EU budget annually. The single farm payment (SFP) is a major component of the first pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU, accounting for over 40% of the EU budget annually. Introduced in 2003, the SFP largely decouples support from current prices or production. EU member countries mostly moved to full decoupling, with partial decoupling being eliminated for all but a few commodities by 2012. Reported spending for \"direct aids,\" including SFP, is estimated at about $50 billion (\u20ac37 billion) for 2008. To receive the SFP, farmers must comply with environmental and agricultural measures, such as keeping farmland in good condition and observing mandatory management requirements. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU includes the Single Farm Payment (SFP), which accounts for over 40% of the EU budget annually. To receive the SFP, farmers must comply with environmental and agricultural measures, known as \"good agricultural practices\" (GAPs), including groundwater protection, water pollution control, pesticide use, and habitat protection. Non-compliance results in reductions in direct payments, with sanctions ranging from 5% to 20% for repeated instances. The Rural Development Policy focuses on competitiveness, environment, quality of life, and diversification in rural areas. The EU's Rural Development Policy focuses on improving quality of life and diversifying the rural economy. Member countries co-finance activities under this policy, with the EU funding 75% of costs and 90% in poorer areas. Direct payments to larger farmers are reduced to finance rural development, with about $14 billion (\u20ac10 billion) allocated in 2007 and $19 billion (\u20ac13 billion) in 2008. This represents about 20% of all EU farm spending, with direct farm spending accounting for 70% of the CAP budget. Direct farm spending, including the SFP, makes up 70% of the CAP budget. The remaining budget is allocated to other farm programs and administration. CAP spending is controlled by a financial discipline mechanism to prevent overspending on direct aid and market support. Quantitative data comparing agricultural program support between the US and EU includes the annual PSE and AMS estimates, as well as annual budget expenditures. The PSE and AMS data, along with annual budget expenditures, provide estimates of support for agricultural commodities and non-commodity programs. These sources are useful for comparing farm program support across countries but have limitations, especially in non-commodity programs like agricultural conservation. The data is more comprehensive than reported budgetary information but does not reflect recent reforms to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was agreed upon by EU agriculture ministers in late 2008. Differences between the United States and the European Union are highlighted, including policy priorities and farm sector disparities. The US commodity program focuses on major commodities like corn, wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton, dairy, and sugar, while the EU program supports a wider range of products. The US has larger farms on a larger farmland base compared to the EU, which has more farm operators on less total land in farming. Since the mid-1980s, farm support in the US and EU has decreased as a share of total gross farm receipts. Commodity program support has declined, while non-commodity programs like farmland conservation have increased. However, non-commodity program support still makes up a small share of farm receipts. The EU provides more support than the US for production-based and non-commodity programs, such as farmland conservation. OECD's Producer Support Estimate (PSE) is used for cross-country comparisons of farm support. The OECD defines Producer Support Estimate (PSE) as the annual monetary value of transfers from consumers and taxpayers to support agricultural producers, broken down into seven categories including production-based and non-commodity criteria. This measure reflects the multifunctionality of agriculture beyond food and fiber production. Agriculture has various functions beyond food and fiber production, including environmental protection, landscape preservation, biodiversity, rural viability, employment, animal welfare, food safety, quality, and security. Non-commodity outputs of agriculture provide social value not reflected in markets and are jointly produced with commodity outputs. The OECD report analyzes government support for non-commodity programs like agri-environmental services, with extensive statistical and historical data by type of support and major commodity. The OECD report provides comprehensive information on agricultural support across countries, allowing for a direct comparison between the United States and the EU. It includes data on various levels of EU accession and historical perspectives back to the mid-1980s, enabling a complete analysis of policy reforms over time. The OECD report allows for a comparison of policy reforms over time, but the PSE's limitation is in budget spending comparison. Non-commodity outputs lack detailed program comparisons, focusing on long-term resource retirements and general criteria. Developed countries' 2009 OECD report highlights general conclusions on producer support. The 2009 OECD report shows that producer farm support is at its lowest level since the 1980s, with a shift towards new policy measures to strengthen rural areas and improve environmental performance. Reforms in farm policy vary across countries. Total farm support in the United States has decreased from 24% of gross farm receipts in 1986 to about 7% in 2008, with a drop in commodity program support and an increase in non-commodity programs. EU estimates are comparable. Total farm support in the EU has declined from 42% of farm receipts in 1986 to about 25% in 2008, with a decrease in commodity program support. Non-commodity criteria support has increased but still remains below 1%. Data shows a decrease in total support payments for commodity programs in both the United States and the EU during this time period. The \"Aggregate Measurement of Support\" (AMS) allows for comparisons of farm program support across countries, reflecting the monetary value of publicly funded farm support. It is used to monitor countries' compliance with WTO commitments to reduce domestic support for agriculture. Green box programs, which are minimally trade-distorting, include research programs and direct payments. Green box payments are minimally trade-distorting and include research programs, direct payments to farmers not tied to production, environmental program payments, and disaster assistance. Blue box programs involve direct payments under production-limiting programs, such as EU direct payments based on fixed areas or yields. Amber box programs are contingent on agricultural production participation, like U.S. price supports for dairy and sugar. These payments do not require WTO disciplines or reductions and do not count against subsidy ceilings. De minimis exemptions exclude small levels of domestic support from AMS calculations if they are not likely to distort trade. They include commodity-specific and non-product-specific support. Non-product-specific subsidies below 5% of a developed country's total agricultural production do not need to be included in the AMS calculation. The AMS data provide a comprehensive account of farm programs, reported by major categories and in local currency. The OECD's reported information includes support for all commodities in local currency, subject to fluctuations in commodity markets and foreign exchange rates. AMS data aggregate domestic agricultural support across all commodities, even those without annual budgetary outlays. The AMS captures agricultural support including government purchases, marketing quotas, and import barriers for dairy and sugar programs in the U.S. and fruits, vegetables, dairy, sugar, and grain products in the EU. The AMS data has a reporting lag, with the most recent U.S. notification covering support through 2007 and the EU notification covering 2005. The comparison of agricultural support data between the United States and the European Union for the period 1995-2005 is limited due to differences in policy priorities, reporting, and accounting methods. The U.S. includes \"domestic food aid\" in its \"green box\" payments, while the EU faces delays in submitting recent data due to accounting issues related to country accession. Internal shifts in reporting categories further complicate direct comparisons. The United States and the European Union have differences in agricultural support data reporting. The U.S. categorizes \"domestic food aid\" as part of its \"green box\" payments, while the EU has delays in submitting recent data. The U.S. provides less support for production-based programs but more for domestic food aid and direct payments compared to the EU. The majority of U.S. farm payments are green box, while a smaller percentage of EU payments fall under this category. The U.S. and EU have differences in reporting agricultural support data. The U.S. classifies \"domestic food aid\" as green box support, while the EU does not. Direct payments in the U.S. are decoupled and classified as green box, totaling around $5 billion annually. EU farm production payments were largely decoupled after the 2003 CAP reforms. Comparing environmental payments data also requires clarification, as the U.S. recently reclassified the CRP as an environmental payment. The recent U.S. notification reclassified the CRP as an \"environmental payment\" instead of \"resource retirement programs.\" Average environmental payments in the U.S. ($1.2 billion) are lower than in the EU ($5.3 billion). U.S. payments for \"resource retirement programs\" ($1.0 billion) are more than double compared to the EU. Total environmental payments under the \"green box\" classification are higher in the EU, but recent data shows a smaller difference: U.S. environmental payments were $3.8 billion in 2007, while the EU had $5.6 billion in 2005. EU payments for rural development programs exceed those in the U.S. EU payments for rural development programs are significantly higher than in the United States. U.S. payments are higher for USDA research, regulatory, and technical services. Annual budget expenditures for agricultural programs in 2006 and 2007 are reported by each country in its local currency. Data sources vary due to general reporting differences among countries. Budget data for the United States are mainly from USDA, including information from the Commodity Credit Corporation and other USDA agencies. The annual budget data from USDA and EU agricultural reports provide timely information on support programs, subject to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. However, the data may not always be comprehensive or inclusive of all support areas, limiting their use for historical comparisons. The USDA and EU annual budget data reflect support for various agricultural programs, but there are limitations in coverage. The U.S. budget data mainly cover five crops, while the EU program supports a wider range of products including grain, dairy, and sugar. Meat, livestock, fruits, and vegetables do not receive farm support payments in the U.S. The EU's budget supports a wide range of products, including grain, dairy, sugar, fruits, and livestock. Most of the budget is in the form of direct aid. Comparing budget data between the US and EU is challenging due to reporting differences. Table 3 compares budget data for the United States and the EU, focusing on commodity and non-commodity support. The EU budget includes interventions in agricultural markets and direct aids, while the US budget covers commodity payments and crop insurance. Non-commodity support in the EU is reported under \"Rural development,\" with limited details on specific activities across all EU27 countries. The curr_chunk discusses the compilation of U.S. data on conservation, rural development, and forestry activities, including budget outlays for various programs administered by USDA's NRCS and FSA. It excludes certain programs like wildfire activities and rural housing. The data is compared with EU budget data in Table 3, focusing on farm program areas and rural development expenditures. Between 2006 and 2007, EU spending for non-commodity support increased, while budget data for farm commodity support is less straightforward due to low commodity prices in 2007. Agri-environmental payments in the EU15 countries have accounted for about 75% of the total rural development budget item, totaling roughly $11-$12 billion per year. In comparison, the U.S. spent an average of about $5 billion on conservation programs during the same period. The EU requires farmers to meet conditions related to environmental protection, food safety, and animal welfare for direct payments, unlike the U.S. Comparing data on a per-acre or per-farm basis is complicated due to significant structural differences between the U.S. and EU farm sectors. The U.S. spent about $5 billion on conservation programs, less than half of the EU's total spending. The EU has twice the farmland base of the EU but fewer farms. Budget data comparisons on a per-unit basis show different interpretations, with the EU having higher farm expenditures per acre but the US having higher expenditures per farm. The EU is a key agricultural trading partner and competitor with the US in world food markets. The EU and the United States heavily support their agricultural sectors. Criticisms and debates challenge the need for government farm programs. Both countries have expanded non-commodity support but it still remains a small share compared to production support. Failure to reform farm support programs has impacted the Doha Round negotiations. The EU and U.S. farm support programs have caused delays in the Doha Round of trade negotiations at the WTO. Congress remains interested in comparing these programs as negotiations progress."
