    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act was created in response to the Institute of Medicine's findings on medical errors causing deaths in the United States. Congress was urged to provide legal protections for information reported for quality improvement and patient safety. Hearings were held by the Senate Committee on patient safety to address these issues. The 107th Congress discussed patient safety initiatives and the need for a learning environment to improve patient safety. Voluntary data gathering systems were favored over mandatory systems for creating this environment. Promising patient safety reporting systems were also highlighted. Promising patient safety reporting systems have been established in the United States, with ongoing projects funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to determine the best ways to structure and use these systems. The Department of Health and Human Services has initiated patient safety projects, including a patient safety standard issued by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Organizations collecting patient safety data are seeking legal protections for the data. The need for legal protections for data sharing in patient safety improvement strategies is highlighted, as current peer review protections are inadequate. The purpose of the Act is to encourage a culture of safety and quality in the healthcare system by providing legal protection for information reported voluntarily for quality improvement and patient safety. The United States healthcare system has been found to not consistently deliver high-quality care to patients. The Act aims to raise standards for continuous quality improvements in patient safety through the actions of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new part C for patient safety improvement, with updated sections and definitions. The new part C of the Public Health Service Act defines non-identifiable information as data that prevents identification of providers, patients, and reporters of patient safety data. Patient safety data includes various information collected or developed by providers for reporting to patient safety organizations. The new part C of the Public Health Service Act defines non-identifiable patient safety data as information reported to patient safety organizations for quality improvement processes, requested by a patient safety organization, reported to providers, collected or developed by patient safety organizations, or shared among organizations with authorization. This data includes information related to corrective actions taken to improve patient safety, healthcare quality, or outcomes. Patient safety organizations conduct efforts to improve patient safety and healthcare quality by collecting and analyzing voluntarily submitted data, and disseminating information to providers on best practices. Patient safety organizations utilize patient safety data to encourage a culture of safety, maintain confidentiality, provide security measures, and certify compliance with criteria. The term 'provider' includes individuals delivering medical services under a licensed provider, physicians, and other healthcare professionals required to be licensed by the state. The term 'provider' includes individuals delivering medical services under a licensed provider, physicians, and other healthcare professionals required to be licensed by the state. This encompasses various healthcare facilities such as renal dialysis facilities, ambulatory surgical centers, pharmacies, physician or health care practitioner's offices, long term care facilities, behavioral health residential treatment facilities, clinical laboratories, and any other entities specified by the Secretary after public notice and comment. \"SEC. 922. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PEER REVIEW PROTECTIONS.\" Patient safety data is privileged and confidential, not subject to subpoenas, discovery, disclosure under FOIA, admission as evidence, or use in adverse employment actions or accreditation decisions. The evaluation of decisions related to accreditation, certification, credentialing, or licensing based on an individual's involvement in patient safety data activities is allowed. Disclosure requirements permit providers to share relevant information for proper management without hindrance. The provider can disclose patient safety data for disciplinary or criminal proceedings if it is material, in the public interest, and not available elsewhere. They can also share information with the FDA or related entities for regulated products or activities. The entity is responsible for activities related to the quality, safety, or effectiveness of regulated products. Disclosures of information by providers or patient safety organizations are allowed for specific activities. The transfer of patient safety data to a patient safety organization does not waive any privilege or protection. It is unlawful to disclose patient safety data described in the section, except as provided for in specific circumstances. The section prohibits the disclosure of patient safety data, with violators facing fines. It does not limit other privileges available under Federal or State laws. It also does not affect the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. \"SEC. 923. NATIONAL DATABASE.\" The Secretary may establish a database to collect non-identifiable patient safety data voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations. The data will be used to analyze regional variations and national statistics on patient safety and healthcare quality. The Secretary may establish a database for voluntary reporting of non-identifiable patient safety data with common formats and confidentiality measures. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to patient safety organizations, including annual meetings for discussions on methodology, communication, data collection, and privacy concerns. Additionally, within 36 months of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Secretary will develop voluntary national standards to promote the integration of health care information technology systems, with ongoing review and dissemination of these standards. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the implementation of this part. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the impact of medical technologies and therapies on patient safety, quality of care, and healthcare costs. The study will assess the use of labor versus technology in the healthcare system and the introduction of innovative medical technologies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the impact of innovative medical technologies and therapies on patient safety, quality of care, and healthcare costs. The study will also assess State laws related to patient safety data peer review systems. The Attorney General will review state laws related to patient safety data peer review systems and submit a report to the Senate and House committees within 9 months of the Act's enactment."
