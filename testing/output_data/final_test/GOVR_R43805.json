    "content": "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for eligible low-income workers, administered as part of the federal income tax system. In 2015, $68.5 billion was claimed by 28.1 million tax filers, making it the largest antipoverty cash assistance program. The credit amount varies based on earned income, number of qualifying children, and marital status. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) primarily benefits families with children, with 97% of EITC dollars going to them. Two temporary modifications were made under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, later made permanent by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act. The modifications included a larger credit for families with three or more children and reducing the EITC's marriage penalty. This report provides an overview of EITC eligibility, computation, and growth since 1975, with data on EITC claims in 2015 by number of qualifying children and income level. The EITC eligibility requirements include filing a federal income tax return, having earned income, meeting residency requirements, having qualifying children, meeting age requirements, having investment income below a certain amount, not being disqualified due to prior fraud, and providing Social Security numbers. To be eligible for the EITC, tax filers must provide their Social Security number, file a federal income tax return, and meet income requirements based on marital status and number of qualifying children. Married filing separately status is not eligible for the credit. To claim the EITC, tax filers must have earned income, including wages, tips, and self-employment income. Servicemembers can include combat pay in their earned income for a larger credit by electing to do so. The EITC is a tax credit that servicemembers can claim by including combat pay in their earned income. Certain forms of income are not considered earned income for the EITC, such as pension and annuity income. Tax filers claiming the foreign earned income exclusion are ineligible for the EITC. Recipients must be U.S. residents, unless residing in another country due to military service. Qualifying children must meet specific requirements. The EITC allows servicemembers to claim the tax credit by including combat pay in their earned income. Qualifying children must meet specific requirements, including having a specific relationship to the tax filer, sharing a residence for more than half the year, and meeting age criteria. A child may be the qualifying child of more than one tax filer in the same household, but only one can claim the EITC for that child. Under current law, individuals must meet specific criteria to claim the childless EITC, including age requirements and limits on investment income. The statutory limit for investment income is adjusted annually for inflation, with a bar on claiming the EITC for 10 years if ineligible. To claim the EITC, tax filers must provide valid SSNs for themselves, spouses, and qualifying children before the income tax return due date. Nonresident aliens are generally ineligible for the credit. The EITC amount is based on formulas considering earned income, qualifying children, marital status, and AGI. It equals a fixed percentage of earned income until reaching its maximum amount, then gradually decreases to zero above the phase-out threshold. Specific values vary based on factors like the number of qualifying children and marital status. The EITC's earned income amounts, credit rates, phase-out rates, and maximum credit amounts vary based on the number of qualifying children and marital status. The phase-out threshold is higher for married tax filers, reducing potential \"marriage penalties\" in the EITC. The EITC for a married couple may result in \"marriage penalties\" as the credit is less than for two unmarried recipients. Figure 2 shows the EITC amount for an unmarried taxpayer with one child in 2018, with distinct ranges: Phase-in Range where the credit increases with earned income up to $10,180, and Plateau where it remains at $3,461 until earnings exceed $18,660. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) provides a maximum credit of $3,461 for a tax filer with one child in 2018. The credit remains at $3,461 until earnings exceed $18,660, known as the phase-out amount threshold. Once income surpasses $18,660, the EITC is reduced by 15.98% for every additional dollar, until it is completely phased out at an AGI of $40,320. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) provides a maximum credit of $3,461 for a tax filer with one child in 2018, which is reduced as income exceeds $18,660. Tax filers can calculate their credit using IRS tables based on income, marital status, and qualifying children. The EITC amount decreases for each dollar of income above the phase-out amount threshold, leading to ineligibility once income reaches $40,320. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has eligibility thresholds based on the number of qualifying children and marital status. These thresholds are adjusted annually for inflation and range from $15,270 to $54,884 in 2018. AGI must be below these thresholds to qualify for the EITC, with amounts expressed as a percentage of the poverty guidelines. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in 2018 has eligibility thresholds based on the number of qualifying children and marital status. The poverty guideline for a family of three was $20,780, with EITC eligibility thresholds exceeding this amount. The EITC is available to all families with children earning between 267.4% to 364.0% of $15,080 annually. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is provided annually to individuals and families in a lump sum payment after filing a federal income tax return. It can be received as a reduction in federal tax liability, a cash payment from the Treasury as a refund check, or a combination of both. The majority of the EITC amount is received as a refund, with a smaller portion offsetting tax liabilities. The EITC is claimed against all taxes on the federal income tax return after nonrefundable credits. Payments are based on the prior year's income when families file their taxes. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is calculated based on the prior year's income, earnings, and family composition. If a tax filer is owed a refund and includes an EITC on their return, the refund will be issued on or after February 15. The EITC is calculated after total tax liability and nonrefundable credits, such as education and dependent care credits. If nonrefundable credits reduce a family's tax liability, more of their EITC will be received as a refund. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is calculated based on the prior year's income, earnings, and family composition. If a tax filer is owed a refund and includes an EITC on their return, the refund will be issued on or after February 15. For tax filers in the \"phase-out range\" of the credit, reducing income will result in a larger EITC. Various forms of income can be excluded from AGI and earned income, such as pretax contributions to savings accounts for retirement or medical expenses. By making these contributions, EITC claimants can reduce their AGI or earned income for purposes of calculating the credit. Reducing income in the phase-in range of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) will result in a smaller credit, while reducing income in the phase-out range will lead to a larger credit. Nontaxable income is generally not included in earned income for EITC calculations, but servicemembers can choose to include their nontaxable combat pay. The EITC cannot be counted as income for federally funded public benefit programs. An EITC refund saved by the filer does not affect resource limits for 12 months. Temporary modifications to the EITC were enacted in 2009, including a larger credit for families with three or more children. ARRA enacted temporary changes to the EITC in 2009, including a higher credit rate of 45% for families with three or more children and increased marriage penalty relief by raising the income level at which the credit phased out for married tax filers. These changes were extended for two years by the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The EITC provisions were extended multiple times, with the PATH Act making them permanent. The EITC was initially enacted in 1975 to encourage economic growth and reduce unemployment. Today, it is the largest need-tested antipoverty program. The EITC was originally enacted in 1975 as a temporary refundable tax credit, with 6.2 million tax filers claiming it that year. The credit was made permanent in 1978 and has since been increased through legislative changes in 1986, 1990, 1993, 2001, and 2009. The credit amount was calculated as a percentage of earnings before 1990. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was initially calculated as a percentage of earnings before 1990, with the credit remaining at its maximum level before gradually decreasing as earned income increased. Legislative changes increased the credit in various ways, such as adjusting the credit rate, earned income amount, phase-out amount threshold, and phase-out rate. Starting in 1990 and more significantly in 1993, the credit formula was revised to vary based on earned income and family size, with workers without qualifying children becoming eligible for a smaller credit in 1993. The EITC underwent revisions in 2001 and 2009, including changes to the credit formula based on marital status and the creation of a larger credit for families with three or more children. These changes were made permanent in 2015. Legislative expansions of the EITC led to growth in the credit in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s and again in the 2000s. The EITC experienced growth in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s and again in the 2000s. Most credits were paid as refunds, with a small portion reducing federal income tax liability. The total amount claimed increased due to higher participation and average credit received. Before the 1986 Tax Reform Act, EITC thresholds were not indexed for inflation, causing the credit to lose value annually. Revisions in 1986, 1990, and 1993 adjusted the credit parameters and formula. The EITC underwent revisions in 1990 and 1993, leading to an increase in the average credit amount. Legislative changes in 2001 and 2009 resulted in larger credits for some claimants. In 2015, the average EITC claimed was $2,440, with $68.5 billion claimed on 28.1 million tax returns, mostly by families with children. 97% of EITC dollars were claimed by tax filers with qualifying children. In 2015, 97% of EITC dollars were claimed by tax filers with qualifying children. Childless tax filers accounted for 26% of all EITC claimants but only claimed 3% of the total EITC dollars. The average EITC claimed for 2015 increased with the number of qualifying children claimed by tax filers. In 2015, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was claimed by millions of filers with qualifying children, with average claims ranging from $294 to $4,185. The EITC benefits lower-income earners near the poverty line, with reduced benefits for those with higher earnings. The most typical EITC tax return had an adjusted gross income between $10,000 and $14,999. In 2015, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was claimed by millions of filers with qualifying children, with average claims ranging from $294 to $4,185. Close to half of all EITC claims had AGIs below $15,000, equivalent to earnings less than the federal minimum wage. Average EITC benefits increase with AGI, then decline, reflecting the formula for determining the credit and the mix of family types claiming the EITC in different AGI categories. In 2015, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was claimed by filers with qualifying children, with average claims ranging from $294 to $4,185. The EITC was claimed on 18.7% of all tax returns, with varying rates by state. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 70% of EITC dollars will be claimed by unmarried tax filers, with most claimed by heads of household. In 2015, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was claimed on 18.7% of all tax returns, with varying rates by state. Mississippi had the highest percentage of returns claiming the EITC at 31.6%, while New Hampshire had the lowest at 11.5%. A regional pattern showed more claims in southern states compared to New England and some northern Midwest states."
