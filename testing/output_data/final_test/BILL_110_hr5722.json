    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Megan's Law of 2008\" and includes findings and declaration of purposes. Congress adopted Megan's Law in 1996 to inform the public about sex offenders in their communities. In 2006, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act was passed to strengthen national standards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has made thousands of arrests since 2003, including many non-U.S. citizens suspected of illegal activities. The Act aims to prevent international travel by sex traffickers and offenders by expanding access to information about offenders, denying entry to foreign nationals with a sex offense, and including relevant information in annual reports to Congress. Over 2 million children are exploited each year in the global sex trade. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 aims to prevent international travel by sex offenders by establishing systems to identify and provide notice of their travel to destination countries. It also includes providing assistance to foreign countries to meet these requirements under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 3. SEX OFFENDER TRAVEL REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act requires individuals to report their travel plans to a jurisdiction 21 days before leaving or arriving from a foreign place. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General will establish rules for reporting within 90 days of the Act's enactment. These rules will outline reporting procedures and required information, with potential alternative reporting methods. The International Megan's Law of 2007 mandates reporting of international travel, with penalties for failure to report, including fines or imprisonment up to 10 years. Amendments to existing laws include adding reporting requirements to section 2250 of title 18, United States Code. Amendments to section 2250 of title 18, United States Code now include a duty to notify sex offenders of reporting requirements under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. The table of sections has been updated to reflect the changes in reporting international travel. The amendments to section 2250 of title 18, United States Code now require notifying sex offenders of their duty to report under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Offenders must read and sign a form acknowledging the reporting requirements. The amendments to section 2250 of title 18, United States Code now require notifying sex offenders of their duty to report under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, including notification to foreign authorities of international travel by sex offenders. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a system to notify foreign authorities about travel outside the US by sex offenders. Foreign authorities will receive identifying information to track these individuals, with technical assistance provided by the Secretary of State. Authorities will participate in the notification program for sex offenders traveling abroad. SEC. 5 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prevent the admission of sex offenders to the United States. Any alien convicted of a sex offense is inadmissible. SEC. 6 requires an annual report on severe forms of trafficking in persons and implementation assessment. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to include a list of countries that identify and notify sex offenders traveling to the United States or other countries. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 amendment requires countries to provide information on sex offenders traveling, including their identity, nature of offense, and travel details. Countries must show progress in establishing this system. The President must provide an assessment on the progress and challenges in establishing a global system for sex offender travel notifications within two years of the Act's enactment. This assessment is based on information required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 amendment. The establishment of a global system for sex offender travel notifications, as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 amendment, would be facilitated by including a system described in section 110(b)(1)(D) of the Act. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. SEC. 7 encourages the President to provide assistance to foreign countries to establish systems for identifying and notifying sex offenders traveling to the United States or other countries. The term \"sex offender\" is defined as per the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. SEC. 8 requires a congressional report. The President must submit an annual report on the implementation of the Act, including the number of sex offenders reporting travel, prosecutions for failure to report travel, and actions taken by foreign countries. In subsection (a), the term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out the Act and its amendments."
