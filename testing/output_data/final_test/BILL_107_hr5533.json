    "content": "The Act titled \"Department of Veterans Affairs Claims Backlog Reduction Act of 2002\" is abbreviated as such. It includes findings related to veterans affairs. Congress finds that there are over 25,000,000 honorably discharged veterans in the US, with over 500,000 veterans having pending claims for benefits. Approximately 100,000 of these claims are over a year old without resolution. The Nation's veterans are dying at a rate of over 1,000 a day, and it is the US Government's responsibility to fulfill promises made to them. The National Association of County Veterans Service Officers has 2,400 full-time employees present in 37 States. Members of the National Association of County Veterans Service Officers are willing to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to clear the backlog of veterans' benefits claims. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"claimant\" for individuals applying for benefits, \"County Veterans Service Officer\" for those assisting veterans with benefits, \"injury or illness claim\" for service-connected claims, \"presumptive claim\" for specific duty-related claims, and \"statutory claims\" for certain claims. The term \"statutory claims\" refers to benefits defined in section 5101 of title 38, United States Code. \"Specific claims\" encompass statutory, presumptive, and injury or illness claims. \"Ready to be rated\" indicates there is enough information to evaluate and assign a disability rating. The term \"State\" is defined in section 101(20) of title 38, United States Code. SEC. 4. REDUCTION OF BACKLOG OF VETERANS' CLAIMS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will identify and categorize the backlog of veterans' claims, referring those requiring development to County Veterans Service Offices based on proximity to the claimant. The claims will be accompanied by specified information needed for development. Claims for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may be submitted to County Veterans Service Officers, who will then forward the necessary information to the Secretary to process the claim. SEC. 5. DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS. County Veterans Service Officers are responsible for developing claims referred to them and have the authority to fully develop and transmit claims to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for rating. Once fully developed, the claim is sent back to the Secretary with all necessary information and a statement indicating it is ready to be rated. The County Veterans Service Officer determines when a claim is fully developed with all necessary items for substantiation, as specified by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. SEC. 6. INFORMATION SHARING.\n\nVeterans' information from the Department of Veterans Affairs will be accessible to County Veterans Service Offices for developing claims under this Act. No other use of the information is allowed. Funding for this Act is allocated to States based on veteran population. States can retain up to 3% for administrative overhead. A portion of funding is designated for education and training as determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Federal funds allocated for County Veterans Service Offices must not exceed 50% of total costs and should be used to expand existing programs, not replace local government funding. In states without a County Veterans Service Officer program, federal funding can be used to establish new programs to assist veterans and their dependents with applications. The Act allows for the allocation of federal funds to assist veterans and their dependents in filing applications for benefits. In states where local governments do not establish County Veterans Service Officer programs, the State department of veterans affairs may provide the services. Any unused funds will revert back to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for reallocation to states with existing programs to expand services and reduce the veterans claims backlog. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out the Act is set at $70,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2005."
