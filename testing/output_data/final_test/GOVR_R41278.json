    "content": "On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law, which restructures the private health insurance market and sets minimum standards for health coverage. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) was signed the following week, amending provisions in ACA. ACA also requires most U.S. residents to obtain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty starting in 2014, and establishes state-based health insurance exchanges for purchasing coverage with federal subsidies available. The ACA requires state Medicaid programs to expand coverage to eligible individuals with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government covers 100% of expansion costs initially, phasing down to 90% by 2020. The Supreme Court ruled that withholding federal Medicaid funds to enforce expansion violated the Constitution. ACA also amends Medicare to reduce growth rates and imposes an excise tax on insurance plans. The ACA includes provisions to reduce growth rates in Medicare, impose excise taxes on high-premium insurance plans, and make changes to tax codes, Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. It also aims to increase the healthcare workforce, promote preventive services, and enhance quality measurement. The law has a significant impact on federal spending and revenues, with subsidies for health insurance purchases, Medicaid expansion, and funding for temporary programs to increase access. The ACA includes programs to increase access and funding for targeted groups, establish exchanges, and support research and demonstration programs. Costs are offset by new taxes, fees, and savings from reforms to slow spending growth. The law also affects discretionary spending through new grant programs and reauthorization of existing programs. The ACA includes various provisions related to workforce, public health, quality of care, and other areas. It is composed of 10 titles, with key provisions found in Titles II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and IX. Title X made amendments to existing provisions and added new ones. Funding for these programs is subject to congressional appropriations. The ACA includes numerous provisions in Titles I through IX and was further amended by HCERA. The summaries of the ACA provisions are grouped under various section headings related to health centers, workforce, prevention, maternal and child health, quality, nursing homes, research, emergency care, and more. The report provides an overview of key ACA provisions such as Biosimilars, Nutrition Labeling, 340B Drug Pricing, and Medical Malpractice. It includes a detailed timeline of important dates and references to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. PHSA Sec. 330 authorizes the health centers program. Sec. 330 authorizes the health centers program, providing grants to various types of health centers to offer comprehensive primary care, case management, and other supportive services to medically underserved communities. Health centers must treat all patients regardless of their ability to pay, with approximately half serving rural populations. Community health centers offer sliding-scale fee arrangements based on patients' financial circumstances, increasing access to primary health care services and improving community health. The ACA provides $11 billion in supplemental funding for these centers over a five-year period. The ACA provides $11 billion in supplemental funding for community health centers over a five-year period, creating a multi-billion Community Health Center Fund. The Secretary is required to transfer $9.5 billion for center operations and patient services, with an additional $1.5 billion for health center construction and renovation. This funding adds to previous supplementary funds provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Additionally, the ACA increases authorized appropriations for health centers and permanently authorizes the program. The ACA permanently authorizes the health centers program and appropriates funds for school-based health centers and nurse-managed health clinics to provide care to underserved populations. It also authorizes state grants for healthcare providers treating the medically underserved. The ACA authorizes state grants for healthcare providers treating the medically underserved and creates a state demonstration program to provide the uninsured with access to health care. Appropriations for the health center program are specified for FY2010 to FY2015, with subsequent years based on a formula considering previous appropriations and patient costs. Community health centers can contract with specified entities for primary health care services. The ACA establishes a Community Health Center Fund with $11 billion allocated over five years to increase funding for health center operations and patient services. Clinics/hospitals must not discriminate based on ability to pay and must offer a sliding fee scale for low-income patients. The ACA establishes a Community Health Center Fund with $11 billion allocated over five years to increase funding for health center operations and patient services. Additionally, funds are appropriated for health center construction and renovation, with a grant program created for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) to use for facility construction and equipment. Preference is given to SBHCs serving children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP programs. The ACA establishes a Community Health Center Fund with $11 billion allocated over five years to increase funding for health center operations and patient services. Subsection 4101(b), as amended by ACA Sec. 10402(a), creates a new PHSA Sec. 399Z-1 for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) to receive grants for operating costs. SBHCs must meet specified criteria, match 20% of the grant amount from non-federal sources, use funds for designated purposes, and provide age-appropriate services while prohibited from offering abortion services without parental consent. The ACA establishes a Community Health Center Fund with $11 billion allocated over five years to increase funding for health center operations and patient services. Subsection 4101(b), as amended by ACA Sec. 10402(a), creates a new PHSA Sec. 399Z-1 for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) to receive grants for operating costs. Entities receiving funding under PHSA Sec. 330 that overlap with the SBHC grant period are prohibited from receiving funds under this section. The Secretary can give preference to applicants serving communities with barriers to access and consider previous grant recipients. Appropriations are authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. A new PHSA Sec. 330A-1 establishes a grant program for Nurse-Managed Health Clinics providing primary health care to vulnerable populations. Eligible clinics must have nurses as major service providers. The ACA authorizes grants for Nurse-Managed Health Clinics to provide care to underserved populations. The Secretary must consider financial need and other factors when determining grant amounts. States can award grants to healthcare providers serving special populations. Funds from Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare programs cannot be used for grants. Total appropriations are $50 million for FY2010, and SSAN for FY2011 through FY2014. The Secretary must establish a three-year demonstration project in up to 10 states to provide comprehensive health care services to the uninsured at reduced fees. Each state may receive up to $2 million for the project, with authorized appropriations to carry it out. Health workforce policy is crucial for transforming the nation's health care delivery system towards primary care, disease prevention, and chronic illness management. Experts are concerned about the size, specialty mix, and distribution of the healthcare workforce. The healthcare workforce faces shortages in certain geographic areas, with projections showing a need for more physicians and nurses by 2020. The enactment of ACA is expected to worsen these shortages as more people seek healthcare services. The federal government plays a crucial role in supporting health professions workforce development through PHSA Title VII, which provides grants, scholarships, and loan repayment for physicians, dentists, physician assistants, and public health workers. These programs aim to increase the number of primary care providers, improve primary care competency, and promote racial and ethnic diversity in the healthcare workforce. Annual funding for Title VII programs exceeded $2.5 billion in the early 1970s. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) reauthorizes and expands PHSA health workforce programs, creating new programs to increase training in primary care, rural areas, and community-based settings. It includes programs for training opportunities in various provider shortages like pediatric subspecialists and geriatricians. ACA also modifies Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payment policy. The ACA's changes to GME payments and new health center grant program aim to promote primary care training in nonhospital settings. The ACA reauthorizes and expands PHSA health workforce programs, including the National Health Service Corps, physician, dental, nursing, geriatric, and public health workforce. It also addresses workforce diversity, mental health, and Medicare GME payments. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) offers scholarships and loan repayment for medical students, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others who agree to work in underserved areas as primary care providers. NHSC clinicians fulfill their service commitments in various healthcare settings, with a high demand for their services. The ACA provides $1.5 billion in funding for the NHSC over five years, in addition to $300 million from the ARRA. It also increases authorized appropriations and allows clinicians to fulfill service commitments part-time, aiming to attract younger providers seeking work-life balance. The ACA aims to attract graduated physicians seeking work-life balance, including female physicians, by offering part-time service opportunities and encouraging medical residency training in community-based sites. It also allows NHSC providers to count time spent teaching towards their service commitment and requires the Secretary to redefine how HPSAs are designated. The HPSA designation has been used for various purposes, including preference for federal grants programs. Concerns have been raised about the methodology used to designate HPSAs and its lack of updates. HHS has been working on developing an alternative methodology since 1998. The ACA sets a timeline for finalizing a new HPSA designation methodology and amends the Internal Revenue Code to clarify that amounts received from state-operated loan repayment programs in shortage areas are not taxable income. This aims to make participation in state loan repayment programs more attractive to health professionals. The section amends PHSA Sec. 338H(a) to authorize amounts for NHSC scholarships and loan repayments for fiscal years 2010-2015. It also establishes a Community Health Center Fund with a total appropriation of $11 billion over FY2011-FY2015. The fund will transfer increasing amounts to the NHSC over FY2011-FY2015, totaling $290 million for FY2011 to $310 million for FY2015. The Secretary can waive the full-time clinical practice requirement for NHSC service, allowing half-time service with a minimum of 20 hours per week. Individuals opting for this must double their obligated service period or accept reduced loan repayment. Language prohibiting NHSC National members' reappointment is deleted. The NHSC National Advisory Council's reappointment prohibition is removed, and the maximum annual loan repayment amount is increased to $50,000. Teaching can now count as clinical practice for NHSC service, with up to 50% of time spent teaching eligible for NHSC service obligation. The Secretary must establish criteria for designating medically underserved populations and HPSAs through a rulemaking process. The Secretary must establish criteria for designating medically underserved populations and HPSAs. This section also amends IRC Sec. 108(f) to exclude from an individual's gross income any amount received under state loan repayment or forgiveness programs aimed at increasing health care services in underserved areas. The tax exclusion applies to amounts received after December 31, 2008. The ACA reauthorizes and expands primary care education programs, adds new programs for pediatric subspecialists, and establishes a grant program for community-based residency training. There are shortages of pediatric subspecialists, with financial reasons cited as a barrier to specialization. The salary difference between general pediatricians and subspecialists is small, while the difference between primary care physicians and specialists is significant. Some question the resources of community-based settings for training. The ACA includes a grant program for faculty and resources to establish residency programs in health centers. It also introduces a new program for training medical students interested in rural practice. Medical schools have implemented rural training programs to encourage students to practice in rural areas. Amendments require medical students receiving loan funds to practice in primary care for 10 years or until the loan is repaid, with penalties for non-compliance. The section authorizes grants to hospitals, medical schools, and other entities for primary care training programs. Funds are to be used for developing accredited training programs in family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics, as well as providing financial assistance to trainees. The Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance for traineeships and fellowships in primary care. Grants are awarded to schools of medicine for capacity building in primary care fields, with priority given to innovative clinical teaching approaches. $125 million is authorized for FY2010, with allocations for physician assistant training programs. The section authorizes $750,000 for each of FY2010 through FY2014 for programs integrating academic units in primary care fields. It amends PHSA Title VII, Part E by adding a new subpart for Recruitment and Retention Programs, creating a new PHSA Sec. 775 for Investment in Tomorrow's Pediatric Health Care Workforce. The Secretary is required to establish a pediatric specialty loan repayment program for eligible individuals working in pediatric medical specialties, pediatric surgery, or child and adolescent mental and behavioral health care. The program offers loan repayments up to $35,000 per year for individuals working in pediatric specialties or child and adolescent mental health in underserved areas. Eligible individuals must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, enrolled in an accredited graduate program, and have good academic standing. Funding is allocated for loan repayments for pediatric specialists and mental health professionals. Subsection 5508(a) of PHSA Title VII, Part C authorizes grants to teaching health centers for primary care residency training programs. Grants are awarded for up to three years with a maximum of $500,000. Grant funds are used for curriculum development and faculty support. The Secretary is required to give preference to applications with an existing affiliation agreement with an Area Health Education Center (AHEC) that sponsors projects to increase health personnel services in underserved communities. $25 million for FY2010, $50 million for FY2011 and FY2012, and SSAN for each fiscal year thereafter are authorized to be appropriated. No more than $5 million annually may be used for technical assistance program grants. Subsection 5508(c) adds a new Subpart XI, Support of Graduate Medical Education in Qualified Teaching Health Centers, creating a Program of Payments to Teaching Health Centers for Graduate Medical Education. The new section, Sec. 340H, establishes a Program of Payments to Teaching Health Centers for the expansion of approved graduate medical residency training programs. It outlines how direct and indirect payments are calculated, limits funding for full-time equivalent residents, and specifies that these payments are in addition to those made to teaching hospitals. The section establishes a Program of Payments to Teaching Health Centers for graduate medical residency training programs. It outlines reporting requirements, audits, payment reductions for non-compliance, and grants for rural physician training. The Secretary is authorized to audit THCs and reduce payments by 25% for non-reporting. Additionally, grants are awarded to medical schools for training students in underserved rural communities. The section authorizes grants for medical schools to establish rural-focused training programs for students practicing in underserved rural communities. Priority is given to schools with a record of training in rural areas or partnerships with rural communities. Grantees must use funds to supplement existing resources and maintain expenditures at or above previous levels. The Secretary will define \"underserved rural community\" within 60 days of enactment. $4 million is authorized for each year. The section authorizes $100 million for FY2010 for debt service, construction, or renovation of a hospital affiliated with a state's public medical and dental school. The Secretary can only release funds upon receipt of an application from a state governor meeting specific requirements. ACA addresses concerns about dental services for disadvantaged populations, with Medicaid-enrolled children facing limited access to care due to provider availability. HRSA recommended federal programs support dental training in a 2005 report. The HRSA recommended expanding federal programs supporting dental workforce, addressing student debt and faculty support. Dental school debt increased by 55% from 1996 to 2006, leading to more graduates choosing specialties. ACA implements changes to promote primary care dentistry training, including loan repayment for students and faculty. Programs aim to expand workforce for underserved areas through alternative care providers. The section establishes programs to support dental care providers, including grants for training and financial assistance. It also introduces a faculty loan repayment program for individuals serving as full-time faculty in specified dental fields. Eligible entities include dental and dental hygiene schools. Entities eligible for programs include dental and dental hygiene schools, approved residency or advanced educational programs, and partnerships with schools of public health for master's-level training in public health. Priority is given to qualified applicants, especially those with a record of providing care in underserved areas or to populations experiencing health disparities. The section authorizes $30 million for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011-FY2015 to train alternative dental health care providers for underserved communities. Eligible entities include institutions of higher education, public-private partnerships, FQHCs, and Indian Health Service facilities. The Secretary is authorized to award 15 grants of not less than $4 million over a five-year period for training alternative dental health care providers in underserved communities. The grants can be awarded to various entities such as FQHCs, Indian Health Service facilities, public hospitals, and other specified organizations. The section also requires a study by the Institute of Medicine on access to dental health care and does not prohibit IHS-approved dental health aide training programs from being eligible for grants. The National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) reports a projected shortage of 10,000 nurses by 2020 due to the increasing complexity of the healthcare environment. Nursing workforce development programs under PHSA Title VIII fund grants for nursing education in various areas. The ACA expands these programs to address concerns raised by experts and aims to enhance the skill level of the nursing workforce. The ACA aims to enhance the skill level of the nursing workforce by increasing loan amounts for advanced practice nurses and family nurse practitioners. Loan funds have been increased from $2,500 to $3,300 annually for FY2010 and FY2011, with final two-year amounts raised to $5,200 per year. Financial need is now a criterion for receiving loans after 2000, and partial loan cancellation is available for recipients working as full-time nurses in public or nonprofit settings. Additionally, separate authorizations have been established for nurse practitioner and nurse midwifery programs under PHSA Sec. 811. The section amends PHSA Sec. 831 by renaming the grant program to Nurse Education, Practice, and Quality Grants, and establishes expanded grant eligibility criteria for nurse midwifery programs. It also deletes the prohibition on obligating more than 10% of traineeships for individuals in doctoral programs. Additionally, it adds a new section, PHSA Sec. 831A, for Nurse Retention Grants, authorizing funding for eligible recipients. PHSA Sec. 831A authorizes Nurse Retention Grants for eligible entities to support nurse retention and promotion programs, with a focus on enhancing patient care related to nursing activities. Funding preference is given to entities that have not previously received grants, address high-priority areas, and for FY2010 through FY2012. Additionally, eligibility for nursing student loan repayment and scholarship programs is expanded to individuals who agree to serve as nurse faculty at accredited schools of nursing for two years or more. The section includes amendments to PHSA Title VIII, renaming the nurse faculty loan program and increasing the annual loan limit. Priority is given to doctoral nursing students, with funding authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. Additionally, a new section authorizes loan repayment agreements for eligible individuals serving as nurse faculty at accredited schools of nursing. The section authorizes loan repayment agreements for eligible individuals to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty. Recipients must serve as faculty for at least four years at an accredited nursing school. Annual loan limits are set at $10,000 for master's degree holders and $20,000 for doctoral degree holders, with aggregate limits of $40,000 and $80,000 respectively for FY2010 and FY2011. Loan limits will be adjusted for cost-of-attendance increases in subsequent years. The section authorizes loan repayment agreements for eligible individuals to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty. Recipients must serve as faculty for at least four years at an accredited nursing school. Annual loan limits are set at $10,000 for master's degree holders and $20,000 for doctoral degree holders, with aggregate limits of $40,000 and $80,000 respectively for FY2010 and FY2011. Loan limits will be adjusted for cost-of-attendance increases in subsequent years. Additionally, the section establishes a graduate nurse education demonstration program in Medicare, where up to five eligible hospitals will receive Medicare reimbursement for clinical training costs for advanced practice nurses. Advanced practice nurses include clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. Advance practice nurses will receive training in clinical skills for primary care, preventive care, chronic care management, and other nursing services for Medicare-eligible population. Clinical training will occur in non-hospital settings, with waivers for rural or underserved areas. Medicare payments are capped based on training costs attributed to increased enrollment in qualified programs. $50 million is appropriated for FY2012-FY2015 to support this initiative. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program to provide nurse practitioners with 12 months of training for primary care careers in FQHCs and NMHCs. Eligible facilities will receive grants to create a training model, with preference given to bilingual candidates. Grants may not exceed $600,000 per year, and technical assistance will be provided by experienced facilities. The IOM has raised concerns about the geriatric workforce's skills to care for an aging population and the lack of training for direct care workers in geriatric medicine. PHSA Titles VII and VIII include programs to train healthcare professionals in geriatric care, and the ACA establishes new programs for geriatric training based on IOM recommendations. The new PHSA Sec. 747A establishes a grant program to provide training opportunities for direct care workers in long-term care settings. Eligible entities must use grant funds to provide tuition assistance for individuals enrolled in geriatrics courses. Recipients must work in geriatrics or related fields for at least two years. The PHSA Sec. 753 amendment authorizes grants for geriatric workforce development programs, offering training in geriatrics, chronic care management, and long-term care. Funding of $10.8 million is allocated for FY2011 through FY2014, with each award totaling $150,000 for qualified entities operating Geriatric Education Centers. The second subsection of the amendment creates incentive grants for health professionals in geriatrics, long-term care, and chronic care management. Recipients must teach or practice in these fields for five years. $10 million is allocated for this program from FY2011 to FY2013. Eligibility for geriatric academic career awards is expanded to faculty at accredited health professions schools. Award recipients must meet targets and use funds to supplement existing resources. New traineeships are established for individuals preparing for advanced roles. Sec. 855 establishes traineeships for individuals preparing for advanced degrees in geriatric nursing or other nursing areas specializing in elder care. It authorizes appropriations for FY2010 through FY2014.

The second project allocates funds for grants to states to develop training programs for personal or home care aides. $85 million is appropriated for demonstration projects from FY2010 to FY2014, with $5 million designated for FY2010 to FY2012. No funds can be used for the project after FY2012. Subsection 5507(b) amends SSA Sec. 501(c) by appropriating $5 million for FY2009 for workforce training grants. Sec. 501(c) appropriates $5 million for FY2009 for special projects supporting family-to-family health information centers. ACA allocates $5 million annually from FY2009 to FY2012 for these centers. It establishes a Personal Care Attendants Workforce Advisory Panel to address workforce issues. PHSA authorizes the Secretary to provide grants for public health workforce development programs. The ACA reauthorizes and creates new programs for public health training, including a loan repayment program for health professionals working in public health agencies. Recipients must serve for at least three years, with an annual repayment cap of $35,000 or one-third of total debt. $195 million is authorized for FY2010. The ACA reauthorizes and creates new programs for public health training, including a loan repayment program for health professionals. It authorizes $195 million for FY2010 and establishes grants for scholarships and community health worker programs. The ACA reauthorizes and creates new programs for public health training, including guidelines for training and supervision of community health workers (CHWs). It authorizes funding for CDC public health training fellowships in epidemiology, laboratory science, and informatics, as well as the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) and other training programs. States can receive federal assistance for loan repayment programs for participants in these training programs. The ACA establishes a new PHSA Title II, Part D, \"United States Public Health Sciences Track,\" at selected academic sites. It emphasizes team-based service, public health, epidemiology, and emergency preparedness. The U.S. Surgeon General administers the track, selecting students and providing funding for tuition and stipends for up to four years. Students have service obligations under specified requirements. The ACA establishes a new PHSA Title II, Part D, \"United States Public Health Sciences Track,\" at selected academic sites. The U.S. Surgeon General administers the track, providing funding for tuition and stipends for up to four years, with service obligations in the USPHS Commissioned Corps. New PHSA Sec. 274 requires the Secretary to transfer funds for training and responding to public health emergencies. Eligible entities for grants or contracts include accredited schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, public health, hospitals, and health departments. The USPHS Commissioned Corps is a branch of the U.S. uniformed services, based in HHS under the authority of the U.S. Surgeon General. Officers serve in federal agencies or state/international agencies to support public health activities. ACA eliminates the cap on Regular Corps officers. The ACA eliminates the cap on Regular Corps officers and establishes a Ready Reserve Corps for intermittent deployment in public health missions. The Ready Reserve Corps officers are expected to be drawn mainly from professionals in the private sector. The section amends P.L. 102-394 to eliminate the cap on Regular Corps officers and establishes a Ready Reserve Corps for active-duty officers in the USPHS Reserve Corps. It authorizes appropriations for recruitment, training, and the Ready Reserve Corps. The IOM has concerns about the diversity of the healthcare workforce. The PHSA Title VII and ACA aim to increase diversity in the healthcare workforce, with research showing better outcomes for patients treated by providers of their own racial background. ACA also expands programs to improve health services in underserved communities. This section of the PHSA requires the Secretary to support the development of research, projects, and curricula for cultural competency, reducing health disparities, and working with individuals with disabilities. Collaboration with specified entities is mandated, as well as evaluation and implementation of the curricula into quality measurement systems. The goal is to make these resources available through the Internet. The section of the PHSA mandates support for research, projects, and curricula on cultural competency, reducing health disparities, and working with individuals with disabilities. It requires collaboration with specified entities, evaluation, and implementation of curricula into quality measurement systems, with resources to be made available online. Authorized appropriations are specified for various programs under the PHSA. This section of the PHSA increases the annual limit on loan repayment amounts to $30,000 and authorizes appropriations for scholarships, loan repayments, fellowships, and educational assistance for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. It also includes schools offering physician assistant education programs in specified health professions schools and expands the Area Health Education Centers program. The new section of the PHSA authorizes infrastructure development grants for AHEC programs and point-of-service maintenance grants. It requires a non-federal match, sets a minimum award of $250,000, and authorizes $125 million for FY2010 through FY2014. Congress emphasizes the importance of every state having an AHEC program. Additionally, it introduces a new section for Continuing Educational Support for Health Professionals Serving in Underserved Communities, providing grants for innovative education activities.

ACA also expands diversity grants to include stipends for nurses entering bridge programs, scholarships for accelerated nursing degrees, and advanced education preparation. It includes consultation with NACNEP and nursing associations, and extends eligibility for education loan forgiveness to allied health professionals. The loan forgiveness program now includes allied health professionals like audiologists, nutritionists, and therapists working in various healthcare settings. Eligible individuals must be employed full-time in federal, state, local, or tribal public health agencies, acute care facilities, or in areas recognized as medically underserved. The term \"allied health professional\" is defined as someone with a degree or certificate in allied health professions from an institution of higher education. The ACA creates a new grant program for training mental and behavioral health providers to address the shortage of providers, especially in rural areas. This amendment authorizes grants for Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training. The ACA establishes a grant program for Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training. Grants are awarded to institutions of higher education for social work and psychology programs, as well as state-licensed mental health organizations for training paraprofessionals. Priority is given to accredited programs with high graduation rates and the ability to recruit in high-need areas. At least four grant recipients must be historically black colleges or universities or other minority-serving institutions. The grant program for Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training prioritizes institutions focusing on vulnerable groups and training child and adolescent mental health workers. Funding is allocated for training in social work and graduate psychology. The ACA allocates funding for training in social work, graduate psychology, professional child and adolescent mental health, and paraprofessional child and adolescent mental health. It establishes a National Health Care Workforce Commission for comprehensive workforce planning to address concerns about the current health professions workforce. The ACA establishes a National Health Care Workforce Commission to evaluate and address the current health professions workforce. It also creates a National Center for Health Care Workforce Analysis and a federal task force on Alaska health care delivery. The Commission, composed of 15 members appointed by the U.S. Comptroller General, focuses on evaluating and meeting the need for health care workers. The Commission, consisting of 15 members appointed by the U.S. Comptroller General, is mandated to recognize effective health care career pathways, disseminate information on best practices, review workforce supply and demand, make recommendations on national priorities and policies, and submit annual reports to Congress and the Administration. The section establishes a competitive health care workforce development grants program to finance education and training for careers in health care, improve workers' safety and health, and assess reports from the NCHWA. HRSA administers the program, provides technical assistance, and reports performance information to the Commission. Planning grants are authorized for $8 million for FY2010 and subsequent fiscal years. The section authorizes appropriations for the National Center for Health Care Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) and State and Regional Centers for Health Workforce Analysis. Funding amounts include $7.5 million for NCHWA, $4.5 million for State and Regional Centers, and grants for longitudinal evaluations. Responsibilities of HRSA's existing National Center for Health Workforce Analysis must be transferred within 180 days of enactment. The section amends PHSA Sec. 791 to transfer responsibilities of HRSA's National Center for Health Workforce Analysis to the new NCHWA. It also requires preference in awarding grants to applicants using longitudinal evaluation data. Amendments include additional duties for various advisory committees and establish the Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska Task Force. The Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska Task Force, composed of federal officials, must submit a report to Congress with recommendations within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary is required to provide an annual report on activities related to health care workforce amendments. Medicare subsidizes medical residency training costs through direct graduate medical education payments to teaching hospitals. Medicare subsidizes medical residency training costs through direct graduate medical education (DGME) payments, covering resident salaries, supervisory physician salaries, and administrative expenses. Indirect medical education (IME) payments compensate teaching hospitals for higher patient care costs due to factors like sicker patients and inexperienced residents ordering more tests. IME adjustments are a percentage add-on to Medicare payments based on resident-to-bed ratio. Medicare DGME and IME payments totaling $9 billion were paid to over 1,100 teaching hospitals in 2008 to educate and train around 90,000 residents. GME payments are seen as a potential tool for shaping the physician workforce, but Medicare caps the number of residents used for payment calculations for individual hospitals. The cap on Medicare-supported residency slots was implemented in 1996 due to concerns of an oversupply of physicians. Now, there are worries about a shortage of physicians, leading to calls for additional residency slots. The ACA aims to redistribute unused slots and preserve positions from closed hospitals, focusing on training in primary care or general surgery. Medicare allows teaching hospitals to receive payments for residents rotating in nonhospital settings if they are providing patient care. Hospitals can receive payments for residents training in nonhospital settings if they are providing patient care and the hospital covers most of the training costs. Time spent on non-patient care activities is not included in payment calculations. There are regulatory restrictions on rotations in nonhospital settings, but experts see value in residents gaining experience in such settings. Residency programs are primarily based in acute-care teaching hospitals, but there is a push for residents to gain experience in nonhospital settings like community health centers. Research shows that residents who train in health centers are more likely to serve underserved populations. Criteria have been established to redistribute unused residency positions to qualifying hospitals, with a limit of 75 additional residents per hospital. Qualifying hospitals can receive additional residency positions, with a requirement to maintain primary care residents and prioritize primary care or general surgery. Factors considered include filling speed and rural training tracks. Residency positions are allocated based on state ratios, HPSA percentage, and rural location. Payments for redistributed positions are based on existing residency payments. The section outlines how residency positions are allocated based on existing payments, with all time spent by residents in patient care activities counting towards payments. Hospitals incurring costs for stipends and benefits must count a proportional share of resident training time. Time spent in nonhospital settings also counts towards payments, with multiple hospitals sharing costs based on training time. The ACA requires resident time spent in non-patient care activities in nonhospital settings to count towards DGME and IME payments. It also mandates counting vacation, sick leave, and approved leave time. The Secretary is directed to establish a process for redistributing medical residency slots.

The Primary Care Extension Program, established under PHSA Sec. 399V-1, aims to support and educate primary care providers on preventive medicine, chronic disease management, mental health services, and evidence-based therapies. Health Extension Agents, local health workers, assist practices in quality improvement, patient-centered care, and connecting to health resources. The Primary Care Extension Program State Hubs award competitive grants to states to establish agencies that assist primary care providers in implementing patient-centered medical homes, developing learning communities, participating in a national network, and creating a plan for financial sustainability. The section authorizes grants for entities to develop Hub implementation plans and provides funding for coordinated care projects for individuals with mental illness and chronic diseases. Additional support may be given based on program evaluations. Funding amounts are specified for FY2011 to FY2014. The Secretary awards grants for coordinated services in mental and behavioral health settings for special populations. Grantees must provide specific services and submit an evaluation within 90 days of grant expiration. $50 million is authorized for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011 to FY2014. The Secretary awards grants for coordinated services in mental and behavioral health settings for special populations. Grantees must provide specific services and submit an evaluation within 90 days of grant expiration. A new PHSA Sec. 340H authorizes grants for Community-Based Collaborative Care Networks (CCNs) to provide comprehensive health care services for low-income populations. CCNs must include a safety net hospital and all FQHCs in the community. Grant funds can be used for various services including case management, health outreach, transportation, capacity expansion, and direct patient care. The Secretary is authorized to limit grant funding for direct care services provided by HRSA grantees. A new PHSA Sec. 520B establishes Centers of Excellence for Depression, awarding grants to eligible entities to establish national centers for treating depressive disorders. The Secretary must establish up to 20 centers within one year of enactment and up to 30 centers by September 30, 2016. The Secretary must establish up to 30 Centers of Excellence for Depression by September 30, 2016. Each center must make non-federal contributions and carry out specified activities, including developing treatment standards and expanding research. The coordinating center must maintain a national database and issue performance report cards for recommendations on improvements. The Secretary must make recommendations to centers and Congress for improvements and expansion. An independent review will evaluate the network of centers. $100 million is authorized for FY2011-FY2015, and $150 million for FY2016-FY2020. Allocation for each center is determined by the Secretary. Federal and state governments share responsibility for quality care in nursing homes. Congress established quality requirements for Medicare-certified SNFs and Medicaid-certified NFs before ACA. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA87) established quality requirements for Medicare-certified SNFs and Medicaid-certified NFs, defining standards for receiving payment. OBRA87 included sanctions for facilities not meeting federal standards, such as civil money penalties and payment denial. CMS contracts with state governments to enforce SNF and NF quality requirements. State and federal responsibilities for enforcing SNF and NF quality requirements are carried out through CMS contracts with state survey agencies. State agencies follow federal regulations for inspections, but have autonomy in certain survey activities and policies. State surveyors propose sanctions for deficiencies, which are reviewed and implemented by CMS regional office officials. Prior to the ACA, there were no standardized complaint forms required by law, but mechanisms were in place to ensure nursing facilities met minimum patient safety standards. The mechanisms to ensure nursing facilities meet patient safety and quality standards include standard surveys every 15 months and complaint investigations for specific allegations. Complaints can be filed verbally, via hotline, or in writing. Standard reporting forms are not provided for complaints. The ACA's nursing home transparency and enforcement provisions enhance quality and accountability requirements for nursing facilities. State survey agencies may involve law enforcement in cases of resident abuse, and maintain a registry of nurse aides with records of abuse, neglect, or theft. The ACA's nursing home transparency and accountability provisions require SNFs and NFs to disclose ownership, implement ethics programs, report staff expenditures, develop a standardized complaint form, update Nursing Home Compare website, and impose CMPs for deficient care. GAO will study CMS's Five-Star Quality Rating System, and new requirements are established for informing stakeholders of planned facility closures. The ACA requires SNFs and NFs to disclose ownership details, expand nurse aide training requirements, and provide information on ownership interests to the Secretary or state agency. This includes disclosing organizational structures and relationships with subcontractors. The ACA requires SNFs and NFs to disclose ownership details and expand nurse aide training requirements. The Secretary must ensure facilities report accountability information in standard formats. Compliance and ethics training programs were mandated by ACA Sec. 6102, with regulations issued by March 23, 2012. A report to Congress on the impact of these programs is due by March 23, 2015. CMS created the Nursing Home Compare website to enhance transparency. CMS developed the Nursing Home Compare (NH Compare) website to improve SNF and NF quality of care for LTC consumers. The website includes national data on nursing facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid, with facility ratings, survey results, and staffing information. Sec. 6103 requires enhanced information on the website for SNFs and NFs, including reporting expenditures for direct care staff wages and benefits. The ACA requires SNFs to report expenditures for wages and benefits for direct care staff on facility cost reports, categorized by different staff types. The Secretary consulted with experts to redesign reports for capturing these expenditures separately. SNFs must report these expenditures two years after ACA's enactment. The ACA requires the Secretary to categorize expenditure data from SNFs within specific timeframes. Additionally, the Secretary must develop a standardized form for quality-of-care complaints from SNF and NF residents. States must establish a complaint resolution process that includes tracking complaints and notifying complainants of receipt. The ACA requires standardized procedures for investigating quality-of-care complaints in SNFs and NFs, including deadlines for response and outcome notification. Changes effective March 23, 2011, also mandate electronic reporting of staffing information to the Secretary, specifying categories and types of staff. The ACA mandates electronic reporting of staffing information in nursing homes, including work categories, resident census data, turnover, and care hours per resident per day. Facilities must report in a uniform format, with data submitted electronically. The Medicare NH Compare website rates facilities from one to five stars based on quality, with five stars indicating superior care. ACA Sec. 6107 requires a GAO study on nursing home quality ratings. The ACA mandated a GAO study on the CMS nursing home Five-Star Quality Rating System, including implementation analysis, problems, and improvements. ACA Sec. 6111 allows additional CMPs for SNFs and NFs with quality-of-care issues, with a requirement for an independent dispute resolution process within 30 days of penalty citation. The Secretary may place CMPs in an escrow account for deficiencies cited at actual harm and immediate jeopardy levels. Monetary amounts collected are kept in interest-bearing escrow accounts pending appeal resolution. CMPs may be reduced for self-reported and corrected deficiencies within 10 days, except for repeat deficiencies in the past year. Regulations are required for these processes. The Secretary is required to issue regulations for appeals of deficiencies, allowing a portion of CMPs to fund activities benefiting residents. These activities include supporting resident and family councils, offsetting relocation costs, and improving facilities. CMP funds can also be used for facility improvement initiatives approved by the Secretary. These changes became effective on March 23, 2011. Within one year of enactment, a national independent monitoring demonstration program was developed to oversee SNFs and NFs chains for safety and quality-of-care deficiencies. Chains selected for participation are subject to oversight and root-cause analyses by an independent monitor. Chains must submit corrective action reports within 10 days of receiving recommendations. If a chain refuses to implement recommendations, they must provide reasons. The independent monitor oversees SNFs and NFs chains for safety and quality-of-care deficiencies. Chains are responsible for costs associated with the monitor. The Secretary can waive Medicare and Medicaid laws for the pilot program. HHS OIG will evaluate the program's feasibility for a permanent establishment. Facilities closing must notify residents, state, Secretary, and LTC ombudsman program 60 days in advance. A closure plan must be submitted and approved by the state, ensuring safe transfer of residents to suitable facilities. The Secretary notifies stakeholders if participation is terminated. No new residents can be admitted after closure date. The Secretary must be notified 60 days in advance of facility closure, with a plan for safe resident transfer. Payments will continue until residents are relocated. Non-compliance may result in sanctions and exclusion from federal programs. Demonstration projects will focus on culture change and information technology in SNFs and NFs. The Secretary awards grants for demonstration projects focusing on technology to improve resident care, especially for those with cognitive impairments. Training on dementia and abuse prevention is now required for SNFs and NFs staff. Funding is authorized for these projects. The new training requirements for in-service nurse aide training took effect on March 23, 2011. The Secretary is mandated to establish a nationwide program for background checks on direct patient access employees of long-term care facilities. Federal matching funds are provided to states for this purpose, similar to the Background Check Pilot program. The nationwide program requires agreements with newly selected states. The Secretary is required to establish a nationwide program for background checks on LTC providers' employees. The Secretary of the Treasury must transfer funds to HHS for this program, not exceeding $160 million for FY2010-FY2012. ACA expands on ARRA's provisions for comparative effectiveness research funding. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research, leading to the creation of the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (FCCCER) and a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identifying 100 high-priority health topics for research. FCCCER emphasized the importance of disseminating research findings and targeting priority populations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated funds for comparative effectiveness research, leading to the creation of FCCCER. Congress replaced FCCCER with PCORI, responsible for coordinating and supporting comparative clinical effectiveness research. PCORI evaluates health outcomes, clinical effectiveness, risks, and benefits of various healthcare interventions and strategies. The ACA establishes a trust fund to support research on pharmaceuticals, integrative health practices, and other treatment strategies. It introduces Comparative Clinical Effectiveness Research through the creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to improve the quality and relevance of clinical evidence for informed health decisions. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute conducts research on chronic conditions, quality of care, patient health, and national expenditures. It collaborates with federal agencies, academic institutions, and private sector entities. The Institute's board includes representatives from various groups, and expert advisory panels may be appointed to assist in research identification. The Institute appoints expert advisory panels to assist in research priorities and establishing the project agenda, including for clinical trials and rare diseases. A methodology committee, with members appointed by the Comptroller General, AHRQ, and NIH, is responsible for developing research standards and consulting with outside entities. The section outlines procedures for conflict-of-interest, data privacy, peer-review, and public availability of information. A new requirement mandates AHRQ to disseminate research findings, create information tools, and develop a database of government-funded evidence. Dissemination materials must identify researchers, describe methodology, and not include practice guidelines or recommendations for payment or treatment. Training of researchers and building data capacity are also required. The new SSA Sec. 1182 limits certain uses of evidence and findings from comparative effectiveness research. The Secretary can only use the findings for coverage determinations through a transparent process that includes public comment and considers the impact on subpopulations. Medicare coverage cannot be determined in a way that values extending the life of certain individuals less than others, or discourages treatment based on individual preferences for life extension versus risk. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) is established to fund the Institute and its activities. It will receive annual appropriations totaling $1.26 billion over FY2010-FY2019, additional funds from a new fee on health insurance policies and self-insured health plans, and transfers from the Medicare trust funds through FY2019. The Institute is prohibited from using values that discount the value of life due to disability when determining coverage. The new health insurance fee is determined by multiplying $2 by the average number of covered lives in a policy/plan year, updated annually by medical inflation. Transfers from the Medicare trust funds are calculated by multiplying $2 by the average number of Part A and Part B beneficiaries in a fiscal year, also updated annually by medical inflation. This section terminates the FCCCER and assigns coordinating activities to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Prior to the ACA, the federal government collected data on health disparities through various HHS agencies, but lacked coordination. Since 1999, HHS-funded surveys collect health disparities data following the Inclusion Policy, which includes race and ethnicity information. Medicare obtains beneficiary race and ethnicity data from the SSA through the SS-5 form, although there are compliance deficiencies. The SS-5 form collects beneficiary race and ethnicity data for Medicare, but there are accuracy and completeness deficiencies. MIPPA instructed the Secretary to evaluate approaches for collecting disparities data on Medicare beneficiaries and report to Congress with recommendations for reporting quality measures based on race, ethnicity, and sex. The MSIS is the primary source of state-reported data on Medicaid enrollees. The MSIS is the main source of state-reported data on Medicaid enrollees, including racial and ethnic information. States have discretion in collecting this data, but CMS requires standardized reporting. There is variation in the quantity and quality of reported data. Efforts are being made to collect and disseminate health statistics on the U.S. population, with the NCHS collecting data on illness, disability, economic impact, and health hazards. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is responsible for compiling national vital statistics and advising on health statistics collection in the U.S. It also ensures comparability and reliability of health data, provides technical assistance to jurisdictions, and addresses issues of confidentiality and data comparability. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions to enhance health care. The ACA mandates the collection and reporting of data on race, ethnicity, sex, primary language, and disability status in federally conducted health programs. It also requires the development of a system to collect data on key national indicators determined by the Secretary. The ACA mandates data collection on race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability status in federally supported health programs. It also requires the Secretary to develop a system for collecting data on key national indicators. The ACA mandates data collection on race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability status in federally supported health programs to generate statistically reliable estimates of subgroups. The Secretary is required to develop standards for measuring and collecting health disparities data, including other demographic data if necessary. Federal health care programs reporting quality measures must include data on individuals by race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability status. The ACA mandates data collection on health care disparities by race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability status. The Secretary is required to develop standards for data management and analysis, ensuring privacy and public reporting. Funding is authorized for data collection activities, with Medicaid and CHIP programs also required to meet these data collection standards. The subsection amends the CHIP and Medicaid statutes to require states to include health disparities data in their annual reports. It expands data collection to include race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability status for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries. The Secretary must evaluate approaches for collecting disparities data and report to Congress on improving healthcare identification. The Commission on Key National Indicators is established to oversee the key national indicator system, make recommendations for improvement, coordinate with data providers, and collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences. The Academy, in collaboration with the private sector, is tasked with establishing a key national indicator system. This involves selecting criteria, developing methodologies, maintaining a public website for access to indicators, and ensuring data quality through a quality assurance framework. The U.S. Comptroller General will conduct a study on previous work in this area. The U.S. Comptroller General is required to conduct a study on best practices for a national indicator system and submit it to Congress. $10 million is authorized for FY2010, and $7.5 million for each FY2011-FY2018. The Secretary must promote physician education on birth and death certificate data importance, encourage state adoption of standard revisions, and assist in vital statistics system re-engineering. (Note: Sec. 10407 discussed earlier under \"Prevention and Wellness\") HIPAA's Administrative Simplification provisions instructed the Secretary to adopt electronic format and data standards for specified administrative and financial transactions in the healthcare system. This includes patient eligibility inquiry, reimbursement claims, claims status inquiry, payment and remittance advice, and coordination of benefits. In 2000, CMS issued initial standards for seven transactions and coordination of benefits. The Secretary adopted electronic format and data standards for healthcare transactions, including patient eligibility, reimbursement claims, claims status, payment, and coordination of benefits. The code sets required under HIPAA include ICD-9-CM for diagnoses and inpatient procedures, with an updated deadline of January 1, 2012. Providers were required to switch to ICD-10 codes by October 1, 2013, which was later extended to October 1, 2014, in response to concerns. The ACA mandates the adoption of operating rules for electronic transactions in healthcare, including EFT for payment. Providers face challenges with plan-specific requirements and companion guides, leading to customization on a plan-by-plan basis. The goal is to address variability and streamline the process. In 2001, Congress mandated Medicare claims to be submitted electronically in the HIPAA standard format. Providers can choose to submit HIPAA transactions electronically, but must comply with the standard. CMS proposed a standard for health care claims attachments in 2005. The ACA amends SSA Sec. 1173 to establish a timeline for the development, adoption, and implementation of operating rules for HIPAA transactions. These rules must enable determination of an individual's eligibility and financial responsibility for specific services. The ACA amends SSA Sec. 1173 to establish operating rules for HIPAA transactions, ensuring eligibility and financial responsibility determination for services. Operating rules are defined as necessary business rules for electronic information exchange, with EFT for health claims payment included. The Secretary must adopt EFT standards by January 1, 2012, to take effect by January 1, 2014. The ACA establishes operating rules for HIPAA transactions, including eligibility and financial responsibility determination. Rules for different transactions must be adopted by specific dates, with a committee tasked to review and provide recommendations for updating and improving the standards and operating rules. The committee must submit recommendations to the Secretary, who must adopt them within 90 days. Health plans must certify compliance with current standards for various transactions by specific deadlines. The Secretary can designate an entity to verify compliance and conduct audits to ensure standards are maintained. The Secretary must conduct audits to ensure health plans comply with standards and operating rules. Penalty fees are assessed for noncompliance, with deadlines for payment and collection by the Treasury Secretary. Unpaid fees accrue interest and are considered debts owed to federal agencies. The section requires the Secretary to establish a unique health plan identifier and adopt transaction standards for health claims attachments. Medicare payments must be made electronically as of January 1, 2014. The Secretary is also required to conduct audits to ensure compliance with standards and operating rules, with penalty fees for noncompliance. The Secretary is required to solicit input from various stakeholders on developing standards for other administrative and financial transactions, including electronic enrollment of health care providers, extending HIPAA standards to other programs, standardizing financial audits, improving claim edits, and potentially requiring health plans to comply with certain requirements. The Secretary is required to convene a meeting to receive stakeholder input on revisions to ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, make appropriate revisions, and publish the revised crosswalk on the CMS website. Additionally, a new section adds provisions for the Secretary to consult with stakeholders and post crosswalks between previous and subsequent versions of ICD codes on the CMS website. The Secretary, within 180 days of enactment, must develop interoperable standards for enrollment in health and human services programs, including electronic matching, simplification of documentation, online eligibility management, and notification functionalities. States must be notified of these requirements. The Secretary must develop interoperable standards for enrollment in health and human services programs, including electronic matching and online eligibility management functionalities. States and other entities may be required to incorporate these standards as a condition for receiving federal HIT funds. Grants will be awarded to states and localities to implement the enrollment standards, with grantees required to submit adoption and implementation plans. The IOM issued reports in 2006 on the state of the U.S. emergency medical system, focusing on hospital-based emergency departments. The IOM reports in 2006 highlighted deficiencies in the U.S. emergency care system, including overcrowded emergency departments, regional variations in services, and workforce shortages. ACA amendments address these issues by implementing recommendations to improve emergency and trauma care, designating the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response as the lead office within HHS. The ACA includes provisions to improve emergency and trauma care, such as designating the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response as the lead office within HHS, authorizing grants for regionalized trauma care systems, allocating funds to facilities with high uncompensated care burdens, and enhancing the emergency care workforce. Additionally, the ACA aims to reduce the number of uninsured individuals through changes to the private health insurance system and Medicaid expansion, which can impact the emergency medical system. Challenges faced by the emergency care system, particularly hospital emergency departments, include providing care to the uninsured under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide treatment to stabilize emergency conditions or transfer patients if necessary. It also prohibits discrimination and delays in treatment, with protections for whistleblowers. Uncompensated care for the uninsured in emergency departments can strain hospital finances and hinder access to emergency care. This section amends PHSA Sec. 1203 to rename it Competitive Grants for Trauma Systems for the Improvement of Trauma Care and transfers administration to the Assistant Secretary. The section amends PHSA Sec. 1204 to award contracts or grants for pilot projects to improve regional coordination of emergency services. Grantees must propose projects to enhance emergency medical and trauma systems, with a required match of funds. Priority is given to entities in medically underserved areas, and grantees must submit a detailed evaluation of the project within 90 days. The Secretary is tasked with disseminating the evaluation information as needed. The section authorizes $24 million for trauma care grant programs annually from FY2010 to FY2014. It transfers grant administration authority to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and directs the Secretary to expand research on emergency medical care systems and their economic impact. Additionally, it amends existing provisions in the Public Health Service Act. The section authorizes $24 million annually for trauma care grant programs from FY2010 to FY2014. It replaces existing provisions with new language requiring the Secretary to establish three programs awarding grants to qualified trauma centers for uncompensated care costs, core missions, and emergency relief. Eligibility for grants is based on trauma care system participation, with a maximum grant amount of $2 million per fiscal year. Qualified trauma centers are categorized based on the percentage of charity, self-pay, and Medicaid patients for grant eligibility. Trauma centers are eligible for grants covering a percentage of their uncompensated care costs based on their category. Preference is given to centers in areas where trauma care availability is declining. Grantees must maintain access to trauma care services and provide data to a national registry. The section authorizes $24 million annually for trauma care grant programs from FY2010 to FY2014. The section authorizes funding for trauma care grants based on ACS guidelines, with $100 million appropriated for FY2009 and subsequent years. Seventy percent of the funding is allocated for uncompensated care awards, with a biennial report required. New definitions for \"uncompensated care costs\" and grants for trauma-related physician specialties are included. Funding distribution among states is determined by annual appropriations. The distribution of grant funds for trauma care is based on the program's annual appropriation level. If the appropriation is less than $10 million, funds are distributed among states with trauma centers providing uncompensated care. A new section authorizes $100 million for state grants annually from FY2010 to FY2015. Additionally, there are appropriations of $25 million for FY2010, $26.3 million for FY2011, $27.6 million for FY2012, $28.9 million for FY2013, and $30.4 million for FY2014. The NIH established the Pain Consortium to enhance pain research and collaboration among researchers. The ACA addresses advancing research and treatment for pain care management, requiring the Secretary to convene an IOM Conference on Pain and encouraging the NIH Director to continue and expand pain research through the Pain Consortium. The ACA establishes provisions for advancing pain research through the Pain Consortium and a health professionals training program. It requires the Secretary to convene a Conference on Pain to address pain recognition as a public health issue, with a report to be submitted to Congress. Funding is authorized for FY2010 and FY2011. Additionally, a new PHSA Sec. 409J encourages the NIH Director to continue and expand research on pain causes and treatments through the Pain Consortium. The Pain Consortium recommends pain research initiatives annually to the NIH Director. The Secretary must establish the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee to coordinate pain research efforts. A new program authorizes training health professionals in pain care, with funding for education and training programs. The Pain Consortium recommends annual pain research initiatives to the NIH Director. The Secretary must establish the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee to coordinate research efforts. Award applicants must include information on assessing, diagnosing, treating, and managing pain, laws on controlled substances, interdisciplinary approaches to pain care, barriers to care in underserved populations, and recent developments in pain care. Funding is authorized for training health professionals in pain care. The ACA addresses abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at the federal level. The Elder Justice Act is incorporated into health reform legislation at the federal level to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly. This legislation emphasizes public health and social service approaches to prevent, detect, and treat elder abuse, placing it on par with similar laws for child abuse and domestic violence. Hundreds of thousands of older Americans are affected by mistreatment in domestic and institutional settings every year, but the exact number is unknown. Efforts to collect data on elder abuse at the national level are hindered by state variations in definitions, making it hard to identify abuse and neglect. An estimated 1-2 million Americans aged 65 and older have experienced mistreatment, with many incidents going unreported. Congressional interest in addressing elder abuse has spanned over a quarter of a century, leading to the incorporation of the Elder Justice Act into health reform legislation. The Elder Justice Act, part of the ACA, aims to combat abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly through a coordinated federal effort combining law enforcement, public health, and social services. It includes provisions for elder abuse prevention and protection activities, such as the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. The Elder Justice Act provisions under ACA include renaming SSA Title XX, establishing an Elder Justice Coordinating Council, and creating a national nurse aide registry. The Elder Justice Act provisions under ACA include establishing an Elder Justice Coordinating Council in the Office of the Secretary, with the Secretary as chair and the U.S. Attorney General and heads of federal departments as members. The Council is required to submit reports to Congress every two years detailing its activities and challenges, and make recommendations for legislation and model laws. The Elder Justice Act provisions under ACA establish an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation to create a plan for elder justice development and make recommendations to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. The Advisory Board must have 27 members with expertise in prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. They are required to submit reports on federal, state, and local elder justice activities to Congress every 18 months. The Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation is authorized to receive funding for its functions and research protections guidelines are required to assist researchers in the areas of elder abuse. $6.5 million is authorized for FY2011 and $7.0 million for each subsequent year. Subpart B authorizes funding for Elder Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation Forensic Centers to establish and operate stationary and mobile centers. Grants are awarded to develop forensic expertise in elder abuse. Funding of $4 million for FY2011, $6 million for FY2012, and $8 million for FY2013 and FY2014 is authorized. Part II establishes grant programs and activities to promote elder justice. Sec. 2041 requires the Secretary to provide incentives for individuals to train for employment in LTC, award grants for training programs and EHR technology, and adopt electronic standards for clinical data exchange in LTC facilities. The Secretary is required to adopt electronic standards for clinical data exchange in LTC facilities and provide funding for APS offices to investigate elder abuse. Funding of $20 million for FY2011, $17.5 million for FY2012, and $15 million for each of FY2013 and FY2014 is authorized for these activities. The section authorizes funding for the Department of Justice to develop best practices, provide training, conduct research, and offer technical assistance for Adult Protective Services (APS). It also establishes grant programs to enhance APS programs and fund demonstration programs. Funding of $3 million for FY2011 and $4 million for FY2012 through FY2014 is authorized, along with $100 million annually for APS program grants and $25 million for demonstration grants. The section authorizes funding for the Department of Justice to develop best practices, provide training, conduct research, and offer technical assistance for Adult Protective Services (APS). It also establishes grant programs to enhance APS programs and fund demonstration programs. Funding of $3 million for FY2011 and $4 million for FY2012 through FY2014 is authorized, along with $100 million annually for APS program grants and $25 million for demonstration grants. Sec. 2043 requires the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities with expertise in abuse and neglect in LTC facilities or state LTC ombudsman programs to improve capacity, conduct pilot programs, and provide support. It authorizes $5 million for FY2011, $7.5 million for FY2012, and $10 million for each of FY2013 and FY2014. Sec. 2044 establishes programs to provide and improve ombudsman training on elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, authorizing $10 million for each of FY2011 through FY2014. Sec. 2044 authorizes $10 million for each of FY2011 through FY2014 for grants under Part II, requiring applicants to provide information for evaluation. A portion of funds must be reserved for validated evaluations of funded activities. Sec. 2044 authorizes $10 million for grants under Part II for FY2011-FY2014, with funds reserved for evaluations. Sec. 2045 requires the Secretary to conduct evaluations and grant audits. Sec. 2046 clarifies that Subtitle B does not limit state law actions or create private causes of action. The amendment to a state's TANF state plan on assisting individuals in training for employment in LTC facilities or elder care occupations took effect on January 1, 2011. It also establishes a National Training Institute for Surveyors and reporting requirements for crimes in federally funded LTC facilities. The amendment authorizes appropriations for activities related to Medicare or Medicaid participating facilities, including grants for state survey agencies. It also requires reporting of crimes in federally funded LTC facilities receiving over $10,000 annually. The amendment mandates LTC facilities to report any suspicion of a crime against residents or individuals receiving care, with penalties for failure to report. Retaliation against employees for reporting is prohibited, with penalties for facilities that retaliate. Facilities must post employee rights prominently. The ACA mandates a study on establishing a national nurse aide registry, with funding not to exceed $500,000. It also impacts various stages of medical product development, including basic biomedical research supported by NIH and other federal agencies. The ACA includes provisions to support biomedical research for developing medical products, such as a temporary tax credit and funding for the Cures Acceleration Network. FDA ensures product safety and effectiveness, with regulations that may impact product quality, cost, and consumer access. The FDA regulates medical products, including requirements for additional health benefit and risk information in labeling and advertisements for prescription drugs. A provision allows generic drugs to seek FDA approval more easily if the brand-name drug changes its labeling within 60 days of the generic's approval. Another provision enables biosimilar biological products to enter the market. The ACA may increase the demand for medical products, with provisions for generating tax revenue from prescription drugs and medical devices. The ACA introduces a new tax credit program for small companies investing in qualifying therapeutic discovery projects. Companies with 250 or fewer employees can apply for tax credits covering 50% of research investments made in 2009 or 2010, up to a total of $5 million per company. The program is capped at $1 billion and aims to incentivize innovation in medical research. The tax credit program introduced by the ACA offers small companies with 250 or fewer employees the opportunity to receive tax credits covering 50% of research investments made in 2009 or 2010, up to $5 million per company. The program is capped at $1 billion and aims to incentivize innovation in medical research through three types of qualifying therapeutic discovery projects. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary, is directed to establish a program to consider and award certifications for qualified investments eligible for a new credit for projects that aim to develop new therapies, reduce healthcare costs, or advance the goal of curing cancer. The program aims to create high-quality jobs and advance U.S. competitiveness in life sciences. The new tax credit certification process requires an application to the Treasury Secretary, who must respond within 30 days. Companies can opt for grants instead of the tax credit, with restrictions on the amount. Certain expenditures are excluded from eligibility, such as facility maintenance and employee remuneration. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to establish the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) to support the development of treatments for rare diseases or conditions with inadequate market incentives. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health can accept charitable gifts to support CAN. The Director will award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to carry out CAN's purposes. The ACA establishes the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) to support the development of treatments for rare diseases. The Director will award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to accelerate the development of high need cures, providing up to $15 million for the first year with a matching requirement. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) aims to support revolutionary advances in basic research and facilitate FDA review for CAN-funded cures. A CAN Review Board will advise the Director on activities and barriers to translating basic science into clinical applications. $500 million is authorized for FY2010, with subsequent funding for future years. Other funds under the PHSA cannot be allocated to the CAN. The Secretary, through the FDA Commissioner, will determine the allocation of funds. The Secretary, through the FDA Commissioner, must determine if adding information about a prescription drug's health benefits and risks to its labeling and advertising would improve healthcare decision-making. This information would be in a standard format like a \"Drug Facts Box.\" The determination must be based on scientific evidence, research on decision-making, and consultations with stakeholders. If decision-making would be improved, regulations for implementation must be proposed within three years. Sec. 3511 of ACA allows the appropriation of SSAN for activities. Generic drugs seeking FDA approval must use the same labeling as the brand-name drug. ACA amends FFDCA Sec. 505(j) to approve a generic application with existing labeling if certain conditions are met. The ACA imposes annual fees on covered entities, such as manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, to be paid to the Treasury Secretary. The fee amounts authorized per year range from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion and are based on each entity's share of total prescription drug sales to specified government programs. The fees collected are transferred to the Medicare Part B trust fund. Covered entities pay annual fees based on their proportion of prescription drug sales to specified government programs. The fee amounts range from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion per year. Different percentages of drug sales are taken into account based on the sales amount. Multiple liable persons for a fee are jointly and severally liable for payment. The Treasury Secretary calculates the proportion to be paid by each covered entity. The new provision imposes a 2.3% sales tax on medical devices starting in 2013. Taxable devices are defined in FFDCA Sec. 201(h), excluding certain items like eyeglasses and hearing aids. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide guidance for implementation. The new provision imposes a 10% tax on indoor tanning services starting on July 1, 2010. Phototherapy services by licensed medical professionals are exempt from this tax. Providers must collect the tax from clients and submit it quarterly to the Treasury Secretary. The ACA establishes new FDA regulatory authority for biosimilars, creating a licensure pathway and authorizing fee collection. Biosimilars are similar to brand-name biologics, while generic drugs are identical to brand-name chemical drugs. Biologics are complex proteins made from living organisms, requiring special handling and usually administered via injection or infusion. The FDA regulates biosimilars, which are similar to brand-name biologics and are administered via injection or infusion. Additional clinical trials may be needed for FDA approval. Congressional interest in an expedited pathway for biosimilar licensure is driven by cost savings, similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act for generic chemical drugs in 1984. The generic drug industry saves costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. Brand-name biologics like Enbrel can be expensive. FDA approval of biosimilars may lead to market competition and price reduction. CBO estimates a $9.2 billion savings over 10 years with a regulatory pathway for biosimilars. The \"Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\" establishes a new regulatory pathway for FDA approval of biosimilars, defining them as highly similar to reference products with no clinically meaningful differences. The Secretary can determine if certain elements in the application for licensure are unnecessary, and interchangeability between reference and biosimilar products is assessed based on specific criteria. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 allows for interchangeable biological products to be substituted without the intervention of a healthcare provider. It provides a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product, during which the FDA cannot approve a follow-on version. If the reference product is designated as an orphan drug, a biosimilar or interchangeable product application cannot be filed until the later of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period or the 12-year exclusivity period. The first interchangeable biological product also receives a period of exclusive marketing. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 allows for interchangeable biological products to be substituted without the intervention of a healthcare provider. It provides a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product. The Secretary is authorized to publish proposed guidance for public comment on the licensure of a biological product. A process must be established for public input on issuing guidance. Patent infringement claims against an applicant for a biological product license are governed by a specific process. New processes are established for identifying disputed patents between reference product companies and biosimilar applicants. All biological product applications must be submitted under PHSA Sec. 351. For biological products approved under FFDCA Sec. 505, the approved application is deemed valid. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 allows for interchangeable biological products to be substituted without healthcare provider intervention. It provides a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product. The Secretary is authorized to develop recommendations for biosimilar product application review goals and user fees. Congress is expected to authorize a user fee program effective October 1, 2012, based on these recommendations. The Secretary must collect data on the cost of biosimilar product application review until October 1, 2010. The Secretary must conduct an audit of biosimilar product application review costs every two years after receiving the first user fee. An alteration of the user fee will be based on the audit results. Additional six months of data exclusivity is granted for new biologic drugs with pediatric studies conducted before FDA approval, and for existing biologic drugs with pediatric studies conducted upon request. The ACA title requires pediatric studies to be conducted and requests an extension at least nine months before the original exclusivity period expires. An IOM study will review pediatric testing of biological products and offer recommendations. The Secretary and Treasury Secretary will determine the amount saved to the federal government each fiscal year due to biosimilar approval pathway enactment, with savings used for deficit reduction. The ACA includes provisions for pediatric studies and requires nutrition labeling for foods sold in chain restaurants and vending machines to address rising obesity rates. This new requirement mandates disclosure of calorie content and daily caloric intake for standard menu items in establishments with 20 or more locations. The ACA mandates nutrition labeling for foods in chain restaurants and vending machines, requiring calorie disclosure for standard menu items. Vending machine operators with 20 or more machines must display calorie information for each food item. The Secretary must establish regulations for nutrient content disclosures and provide quarterly reports to Congress on progress towards final regulations. The section amends FFDCA Sec. 403A to preempt states and localities from establishing different nutrition labeling requirements. It also prohibits preempting state or local laws unless they create nutrition disclosures that would be required by this section. Under PHSA Sec. 340B, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the Medicaid drug rebate program must provide discounts on outpatient drugs to covered entities. Approximately 14,000 covered entities and 800 manufacturers participate in the program, which includes hospitals serving a higher percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries. Under PHSA Sec. 340B, covered entities like hospitals serving Medicaid beneficiaries receive discounts on outpatient drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Participating entities are prohibited from diverting drugs or obtaining multiple discounts. The 340B discount is determined by dividing the average Medicaid rebate percentage by the average manufacturer price. The Medicaid statute defines Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) as the average price paid to manufacturers by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail pharmacies. Manufacturers calculate the maximum price they can charge 340B entities based on their AMP. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the Social Security Act to include qualifying children's hospitals in the 340B program, requiring them to meet all participation requirements. Manufacturers can audit covered entity records for product diversion or multiple discounts. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include more entities like children's hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers. These new facilities must meet specific participation requirements to receive discounted drug prices. The changes aim to improve program integrity and oversight. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include more entities like children's hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers, with specific participation requirements. The provisions in this section require the Secretary to develop systems to improve manufacturer and covered entity compliance, program integrity activities, and administrative procedures to resolve disputes. Compliance systems aim to increase transparency, monitoring, oversight, and investigation of drug prices charged to covered entities, and to prevent drug diversion or multiple discounts. A new administrative dispute resolution process will mediate and resolve covered entity overpayment claims. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include more entities like children's hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers. The Secretary is required to establish standards and issue regulations for assessing Civil Money Penalty sanctions on drug manufacturers for overcharge violations. A dispute resolution process will be implemented for covered entities to report suspected overcharges. The section authorizes appropriations for improvements to the 340B program. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include more entities like children's hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers. HCERA Sec. 2302 amends ACA Sec. 7102 to exclude orphan drugs from 340B discounts for newly added hospital entities. GAO is required to submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of individuals receiving services through 340B-covered entities. The report was due within 18 months of enactment and is to make recommendations on program expansion, access to therapies, and use of 340B income by covered entities. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include more entities like children's hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers. One provision in the ACA expresses the Sense of the Senate that Congress should consider establishing a state demonstration program to evaluate alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice. Various states have implemented tort reform laws, including statutes of limitation and caps on damages. ACA does not create a federal medical liability reform law but gives states a financial incentive to develop their own alternatives. The ACA does not create a federal medical liability reform law but incentivizes states to develop their own alternatives to tort litigation. It extends liability protection to members of free clinics and suggests the establishment of a state demonstration program for evaluating alternatives to the existing civil litigation system for medical malpractice claims. Additionally, it authorizes the appropriation of $50 million for demonstration grants to states for this purpose. The ACA incentivizes states to develop alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice claims by providing demonstration grants for up to five years. States must demonstrate that their alternative promotes prompt and fair resolutions, encourages efficient resolution, discloses errors, improves patient safety, and enhances access to healthcare. The ACA incentivizes states to develop alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice claims by providing demonstration grants for up to five years. States must demonstrate that their alternative promotes patient safety, reduces medical errors, improves access to liability, informs patients about differences between alternatives, allows patients to opt out at any time, and does not conflict with state law. Each state must identify funding sources and establish jurisdiction for the alternative. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to states applying for grants. The ACA incentivizes states to develop alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice claims by providing demonstration grants for up to five years. States must demonstrate that their alternative promotes patient safety, reduces medical errors, improves access to liability, informs patients about differences between alternatives, allows patients to opt out at any time, and does not conflict with state law. The Secretary will consult with a review panel composed of relevant experts appointed by the Comptroller General when reviewing states' grant applications. Reporting requirements include submitting reports on the impact of funded activities on patient safety and medical liability insurance, an annual compendium to Congress, and contracting with a research organization for an overall evaluation. The ACA incentivizes states to develop alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice claims by providing demonstration grants for up to five years. States must demonstrate that their alternative promotes patient safety, reduces medical errors, improves access to liability, informs patients about differences between alternatives, allows patients to opt out at any time, and does not conflict with state law. A review panel, research organization, MedPAC, and MACPAC must conduct evaluations and reports on the impact of state-implemented alternatives. The Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity for government employees' negligent acts. Congress can grant FTCA liability protection to private organizations, employees, and volunteers, deeming them federal employees. In 1996, volunteer health professionals at free clinics were granted this protection. ACA Sec. 10608 extends FTCA liability protection to officers, governing board members, employees, and contractors of free clinics, allowing them to opt out of purchasing medical malpractice insurance.
