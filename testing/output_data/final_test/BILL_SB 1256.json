    "title": "SB 1256",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 314 of the Code of Civil Procedure, known as the Civility in Litigation Act, requires a person aggrieved by an unlawful act to send a letter outlining the grievance before taking legal action or pursuing alternative dispute resolution. The letter must be sent by certified mail to the alleged wrongdoer's last known address. The Civility in Litigation Act mandates sending a certified letter outlining grievances to the alleged wrongdoer before legal action. The recipient has 30 days to respond and engage in good faith efforts to resolve the issue. If the alleged wrongdoer fails to respond to the certified letter within 30 days, the aggrieved party can pursue legal action or alternative dispute resolution. The statute of limitations on the claim is tolled for 30 days after the letter is mailed, plus any negotiation period. If the aggrieved person files a complaint in court, they must attach a copy of the letter sent and proof of mailing. If the letter was not received, this should be disclosed in the complaint along with efforts made to comply with the law. If the provisions of this subdivision are not complied with in good faith, a court may dismiss a claim authorized under it. The court must state in writing why the case was dismissed and whether it was dismissed with prejudice. Claims by an aggrieved party that are not time-barred should be dismissed without prejudice to allow for any alleged defects to be corrected. The section excludes claims related to Family Code, Government Code, Penal Code, or Probate Code. It also does not apply in true emergencies requiring immediate court relief. Compliance with the section is considered an offer to compromise and is inadmissible as evidence. Compliance or attempts to comply can be used to show good faith or adherence to the section. The term \"authorized representative\" in this section refers to a person designated in writing to represent someone accused of an unlawful act, including attorneys, insurance company representatives, or others with authority to resolve disputes on behalf of the accused."
