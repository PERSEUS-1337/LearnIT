    "content": "The \"Enhanced Safety from Wildfire Act of 2003\" imposes liability for damages resulting from the spread of wildfire from forested public lands in the United States. The \"Enhanced Safety from Wildfire Act of 2003\" holds the United States liable for property damage caused by fires spreading from federal forested lands to non-federal lands, under certain conditions. The rule of law specified in subsection (a) does not apply when non-Federal lands exceeding 6,400 acres are used for commercial timber production, unless the owner proves the lands were managed for forest health before the fire. Disputes over land status are resolved by the State Forester, with expenses split between parties. The rule of law specified in subsection (a) does not apply to certain Federal lands, including National Wilderness Preservation System components, lands with prohibited vegetation removal, and small non-contiguous Federal land areas. However, the rule does apply to National Forest System lands and Bureau of Land Management lands. The rule of law in subsection (a) applies to National Forest System lands and Bureau of Land Management lands under the O&C Sustained Yield Act of 1937 that do not meet the acreage limitation in subsection (d)(3). The Secretary must report on the forest health status of buffer zones with non-Federal lands within two years. Buffer zones are defined as forested Federal lands near non-Federal boundaries. The Secretary determines buffer zones for forested Federal lands based on geography, topography, and forest cover. Condition class 1 for these lands means managing fire regimes, vegetation, and ecosystem components. Forested Federal lands include public lands and National Forest System lands with significant tree presence. The term 'Secretary concerned' refers to the Secretary of the Interior for public lands and the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System lands. A delayed effective date of eight years is specified for the rule of law regarding fires spreading from Federal lands onto non-Federal lands. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Liability for damages resulting from wildfire spread from public lands or National Forest System lands is addressed in Sec. 319."
