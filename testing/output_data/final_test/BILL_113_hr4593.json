    "content": "PROHIBITING TAX STATUS ASSIGNMENT BASED ON POLITICAL BELIEFS AND ACTIVITIES. Congress finds that the US income tax system relies on voluntary compliance, which often requires taxpayers to submit private information to the IRS. To maintain trust, the IRS must act in a non-partisan manner and ensure taxpayers are not discriminated against based on various factors. The IRS should not assign tax treatment based on political beliefs or activities to maintain taxpayers' confidence in the US tax system. Targeting individuals or groups based on political beliefs must stop to uphold the integrity of the income tax system. The IRS should not evaluate political activities of individuals or organizations. An organization is defined as a group registered with the Federal Election Commission as a political committee, determined to be a political committee by law, or primarily operating to influence the selection of individuals for public office. The text chunk discusses the registration requirements for individuals seeking public office and tax-exempt organizations engaging in political activities. Individuals running for office need to register with the appropriate State agency, while tax-exempt organizations can engage in political activities as long as it does not exceed 50 percent of their total activities. The text chunk outlines the permissible political activities for tax-exempt organizations, including educating individuals on public issues and participating in ballot initiatives. Political activity in furtherance of American democracy is defined as activities that support the Federal Election Campaign Act. The text chunk clarifies that tax-exempt organizations must still comply with filing requirements as a political committee under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971."
