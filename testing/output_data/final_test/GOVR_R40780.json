    "content": "The existing authorization for federal surface transportation programs provided by SAFETEA-LU expires on September 30, 2009. Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize or extend these programs while addressing a financial shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. Congress transferred $7 billion from the Treasury's General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund to keep it solvent through FY2009. The Highway Trust Fund faces financial problems and Congress is considering legislation to address the shortfall. The fund consists of separate highway and transit accounts, with discussions on program extension and major issues associated with surface transportation legislation. The fund was temporarily supported with $7 billion from the Treasury's General Fund to remain solvent through FY2009. The Highway Trust Fund, financed mainly by excise taxes on motor fuels, faces financial issues. The fund has separate highway and transit accounts, with the highway account receiving 15.44 cents per gallon tax revenue. Without legislative intervention, the Federal Highway Administration would be unable to pay states for completed work. The Highway Trust Fund faced financial issues, with the Federal Highway Administration unable to pay states for completed work. Last year, $8 billion was transferred to the highway account, and this year $7 billion was provided to carry it through FY2009. The transit account remains solvent for now, but its long-term health is at risk. Over 50 years, there have been several fuel tax increases, with the last one in 1993. The Highway Trust Fund has faced financial challenges, with spending on highways and transit exceeding revenues. The Congressional Budget Office data shows a growing gap between outlays and receipts, with an injection of funds from the Treasury general funds. The CBO estimates for FY2009 show a significant gap between outlays and receipts, with revenues lower than predicted due to decreased driving and other tax components. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund will struggle to support increased transportation spending, requiring policymakers to find new sources of income for the program. The upcoming legislative debate on transportation funding will be defined by the lack of a ready source of new cash, unlike previous reauthorization bills that benefited from increased fuel usage. Policymakers must now decide between finding new sources of income for an expanded program or settling for a smaller program with potential differences. The ARRA provided new funding for surface transportation programs in FY2009 and FY2010, including $27.5 billion for the federal-aid highway program, $8.4 billion for the federal transit program, and $8 billion for High Speed Passenger Rail. An additional $1.5 billion is available through the Surface Transportation Discretionary Grant program. Tax law changes allow for innovative financing for transportation projects. The ARRA provided new funding for transportation projects through innovative financing, including tax credits for \"Build America Bonds.\" The debate on reauthorization is influenced by the significant boost in funding, with some advocating for a slow approach while others argue for continued investment to address national infrastructure deficiencies. The Federal-Aid Highway Program encompasses various programs, categorized as formula and discretionary. The FHWA administers formula and discretionary programs for highway funding. Formula programs distribute funds annually to states based on specific factors, known as \"apportionments.\" Discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress. State DOTs primarily manage the Highway Program, deciding where and how funds are spent within federal guidelines. Federal money for highway projects is not given upfront but allocated as needed. Federal monies for highway projects are distributed to states as notifications of available funds. States can submit vouchers for reimbursement of project costs once work is approved and started. The Highway Program is funded with contract authority to control annual spending without the need for further legislative action. The ObLim (Oblimit) sets a limit on contract authority for annual spending, similar to an appropriation, indicating federal funding available for states. Highway projects require financial participation from states/local governments, with varying federal-state/local match percentages. Federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through formula-driven programs. The federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through large \"core\" formula-driven programs, such as the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, Highway Bridge Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, and Equity Bonus Program. Formulas determine the portion of funding each state receives. These programs aim to provide federal funds for specific needs. The state DOTs receive federal-aid highway money through various formula programs like the Safe Routes to School program and Appalachian Development Highway System. Funding flexibility allows shifting funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. Despite this flexibility, some argue that the programmatic structure inhibits efficient use of federal highway funds. The Equity Bonus Program is the largest highway program, ensuring each state receives a prescribed rate-of-return. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a prescribed rate-of-return on highway users' tax payments. Additional funding may be allocated through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) and discretionary programs under FHWA control. Earmarking of discretionary program funding by Congress has been common since FY2000. Since FY2000, Congress has earmarked most discretionary program funding, including Transportation, Community and System Preservation Program (TCSP), National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program (NCIIP), Construction of Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities, and Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS). The FHWA lists 59 activities as Allocated Programs, some resembling specific projects or temporary pilot programs. DOT utilizes various financing mechanisms, such as the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. The federal transit program, administered by DOT's Federal Transit Administration (FTA), includes financing mechanisms like TIFIA, GARVEEs, and State Infrastructure Banks. These leverage federal funds through debt mechanisms. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, with the Urbanized Area Formula Program providing funding to urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or more. Funding in two programs is distributed by formula, accounting for 85% of authorized funding. The Federal Transit Administration's transit program includes various funding mechanisms like TIFIA, GARVEEs, and State Infrastructure Banks. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, with the Urbanized Area Formula Program providing funding to urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or more. The Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are mainly used for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program provides competitive funding for new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including transit rail projects, busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, automated guideway systems, and vintage trolleys. The Small Starts program in SAFETEA funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Small Starts projects receive $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization starting in FY2007. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and related equipment, as well as for building facilities like administrative and maintenance buildings, transfer facilities, bus shelters, and park-and-ride stations. Other funding programs account for the remaining 15% of program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States. The Department of Transportation (DOT) agencies administer highway safety programs in the United States, focusing on reducing transportation-related fatalities and injuries. States have primary responsibility for highway safety, with federal assistance provided through grants and regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). NHTSA promotes highway safety, provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and conducts research on traffic safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) oversees state highway safety activities and federal grant funds for traffic safety. States must submit approved highway safety plans to receive funds, which identify safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. NHTSA provides training, technical assistance, and grants through formula and incentive programs, including the State and Community Highway Safety Program (Section 402) and smaller incentive grant programs established by Congress. The Section 402 program provides grants to states for highway safety programs targeting speeding, occupant protection, drunk/drugged driving, motorcycle and school bus crashes, and unsafe driving behaviors. Grants are distributed based on population and road mileage, with 40% allocated to local communities for safety implementation. The Section 402 program provides grants to states for highway safety programs, with 40% allocated to local communities. Congress established traffic safety incentive grant programs in SAFETEA to offer additional federal funding for states that address occupant protection, drunk driving, motorcyclist safety, and traffic data collection. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation and enforcement. The FHWA administers motor carrier safety grant programs to ensure the safety of commercial motor vehicle operations. The HSIP program aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving roadway design or operation. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. The program includes a set-aside for the Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program. The Obama Administration has requested Congress to extend the existing program for 18 months to secure long-term funding for high-risk rural road improvements. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has introduced legislation (S. 1498) to extend surface transportation programs at current funding levels until March 31, 2011. EPW is the lead Committee on reauthorization for highway titles. The Senate Committees have introduced legislation related to surface transportation programs, with provisions likely to be merged into a single bill. The proposed legislation lacks funding data and details of major provisions, with a markup session held on June 24, 2009. Amendments were introduced but subsequently withdrawn, and the bill is yet to be formally introduced. The unnumbered bill related to surface transportation programs is not yet formally introduced. Information on its contents can be found on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's website. The authors of the legislation see it as transformational, simplifying the existing program by eliminating 75 stand-alone programs and creating new focused programs. The unnumbered bill related to surface transportation programs aims to simplify existing programs by eliminating 75 stand-alone programs and creating new focused initiatives. It includes new programs such as the critical asset investment (CAI) program, the freight transportation program (FIP), the metropolitan mobility and access program (MMA), and a program for projects of national significance (PNS). The legislation also focuses on intermodalism and makes structural changes to retained programs. The bill makes significant changes to the Department of Transportation, introduces new planning initiatives, enhances the role of certain groups in transportation planning, and establishes performance management systems. Performance management is a key focus, with terms like \"performance target\" and \"performance measure\" appearing frequently. The legislation aims to transform Federal surface transportation to a performance-based framework. While the bill introduces performance management systems and aims to transform Federal surface transportation to a performance-based framework, some argue that it merely adds to existing rules and regulations without replacing them. The bill, at 775 pages, lacks funding data, details on programs, and a list of high priority projects, making it complex and challenging to navigate. The proposed transportation bill, known as STAA, is complex and lengthy at 775 pages. It includes significant changes to federal surface transportation programs, focusing on freight, transit, intermodalism, and livability policies. Some may see the bill as biased against expanding highway capacity, while others view it as promoting alternatives to the automobile. The proposed transportation bill, known as STAA, includes significant changes to federal surface transportation programs, favoring alternatives to the automobile such as transit, bicycles, and walking. Funding for the $500 billion program is uncertain, with $450 billion from the Highway Trust Fund and an additional $50 billion for high-speed rail. The bill lacks a revenue title and programmatic funding details, making it difficult to assess its importance. The STAA transportation bill includes significant changes favoring transit, bicycles, and walking. Funding details are uncertain, with $450 billion from the Highway Trust Fund and an additional $50 billion for high-speed rail. The federal transit program alone will be authorized at $99.8 billion over six years, with 22% of funding directed to transit by the STAA. The STAA transportation bill focuses on transit, bicycles, and walking, with major changes in the Highway Title. It shifts towards maintenance/improvement of existing highways, freight movement, multimodal improvements, and highway safety efforts. The bill is seen as more urban-focused compared to SAFETEA. The STAA transportation bill focuses on transit, bicycles, and walking, with major changes in the Highway Title. It shifts towards maintenance/improvement of existing highways, freight movement, multimodal improvements, and highway safety efforts. The bill is seen as more urban-focused compared to SAFETEA. Among the structural changes, the Highway Title of STAA would make to the Federal-Aid Highway program are the following: Interstate Maintenance Program, Highway Bridge Program, and National Highway System Program would cease to exist as independent entities and their responsibilities would be transferred to Critical Asset Investment (CAI) and Freight Improvement (FIP) programs, or to the existing STP. STP, CMAQ, and HSIP are retained as core programs to be joined by CAI and FIP, a total of five core programs. The STAA transportation bill introduces major changes in the Highway Title, focusing on transit, bicycles, and walking. It creates intermodal programs like the Metropolitan Mobility and Access Program (MMA) and Projects of National Significance (PNS), allowing for funding transferability between highway and transit projects. Additionally, it consolidates discretionary programs and expands direct project funding eligibilities. The STAA transportation bill introduces changes in the Highway Title, creating new programs like the National Highway System (NHS) to improve road and bridge conditions. Eligibility is limited to highways on the NHS or bridges on Federal-Aid Highways, with a focus on funding performance outcomes. Capacity expansion projects are restricted unless on Federal-Aid Highway bridges. The STAA transportation bill introduces new programs for improving road and bridge conditions, including the National Highway System (NHS) for highways and Federal-Aid Highway bridges. States can spend a percentage on CAI management, data collection, and bridge inspection. Performance measures and targets are set, with states required to submit CAI plans for approval. DOT can withhold funding for projects inconsistent with the plan starting in 2012. STAA also creates a program for apportionments to fund projects. The STAA transportation bill introduces new programs for improving road and bridge conditions, including the National Highway System (NHS) for highways and Federal-Aid Highway bridges. States can spend a percentage on CAI management, data collection, and bridge inspection. Performance measures and targets are set, with states required to submit CAI plans for approval. DOT can withhold funding for projects inconsistent with the plan starting in 2012. Additionally, a new program (Section 1105) would provide apportionments to states for publicly owned highway freight transportation projects, with specific purposes outlined for the Freight Infrastructure Program (FIP). Projects must be located on designated routes and states must develop state freight plans to receive funding. States can also make grants to freight corridor coalitions meeting certain requirements. Observers see the FIP as a significant intermodal initiative. The FIP is a major intermodal initiative under the STAA transportation bill. It is part of the core programs and retains SAFETEA requirements with some changes. Former Highway Bridge Program projects not eligible under CAI would now be eligible for STP funding. STAA also mandates that 10% of STP funds allocated to MPOs be used for Transportation Enhancement activities. The sub-allocation of STP funds is now 80% based on population and 20% to any area of the state. The STP program under the STAA transportation bill is more flexible than other Highway Programs, with 80% of funds allocated based on population and 20% to any area of the state. Changes include requiring states to develop HSIP investment plans and setting a general cost share of 90% for HSIP projects. Highway safety targets and strategies to meet them are to be integrated into states' existing Strategic Highway Safety Plans. The High Risk Rural Road Program is consolidated within the HSIP with distinct funding. Several safety programs are also under the HSIP umbrella with a federal share of 90%. STAA continues and modifies the existing core Highway Program. CMAQ provides funding for projects reducing transportation emissions in air quality areas. CMAQ funds can be used for HOV lane construction and clean-fuel public transportation buses. Formula factors for CMAQ funds have been rewritten. The CMAQ formula factors have been rewritten with no specified weights. The federal share is 80%. STAA creates the MMA program for multimodal transportation funding directly to MPOs. The Transportation Research Board would provide project selection recommendations. Eligible MPOs must serve urban areas with over 500,000 population. The MMA program provides grants to MPOs serving urban areas with over 500,000 population. There are two tiers of grants: tier one for areas with over 1,000,000 people experiencing travel delays, and tier two for others. 40% of funds are for tier one grants and 60% for tier two grants. Tier one grants are limited to 10 recipients, while tier two grants aim for geographically equitable distribution. DOT may enter into FFGAs with recipients to establish federal participation terms and performance criteria. The FFGA under the MMA program sets federal participation terms and performance criteria for eligible recipients. Plans involving tolls or PPPs in metropolitan mobility plans must be approved by the Office of Public Benefit. Certain financing costs and planning/reporting costs are eligible. Recipients can establish a metropolitan infrastructure bank with the DOT for project credit. Section 1205 suggests MMA funds may prioritize transit improvements over highway construction, with an 80% federal share. STAA (Section 1206) introduces a new project program for large national projects. Section 1206 of the STAA establishes a new project program for very large projects of national significance, with projects needing to equal or exceed $500 million or 75% of a state's annual apportionment. Eligible projects include international bridges, public or private rail facilities, intermodal freight transfer facilities, and access or service improvements. DOT will set competitive criteria for grant selection and carry out a national solicitation for grant applications. Limited assistance may be provided to ports for surface transportation infrastructure modifications. The STAA establishes a new project program for very large projects of national significance, with projects needing to equal or exceed $500 million or 75% of a state's annual apportionment. DOT will set competitive criteria for grant selection and carry out a national solicitation for grant applications. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis with a federal share of 80%, but a lower federal share may be requested. The bill includes various new and existing programs, such as ADHS funds apportioned based on cost estimates, guaranteed minimum funds for participating states, and limits on access road mileage. The bill includes provisions for the reauthorization of corridor X-1 in Alabama with funds up to $500 million, rescinding unobligated funds after September 30, 2013. It also reestablishes the Ferry Program for reconstruction of ferry boats and terminals, eliminates set-asides for certain states, and requires a National Ferry Database. Additionally, it consolidates Federal Lands Highways programs with the Territorial Highway System.

It also reestablishes the Ferry Program for reconstruction of ferry boats and terminals, eliminates set-asides for certain states, and requires a National Ferry Database. Additionally, it consolidates Federal Lands Highways programs with the Territorial Highway System. The bill also addresses tolling limitations on the Interstate System highways, highlighting the importance of toll revenue for highway financing. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act (STAA) is changing direction by eliminating toll-related programs and instituting new requirements. It would require public authorities to consider the negative effects of tolls on interstate commerce, provide improvements for diverted travelers, and mitigate the impact on low-income drivers before implementing tolls. Toll revenues must be used for facility capital and operating expenses. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act (STAA) is eliminating toll-related programs and introducing new requirements. Toll revenues are to be used for facility costs, debt service, and a return on investment. Excess revenues from tolled HOV lanes may fund public transportation. DOT will review toll rate schedules before implementation. Federal participation in HOV projects for low-emission vehicles is allowed. Public-private partnerships (PPP) financed by tolls are used for highway and transit infrastructure development. PPP agreements involving federal-aid highway funds would also be permitted at the state and local level. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act introduces new federal requirements for public-private partnerships (PPP) involving federal-aid highway funds. These agreements must evaluate costs and benefits, adhere to public information and involvement requirements, and cannot include non-compete clauses. The act also allows for early contract termination with fair market compensation to the private partner. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act introduces new tolling and PPP oversight provisions through the creation of the Office of Public Benefit (OPB) within the FHWA. The OPB will review and approve toll rate schedules, provide leadership on toll projects and PPPs, and address concerns such as traffic diversion and increased driving costs. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act introduces new tolling and PPP oversight provisions through the creation of the Office of Public Benefit (OPB) within the FHWA. Critics are concerned that the new requirements may dampen the desire of states and the private sector to pursue tolling and PPP agreements due to extra time, expense, and uncertainties. One major source of uncertainty is the requirement for the OPB to review and approve PPP compliance with new public transparency requirements, potentially causing delays and risks for project partners. Section 1103 of the Surface Transportation Authorization Act allows for blanket highway-transit transfers between Title 23 (Highway) and Chapter 53, Title 49 (Public Transportation) programs. States can transfer funds to other states or to the FHWA for various uses. Urbanized areas with over 200,000 individuals must have MPO agreement to transfer STP sub allocations to highway uses. The MMA and PNS programs make projects eligible under both highway and public transportation titles, allowing funds authorized under the highway title to be spent directly on mass transit projects. This could create organizational issues for the DOT in tracking funds. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act (STAA) allows for transfers of funds between highway and transit programs, creating organizational issues for the DOT in tracking spending. STAA broadens the flexibility for transferring funds, making virtually all Federal-Aid Highway title funds available for transit use. While transfers historically flowed from highways to transit, STAA retains existing interagency transfers among programs. However, the proposed legislative language does not include interagency transferability provisions for new programs. The proposed legislative language of new programs like STP, CMAQ, and Recreational Trails may still allow fund transfers among themselves, but not with new Title 23 highway programs like CAI, FIP, MMA, and PNS. Detailed performance and planning requirements are outlined for programs in Title I of the bill, potentially requiring increased personnel at DOT, state DOTs, and MPOs. Metropolitan Planning Organizations would receive financing authority under the Metropolitan Mobility and Access Program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program could see a major shift in authority from states to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) under the proposed legislation. Some concerns exist about the ability of MPOs to efficiently administer programs like MMA and their legal authority to receive federal funds directly. Highway interests may worry about the focus on freight, intermodal, and livability over addressing highway passenger traffic congestion in the new programs. Additionally, questions may arise about the lack of funding for Subtitle B of Section I of STAA, which includes MMA and PNR. The funding allocation for Subtitle B of Section I of STAA, which includes MMA and PNR, is questioned. STAA programs like Projects of National Significance and tier one grants could be at risk for earmarking. Formula programs may also face discretionary set asides. STAA currently does not have an equity adjustment program, but a provision is included in the bill. The bill includes programs to improve freight bottlenecks, fund megaprojects, and encourage urban intermodalism, leading to uneven distribution of Federal-Aid highway funds. This could worsen donor-donee conflicts and increase costs to bring donor states to a targeted spending share. Deciding which programs fall under equity adjustments could be challenging, affecting core programs in states benefiting from large programs like MMA, PNS, High Priority Projects, and FIP. Excluding these programs would reduce the overall bill's rate-of-return guarantee. The STAA proposes programmatic changes in the Federal-Aid Highways title of the bill, but authorization levels are not included yet. This limits analysis of the policy impact, especially regarding the new Critical Asset Investment Program and Freight Improvement Program. Without funding levels, it is hard to determine the importance of national needs supported by these programs compared to the Surface Transportation Program. STP has traditionally supported more local needs, and observers argue that significant and focused funding is necessary for effective implementation. Many argue that increased investment in freight infrastructure is crucial to prevent inefficiency and economic drag. Disagreements exist on how to raise funds, the required amounts, and the federal government's role in planning. SAFETEA lacks a separate federal freight transportation program, with funding mainly channeled through Highway Programs. The SAFETEA authorized funding for states through Highway Programs like STP, benefiting the freight industry. A new program, the Freight Improvement Program (FIP), aims to address economic, congestion, security, and safety issues in publicly owned highway freight transportation projects on the National Highway System. Eligible projects for the Freight Improvement Program must be on the National Highway System or National Network, or on newly designated secondary freight routes of economic significance. States will select these routes in consultation with local governments. DOT will review and designate them. States must measure and document freight movement on funded facilities and establish performance targets. Every five years, states must assess the condition of secondary freight routes and develop a freight plan. The draft bill requires state DOTs to develop a freight plan for eligible projects on designated freight routes to receive FIP funds. A freight advisory committee would participate in plan development, and funding may be provided to up to ten freight corridor coalitions for interstate infrastructure needs assessment. The FIP aims to elevate consideration of freight needs in funding allocation by creating a specific funding category and requiring states to develop a separate freight plan. It also establishes freight advisory committees and provides funding for multi-state corridor coalitions to address stakeholder concerns regarding funding accountability. The Surface Transportation Authorization for Equity in Transportation Act (SAFETEA) created capital grants programs and extended a loan program for freight rail infrastructure, addressing concerns about neglect of nationally significant chokepoints in the surface freight network. The private ownership of freight railroad infrastructure limits public knowledge about its condition and performance, leading to difficulties in pinpointing locations with infrastructure constraints. A backup in one area of the rail system can significantly impact fluidity in other parts due to the interconnected network and long-distance cargo movement. The Surface Transportation Authorization for Equity in Transportation Act (SAFETEA) extended grants and loan programs for freight rail infrastructure through FY2015. It includes programs for relocating railroad tracks, class II and III railroads, and a loan program for rehabilitation and improvement. The bill also requires quadrennial reports on the condition and performance of freight and intercity passenger rail systems. Intermodalism was a major focus of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. The Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA, P.L. 102-240) aimed to improve intermodal connections in surface transportation programs by creating the Office of Intermodalism within DOT. However, the office did not meet expectations and lacked influence on policymaking. The proposed solution is to establish a new structure for intermodal planning within DOT led by an Under Secretary of Transportation for Intermodalism. The Surface Transportation Authorization Act (STAA) establishes a new Under Secretary of Transportation for Intermodalism with responsibilities for approving/recommending MMA and PNS projects. The STAA also creates an Office of Intermodalism within the DOT to enhance coordination and planning among modally organized agencies. The Office, headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, may play a significant policy role in coordinating project proposals. Staffing and funding levels for the Office are not specified in the STAA. The STAA establishes a new Council on Intermodalism chaired by the Secretary of Transportation to address departmental coordination issues. Voting members include the Administrator of each DOT operating agency, with the Coast Guard Commandant and Chief of Engineers as nonvoting members. The Council is required to meet monthly to keep intermodalism at the forefront of DOT policymaking decisions. The provision establishing the Council on Intermodalism ensures key decision-makers participate in meetings, but absences could lead to policy decisions without major agency administrators present. The equal voting distribution may pose challenges due to significant differences in agency size and scope. The STAA mandates the creation of an Office of Expedited Project Delivery in the FHWA and FTA to oversee timely completion of funded projects, with a focus on large and complex projects. The Offices provide oversight for all FHWA and FTA projects, with special attention to significant projects costing $500 million or more for FHWA and \"New Start\" projects for FTA, particularly rail transit construction projects. The Office of Expedited Project Delivery in the FHWA and FTA oversees funded projects, focusing on large and complex ones. They identify and solve problems, provide annual reports to Congress, and make recommendations for improvement. However, they lack specific authority to enforce actions or penalties for noncompliance, leading to concerns about their effectiveness in expediting project delivery. The new Offices for expedited project delivery may lack power and require significant staffing and funding. Funding for these Offices is not set aside in the bill, raising questions about costs and potential reallocation of funds. A new Office of Livability within FHWA aims to align transportation policies with sustainable and livable community concepts, responding to calls from the environmental community. The Director is responsible for administering programs to promote livable communities and multiple transportation options, facing opposition in some parts of the transportation community. The Director is responsible for administering programs to promote livable communities and multiple transportation options, including the enhancement program, recreational trails program, national scenic byways program, and U.S. bicycle route system program. They work with FHWA and FTA on planning and other programs for promoting livability in transportation assets, coordinate with other agencies like HUD and EPA, and provide leadership on livability issues such as developing street design policies and standards. The Director is responsible for promoting livable communities and transportation options, including the U.S. bicycle route system program. They have the authority to develop model legislation for pedestrian and bicyclist rights but lack real power to enforce adoption outside of DOT. However, they do have decision-making authority in developing and implementing the U.S. Bicycle Route System, including issuing regulations and operating a grant program for its implementation. The STAA program allocates grant funding for planning, mapping, signage, promotion, and construction of a designated system. Only 50% of the funds can be used for construction. The Office of Public Benefit within FHWA oversees highway toll projects and public-private partnership agreements. The Director of this office approves or disapproves toll agreements based on specific criteria. The Office of Public Benefit oversees highway toll projects and public-private partnership agreements, with the Director approving or disapproving toll agreements based on specific criteria. The creation of the Office aims to protect the public interest in the nation's surface transportation system, requiring strengthened public protections for highway toll projects and PPP agreements. The bill provides specific criteria for the Office to evaluate in its decision-making process. Implementing the guidance in the bill may be challenging, such as evaluating toll rate proposals' impact on low-income travelers without local/regional data. The Office will be involved in alternative financing agreements dependent on toll revenues, with many supporting PPPs in highway infrastructure development. Concerns exist about the administrative complexity of PPP execution. The new Office created by the proposed legislation adds transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, including the development of performance management systems. Supporters of tolling and PPPs may view the Office as a bureaucratic hurdle and the approval criteria as unfriendly to non-grant financing mechanisms for infrastructure. The bill also mandates the development of a National Transportation Strategic Plan by the Secretary of Transportation. The proposed legislation mandates the development of a National Transportation Strategic Plan by the Secretary of Transportation, to be created and updated every two years by the new Office of Intermodalism. This plan will guide the use of federal transportation funds and include projects with significant national and regional benefits. The STAA proposes DOT oversee the development of a plan for funding investment programs, without constraints on resources or funding recommendations. This may lead to a heavy workload for DOT in evaluating project proposals for inclusion in the plan, potentially inundating them with submissions. Additionally, DOT is required to provide data and 20-year projections to states for transportation planning, including projections for suborbital space tourism demand. The proposed bill aims to change state transportation planning by adding new factors to the existing requirements. This could create additional work for state DOTs, especially when identifying projects involving privately owned infrastructure like freight rail. Critics are concerned about the strategic nature of the national plan if it solely relies on states' project submissions. Additionally, there is a risk of criticism if some states are overrepresented or underrepresented in the prioritization process. The proposed legislation aims to enhance state transportation planning by adding factors like sustainability, reducing GHG emissions, and improving public health. States must develop greenhouse gas reduction targets and strategies. The plan must address congestion in airports and freight rail corridors, consider ports and interconnectivity between modes, and implement performance management with measures and targets. The proposed legislation includes a freight improvement program requiring states to develop a state freight plan with performance measures and targets. The plan must be consistent with long-range transportation plans and may be separate or incorporated within the statewide plan. The Secretary can designate and provide grants to up to 10 freight corridor coalitions to develop corridor plans aligned with the statewide strategic long-range plan. The bill includes provisions for long-range transportation planning at the statewide and metropolitan levels, with changes to requirements for setting GHG emissions targets and implementing performance measurement systems. Notable provisions for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) include raising the population threshold for MPO creation and requiring voting members to be represented proportionally to the population of each political subdivision in the metropolitan area. The bill introduces changes for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), including new voting structure requirements and certification criteria. It also mandates the creation of a database of MPO characteristics and establishes a funding program for areas with populations of 500,000 or more to address transportation congestion. The proposed legislation aims to address surface transportation congestion in urban areas through coordinated planning with state and transit agencies. It defines a rural planning organization (RPO) to enhance transportation planning in areas with less than 50,000 individuals. The bill includes performance management as a new requirement in federal surface transportation programs. The new requirement in federal surface transportation programs, such as the Freight Improvement Program (FIP) and the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), includes adding performance management to focus on key objectives and improve transparency for program managers and the public. Sanctions for not meeting requirements vary by program, with some programs lacking explicit consequences for not establishing performance management tools or meeting performance goals. The state must establish performance goals and measures in its freight plan, report to the Secretary annually, but funding from the FIP does not seem to be tied to plan quality or goal achievement. Sanctions exist in other programs for not meeting performance goals, such as the requirement for an approved metropolitan mobility plan with performance-based goals in the MMA. Funding continuation depends on providing progress reports and new plans in the future. The STAA mandates DOT to set safety performance targets for each state. The STAA requires DOT to establish safety performance targets for each state in their highway safety improvement plans and oversee the implementation of investment plans to meet these targets. It also reduces the number of statutory programs administered by NHTSA and incorporates elements of eliminated programs. The STAA requires DOT to establish safety performance targets for each state in their highway safety improvement plans and oversee the implementation of investment plans to meet these targets. It reduces the number of statutory programs administered by NHTSA, incorporating some elements of eliminated programs. Specifically, it eliminates certain grants and reallocates a percentage of formula safety grant funds to impaired driving, occupant protection, and motorcycle safety programs. States meeting performance targets can use funds for other safety purposes. The draft bill strengthens the emphasis on performance in each state's highway safety program by requiring DOT to establish quantifiable safety performance targets and report annually to Congress. It reduces the linkage between highway safety programs and performance measures by eliminating NHTSA incentive grant programs. The draft bill would replace the existing seat belt incentive grant program with a penalty for states without a primary seat belt law, withholding highway funding starting at 2% in FY2013 and increasing to 8% in FY2016. States would also be required to install ignition interlock devices for at least 6 months. The draft bill proposes requiring states to install ignition interlock devices on vehicles of those convicted of DUI, with penalties for non-compliance. It also includes pedestrian and bicycle safety in traffic safety focus areas and sets goals for reducing crashes and fatalities involving commercial vehicles. The draft bill aims to increase funding each year for commercial vehicle enforcement activities and establish an incentive grant program for states that reduce commercial motor vehicle crashes. It also strengthens requirements for states to enhance their commercial drivers licensing programs and creates a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results of commercial drivers to prevent drivers from evading consequences for failed tests. Additionally, motor carriers subject to DOT's hours-of-service regulations must equip their vehicles with electronic devices. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's draft bill proposes requiring commercial motor vehicles to have electronic on-board recorders to address drivers not keeping accurate hours-of-service records, potentially driving while fatigued. The bill also includes significant changes to federal transit programs, with details on funding distribution still unclear. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's draft bill proposes significant changes to federal transit programs, with funding details indicating $99.8 billion over six years for the federal transit program, with 88% from the mass transit account and 12% from the general fund. This would result in an average annual authorization of $16.6 billion under the STAA, potentially directing 22% of the total funding to transit. The draft bill proposes significant changes to federal transit programs, with $99.8 billion allocated over six years. The bill allows for the transfer of highway program funds to transit programs, potentially increasing funding for transit projects. The draft bill proposes significant changes to federal transit programs, with $99.8 billion allocated over six years. The bill allows for the transfer of highway program funds to transit programs, potentially increasing funding for transit projects. The bill also includes a new $50 billion Metropolitan Mobility and Access (MMA) program to address highway traffic congestion, with some funds likely supporting transit. The bill abolishes the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Program, merging its funds into existing Urban and Rural Formula Programs and creating a new Intermodal and Energy Efficient Transit Facilities Program. The Efficient Transit Facilities Program provides funding for intermodal facilities to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The debate over the Bus Capital Program funding distribution revolves around whether to use a formula or discretionary approach. Supporters of a formula-driven distribution argue for equity, simplicity, and reliability in funding, while those in favor of discretionary spending believe it allows for necessary investments that formula funds may not cover. The new Metropolitan Mobility and Access (MMA) program in the bill may provide additional funding for transit in large urban areas with over 500,000 residents. Funding from this program would be distributed based on population and highway congestion levels, allowing for mode-neutral improvements. The new Metropolitan Mobility and Access (MMA) program proposes major changes in federal highway funding distribution, providing funds directly to metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) instead of state DOTs. Additionally, the program combines existing programs to create the Coordinated Access and Mobility Grants Program, aiming to streamline services for the elderly and disabled. Funding in the new program will be distributed based on population demographics. The new federal transit program proposes changes in funding distribution based on population demographics, with a focus on the elderly, disabled, low-income, and welfare recipients. Recipients must develop performance plans to ensure compliance with regulations for Americans with disabilities. Failure to meet goals may limit funding flexibility. The Urbanized Area Formula Program may allow transit operators in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more to use funds for operating costs. The proposed legislation would allow transit agencies in areas between 200,000 and 1 million to use a percentage of federal funds for operating expenses based on population size. Agencies must have a dedicated source of revenue for operating costs or meet specific requirements to use federal funds for operating expenses. Federal matching shares for capital expenses remain unchanged in the STAA. The STAA maintains federal matching shares for capital expenses at 80% and for operating expenses at 50%. The use of federal funds for operating expenses has been controversial since the 1960s, with support increasing during times of transit service threats. Critics argue that federal operating support leads to decreased productivity as it allows operators to neglect cost control and revenue generation. Details on modifications to the Rural Formula Program are scarce. The draft legislation proposes modifications to the Rural Formula Program, including altering the funding distribution formula to consider transit service factors. This change aims to increase funding for small urban and rural transit services, addressing the longstanding issue of limited funding for these areas. Incorporating transit service factors in the formula would incentivize providers to offer services in costly locations. The proposed legislation includes changes to the New Starts/Small Starts project development and funding approval process, aiming to simplify and streamline the current rigorous and time-consuming process. The bill suggests reducing the approval stages from three to one, eliminating the alternatives analysis requirement, and ensuring FTA approval for project development if chosen as the locally preferred alternative. The proposed legislation aims to simplify the New Starts/Small Starts project development process by reducing approval stages, eliminating the alternatives analysis requirement, and creating an Office of Expedited Project Delivery within the FTA to expedite capital projects. This would allow the Secretary to fast track projects and evaluate based on federal assistance sought. Advocates believe this will shorten project delivery times and expedite federal funding approval for low-risk projects. The proposed legislation aims to simplify the New Starts/Small Starts project development process by reducing approval stages and creating an Office of Expedited Project Delivery within the FTA. Critics are concerned that this may lead to federal support for less competitive projects and overwhelm the evaluation process. There is also a risk of approving more projects than can be supported by available funding authority. The STAA bill would change the definition of New Starts projects to those receiving $100 million or more in federal assistance, and Small Starts projects to those receiving less than $100 million. It aims to broaden the evaluation factors used by FTA to include mobility, accessibility, congestion relief, energy, environment, economic development, and land use patterns. The bill prohibits the use of a cost-effectiveness index in project selection. The legislation prohibits FTA from using a cost-effectiveness index and mandates the use of a transportation system user benefit calculation for evaluating mobility. The STAA bill may change the distribution of funding under the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, simplifying the formula and focusing on maintenance needs. There will be no restriction on funding for fixed guideway systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or less. Recipients may need to develop performance goals related to maintaining transit assets in good repair. The legislation mandates performance planning and goal setting for transit assets in good repair, with updates required periodically for federal funding eligibility. The legislation proposes to cut off federal funding to transit recipients that do not meet performance goals, with the authority for FTA to adjust targets to ensure funding continues. The STAA proposal would amend Title 23 provisions for the CMAQ Program, including changes to eligible projects such as acquiring public transportation vehicles and eliminating certain project types. The proposal aims to amend the CMAQ Program by eliminating specific project listings for funding eligibility, changing project eligibility criteria for states receiving minimum apportionment, requiring interagency cooperation for emission reduction estimates, and specifying how project information should be publicly available. Under the current proposal, requirements for partnerships with nongovernmental entities would be eliminated, along with the EPA's obligation to provide technical guidance on diesel emission reductions. The EPA has already gathered and made public the necessary information. Current law prohibits certain activities until the appropriate environmental review is completed under NEPA regulations by FHWA or FTA. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is required during the NEPA process. Surface transportation projects must comply with various environmental laws and regulations, involving agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Coordination among these agencies is essential to ensure compliance with requirements such as the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act, and Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966. Previous legislation aimed to streamline agency coordination and environmental compliance processes. SAFETEA amended Title 23 to streamline environmental reviews for project decision-making. The STAA proposes integrating state transportation planning elements into NEPA documentation and setting a 120-day deadline for final project design after EIS completion. It also encourages programmatic approaches for environmental programs and permits. The Office of Expedited Project Delivery is urged to establish programmatic agreements to meet NEPA requirements. The surface transportation bill emphasizes meeting NEPA requirements and encouraging states to acquire transportation rights-of-way for long-term needs. It also includes a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transportation planning. Transportation sources contributed to 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2007, up from 25% in 1990. Emissions from cars, trucks, and rail have been steadily increasing, with passenger cars and light duty trucks growing by 24%, rail emissions by 50%, and medium- and heavy-duty truck emissions by 80% since 1990. To achieve the goal of reducing emissions by 80% over the next four decades, measures such as improving fuel efficiency, switching to lower carbon fuels, and better coordination among land use, housing, and transportation projects are necessary. The proposed STAA bill aims to address transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions by setting emission reduction targets and strategies based on EPA models. It includes efforts to increase public transportation ridership, walking, and bicycling, as well as developing performance measures for areas with populations over one million to reduce dependency on single occupant motor vehicles. The STAA bill aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting alternative transportation modes and setting emission reduction targets. It would authorize $50 billion over six years for high-speed rail development, funded by the General Treasury. Annual reporting on progress is required, but no sanctions are specified for not meeting goals. The Rail Investment and Improvement Act (P.L. 110-432, section 501) enacted in October 2008 defines \"high-speed\" rail service as reaching speeds of at least 110 miles per hour. The bill requires a 20% local match for high-speed rail projects and allows the Secretary of Transportation to issue \"letters of intent\" for future federal funding. States or Amtrak can partner with public, private, or non-profit entities for high-speed rail projects, but without a dedicated funding source, the bill's impact on modernizing the passenger rail network is uncertain. The Rail Investment and Improvement Act defines high-speed rail service as reaching speeds of at least 110 miles per hour, requiring a 20% local match for projects. Congress faces challenges in sustaining funding levels for passenger rail, with proposed routes unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover operating costs. Legislation like CLEANTEA could impact federal surface transportation policy by establishing a new trust fund funded by auctioning greenhouse gas emissions allowances. The bill mandates that 10% of auctioned greenhouse gas emissions allowances be deposited into a fund for states and MPOs to develop plans to reduce GHG emissions from transportation. States can opt out of the Federal-Aid Highway program starting in FY2011, receiving an equivalent amount from the Highway Trust Fund with certain conditions. S. 903 is a donor state bill that proposes transferring funds directly to states instead of through the existing federal aid program, addressing complaints from donor states about not receiving a full return on their contributions to the trust fund. The bill favors partial devolution of the surface transportation assistance program, similar to revenue sharing policies from the Nixon Administration. The Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 (S. 1036) introduced by Senators Rockefeller and Lautenberg sets national transportation policy objectives and goals, including reducing vehicle miles traveled, fatalities, carbon dioxide levels, and delays. The bill lacks detailed implementation provisions and clarity on the regulatory structure for program restructuring. The Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 aims to reduce transportation delays, improve infrastructure, increase public transportation usage, shift to non-highway freight services, address congestion at international points of entry, ensure energy supply transportation, and control transportation costs as a percentage of GDP. The Secretary of DOT must work with various stakeholders to achieve these objectives. The Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 requires collaboration with state and local governments, non-profits, and private entities to develop a National Surface Transportation Performance Plan. The Secretary of DOT must evaluate federal programs' contributions to achieving policy goals and align funding accordingly.
