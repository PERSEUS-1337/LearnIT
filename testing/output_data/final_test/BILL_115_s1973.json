Federal agencies with annual extramural research expenditures over $100,000,000 must develop a public access policy within one year of enactment. The policy should align with the agency's goals and include common procedures for collecting and depositing research papers. The Federal research public access policy requires the submission of final manuscripts of research papers to a designated digital repository, incorporating peer review changes, and replacing with the final published version with publisher consent. The Federal research public access policy mandates free online public access to final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions within 12 months of publication, with publisher consent and retention of agency goals for functionality and interoperability. Requests for access can be made by the public and stakeholders through established mechanisms. The Federal research public access policy allows the public and stakeholders to request adjustments to the period before final peer-reviewed manuscripts are made publicly available. This includes providing research papers in reusable formats, improving access to research papers, and ensuring compatibility with state-of-the-art technologies. The Federal research public access policy ensures long-term preservation and free public access to published research findings in digital repositories maintained by Federal agencies. The policy applies to researchers employed by the Federal agency whose works are in the public domain. The Federal research public access policy requires works by researchers funded by Federal agencies to be marked as public domain material when published and made available simultaneously with other works. Exclusions from the policy apply to certain circumstances. The Federal research public access policy excludes certain circumstances from its requirements, such as research progress reports at professional meetings, laboratory notes, classified research, works generating revenue, and authors who do not submit their work to journals. This policy does not affect rights under patent or copyright law. The GAO report, required every 3 years after enactment and every 5 years thereafter, analyzes the delay between paper publication and online availability. It also evaluates the effectiveness of the Federal research public access policy in providing free online access to federally funded research papers. The research papers enable productive reuse and computational analysis using state-of-the-art technologies. It also discusses the possibility of including a royalty-free copyright license for public use with proper attribution to the authors. SEC. 5. DOWNSTREAM REPORTING. Any person or institution awarded a Federal grant must certify that funds will not be subgranted without disclosure to the agency head, and that all subgrants are within the scope of the original grant.
