    "content": "The United States has a \"classical\" system for taxing corporate income, with a separate corporate income tax of 35% on most corporate taxable income. Federal corporate tax revenue has varied between 1% and just over 2% of GDP since 1980, with an increase in FY2005 and FY2007. Federal corporate tax revenue in the United States saw an increase in FY2005 and FY2007, rising to 2.3% and 2.7% of GDP, respectively, before returning to 2.1% in 2008 and dropping to 1.0% in 2009. The CBO projects that corporate tax revenue as a percentage of GDP will remain at 1.0% through 2010 due to reduced corporate profits from the economic recession, with an upward trend expected from 2011 onwards. Additionally, not all businesses are subject to the corporate income tax, as income earned by partnerships is taxed to individual partners under the individual income tax. As Congress debates business tax policy, key questions on equity, economic efficiency, and administrability are raised. These questions focus on the impact of investment incentives on the economy's capital stock and whether reduced tax burdens increase capital supply and long-run growth. The debate over business tax policy raises questions about the effectiveness of tax cuts in stimulating the economy, their impact on tax fairness, and their influence on U.S. economic competitiveness. The President's Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Proposal aims to modify business taxes, remove certain coal, oil, and gas tax provisions, and reform international taxation. These changes are estimated to increase overall business taxation levels. One significant proposal is the repeal of last-in first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting, projected to raise $75.3 billion over 10 years. The President's budget proposes changes to business taxes, including repealing LIFO inventory accounting, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reinstating superfund taxes, and making the Research and Experimentation tax credit permanent. Additionally, the budget aims to eliminate capital gains taxation on small businesses and modify coal, oil, and gas provisions. The President's Budget Proposal includes provisions to repeal Section 199 production activities deduction, percentage depletion, and expensing of intangible drilling costs in the coal, oil, and gas industries. These changes are estimated to raise around $40 billion over the 2010-2020 budget window. Additionally, there are proposals to modify tax rules for dual-capacity taxpayers, reinstate superfund taxes, and make changes to rules on deferral, foreign tax credits, and transfer pricing. The deferral proposal would defer the deduction of interest expenses related to deferred foreign-source income until it is subject to U.S. tax. The foreign tax credit proposals aim to prorate foreign taxes over the taxpayer's entire foreign income, addressing issues of inappropriate separation of creditable foreign taxes from associated foreign income. Transfer pricing proposals target excessive returns from intangible asset transfers to low-tax countries. Congressional debate on health care reform includes concerns about the impact on small businesses, particularly regarding a \"pay or play\" mandate for health insurance coverage. The House and Senate bills propose exemptions for small businesses from penalties related to the \"pay or play\" mandate for health insurance coverage. Small firms with $500,000 or less in payroll or 50 or fewer employees would be exempt. Temporary credits are also provided to subsidize small employers' contributions to health insurance for lower-income employees. The subsidies for small employers' health insurance contributions depend on firm size and average employee compensation. The credits, up to 50% of the employer's cost, are the same in both House and Senate bills. The Tax Extenders Act of 2009 offers tax relief through the extension of expired provisions. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 4213 differ in revenue offsets, but both propose extensions for the research credit and the active financing exception. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 4213 propose extensions for various tax provisions, with differing revenue offsets. The House offsets costs through taxing carried interest as ordinary income and changing corporate estimated tax payments, while the Senate offsets costs through codifying the \"economic substance doctrine\" and excluding tax benefits for \"black liquor.\" A proposed amendment to H.R. 4213, the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010, aims to extend these provisions and offset costs by treating a portion of carried interest as ordinary income. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) contained business tax provisions, including incentives for alternative energy investment and cash-flow benefits for businesses. International tax provisions in the President's Budget Proposal aimed to close loopholes and raise $14.5 billion over 10 years. The ARRA focused on promoting renewable energy through the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) extension. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) included business tax provisions, with a focus on renewable energy incentives. The extension of the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) was a major component, costing $13.1 billion over 10 years. Other provisions aimed at increasing near-term cash flow included modifications to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and accelerated capital cost recovery measures. The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 included business tax provisions such as an extension of bonus depreciation and enhanced small business expensing. It also deferred certain income related to the discharge-of-indebtedness provision, estimated to cost $6.7 billion over 10 years. This act extended the carryback period for business losses and delayed the implementation of worldwide interest allocation rules. The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 included provisions for business tax relief, such as extended carryback period for losses and deferred income related to discharge-of-indebtedness. The act also delayed the implementation of worldwide interest allocation rules until 2018, aiming to correct flaws in foreign tax credit rules. The 111th Congress continued discussions on stimulating the economy through business tax cuts, focusing on cash-flow and investment measures to increase aggregate demand. These measures aim to provide businesses with immediate access to working capital to maintain operations. The 111th Congress focused on cash-flow and investment measures to stimulate the economy by providing businesses with immediate access to working capital. Examples include extending the net operating loss carryback period and bonus depreciation provisions. The 111th Congress focused on cash-flow and investment measures to stimulate the economy by providing businesses with immediate access to working capital, such as extending the net operating loss carryback period and bonus depreciation provisions. Temporary tax incentives were enacted for fixed periods to encourage specific investments or activities deemed economically or socially desirable. The question with each extender is whether market failure or a socially desirable goal justifies the intervention. According to economic theory, tax benefits that interfere with the market can reduce economic efficiency and overall welfare. The research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, enacted in 1981 and renewed multiple times, provides businesses with a tax benefit linked to increases in research spending. The credit aims to address market failure in research and development by incentivizing firms to invest more in R&D. The most recent extension of the R&E credit was in 2008 under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The Stabilization Act of 2008 increased the alternative simplified credit rate and repealed the alternative incremental research credit for the 2009 tax year. There is ongoing interest in extending and making the R&E tax credit permanent. Tax extenders, including the R&E credit, have been a recurring issue for Congress due to their temporary nature. The Tax Extenders Act of 2009 retroactively extended various temporary tax provisions through December 31, 2009. The Tax Extenders Act of 2009 (H.R. 4213) received congressional attention in 2010 for energy taxation, focusing on incentives for energy conservation and alternative energy sources. The ARRA included provisions to encourage investment in alternative energy. The President's FY2011 Budget Outline aimed to eliminate tax preferences for the oil and gas industry, estimated to raise $36.5 billion over 10 years. The repeal of the Section 199 domestic production deduction, enacted in The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, accounts for over 40% of the estimated $36.5 billion raised over 10 years. Another nearly 44% comes from eliminating provisions enacted during World War I, such as the expensing of intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion. Congress may also target corporate \"tax shelters\" to increase revenues, as they can impact tax equity and fairness perceptions. A tax shelter is a transaction that reduces taxes without reducing return or increasing risk. It can be illegal (tax evasion) or legal (tax avoidance). Congress has shown interest in restricting tax shelters, with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 containing provisions to limit specific tax shelters like leasing activities and acquiring losses for tax purposes. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (TIPRA) in 2006 included provisions to restrict tax sheltering activities, such as clarifying the economic substance doctrine. The Senate version aimed to disallow tax benefits for transactions lacking economic substance, but these provisions were not adopted. The President's FY2011 Budget Outline proposed codifying the economic substance doctrine. The President's FY2011 Budget Outline includes codifying the economic substance doctrine to raise $4.2 billion over 10 years. Congress may consider taxing U.S. firms' foreign income to generate additional revenue. Concerns about tax benefits promoting foreign outsourcing and the impact of tax policy on domestic employment are being discussed. Taxes can influence firms' decisions on overseas operations versus domestic investment. The tax benefit of \"deferral\" incentivizes U.S. firms to invest overseas in countries with low tax rates by allowing them to postpone U.S. tax on foreign income reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. While Subpart F provisions restrict deferral for passive investment income, recent legislation has focused on expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations. For example, the AJCA and TIPRA have both made changes to tax laws related to overseas operations. Several analysts argue that taxing overseas operations may be counterproductive in the modern integrated world economy. There is a consensus that the U.S. corporate income tax rate should be reduced, with major tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 focusing more on individual income taxes. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWA; P.L. 107-147) included tax cuts for married couples, child tax credit expansion, and various business tax cuts such as bonus depreciation, capital gains reductions, extenders, and provisions to boost U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWA; P.L. 107-147) included provisions for bonus depreciation, extended net operating loss carryback period, and temporary tax benefits for businesses. The act aimed to boost U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWA; P.L. 107-147) included business provisions such as tax cuts for dividends and capital gains, aiming to reduce double-taxation on corporate-source income. These reductions were temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of 2008. Additionally, the act increased bonus depreciation to 50% and extended coverage from May 5, 2003, to January 1, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357) addressed a dispute with the EU over U.S. tax benefits for exporting, repealed the extraterritorial provisions, and introduced new WTO-legal business tax cuts. The act was an omnibus business tax bill that went beyond addressing the ETI issue. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357) was an omnibus business tax bill that included a new domestic production deduction, tax cuts for multinational firms, and extended small business expensing allowances. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (TIPRA; P.L. 109-222) extended reduced rates for dividends and capital gains, while the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA; P.L. 109-432) extended various tax provisions that had expired in 2005. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA; P.L. 109-432) extended various tax provisions that had expired in 2005. The Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-28) included tax cuts for small businesses to offset the higher minimum wage. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-185) allowed for increased expensing of certain business assets and temporary \"bonus\" depreciation for property acquired in 2008. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-234) and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) included tax provisions for businesses related to renewable energy and energy efficiency."
