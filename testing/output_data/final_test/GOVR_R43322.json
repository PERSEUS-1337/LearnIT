    "content": "A National Security Letter (NSL) is similar to an administrative subpoena, requiring no prior judicial approval. Intelligence agencies issue NSLs to gather information from various institutions like telephone companies and banks. Several proposals to amend NSL authority were made in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses, but none were enacted. In the 113th Congress, NSLs were often linked with legislation addressing FISA authority, with a bill passing in the House but failing in the Senate. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, NSL statutes required communications providers to supply customer information upon FBI request for foreign counterintelligence investigations. S. 2685 failed to secure cloture in Congress, and no final action was taken on NSL proposals before adjournment. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the authority for the FBI to request customer information from communications providers for foreign counterintelligence investigations. This included obligations for financial institutions and consumer credit reporting agencies to provide relevant records upon certification by the FBI Director or designee. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the FBI's authority to request customer information for foreign counterintelligence investigations. Consumer credit reporting agencies were obligated to provide customer identification and financial institution details upon certification by the FBI Director. Section 802 of the National Security Act required consumer reporting agencies to provide consumer reports, financial information, and records to a wider range of federal officials for a more limited purpose. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the FBI's authority to request information from consumer reporting agencies, financial institutions, and holding companies for clearance purposes and security inquiries. Section 505 of the Act altered the FBI's NSL authority by expanding issuing authority, eliminating the requirement of specific facts linking to a foreign power, and requiring information to be sought for clearance purposes. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the FBI's authority to request information from consumer reporting agencies and financial institutions for security inquiries. It altered the NSL authority by removing the requirement of specific facts linking to a foreign power and requiring information to be relevant to national security investigations. The Act also added a new section obligating consumer reporting agencies to provide consumer information for investigations related to international terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act amended the NSL statutes to provide more explicit enforcement authority and address constitutional concerns. The amendments included removing the open-ended nondisclosure provisions and adding penalties for breaching confidentiality. The USA PATRIOT Act amended NSL statutes to include a judicial enforcement mechanism, penalties for non-compliance with nondisclosure requirements, and expanded congressional oversight. Department of Justice Inspector General reports highlighted a significant increase in FBI's use of NSLs from 8,500 requests in 2000 to 47,000 in 2005. The use of NSLs increased significantly from 8,500 requests in 2000 to 47,000 in 2005, with a majority involving telephone or email communications. The reports provided insight into how NSL statutes, like 18 U.S.C. 2709, were used in counterterrorism cases to obtain telephone records and subscriber information for investigative purposes. The FBI used telephone records to identify individuals in the same area as the subject, leading to investigations on a potential terrorist cell. NSLs were primarily used to gather evidence for FISA orders, including access to bank transaction records under the RFPA statute. This was demonstrated in a counterterrorism investigation of convenience store owners in the US. The FBI conducted a counterterrorism investigation on convenience store owners in the US who allegedly sent funds to known Hawaladars in the Middle East, suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda affiliates. The investigation revealed possible violations including money laundering, sale of untaxed cigarettes, check cashing fraud, and other fraudulent activities. National security letters were issued to obtain bank account records, uncovering large sums of money transfers among the subjects. The FBI used National Security Letters (NSLs) to track money transfers among convenience store owners suspected of ties to Al Qaeda affiliates. The NSLs helped identify sources and recipients of the transfers, enabling the FBI to gather information on the subjects' day-to-day activities and potential white-collar crimes. The information obtained from NSLs was used to determine if further investigation was needed, generate leads for other agencies, and corroborate data from other investigative techniques. The FBI used National Security Letters (NSLs) to gather information for analytical intelligence reports and databases, but a report criticized the FBI for using NSLs in violation of statutes and policies. Additionally, the FBI issued \"exigent letters\" to obtain phone records without following proper procedures in some cases. The report criticized the FBI for obtaining financial and telephone records without proper authorization, issuing over 700 exigent letters circumventing regulations, initiating NSLs without effective review, and violating internal control policies. Violations included not retaining signed NSL copies, lack of clear guidance on investigative techniques, and inaccurate data collection. Prior to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the Supreme Court ruled that customers had no Fourth Amendment privacy rights in telephone records. The FBI's misuse of NSL authority did not constitute criminal conduct, with personnel considering NSLs essential for investigations and information from NSLs being input into FBI systems. SAC supervision of attorneys reviewing NSL legal adequacy sometimes hindered questioning of investigations previously approved by the SAC. The Fourth Amendment requirements can be eased in exigent circumstances, such as the threat of evidence destruction or danger to officers. The ECPA prohibits communication service providers from disclosing customer records without exceptions like a grand jury subpoena or NSL. Violating this prohibition can lead to civil liability, but not criminal penalties. The Inspector General found that the FBI obtained telephone records using \"exigent letters\" before serving NSLs or grand jury subpoenas. The FBI stopped using exigent letters but can still request emergency disclosures under certain circumstances. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel advised the FBI on this matter. The Office of Legal Counsel advised the FBI that ECPA may allow electronic communications providers to disclose call detail records voluntarily. The second IG Report reviewed the FBI's use of national security letters in 2006, noting an increase in requests from investigations of U.S. persons. The FBI and DOJ are working to address the issues identified. The FBI and DOJ are committed to correcting problems identified in IG Report I regarding NSLs issued in 2006. Significant progress has been made, but it is too early to definitively state if new systems will fully eliminate issues. The third IG Report found that the FBI's use of exigent letters became casual and unsupervised, with employees of communication service providers generating letters for FBI personnel to sign. The FBI's use of informal requests for telephone records, facilitated by employees assigned to FBI offices, led to a culture of casual access without proper justification or legal process. This practice, known as sneak peeks, allowed FBI personnel to view telephone records without documentation, leading to widespread use of exigent letters and other informal requests. The FBI obtained telephone records through improper means, violating guidelines and policies. The IG's Report criticized the FBI's actions but acknowledged steps taken to address the issues. The current secrecy and judicial review provisions for NSLs must be considered in light of legal decisions. The recipient of a National Security Letter (NSL) is required to keep the request or response secret unless disclosure may pose a danger to national security, diplomatic relations, ongoing investigations, or individual safety. They can disclose the request to comply with it and seek legal advice. The recipient can petition the court to modify or lift the secrecy requirement within a year of issuance. The court may modify or set aside NSL secrecy restrictions if disclosure does not endanger national security, personal safety, or interfere with investigations. Recipients can petition the court to modify or lift the secrecy requirement if compliance is unreasonable or oppressive. The \"unreasonable or oppressive\" standard is used for grand jury and other subpoenas issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, providing protection against undue burdens and protecting privileged communications. Compliance with a particular NSL might be burdensome, but few federally recognized privileges are suggested in the circumstances under which NSLs are used. The court has the authority to modify or set aside an NSL that is deemed \"unlawful\" to ensure compliance with statutory provisions. The court has authority to enforce National Security Letters (NSLs) against recipients who fail to comply, punishable by contempt of court. Breach of confidentiality requirements can result in imprisonment and fines. The Second Circuit outlined procedures for NSLs to pass First Amendment scrutiny, including recipient notification of contesting secrecy orders and annual judicial review applications. The District Court for the Northern District of California agreed with the Second Circuit that the secrecy provisions of NSLs violate the First Amendment and separation of powers principles. The court also found that the judicial review section of NSLs violates both the First Amendment and separation of powers principles. Additionally, the court determined that the constitutional defects in the confidentiality components of the NSL statutes invalidate the statutes as a whole. Bills in the 113th Congress proposed adjustments to the NSL statutes in four areas. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, NSL statutes required certification by a senior FBI official for specific information related to a foreign power. Proposed adjustments in four areas included grounds for issuing NSLs, confidentiality requirements, reports and audits, and sunset and repeal. The USA PATRIOT Act removed requirements for certification by a senior FBI official for specific information related to a foreign power in National Security Letters (NSLs). Now, the Director of the FBI can request certain information relevant to investigations on international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities without the previous restrictions. The USA PATRIOT Act removed certification requirements for specific information in National Security Letters (NSLs), allowing the FBI Director to request information for investigations on international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The \"specific and articulable\" facts standard in investigations may not always translate well in a counterterrorism context. Counterterrorism cases involve complex networks with a larger volume of communication and financial transactions, making it challenging to meet the legal standards. The \"specific and articulable facts\" standard may be difficult to apply as the foreign power in terrorism cases is often an imperfectly understood terrorist organization. This can lead to challenges in identifying individual suspects. S. 1551 (Wyden) and S. 1599 (Leahy) proposed amendments to NSL statutes to specify categories of individuals whose records may be accessed, aiming to address challenges in counterterrorism cases. The bills aimed to restrict the scope of NSL statutes by limiting requests for bulk collection dumps and requiring requests for specific selection terms related to communications, financial records, or credit information. The prohibition on using the authority in investigations based solely on First Amendment-protected activities was preserved. The Director of the FBI can request information using specific selection terms for authorized investigations. NSL statutes have nondisclosure provisions to protect national security. The NSL statutes have provisions for nondisclosure to protect national security, allowing a federal district court to modify or set aside secrecy requirements if disclosure does not pose a danger. The Second Circuit ruled that these provisions must withstand First Amendment scrutiny through judicial review. The agency's proposed order is narrowly crafted to address adverse consequences of disclosure. The Ninth Circuit's district court opinion on National Security Letters found confidentiality provisions constitutionally invalid and not severable from the NSL statutes. S. 1599 and S. 2685 would have modified provisions for NSL nondisclosure orders. The proposed legislation aims to amend provisions for National Security Letters (NSLs) by narrowing the justification for national security risks and adding specific grounds for criminal investigations. It includes factors like risk of flight, destruction of evidence, and witness intimidation as exigent circumstances for warrant execution without prior announcement. S. 1599 and S. 2685 would have also revised the judicial review process for NSL nondisclosure orders. The proposed legislation aimed to amend provisions for National Security Letters (NSLs) by narrowing the justification for national security risks and adding specific grounds for criminal investigations. It included an expanded list of concerns for imposing a nondisclosure order, such as endangering national security, interfering with diplomatic relations, or alerting a target of the investigation. Recipients would have the right to judicial review within 30 days of a request, and the agency would need to provide a statement of facts supporting the nondisclosure order.

It included an expanded list of concerns for imposing a nondisclosure order, such as endangering national security, interfering with diplomatic relations, or alerting a target of the investigation. Recipients would have the right to judicial review within 30 days of a request, and the agency would need to provide a statement of facts supporting the nondisclosure order. The bills proposed changes to make NSLs subject to judicial review and require recipients to be notified of this. The bill aimed to amend NSL provisions by narrowing national security risk justifications and adding grounds for criminal investigations. It required notice to recipients of the right to appeal a nondisclosure order within 30 days. The court would give \"substantial weight\" to the government's certification of adverse consequences. Sections of the USA PATRIOT Act called for NSL-related reports and audits to be provided to congressional committees. Section 118(c) and Section 119 of the USA PATRIOT Act required reports and audits on the use of National Security Letters (NSLs). Bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements, with S. 1215 and S. 1599 calling for more detailed reports to be submitted to congressional committees twice a year. The reports would cover the number of NSL requests related to different categories of individuals. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements for National Security Letters (NSLs). S. 1551 and S. 2685 would have required breakdowns of reported totals according to different categories of individuals, including U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons. Additionally, some bills would have allowed recipients of NSLs to publicly disclose information about the number of requests they received. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements for National Security Letters (NSLs. H.R. 3035, S. 1551, and S. 1599 would have allowed recipients to issue periodic reports on the number of NSL requests they received, organized by statute or categories. They would also have immunized providers from liability for good faith exercise of the authority provided. Section 119 called for an NSL audit by the Department of Justice Inspector General for 2002-2006, while S. 1215 and S. 1599 would have called for a similar audit for 2010-2013. The bills would have also called for audits by the intelligence community Inspectors General. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements for National Security Letters (NSLs. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community would have performed an assessment covering the period from 2010 to 2013, including the importance of NSL information, collection methods, any improper practices, and the use of NSLs. Section 627 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is considered the most comprehensive NSL statute. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements for National Security Letters (NSLs) under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Several bills proposed repealing certain provisions to centralize NSL authority in the FBI. S. 1215 and S. 1599 would have returned NSL statutes to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form, making them temporary. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements for National Security Letters (NSLs) under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. S. 1215 and S. 1599 would have returned NSL statutes to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form, establishing a transition provision for investigations or offenses begun prior to June 1, 2015. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded authority under existing laws but did not expand the reach of the NSL statute. A return to the pre-USA PATRIOT Act state would eliminate the amendments made by the act. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to expand reporting requirements for National Security Letters (NSLs) under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. S. 1215 and S. 1599 sought to return NSL statutes to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form, requiring approval by higher FBI officials and limiting investigations based solely on First Amendment protected activities. The USA PATRIOT Act changed the National Security Letter (NSL) statutes, allowing approval by higher FBI officials and removing restrictions on investigations related to First Amendment rights. Recipients were prohibited from disclosing NSL requests and had no means to challenge the nondisclosure requirement. The USA PATRIOT Act amended NSL statutes to allow higher FBI approval and removed restrictions on First Amendment investigations. Recipients were barred from disclosing NSL requests, but Congress addressed this by creating a permanent review section, 18 U.S.C. 3511, for judicial oversight. The National Security Act NSL statute, unamended by the USA PATRIOT Act, is the least intrusive, reaching only information on federal employees who consent to disclosure. The Senate Judiciary Committee added a sunset provision to ensure careful review of NSL issuance after the standard was lowered in 2001, leading to a spike in NSL use. The use of National Security Letters (NSLs) spiked after the standard for issuing them was lowered in 2001. In 2006, nearly 50,000 NSLs were issued compared to fewer than 10,000 in 2001. Inspector General audits in the 2005 USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill revealed over-collection of information and abuse of NSL authority. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Minority Views objected to returning NSL statutes to their pre-PATRIOT Act versions, which required specific and articulable facts linking the requested information to a foreign power or agent. The pre-PATRIOT Act requirement for National Security Letters (NSLs) prevented the FBI from using them early in investigations, hindering their effectiveness in terrorism or espionage cases. Rolling back the sensible NSL reforms made in the USA PATRIOT Act is unnecessary. Financial institutions must comply with FBI requests for customer financial records.
