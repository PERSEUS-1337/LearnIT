Additionally, 677 military personnel were wounded in action, with 275 returning to duty within 72 hours. In OIF, there were 2,242 fatalities, with 1,761 hostile deaths and 481 non-hostile deaths. 16,420 military personnel were wounded in action, with 8,812 returning to duty within 72 hours. Private First Class Keith M. Maupin was the only U.S. soldier classified as a POW, captured on April 9, 2004. Between 2001 and January 17, 2006, 532,539 reservists were involuntarily called to active duty for ONE, OEF, and OIF. 126,345 were serving on active duty as of January 17, 2006, while 406,005 had been demobilized before that date. Reservists were called under Partial Mobilization, allowing activation for up to 24 months during a national emergency. The total number mobilized is likely lower due to some being called up multiple times. The President can mobilize up to 1 million Ready Reserve members for a maximum of 24 consecutive months during a national emergency without Congress approval. DOD's policy generally limits reservists to one year of active duty, but they can serve up to 24 cumulative months if needed for operational requirements. The President can mobilize up to 1 million Ready Reserve members for a maximum of 24 consecutive months during a national emergency without Congress approval. DOD's policy limits reservists to one year of active duty, but they can serve up to 24 cumulative months if needed for operational requirements. Reservists could be mobilized multiple times for tours of 24 consecutive months apiece if DOD changes its policy to mirror the law. National Guard members have been called up for duties related to ONE in a non-federal status and were activated under Title 32 of the U.S. Code for additional security at airports in 2001 and 2002. These distinctions affect pay, benefits, and legal protections for the affected individuals. The Department of Defense has an administrative policy for \"sole surviving\" sons and daughters in the military, allowing them to apply for protective assignment status to avoid combat duties. Enlisted personnel in this situation may also be granted a discharge. The term \"sole surviving son or daughter\" is defined by the DOD as the only remaining child in a family. The Department of Defense has a policy for \"sole surviving\" sons and daughters in the military, allowing them to apply for protective assignment status to avoid combat duties. The term is defined as the only remaining child in a family where a parent or sibling served in the Armed Forces and faced certain circumstances. The issue is different from the fictional \"Sullivan Act\" based on five brothers who died in World War II. The Navy issued a policy after a tragedy involving three brothers on the U.S.S. Arizona, but it was not enforced. Current DOD policy allows family members to serve together, but reassignment requests may be approved. No law governs the treatment of conscientious objectors serving in the military. The Department of Defense has an administrative policy for conscientious objectors in the military. Those who develop moral objections to war after joining can apply for transfer or discharge. A formal investigation determines if conscientious objector status is granted based on DOD criteria. Conscientious objector status is determined by the DOD policy based on the individual's opposition to all wars. In 2000, over 100 servicemembers applied for this status, increasing to over 400 in 2004, with approximately half being approved. Family members of killed, captured, or disabled service members can request exemption from serving in hostile-fire areas. Under federal law, the President has the authority to suspend laws related to promotion, retirement, and separation of military personnel during a period when Reserve Component members are involuntarily ordered to active federal service. This authority has been delegated to the Secretary of Defense since 1990. The President delegated authority to military services in 2001 to implement \"stop-loss\" policies, retaining personnel with critical skills during crises. The Army has a unit-based stop-loss policy for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, delaying personnel departure for 90 days after return to maintain unit cohesion and military effectiveness. The Army has both an Active Army and Reserve Component Unit Stop Loss program, impacting soldiers from 90 days before mobilization through demobilization, affecting 12,467 soldiers as of December 31, 2005. Stop loss does not affect involuntary separations like discharges for criminal acts or modify service policies leading to administrative or medical discharge. Congress requires the Secretary of Defense to report on informing new enlistees about stop loss policies. Military personnel in OEF and OIF may be eligible for Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger Pay. Military personnel serving in OEF and OIF are eligible for Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger Pay (HF/IDP) authorized by 37 U.S.C. 310. This special pay compensates servicemembers for physical danger in designated imminent danger zones like Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Eligibility requires serving some time in these zones, with the rate set at $225 per month. Hardship Duty Pay (HDP) is compensation for military personnel serving in demanding duty locations, with the maximum amount recently increased to $750 per month by Congress. Family Separation Allowance (FSA) provides special pay for servicemembers with dependents separated for more than 30 days. The Family Separation Allowance (FSA) provides special pay for U.S. military personnel separated from their dependents for 30 continuous days or more, with a rate of $250 per month. Additionally, service members deployed to designated areas can participate in the Savings Deposit Program, earning a guaranteed 10 percent interest on deposits up to $10,000. The deposit is returned with interest within 90 days of leaving the eligible region. Military personnel serving in combat zones like Afghanistan and Iraq are eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion, which means their compensation is free of federal income tax. This benefit also applies to those in direct support of operations in these regions. The death gratuity is a lump sum payment to the surviving spouse or children of a servicemember who dies in the line of duty. The payment amount was recently increased to $100,000 for all active duty deaths and may also be paid if death occurs within 120 days after release from active duty due to injury or disease incurred during military service. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a lump sum payment to the designated beneficiary or next of kin of a servicemember who dies in the line of duty. All military members are automatically enrolled in the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) for a maximum benefit of $400,000, which pays benefits in the event of combat-related deaths. Additionally, active duty personnel are covered by the SBP, which entitles the surviving spouse to an annuity if the servicemember dies while on active duty. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides an annuity to the surviving spouse based on the deceased's pay and years of service. SBP benefits may be affected by Social Security and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. SBP payments cease if the surviving spouse remarries before age 55. The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) program provides monthly payments to unremarried surviving spouses or eligible children of servicemembers who die due to service-related illnesses or injuries. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides an annuity to the surviving spouse based on the deceased's pay and years of service. SBP benefits may be affected by Social Security and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). Surviving spouses and children of servicemembers who die while on active duty may be eligible for Social Security Survivor benefits based on various factors. Remarriage can impact benefits. The military service provides reimbursement for various expenses related to the burial of deceased servicemembers, including recovery and identification of remains, notification of next of kin, preparation of remains for burial, furnishing of clothing and casket, hearse service, funeral director's service, transportation of remains, and interment. Members of the Armed Forces who die while on active duty are eligible for burial in national cemeteries, including Arlington National Cemetery. The government provides a grave site, opening and closing of the grave, headstone or marker, and maintenance of the site at no cost to the family. Interment of cremated remains in a columbarium is also an option. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act allows the Secretary of Defense to permit the family of a servicemember who dies on active duty to remain in government quarters for up to 365 days. The government allows the family of a deceased servicemember on active duty to stay in government quarters for up to 365 days or receive Basic Allowance for Housing for the same period. The unremarried surviving spouse is eligible for TRICARE until age 65, then TRICARE for Life with Medicare coverage. Children remain eligible for TRICARE until age 21, with possible extensions for certain circumstances. The surviving family members of a deceased servicemember receive TRICARE benefits at the active duty dependent rate for three years, then at retiree dependent rates. The unremarried surviving spouse and children have access to commissary and exchange systems indefinitely. Children can access these facilities until age 21 or marriage, with possible extensions for full-time enrollment in higher education or severe disability. The Survivors' and Dependants' Educational Assistance program provides educational assistance for unremarried surviving spouses and eligible children of servicemembers who die in the line of duty. The Survivors' and Dependants' Educational Assistance program provides benefits for surviving spouses and eligible children of servicemembers who die in the line of duty. The monthly payment is $803 for full-time attendance at eligible institutions, with a lesser amount for part-time attendance. Unremarried spouses have up to ten years to use this benefit, and children can generally receive benefits between the ages of 18 and 26. This benefit can be used for various types of education and training programs. Effective December 1, 2005, the TSGLI program was established to provide traumatic injury coverage for service members, offering immediate payments ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 based on the severity of the condition. This program aims to ease the financial burden associated with hospitalization, recovery, and rehabilitation for individuals with severe injuries. The TSGLI program, established in December 2005, provides immediate compensation for service members with severe injuries, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000. It is retroactive to October 7, 2001 for injuries in OEF or OIF. Service members wounded in combat zones receive a special pay of $430 per month during hospitalization, recovery, and rehabilitation, which is reduced by hostile fire pay. Previous legislation waived meal charges for hospitalized service members. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act exempts service members from paying for meals while receiving continuous care for injuries incurred in support of military operations. This exemption is effective from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006. Military personnel, including reservists, are eligible for legal protections under the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act of 2003. National Guardsmen on full-time duty under Title 32 are also covered by the SCRA. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides legal protections for military personnel, including reservists and National Guardsmen on full-time duty under Title 32. It offers safeguards against rental property evictions, mortgage foreclosures, insurance cancellations, and government property seizures. The SCRA also limits interest rates on pre-service loans to 6 percent, except for student loans. These protections typically apply during active military service or shortly thereafter. Congress and the executive branch were in disagreement over the military's ability to handle multiple missions due to manpower levels. Concerns about high personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO) levels affecting retention led to laws requiring tracking of PERSTEMPO and allowances for lengthy deployments. General Eric Shinseki and Secretary of the Army Thomas White proposed increasing the Army's end strength due to mission demands. Since September 11, 2001, operations have increased the Army's manpower needs, leading to the call up of reservists and longer duty days. This response has enabled the military to perform its missions, but concerns exist about low retention rates and performance levels if sustained. Congress and the executive branch are in disagreement over the military's ability to handle multiple missions. In response to increased manpower needs since September 11, 2001, Congress and the executive branch have taken actions to address concerns about low retention rates and performance levels in the military. This includes authorizing increases in the size of the active Army and Marine Corps in various defense authorization acts, such as the FY2005 and FY2006 National Defense Authorization Acts. The FY2005 and FY2006 National Defense Authorization Acts authorized increases in the size of the active Army and Marine Corps to address manpower needs post-9/11. The Army is facing recruiting shortfalls, leading to difficulties in increasing its strength. Reorganization efforts aim to increase deployable units and reduce PERSTEMPO rates. Shifts from reserve to active components and retraining personnel are also strategies to address manpower strain.

Shifts from reserve to active components and retraining personnel are also strategies to address manpower strain. Suggestions to meet manpower needs include shifting skills from lower to higher demand areas, contracting out functions to the private sector, using technologies to reduce manpower needs, and increasing allied military participation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reinstating the draft would require congressional approval, but it appears unlikely at present. The military is meeting its retention objectives and has a large pool of trained personnel in the reserves to augment its active forces. Conscription is not useful for producing high skill specialists like intelligence analysts, linguists, and pilots. However, a draft might be considered if reconstruction and counter-insurgency operations in Iraq require a major U.S. presence for a prolonged period. A draft could be considered for expanding the Army quickly with a large number of personnel who do not need specialized skills. Congress might consider a draft if there is a need to dramatically increase the size of the Army in a short period of time. See CRS Report RL31682 for a detailed discussion on arguments for and against a draft."
