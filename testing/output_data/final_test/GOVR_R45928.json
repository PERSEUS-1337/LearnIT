    "content": "The federal contraceptive coverage requirement under the ACA was developed and modified by subsequent agency guidelines and rules. Before the ACA, state requirements varied for health plans covering contraception, with access often subject to cost-sharing. Religious exemptions also varied by state, and laws only applied to insurance plans sold within that state, excluding self-insured employer-sponsored health plans governed by ERISA. The ACA required certain health plans to cover preventive services without cost sharing, including contraception for women as per HRSA guidelines. The Institute of Medicine recommended including FDA-approved contraceptive methods in HRSA guidelines for women's preventive services. HRSA adopted this recommendation in 2011, applying it to plan years starting from August 1, 2012, with exemptions for certain religious employers. In 2012, HHS announced a temporary \"safe harbor\" for nonexempt, nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contraception coverage. In 2013, HHS, DOL, and the Treasury issued a final rule to simplify the religious employer exemption and establish accommodations for eligible organizations. The 2013 Rule established an accommodation process for eligible organizations with religious objections to contraception. Eligible organizations could comply by completing a self-certification form and sending it to their insurers or third-party administrators. Insurers were then required to exclude contraceptive coverage from the applicable plans. The 2013 Rule established an accommodation process for eligible organizations with religious objections to contraception. Insurers were required to exclude contraceptive coverage from the applicable plans but separately pay for any required services. Numerous organizations filed lawsuits challenging the requirement and the accommodation process. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) prohibits the federal government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion, except under narrow circumstances. It requires the government to show that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. This strict scrutiny standard, particularly the \"least restrictive means\" requirement, is exceptionally demanding. RFRA extends beyond what the Court has held is constitutionally required. Challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement focused on whether for-profit corporations were protected by RFRA and if requiring coverage of contraception violated RFRA. The Supreme Court addressed these issues in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., ruling in favor of closely held corporations objecting to providing coverage for certain contraceptives. The Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. that closely held corporations, like Hobby Lobby, were covered by RFRA. They argued that providing insurance coverage for contraception violated their religious beliefs as they believed life begins at conception. The Court rejected the argument that for-profit corporations could not exercise religion, stating they could do so through business practices. The Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. that closely held corporations, like Hobby Lobby, could exercise religion through business practices. The Court analyzed whether the contraceptive coverage requirement substantially burdened the challengers' exercise of religion based on their sincerely held belief that providing coverage for certain forms of contraception would violate their religious beliefs. The Court focused on whether the burden imposed by the coverage requirement was substantial. The Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. that the contraceptive coverage requirement imposed a substantial burden on the challengers' religious beliefs. Despite acknowledging a compelling governmental interest, the Court found that the accommodation process for nonprofit organizations with religious objections was a less restrictive means to achieve the same goal. The Court held that applying the contraceptive coverage requirement to closely held corporations violated RFRA. A rule was finalized in response to the Hobby Lobby decision, extending the accommodation to for-profit entities with religious objections. Challenges to the accommodation process for contraceptive coverage requirement remained unresolved. The college's objection to submitting EBSA Form 700 due to religious beliefs was upheld by the Supreme Court, allowing them to be exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement. The Supreme Court upheld a college's objection to submitting EBSA Form 700 based on religious beliefs, allowing them to be exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement. HHS issued an interim rule on August 27, 2014, providing eligible organizations an alternative to EBSA Form 700, allowing them to notify HHS of their objections to providing coverage for FDA-approved contraception. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to deny a college a preliminary injunction regarding the provision of contraception in student benefit plans. The court ruled that the college could notify either its TPA or the government of its objection to providing contraception, allowing the government to designate the TPA to provide the coverage. Compliance with the accommodation process was not seen as making the college complicit in providing contraception. The Seventh Circuit upheld the accommodation process for providing contraception in student benefit plans, ruling that colleges notifying their objection did not make them complicit. Appellate courts in eight circuits also found the process did not burden religious exercise, rejecting claims that providing notice triggered contraception provision. The Eighth Circuit was the first to hold that the accommodation process violated RFRA, with judges like Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissenting. They reasoned that self-certification under the process would violate religious beliefs. The Eighth Circuit ruled that the accommodation process for providing contraceptive coverage violated RFRA due to religious beliefs. The court found that the process was not the least-restrictive means for the government to provide access to cost-free contraception. The Supreme Court vacated the Zubik decisions and remanded the cases to the circuit courts after parties clarified that contraceptive coverage could be provided to employees without burdening religious exercise. The Supreme Court vacated the Zubik decisions and remanded the cases to the circuit courts to find a solution that accommodates petitioners' religious exercise while ensuring women receive full contraceptive coverage. The government was enjoined from penalizing petitioners for not providing notice, and the executive branch took further actions on the contraceptive coverage requirement. The Departments sought public input on revising the contraceptive coverage requirement but had not found a feasible solution to address concerns of religious objectors while ensuring women receive full coverage. President Trump's executive order directed the Departments to consider amended regulations to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate. The Departments reversed their position on contraceptive coverage, issuing two interim final rules making the accommodation process optional for organizations with religious or moral objections. Organizations could voluntarily shift the obligation to provide coverage. The EBSA Form 700 or specified notice allows organizations to voluntarily shift the obligation of providing contraceptive coverage. An individual exemption allows employers and issuers to offer alternative policies for those who object based on religious beliefs or moral convictions. The Religious Exemption IFR is estimated to affect the contraceptive costs of around 31,700 women. The agencies estimated that the total costs potentially transferred to affected women would be around $18.5 million. They also projected a potential transfer cost of $63.8 million for approximately 120,000 women under the Religious Exemption IFR. The Moral Exemption IFR was estimated to affect the contraceptive costs of 15 women, totaling approximately $8,760. The 2019 Final Rules, which included the Religious and Moral Exemption IFRs, were finalized on November 15, 2018, with effective dates of January 14, 2019. The 2019 Final Rules clarified the regulatory text and increased the estimate of affected women to 126,400, with potential transfer costs of $67.3 million. Legal challenges arose from states and private parties, leading to injunctions against the prior accommodation process. In Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, legal challenges arose regarding the 2019 Final Rules, with Pennsylvania and New Jersey alleging procedural violations and arbitrary decision-making. The U.S. District Court and Third Circuit ruled in favor of the states, finding violations of the Administrative Procedure Act in issuing the rules. The U.S. District Court and Third Circuit found procedural violations in issuing the 2019 Final Rules, stating that the Departments did not provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment and exceeded their authority under the ACA. The Third Circuit disagreed with the Departments' argument that the expanded Religious Exemption in the 2019 Final Rules was necessary to comply with RFRA, stating that RFRA authorized courts to determine if a law burdens religious exercise without needing to defer to the Departments' assessment. The Third Circuit disagreed with the Departments' argument that the expanded Religious Exemption in the 2019 Final Rules was necessary to comply with RFRA. The court concluded that the prior accommodation process already complied with RFRA and making compliance optional for religious objectors would burden female employees. The circuit court upheld the district court's decision to issue a nationwide preliminary injunction to prevent the likely unlawful 2019 Final Rules from taking effect in some states. The Supreme Court granted petitions for certiorari from the federal government and the Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home, consolidating the appeals regarding contraceptive coverage. Over 50 amicus briefs have been filed in support or opposition. Members of Congress have also submitted briefs on the matter. Some Members of Congress have filed briefs in opposition or support of the Third Circuit's ruling on the central question in Little Sisters of the Poor case. The federal government argues that HRSA has the authority to develop guidelines for contraceptive coverage exemptions under the ACA and RFRA. The government argues that the Religious Exemption is necessary for employers with conscientious objections due to the substantial burden of mandatory contraceptive coverage. Little Sisters contends that the prior accommodation process was insufficient and the certification process was merely another way to comply with the mandate. State-respondents urge the Supreme Court to affirm the Third Circuit's ruling. The states ask the Supreme Court to affirm the Third Circuit's ruling on the case, arguing that federal agencies overstepped their authority in creating exemptions from mandatory laws under the ACA. They emphasize that RFRA does not grant broad rulemaking authority to agencies and that the accommodation effectively exempts employers without a violation. The party claims RFRA authorizes moral rule exemptions. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Massachusetts challenged expanded exemptions. First Circuit reversed district court ruling, remanded case to consider violations of APA, First Amendment, and Fifth Amendment. Motions for summary judgment pending. Legal issues surrounding the challenge to the 2019 Final Rules were pending in district court alongside cases in California, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. 14 states sought to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the rules, with claims including APA, Establishment Clause, and Equal Protection Clause violations. The district court decided on statutory grounds, granting injunctive relief. The court granted injunctive relief on statutory grounds, finding that the final rules likely violated the APA and were not authorized by RFRA. A preliminary injunction was issued against enforcement in plaintiff states only. The Ninth Circuit upheld the decision, stating that the agencies lacked statutory authority under the ACA for the final rules and that RFRA did not permit the Religious Exemption. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision, stating that the Religious Exemption contradicts congressional intent and that a blanket exemption for religious objectors is at odds with RFRA. The Pennsylvania and California actions resulted in preliminary injunctions against the 2019 Final Rules, with a nationwide injunction also in place. In DeOtte v. Azar, the court certified two classes. In DeOtte v. Azar, the court certified two classes of objectors to the contraceptive coverage requirements in the Northern District of Texas. The \"Employer Class\" includes current and future employers in the US objecting based on religious beliefs to providing coverage for contraceptive services. The \"Individual Class\" includes individuals in the US who object to contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs and are willing to purchase insurance without such coverage. The court granted summary judgment to classes objecting to contraceptive coverage requirements based on religious beliefs. The Employer Class argued that executing accommodation forms is immoral, while the Individual Class claimed purchasing plans with contraception coverage burdens their religious exercise. The court found the requirement imposed a substantial burden on these groups. The court found that the contraceptive coverage requirement imposed a substantial burden on religious groups and concluded it was insufficiently tailored. The government was permanently enjoined from enforcing the requirement against objecting employers and insurers, allowing them to offer plans without contraceptive coverage. A \"safe harbor\" was included in the final order for the government to determine sincere religious objectors. The court ruled to enforce the contraceptive coverage requirement with sincere religious objectors and seek a declaration for those with doubted sincerity. The State of Nevada's motion to intervene was denied, leaving the implementation of the requirement uncertain. The rulings affect regulatory frameworks pre and post expanded exemptions. Injunctions in Pennsylvania and California don't prevent qualifying entities from using exemptions or accommodations. Government enforcement is limited due to injunctions in cases like DeOtte regarding accommodation notification. The Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters of the Poor could clarify the validity of the 2019 Final Rules and exemptions for employers with religious objections to contraceptive coverage. A ruling affirming the injunction may invalidate the rules in some states, prompting the Department to issue new regulations or guidance. The ongoing public policy debate over religious exemptions to contraceptive coverage could be clarified by the Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters of the Poor. A ruling in favor of the 2019 Final Rules could lead to expanded exemptions, leaving further amendments to the federal contraceptive coverage requirement to the Departments and Congress. The decision may also address whether RFRA allows federal agencies to exempt entities from generally applicable laws. The Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters of the Poor could clarify the ability of federal agencies to exempt entities from laws that burden religious exercise. This decision may also address whether agencies must consider the interests of third parties, such as women seeking contraceptive coverage under the ACA. Litigation may continue regarding the authority of agencies to exempt objecting universities or employers from contraceptive coverage requirements. Amicus briefs from Members of Congress highlight differing views on what RFRA requires of federal agencies. The Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters of the Poor may clarify federal agencies' ability to exempt entities from laws burdening religious exercise. A group of 186 Members of Congress argue that RFRA does not grant authority to agencies to craft exemptions to laws enacted by Congress, potentially limiting religious liberties. The Supreme Court ruling on the 2019 Final Rules may not prevent Congress from amending the coverage requirement or RFRA itself. Lawmakers have proposed various approaches to recalibrate contraceptive coverage, including government involvement in facilitating access and clarifying responsibilities for accommodating religious objections. Some have suggested amending the ACA's preventive services coverage requirements to explicitly include contraception. Legislation may amend preventive services requirement to include contraceptive care, potentially supporting a compelling interest in providing cost-free coverage for contraception through employer-sponsored health plans. The Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby assumed a compelling interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to contraceptive methods. The 2019 Final Rules suggested that the government may not have a compelling interest in contraceptive coverage, as Congress left the decision to the agencies. Proposals to expand contraceptive coverage could face challenges from religious objectors asserting a substantial burden on their religious exercise under RFRA. RFRA applies to all federal statutes unless explicitly excluded. Some legislation concerning contraception includes language excepting those provisions from RFRA or excluding RFRA claims. Bills introduced after Hobby Lobby aimed to prevent employers from denying coverage required by federal law, despite RFRA. Proposed amendments to RFRA would limit its strict scrutiny standard for certain healthcare laws. Some laws exclude RFRA from contraceptive coverage requirements, allowing challenges based on the Free Exercise Clause. Suggestions include funding separate contraceptive coverage or expanding access to free contraception programs to accommodate religious objectors. The Departments issued a rule allowing federally funded family planning projects to provide contraceptive services to women whose employers have religious or moral exemptions. Proposals aim to provide alternatives to requiring private parties to offer contraceptive coverage, reducing potential legal challenges. Other suggestions include codifying exemptions for entities with religious objections to the coverage requirement. The Protection Act of 2014 aimed to prevent HHS from enforcing rules related to requiring coverage of sterilization or contraceptive services for individuals or entities with religious objections. It also proposed a special rule in the ACA to exempt health plans from providing such coverage based on religious or moral beliefs. Statutory exemptions for contraceptive coverage could potentially prevent future litigation. Statutory exemptions to the contraceptive coverage requirement could prevent future litigation over the Departments' authority under the ACA to create categorical exemptions. Broader exemptions may reduce potential challenges under RFRA or Free Exercise, but could lead to Establishment Clause challenges. The Supreme Court's stance on accommodating both clauses remains uncertain. Little Sisters of the Poor case marks the fourth Supreme Court term in six years dealing with the federal contraceptive coverage requirement. During this time period, the Departments issued six rules on the requirement, a change in administration affected their approach to RFRA, and the Supreme Court saw two new Justices appointed. The Court may address the coverage requirement in the Little Sisters of the Poor case, while Congress and the executive branch also play a role in shaping future decisions."
