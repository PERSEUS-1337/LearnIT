Congress finds that between 1951 and 1992, the US conducted over 900 nuclear weapons tests at the Nevada Test Site, with 100 above-ground tests, some larger than the Hiroshima bomb. Despite 804 underground tests, significant radioactive fallout occurred. Research on health effects was not disclosed until 1979, leaving American citizens uninformed. The American government conducted over 900 nuclear weapons tests between 1951 and 1992, leading to significant radioactive fallout. Despite public pressure in the 1980s, only one comprehensive study on radiation exposure, specifically iodine-131, has been conducted. This lack of information left American citizens unaware of the health risks associated with radiation exposure. The United States conducted over 900 nuclear weapons tests between 1951 and 1992, resulting in widespread radioactive fallout. A study by the National Cancer Institute revealed radiation exposure across all 48 states, with some areas receiving more fallout than those directly downwind of the Nevada Test Site. Despite a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992, there is a possibility of future testing. The government must provide greater accountability regarding the health and safety implications before any resumption of nuclear testing. The Federal Government must ensure public safety in future nuclear weapons tests by analyzing environmental effects, notifying the public, monitoring tests independently, and conducting extensive health research efforts. SEC. 3. Treatment under National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 of actions relating to nuclear weapons tests. Actions by Federal agencies related to nuclear weapon testing are considered major actions that significantly impact the environment, requiring a detailed environmental impact statement. This includes actions such as resuming tests at the Nevada Test Site or using other locations for testing. The environmental impact statement must include a detailed description of the actions. The environmental impact statement for actions related to nuclear weapon testing must include a detailed description of the possibility of radiation containment failure and its effects, as well as the long-term effects on the water table from underground radiation leakage. If multiple nuclear weapons or devices are to be tested, separate descriptions are required for each class, including those with a yield of less than 15 kilotons. The text discusses the classification of weapons based on their yield, with categories ranging from less than 15 kilotons to over 50 kilotons. It also mandates the public availability of detailed environmental impact statements for actions related to nuclear weapon testing by federal agencies. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires a statement for certain actions. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires congressional authorization for the resumption of nuclear weapons testing and public notice requirements. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 mandates that the President must provide advance public notice of each nuclear test, including the date, time, and location. Any changes to this information must also be promptly communicated to the public. Additionally, prompt notice of any release of radiation beyond the Nevada Test Site is required. Whenever a nuclear test by the United States results in a release of radiation beyond the Nevada Test Site, the President must promptly provide public notice including the date, time, location, nature, and extent of the release. These requirements apply regardless of any laws that would otherwise keep the information private. SEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM FOR INDEPENDENT RADIATION MONITORING. The Secretary of Homeland Security authorizes grants for institutions of higher education to acquire and maintain radiation detection equipment. Preference is given to institutions in states with high fallout levels from nuclear weapons tests. Grant recipients must monitor nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security authorizes grants for institutions of higher education to acquire and maintain radiation detection equipment. Grant recipients must monitor nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States, using sensors to determine radiation levels and making the information public. SEC. 7. MONITORING OF RELEASES OF RADIATION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. Monitoring of radiation releases into the atmosphere following nuclear weapon tests is conducted by the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, utilizing various monitoring systems on and off the test site. The government has a monitoring system off the test site. The Secretary of Energy assesses the containment of each test, and the EPA uses ground and airborne sensors for real-time monitoring. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with other relevant federal agencies, will make determinations for monitoring based on various factors. The Secretary and the EPA Administrator will ensure that radiation monitoring data is promptly made available to the public online. If a release of radiation beyond the NTS boundaries is detected during testing, the EPA Administrator must report to Congress, all nuclear testing stops, and a compensation program for affected individuals is implemented. Compensation is provided to individuals affected by the release of radiation. Establishment of the Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health is outlined in Section 8. Compensation is provided to individuals affected by radiation exposure. The National Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health will be established through a grant to a university in the intermountain west region. Its activities include awarding research grants on radiation's health effects and studying the relationship between radiation and human health, including fallout data collection. The National Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health will coordinate research efforts, collect fallout data, and maintain an archive of data on human health effects. They will submit an annual report to Congress and receive necessary appropriations for their activities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the dose of radionuclides received by the US population from nuclear weapons tests. The results will be disaggregated by organ, radionuclide, and demographic variables, with a report submitted to Congress and results made publicly available."
