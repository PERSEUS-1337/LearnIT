    "content": "The President signed the FY2006 defense appropriations bill (P.L. 109-148) on December 30, 2005, and the FY2006 defense authorization bill (P.L. 109-163) on January 6, 2006. House and Senate conferees reached agreements on both bills on December 18. The House approved the agreements on December 19, and the Senate approved them on December 21 after removing a provision for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The House approved an enrolling resolution on December 22 for a bill without ANWR provisions, clearing it for the President. The appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of Defense and other measures like Hurricane Katrina recovery funds, avian flu preparedness, and spending cuts. The bill also allows for oil drilling in ANWR, with projected revenues allocated to Alaska, Katrina relief, and the LIHEAP energy program. Opponents of ANWR drilling resisted the measure in the Senate. The Senate rejected ANWR drilling in a key vote on the appropriations conference report. The House then passed the appropriations bill without ANWR provision, clearing it for the President. Other measures added to the bill include funds for Katrina relief, avian flu preparedness, and a 1% cut in FY2006 appropriations. The enacted bill includes cuts in defense spending, with reductions in military personnel and operating accounts. The cuts did not affect major weapons programs but eliminated unnecessary funds. Congress has made similar cuts in recent years, partly funded through supplemental funds. The White House objected to Senate reductions in defense spending, warning of a potential veto if defense funding is significantly reduced to avoid cuts in non-security spending. Congress agreed to trim $4.4 billion from the defense budget and added $0.1 billion to military construction. Emergency supplemental funding has offset regular defense appropriations, freeing up funds for non-defense programs. Congress approved an across-the-board cut in all appropriations, reducing Department of Defense funds by $8.4 billion compared to the Administration's request. Treatment of detainees was a key issue in Senate discussions, with proposed amendments to establish an independent commission and prohibit cruel treatment. Senator Warner also proposed uniform interrogation standards for the Defense Department. The Senate approved an amendment to require the Defense Department to follow Army field manual regulations on interrogations and prohibit any federal agency from engaging in cruel treatment of detainees. The Senate approved an amendment to require the Defense Department to follow Army field manual regulations on interrogations and prohibit any federal agency from engaging in cruel treatment of detainees. Senator McCain offered a measure to prohibit cruel treatment of detainees, which was accepted by voice vote. Senator Graham withdrew his original proposal for tribunal authority and offered a revised amendment for tribunal regulations, Senate confirmation of tribunal leaders, and limited court appeals. The Senate debated court oversight of the tribunal and rejected an amendment for court review of habeas corpus petitions. Senators Graham and Levin agreed on regulations for the tribunals, which were approved by the Senate. The Senate approved a compromise version of the Graham amendment expanding court appeals for tribunal decisions. The conference agreements included requirements for DOD adherence to the Army field manual on interrogations and prohibiting cruel treatment of detainees. Additionally, a new provision was added to allow U.S. government personnel to defend themselves by claiming they were unaware of unlawful practices. Iraqi security personnel were also mandated to receive training in interrogation techniques and copies of the Army field manual. The House rejected an amendment for an exit strategy in Iraq, with Representative Pelosi proposing a report on progress for withdrawal. Another amendment stated that early withdrawal calls from Iraq are counterproductive. Ros-Lehtinen opposes calls for early withdrawal from Iraq, stating that it is U.S. policy to withdraw only when national security and foreign policy goals in Iraq are achieved. The Senate debated U.S. Iraq policy extensively in November, rejecting a Levin amendment that would tie troop withdrawals to progress in Iraq. Instead, a revised version of the amendment was agreed upon, emphasizing 2006 as a transition year for Iraqi security forces to take on more responsibility for security, leading to eventual U.S. troop withdrawals. Administration reports on an improved schedule are required. The House rejected a resolution for immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq, following a call by Representative Murtha for redeployment of U.S. forces. The authorization agreement includes quarterly progress reports on Iraq and aims for 2006 to be a turning point in transferring security responsibility to Iraqi forces. The authorization agreement for Iraq aims for 2006 to be a turning point in transferring security responsibility to Iraqi forces. The appropriations conference report requires quarterly progress reports on Iraq and includes a \"bridge fund\" for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House and Senate differ on the recommended funding amounts for the bridge fund. The House agreed to a modified amendment requiring reports on fund allocation, equipment, and military construction projects. The appropriations conference agreement provides $50 billion as a bridge fund, including $8 billion for weapons procurement. An en bloc amendment approved by the House includes a measure requiring DOD to notify Congress 60 days in advance of any policy changes for assigning women to operational ground units. The Pentagon's 1994 policy prohibiting women in ground combat units was codified into law, with restrictions on changes to current assignments. The authorization conference agreement reduced advance notification to 30 days. Both the House and Senate increased Army and Marine Corps end-strength, with the Senate adding 20,000 to Army end-strength. These increases add to those approved last year, requiring DOD to support over 30,000 extra troops. The Senate authorization includes support for over 30,000 extra troops, with an increase of 10,000 in Army and 1,000 in Marine Corps end-strength in FY2006. The total authorized end-strength in the Army is 512,400, 30,000 above the pre-Iraq war baseline level. The authorization also allows for additional troops to be added in the future, indicating potential future issues with end-strength. The House and Senate authorization bills for Navy shipbuilding in FY2009 differed significantly. The House bill added funds for additional ships and imposed cost caps, effectively terminating the DD(X) destroyer program. The Senate bill prohibited a winner-take-all competition for the DD(X) and added advance procurement funds for a second ship. Representative Murtha played a key role in the defense decisions. The appropriations conference agreement provides funding for the DD(X) destroyer, one T-AKE cargo ship, and additional Littoral Combat Ships. Cost caps are established for specific ships, and the Navy is required to design a lower-cost submarine. The House authorization bill imposes cost caps on Navy ships, trims funding for the Army Future Combat System, cuts funding for some satellite programs, and revises acquisition laws. The House and Senate appropriations bills made cuts to weapons programs, with the Senate cutting the Future Combat System (FCS) by $236 million. The authorization conference agreement includes amendments to defense acquisition laws to improve reporting on weapons cost growth and major program unit cost growth. The House and Senate appropriations bills made cuts to weapons programs, with the Senate cutting the Future Combat System (FCS) by $236 million. The authorization conference agreement includes amendments to defense acquisition laws to improve reporting on weapons cost growth and major program unit cost growth. A report on the role of Lead Systems Integrators in developing major weapons was required, but certain measures like a full analysis of alternatives for weapons with cost growth exceeding 15% were not included. Additional funding for ground-based missile defense testing was added, with differing opinions on oversight. Reserve personnel health benefits were also addressed in the House Armed Services Committee. The House Armed Services Committee approved an amendment to make TRICARE available to non-deployed reserve personnel, but it was later removed due to cost constraints. The Senate approved a provision to allow non-deployed reservists to enroll in TRICARE, with a premium of 50% of the benefit value. The House authorization eliminated funds for DOE to study new nuclear weapons. The authorization eliminated funds for the Department of Energy (DOE) to study the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), as did the House-passed energy and water appropriations bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee did not cut DOE RNEP funds. The Senate rejected an amendment to eliminate DOE funds for the RNEP. The conference agreement on the energy and water bill eliminates RNEP funding. Senator Domenici stated that the Administration supported the elimination of funds for RNEP. Administration officials emphasized testing projectiles to penetrate hardened concrete. Opponents fear the nuclear program could be revived in the future. The House and Senate approved a budget resolution allocating $843 billion for national defense in FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee reduced defense appropriations by $3 billion, while the Senate cut $7 billion. Subsequent revisions did not change defense funding levels in either chamber. The House and Senate approved a budget resolution for FY2006 defense funding. The House completed marking up its defense authorization bill and passed an amended version. The Senate began floor action on its defense authorization bill but suspended consideration after a cloture vote failed. The Senate later resumed consideration and approved the bill. Both chambers also marked up their defense appropriations bills. The House and Senate approved the defense budget for FY2006. The Senate passed the defense authorization bill after rejecting a proposal to add elements of the defense authorization bill. Conference agreements on the authorization and appropriations bills were approved in December. The President signed the defense appropriations bill into law on December 30 and the defense authorization bill into law on January 6. A key issue in the FY2005 defense debate was funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In early 2005, Congress provided $25 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as a bridge until FY2005 supplemental funding was approved. An additional $76 billion was approved in May 2005 to cover the remainder of FY2005. Advance funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan became an issue again in the FY2006 budget, with Congress exempting $50 billion in emergency spending for military contingency operations from a potential point of order in the Senate. In FY2006, Congress considered providing additional funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The budget resolution set aside $50 billion, but Congress could have allocated more without triggering spending limits. Ultimately, the appropriations conference agreement provided $50 billion. Other issues included whether to establish a strategy for progress in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration needs to establish a strategy for withdrawing from Iraq and measures of progress. Congress is considering trimming defense funding to limit cuts in non-defense programs, providing additional military benefits, increasing active duty end-strength, funding for navy shipbuilding, and deciding on aircraft carrier retirements. Congress is considering various defense-related decisions such as reducing the number of deployable carriers, terminating procurement of certain aircraft, overseeing major weapons programs, restructuring missile defense priorities, and financing Army reorganization plans. Congress is considering decisions on restructuring the Defense Department's civilian personnel system, changes in environmental laws for military training, studying new nuclear weapons, and implementing policies on social issues like women in combat support units and abortions in the military. In 2005, Congress debated measures for troop withdrawal from Iraq amid differing views on progress in military operations and political conditions. Other issues under consideration included military base closures, treatment of detainees, acquisition of tanker aircraft, and defense \"Buy American\" requirements. Critics are concerned about the lack of progress in key indicators of success in Iraq, such as attacks against U.S. soldiers, quality of Iraqi security forces, overall security level, and economic infrastructure. There are debates in Congress about establishing a withdrawal date, with supporters arguing against it to prevent regime opponents from planning for a U.S. exit. Some critics oppose withdrawal, believing the U.S. has a responsibility to prevent civil war in post-occupation Iraq. Efforts in Congress are being made to pressure the Administration to define its strategy. Efforts in Congress are being made to pressure the Administration to define measurable indicators of progress in Iraq and establish criteria for U.S. troop withdrawals. On May 25, the House rejected an amendment calling for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, and on June 20, an amendment was proposed to require the President to submit a report outlining a strategy for success in Iraq and criteria for troop withdrawal. The House rejected an amendment calling for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. Another amendment required a report on Iraqi security forces, capabilities, and political stability without setting a withdrawal date. Later, a different amendment was approved stating that early withdrawal from Iraq is counterproductive. The Senate debated U.S. Iraq policy extensively in November, rejecting a Levin amendment tying troop withdrawals to progress in Iraq. General Casey initially mentioned possible troop reductions in spring or summer, but later became less certain. The Senate agreed to a revised version of the Levin amendment, stating that 2006 should be a transition year for Iraqi security. The amendment in 2006 marked a transition year for Iraqi security forces to take on more responsibility, leading to U.S. troop withdrawals. Representative John Murtha called for redeploying U.S. forces out of Iraq, arguing that their presence worsened the security situation. House Republicans brought up a resolution by Representative Hunter calling for immediate withdrawal from Iraq, which was rejected by a vote of 403-6. The FY2006 defense budget did not include funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress later agreed to provide $76 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2005. Administration officials planned to request funding for Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2006 in a supplemental budget. Critics argue that funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan should be included in the regular defense budget instead of relying on supplemental appropriations. They are concerned about the lack of oversight and the inclusion of non-related programs in the supplemental budget. The Administration favors using supplementals to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan due to quicker access to funds and the ability to remove costs once operations cease. Critics argue for including these funds in the regular defense budget to avoid lack of oversight and unrelated program inclusions. The debate over funding military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan revolves around whether to include war costs in the regular defense budget or use supplementals. Precedents show that past conflicts like World War II and Vietnam were funded through a mix of supplementals and regular appropriations. The Administration prefers supplementals for quicker access to funds, while critics argue for regular budget inclusion to ensure oversight and prevent unrelated program inclusions. The Johnson Administration requested emergency supplementals for Vietnam in addition to regular defense appropriations, with funds requested as troop levels increased. Congress included funding for ongoing military operations in Southwest Asia in regular appropriations bills in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration included funding for ongoing military operations in regular defense budgets, including operations in Southwest Asia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Senator Byrd's amendment in 2005 expressed the Senate's support for funding operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through regular annual funding bills. The appropriations conference agreement includes the Byrd amendment as a statement of the sense of the Senate, with no procedural hurdles for funding Iraq and Afghanistan in the regular FY2006 defense bills. Funding caps in the FY2006 congressional budget resolution do not seem to be a barrier, as appropriations bills could designate funding for operations abroad as \"defense emergency appropriations\" or for \"contingency operations in support of the global war on terrorism.\" In the markup of the FY2006 defense authorization bill, the Senate Armed Services Committee allocated $50 billion for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The House-passed authorization recommended $49.1 billion, while the House-passed defense appropriations bill provided $45.2 billion and the Senate-passed bill provided $50.0 billion. In 2004, Congress debated reducing defense spending to address the federal budget deficit, with the Senate initially recommending $7 billion less for defense but later voting to restore the funds. In FY2005, appropriators trimmed about $2 billion from the Administration's defense request in the defense appropriations bill, making funds available for other defense bills and non-defense programs. This process of cutting defense funds to offset funding in non-defense bills has been recurring, with similar actions taken in FY2004. In FY2005, appropriators trimmed $2 billion from the Administration's defense request in the defense appropriations bill to fund other defense bills and non-defense programs. The debate on the FY2006 budget resolution did not focus on defense spending, but overall deficit pressures led to trimming defense to moderate cuts in non-defense programs. Budget constraints may worsen in the coming years. The appropriations committees are required to report how funds will be allocated among subcommittees, known as \"302(b) allocations.\" Budget limits are enforced to prevent exceeding allocations. The FY2006 budget resolution provides $843.02 billion for allocations. Chairman Jerry Lewis released proposed allocations, later revised but did not change significantly. The allocations for defense and military quality of life/veterans affairs subcommittees were revised multiple times but remained unchanged. The defense subcommittee received $363.44 billion, $3.28 billion below the Administration request, while the MQL/VA subcommittee received $85.158 billion, $1.05 billion above the request. The allocations allowed for roughly $3 billion to be shifted from defense to non-defense programs. The House Appropriations Committee argued about the defense total in releasing its initial allocations. The House Appropriations Committee argued that the defense appropriations bill could include $5 billion in rescissions of prior year funds to offset increases in FY2006 programs. This would allow for a $1.72 billion increase in actual programs, despite a $3.28 billion cut from the request. There are concerns about using defense rescissions to offset increases in non-defense appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $5 billion in rescissions of prior year defense funds to offset increases in FY2006 programs, allowing for a $1.72 billion increase despite a $3.28 billion cut from the request. Concerns exist about using defense rescissions to offset non-defense appropriations. The Committee approved initial 302(b) allocations, with the Senate cutting $7 billion from the defense bill and adding $797 million for military construction/Veterans Affairs. This resulted in $6.2 billion more for non-defense discretionary programs than the Administration request. Both the House and Senate complied with the allocations in later action on defense appropriations bills, with cuts mainly in military personnel, operation and maintenance, and revolving fund accounts. The House and Senate resolved differences on defense funding in conference negotiations, with the Senate cutting defense by $4.4 billion below the Administration request. The House approved revised estimates reflecting the compromise, while the Senate reported its revised allocations. The conference agreement added $0.1 billion for Department of Defense in the military construction/VA appropriations bill. Congress cut $8.4 billion from the Administration's original request for the Department of Defense in the military construction/VA appropriations bill, reflecting budget constraints and competing demands for funds. This included an across-the-board 1% cut in total non-emergency FY2006 appropriations, with $4.1 billion cut from the Department of Defense. Congress has consistently enhanced retirement, health, and other benefits for military personnel, including \"TRICARE for Life\" and concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits. Since 1999, Congress has enacted measures to improve military personnel benefits, including increased retirement benefits, offsetting off-base housing costs, and health insurance for deactivated reservists. These measures, along with substantial pay raises, have raised costs for active duty military personnel by over 30% above inflation. In FY2006, Congress continued to debate proposals to enhance military benefits. In FY2005, Congress renewed the debate on health benefits for military reservists. They approved federal health insurance for families of deactivated reservists who reenlist but rejected proposals for all reservists. Additionally, Congress increased the death gratuity to $100,000 for service members killed in the line of duty, provided $150,000 to survivors of those killed in combat zones, and raised the maximum insurance amount for service members to $400,000. These provisions apply until September 30, 2005. The provisions for health benefits and death gratuity for military reservists were renewed in FY2005, with an increase in death gratuity to $100,000 and maximum insurance amount to $400,000. The Senate approved measures to compensate federal employees called to active duty, but the House and conference agreement did not include this provision. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee proposed permanent increases in death gratuity and insurance benefits, with the House also considering making TRICARE available to military reservists. Opponents raised concerns about the cost and potential abuse of the system by employers, while warning of increased costs for federal employees in the reserves. Proponents argued that reservists deserve guaranteed health insurance. The amendment was approved by a narrow vote in the committee, followed by approval of a measure allowing the chairman to remove provisions that exceed budget limits. The Budget Office estimated an increase in mandatory expenditures for a provision related to TRICARE for reservists. Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter removed the provision due to concerns about a point of order. Representative Taylor's motion to restore the provision with a change to eliminate mandatory spending impact was defeated. The Senate later added a TRICARE provision for reservists to the defense authorization bill, allowing non-deployed reservists to enroll in TRICARE. The Senate approved amendments to the defense appropriations and authorization bills to address income losses for federal employees called to active duty as reservists, define veterans unable to work as 100% disabled, and allow reservists to receive unemployment compensation. The conference agreement on the defense authorization bill resolved these issues. The Senate approved amendments to the defense bills to address income losses for federal employees called to active duty as reservists, provide health insurance through TRICARE, offer income replacement for mobilized reservists, accelerate full concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits, and increase death gratuity and life insurance benefits. The defense bill increases life insurance benefits for service members killed in Iraq or Afghanistan and addresses income losses for mobilized Federal employees. Congress has debated the size of the Army and Marine Corps, with some arguing for increased ground troops. Last year's defense authorization bill increased Army and Marine Corps end-strength, establishing higher totals as legal minimums. The final defense bill in FY2005 increased Army and Marine Corps end-strength, setting higher totals as legal minimums. It authorized additional troop increases, which the Administration opposed but had little effect as the Defense Department already planned to keep more troops in service. Congress did not object to funding the additional troops. The Defense Department planned to keep more troops in service than Congress mandated, with additional funding approved for the extra troops. There are debates on whether the troop increases should be temporary or permanent, with proposals to add 30,000 troops to the Army and 5,000 to the Marine Corps in FY2006. In FY2006, proposals include adding 30,000 troops to the Army, 12,000 to the Marine Corps, 2,000 to the Navy, and 1,000 to the Air Force. The debate is now focused on permanent, substantial increases in the overall force size, which the Administration opposes. Rumsfeld argues for restructuring forces instead of permanent increases. The Pentagon aims to restructure the Army by reducing non-combat positions and shifting personnel to combat arms. The House and Senate propose adding troops to the Army and Marine Corps in FY2006, with the Senate suggesting a larger increase. The Administration prefers restructuring forces over permanent increases in overall force size. The Senate provision proposes adding 40,000 troops to the Army and 3,000 to the Marine Corps, exceeding the Administration's plan for Iraq. The Navy's FY2006 request includes funding for four new ships, down from six in the previous year, due to budget constraints. The Navy's FY2006 request includes reducing the procurement rate of DD(X) destroyers and Virginia-class submarines, eliminating funds for an LPD-17 amphibious ship, and delaying the procurement of a new aircraft carrier to FY2008. The Navy's annual procurement rate falls short of what is needed to maintain the fleet size, despite arguments focusing on capabilities rather than numbers of ships. The Navy's long-term shipbuilding requirements were addressed in a report to Congress, showing two alternatives for FY2035 - one with 260 ships and one with 325 ships. Production rates are expected to increase, mainly due to ramping up production of the Littoral Combat Ship. Rising shipbuilding costs have been cited as a major challenge by the retiring Chief of Naval Operations. Concerns have been raised by Members of Congress about the low rate of Navy shipbuilding, including a deferred proposal for a winner-take-all competition between surface ships. The Secretary of Defense for Acquisition proposed a winner-take-all competition between two shipyards for building all DD(X) destroyers, instead of splitting them between yards. Congress may increase the shipbuilding budget for FY2006 to prevent yard closure. Alternative funding mechanisms are being considered for Navy ships to start new construction within budget constraints. Discussions are ongoing about alternatives to the full funding policy for Navy shipbuilding. Discussions are ongoing about alternative funding mechanisms for Navy shipbuilding, such as incremental or split funding and advance appropriations. These options may smooth out annual numbers but won't increase ship procurement significantly and could lead to budget problems in the future. Senator Warner proposed an amendment to increase the total amount of advance funding in the FY2006 congressional budget resolution. Senator Warner proposed an amendment, SA 146, to increase the resolution's limit on advance appropriations by $14 billion and allow them for Navy shipbuilding. The amendment was not brought up on the floor. The conference report on the budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 95, does not raise the original limit on advance appropriations but includes Navy shipbuilding in the list of accounts eligible for advance appropriations in the Senate. Congress can still provide advance appropriations for ships if other appropriations are reduced, there is no objection in the Senate, or if 60 Senators vote to waive the limit. The Senate Appropriations Committee included a provision in the supplemental appropriations bill (H.R. 1268) prohibiting funds for ship implementation. The House Armed Services Committee subcommittee on projection forces made significant changes to Navy shipbuilding in the FY2006 defense authorization bill. They added funds for three additional ships, including 2 DDG-51 destroyers and an additional T-AKE dry cargo ship. They also allocated funds to begin construction of a new LHA(R) amphibious assault ship and imposed a cost ceiling of $1.7 billion on the \"next generation surface combatant.\" The matter of implementing a winner-take-all strategy to acquire the DD(X) remains unresolved for future appropriations. The House Armed Services Committee subcommittee imposed a cost ceiling of $1.7 billion on the \"next generation surface combatant,\" leading the Navy to design a more affordable substitute destroyer. They also capped costs on other projects like the Logistics Combat Ship, Virginia-class submarines, and LHA(R). Additionally, the committee approved funds for advanced procurement of the CVN-21 carrier, with the condition that the Navy could start production in FY2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee did not make significant changes to Navy shipbuilding in their markup of the FY2006 defense authorization bill. The Services Committee did not significantly change Navy shipbuilding in the FY2006 authorization. They added funding for the LHA(R) ship and CVN-21 construction, as well as support for the DD(X) program. The House Appropriations Committee followed suit, cutting funds for the DD(X) and adding money for one T-AKE. The Senate Appropriations Committee added funds for additional ships, including Littoral Combat Ships and an LHA(R) ship. They also added funding for a second DD(X) destroyer and CVN-21 construction, while eliminating funds for T-AKE due to cost increases. The appropriations conference agreement accelerated the start of the CVN-21 aircraft carrier and provided funding for the DD(X) destroyer and advance procurement for a second ship. Congress rejected the House's proposal to terminate the DD(X) program and build more DDG-51 destroyers. They added $384 million for an additional T-AKE cargo ship and set cost caps on various Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy's plan to retire the USS John F. Kennedy would reduce the fleet's carriers from 12 to 11. The Navy's proposal to retire the USS John F. Kennedy would reduce the fleet's carriers from 12 to 11, sparking controversy in Congress over the decision to retire a conventionally powered ship. The Senate approved an amendment to extend the service life of the Kennedy and prohibit its retirement. The Senate approved an amendment to extend the service life of the USS John F. Kennedy and prohibit its retirement. Funds in the supplemental cannot be used to reduce the number of aircraft carriers below 12 until the Quadrennial Defense Review is submitted to Congress. The Navy was directed to retain 12 carriers until 180 days after the completion of the Quadrennial Defense Review and to perform maintenance and repair on the USS John F. Kennedy to extend its life. The House Armed Services Committee did not take steps to keep the USS John F. Kennedy in service, but required the Navy to maintain a minimum of 11 deployable carriers. The House Appropriations Committee did not address the issue, while the authorization conference agreement mandated the Navy to keep 12 operational aircraft carriers in the combat force. Additionally, there were proposed cuts in major weapons programs, including a decision to terminate procurement of the C-130J cargo plane. The decision to terminate C-130J procurement was controversial in Congress due to critical reports on safety and mission performance. The Defense Department appeared less firm in its determination to end the C-130J program compared to other decisions in PBD-753. The Department planned to review its C-130J decision and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld reversed the termination of production. The Senate approved an amendment to prohibit funds from terminating the C/KC-130J contract. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced Marine KC-130J procurement and shifted funding to the Air Force for C-130J aircraft in the FY2006 defense authorization. The House and Senate committees approved funding for C-130J aircraft, with different numbers allocated. The defense appropriations bill includes funds for KC-130Js and C-130Js. The Air Force's F/A-22 fighter production termination was proposed, with plans for additional aircraft beyond FY2008. The Air Force is facing opposition to cuts in funding for the F/A-22 fighter aircraft program, with no related legislative proposals in Congress. The program's production will cease in FY2009, giving time to consider its fate. Congress is grappling with how to address programs that have faced delays and cost overruns. The Navy ships are not the only troubled programs in the defense budget. Delays and cost growth have affected various high-profile weapons programs, including the F/A-22 aircraft, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and several satellite and space launch programs. Congress has cut funding for programs like TSAT by $300 million, raising concerns about technology maturity. The Defense Department requested funding for TSAT and Space Based Radar, but Congress cut funding for both programs significantly. The Army Future Combat System is undergoing changes in its development contract. The FCS and other troubled programs may face budget cuts to fund increases in other areas. In the FY2006 defense authorization markup, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved full funding for the Army Future Combat System (FCS) at $3.4 billion. However, the House Armed Services Committee reduced FCS funding by $400 million and shifted some parts of the program to R&D lines. Additionally, funding for Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT) and Space-Based Radar was cut significantly. The House committee also made changes to acquisition laws to control weapons cost growth. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made significant cuts to various defense programs, including the Future Combat System, TSAT, Space-Based Radar, Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), and Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS). The House committee also implemented changes to acquisition laws to monitor cost growth more closely. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made significant cuts to defense programs, including SBIRS-High, JTRS, and missile defense. Emergency funds were allocated for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a focus on weapons procurement like uparmored HMMWVs. The Administration requested $8.7 billion for missile defense in FY2006, with planned funding reductions directed by PBD-753. In FY2006, there were significant cuts in defense programs, including missile defense. Funding for the Ballistic Missile Defense System Interceptor was reduced, raising questions about the practicality of the program. Despite debates in Congress, funding for the Kinetic Energy Interceptor remains in future budget plans. The White House accelerated deployment of a ground-based interceptor system in 2004. The Missile Defense Agency is deploying interceptor missiles in Alaska and California, but the system has not been declared operational. Recent tests have failed, and there are debates in Congress about funding for long-term technologies versus more immediately deployable systems like the Patriot PAC-3. Representative Spratt proposed an amendment in the FY2006 defense authorization bill to schedule missile tests. The subcommittee approved adding $100 million for additional testing of the ground-based missile defense system. The full committee rejected proposals for successful testing before deployment and transferring oversight of tests. The House rule did not allow further amendments on missile defense funding or testing. The committee bill requires a report comparing the Airborne Laser and Kinetic Energy Interceptor programs for missile interception. The Senate Armed Services Committee also allocated funds for the mid-course defense system. The House Appropriations Committee added $100 million for testing of the ground-based defense and $82 million for a multiple kill vehicle. They restructured the budget to make different elements of the program more visible, dividing the midcourse defense program into ground-based and sea-based defenses, and the sensor program into separate elements for satellites and radars. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided an additional $200 million for the ground-based midcourse defense system and $65 million more for the U.S.-Israeli Arrow program. The Army is reorganizing its combat forces to create more flexible and deployable brigades. They plan to increase the number of deployable brigades from 33 to at least 43 by the end of FY2007. The reorganization will cost $48 billion over seven years. The Army's reorganization plan aims to increase deployable brigades from 33 to at least 43 by FY2007, costing $48 billion over seven years. Funding for the plan includes $5 billion in FY2005 supplemental funds, with additional annual budget increases starting in FY2007. Congress generally supports the reorganization, with the main debate being whether to fund it through supplementals or regular appropriations. The Defense Department plans to increase deployable brigades without a permanent increase in end-strength. Costs are covered through supplemental appropriations, with doubts in Congress about the Army's ability to fill out new brigades by reassigning personnel. Retired Army Colonel Douglas MacGregor questions if the new brigades are well-equipped to meet strategic requirements. In FY2005, Congress provided $5 billion for Army modularization. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act granted broad authority to the Secretary of Defense for DOD reorganization. Disagreements have arisen over changes to the civilian personnel system, leading to potential amendments by Congress. Measures may be proposed to regulate privatizing civilian procedures. In the past years, Congress has regulated privatizing civilian defense jobs and proposed legislative measures to ease environmental statutes for military training. Amendments were made to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and Endangered Species Act in defense authorizations. The Administration also proposed revisions to amend the Clean Air Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response. The Defense Department has proposed legislative changes in environmental statutes affecting military training facilities, including exemptions for military readiness activities from conforming to State Implementation Plans under the Clean Air Act and defining military munitions on operational ranges as not solid waste under RCRA and CERCLA. Congress has not taken action on these proposals. The House and Senate have not addressed the new Administration's defense authorization proposals. Last year, both chambers rejected amendments to eliminate funds for studies of new nuclear weapons. The FY2005 Energy and Commerce appropriations bill eliminated funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and the Advanced Concepts Initiative. The Administration requested funds for RNEP in the FY2006 budget, but the DOE removed long-term funding for RNEP development. The FY2006 budget includes $4 million for RNEP in the DOE budget and $4.5 million in the Air Force. Budget projections also include $14 million for RNEP in FY2007 in the DOE and $3.5 million in the Air Force. Funding for RNEP is not projected after FY2007, but could be restored. The FY2006 budget does not include funds for ACI, but instead allocates $9 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces eliminated RNEP funds from the DOE budget and redirected the money to the Air Force for non-nuclear bunker buster weapons. The RRW program raised concerns among arms control groups and may spark debate in Congress. The committee also allocated $4 million for a DOD study on conventional and nuclear penetrator options. The House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces redirected funds from the RRW program to the Air Force for non-nuclear bunker buster weapons. The Senate Armed Services Committee provided funding for RNEP in DOE but eliminated Air Force funding. The House energy and water appropriations subcommittee increased funding for the RRW program and eliminated funds for RNEP from the Department of Energy budget. The House appropriations committee eliminated funds for the RNEP in the energy and water appropriations bill (H.R. 2419) and set goals for the RRW program. The Senate initially included RNEP funds but later rejected an amendment to eliminate them. The conference agreement ultimately removed RNEP funding, with the Administration supporting this decision to focus on non-nuclear weapons for destroying buried targets. Some opponents of the RNEP have raised concerns about the possibility of the nuclear program being revived in the future. Social issues within the military often come up in congressional discussions on annual defense bills, such as debates on gays in the military, women in combat, housing for recruits, and access to abortions in military hospitals overseas. Congress has also been discussing the Defense Department's policy on sexual abuse and its handling of abuse cases. In Congress, debates have focused on whether women should serve in combat support units deployed alongside combat units. Currently, women are not allowed in combat roles but are often in support units near combat. Some women have been involved in fighting and casualties. In a committee markup, a measure was approved to bar women from certain combat support units. Representative John McHugh proposed an amendment to codify the existing DOD policy. In Congress, debates have focused on whether women should serve in combat support units deployed alongside combat units. Representative John McHugh offered an amendment to codify the existing DOD policy that prohibits assignment of women to ground combat units. The amendment would also require the Defense Department to notify Congress in advance of any changes in policies on the assignment of women to deployable ground units. The conference agreement on the defense authorization bill includes this provision with a requirement for 30 days advance notification. The debate on religious tolerance at the Air Force Academy caused a 45-minute halt in action on a bill. The bill aimed to address coercive and abusive religious proselytizing at the Academy, with differing opinions on how to maintain a climate of religious freedom and tolerance. Representative Obey objected to statements by Representative Hostettler, leading to proposed substitutes by Representative Hunter and Obey. The House debated religious tolerance at the Air Force Academy, with Representative Obey offering a substitute to the Hunter proposal. Representative Hostettler's remarks led to a temporary halt in proceedings, but he withdrew his comments, and the debate continued. The House ultimately rejected the Obey amendment, and the Hunter amendment prevailed. The Senate later approved a defense authorization bill, with a separate issue arising regarding the Defense Department's support for a Boy Scout jamboree. The Senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by Senator Frist, ensuring federal agency support for youth organizations like the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. Congress also approved military base closures for 2005, with discussions on repealing or limiting the base closure law. In the current legislative session, there were discussions in Congress about last-minute measures to delay or derail the base closure process. The House Armed Services committee rejected an amendment to delay the closure round, which was later rejected by the full House. Senator Thune proposed a bill to postpone closures until major combat forces return from Iraq, and also proposed a similar amendment to the defense authorization bill. The base closure commission sent its final report to the White House, which was approved by President Bush and sent to Congress. On October 27, 2005, the House rejected a resolution disapproving base closure recommendations. Congress also debated upgrading the Air Force's tanker aircraft fleet and strengthening \"Buy American\" requirements for military equipment purchases. These issues may resurface in Congress this year. The House approved measures for military forces to assist with border security, including banning the Defense Department from acquiring items from companies receiving foreign subsidies. An amendment was passed to prevent \"Buy American\" requirements from being waived by trade agreements. The conference agreement on the authorization bill does not include House provisions, such as allowing the Secretary of Defense to assign military forces to border patrol operations. Several CRS reports are referenced on defense budget challenges, Iraq and Afghanistan supplemental appropriations, war on terror costs, and Air Force transformation. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on defense-related topics such as nuclear earth penetrators, Army's Future Combat System, defense procurement, exemptions from environmental laws for DOD, F-22A Raptor, F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program, appropriate size of military forces, and military space programs. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on military space programs, naval transformation, aircraft carriers, attack submarines, destroyers, ship procurement, force structure, and shipbuilding plans. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on Navy force structure, shipbuilding plans, Army modular redesign, and Veterans' medical care, along with a congressional budget resolution for FY2006. The conference report (H.Rept. 109-62) was filed on April 28, 2005, and agreed to in the House (214-211) and Senate (52-47) on the same day. S.Con.Res. 18 (Gregg) is an original concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget for FY2006. H.R. 1815 (Hunter) authorizes appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for FY2006. S. 1042 (Warner) authorized appropriations for FY2006 for military activities of the Department of Defense, military construction, and defense activities of the Department of Energy. It was signed into law by the President on January 6, 2006. The Senate and House committees marked up and reported on a bill for appropriations for the Department of Defense for FY2006. The Senate approved the bill with amendments and incorporated it into H.R. 1815, while the House approved it with amendments as well. The Defense Authorization and Appropriations Bills for FY2006 were debated, approved, and signed into law by the President on December 30, 2005. Congress provides funding for national defense programs through annual appropriations measures, with the defense appropriations bill being the largest. The defense appropriations bill authorizes programs funded in regular appropriations measures, addressing defense programs in detail. It provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research and development. Additionally, it allocates small amounts for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community. The defense appropriations bill authorizes funding for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research and development. It also includes allocations for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized jurisdiction, moving certain programs to the Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee retained these programs within the defense appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized jurisdiction, moving certain programs to the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. This report will track funding levels of programs shifted out of the defense appropriations bill by the House, which still fall within the Department of Defense and overall National Defense budget functions. The Administration's FY2006 federal budget request includes $441.8 billion for national defense, with $421.1 billion for military. The FY2006 federal budget request includes $441.8 billion for national defense, with $421.1 billion for military activities of the Department of Defense. This represents a 4.3% increase over the FY2005 enacted level in nominal terms, and a 1.9% increase after adjusting for inflation. Funding for national defense grew by 38% in nominal terms between FY2000 and FY2005. The FY2006 federal budget request includes $441.8 billion for national defense, with $421.1 billion for military activities of the Department of Defense, showing a 4.3% increase over FY2005 in nominal terms. The Administration's FY2006 request highlights continued growth in military personnel and operation and maintenance costs, a slowdown in funding for RDT&E and procurement, and last-minute changes in funding for major weapons programs. The FY2006 Department of Defense budget request is $19.1 billion higher than FY2005, with $5.7 billion for military personnel and $10.0 billion for operation and maintenance. Personnel and O&M account for over 80% of the increase, reflecting a trend from FY2000 to FY2005. This trend may limit new funding for weapons programs as budgets level off. The Administration proposes $78.0 billion for procurement in FY2006, a slight decrease. The Administration proposes $78.0 billion for procurement, a decrease of $300 million compared to the FY2005 baseline level, and $69.4 billion for RDT&E, an increase of $600 million. Both represent real reductions in funding after adjusting for inflation. The plan calls for modest growth in weapons acquisition in the defense budget, with procurement funding increasing while RDT&E declines. Overall, procurement plus RDT&E spending increases by 7.3% over the next six years, with only modest real growth in operation and maintenance at 1.8% per year. The Defense Department faced significant budget constraints in December 2004, leading to changes in long-term acquisition plans to meet White House budget targets. The Office of Management and Budget instructed a $55 billion cut from the FY2006-FY2011 Future Years Defense Plan, resulting in a $30 billion reduction in the DOD budget over six years. Additionally, $25 billion was added to the FY2007-FY2011 Army budget for an ongoing reorganization plan. The Defense Department faced budget constraints in December 2004, leading to a $30 billion reduction in the DOD budget over six years. Program Budget Decision 753 (PBD-753) outlined adjustments for the FY2006 budget submission to meet the OMB mandate. Proposed reductions heavily focus on FY2009 and FY2010, with controversial cuts including Navy shipbuilding and termination of the C-130J. Congressional attention may center on these programs in defense bills. The Defense Department decided not to terminate C-130J production as the House Armed Services Committee began marking up defense authorization bills. Long-Term Defense Budget Challenges: The defense budget will face pressure due to moderate growth rates, increased military personnel costs, operation and maintenance cost growth, weapons program cost growth, and new security threat perceptions. These trends present challenges for Congress and the Defense Department in shaping the budget. The defense budget will face pressure due to moderate growth rates, increased military personnel costs, operation and maintenance cost growth, weapons program cost growth, and new security threat perceptions. These trends present challenges for Congress and the Defense Department in shaping the budget. Congress seldom addresses these matters directly, but long-term budget pressures underlie many issues they will grapple with this year."
