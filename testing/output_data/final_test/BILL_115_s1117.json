    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Financial Choice and Capital Markets Protection Act of 2017\" amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 by adding a section regarding the treatment of money market funds. The section defines 'covered Federal assistance' as Federal aid used for loans, guarantees, or assistance arrangements with money market funds. 'Federal assistance' includes insurance, guarantees by the FDIC, Treasury transactions, and advances from Federal sources. The section outlines the conditions for a stable value money market fund to elect a specific method for computing the current price per share. The section outlines the conditions for a stable value money market fund to elect a specific method for computing the current price per share, using the amortized cost method of valuation. The board of directors of a company can choose to use the penny-rounding pricing method for a money market fund if they believe it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, and as long as the resulting share price reflects the market-based net asset value per share. The company or series must comply with quality, maturity, diversification, liquidity, and other requirements set by the Commission. Companies making this election are exempt from default liquidity fee requirements. The default liquidity fee requirements under section 270.2a-7(c)(2)(ii) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations prohibit direct Federal assistance to money market funds. Principal underwriters and dealers must disclose this prohibition in the fund's prospectus and sales materials. The Commission may adopt rules and regulations for the disclosure requirements under subsection (c) after consulting with relevant entities. Companies electing under subsection (b)(1) must still comply with this title and Commission regulations."
