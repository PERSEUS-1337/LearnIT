    "content": "The \"Pool and Spa Safety Act\" includes sections on short title, findings, recommended swimming pool safety standards, state swimming pool safety grant program, national education program, definitions, and CPSC reports. The Congress finds that drowning is the leading cause of death in children under 4 and the second leading cause of death in children 14 and under in the United States. Many children drown due to pool and spa drowning and entrapment, with instances like Virginia Graeme Baker and Preston de Ibern. In 2003, 782 children ages 14 and under died from unintentional drowning, and from 1985 to 2004, at least 33 children died from pool and spa entrapment. Adult supervision at aquatic venues is crucial in preventing child drownings. Research studies show that barriers or fencing can significantly reduce childhood residential swimming pool drownings and near drownings, emphasizing the importance of safety measures for preventing children from drowning. SEC. 3. RECOMMENDED SWIMMING POOL SAFETY STANDARDS. The Commission will establish recommended minimum State law standards for swimming pools and spas, including barriers to prevent unsupervised access and devices to prevent entrapment of children by drains. The final rule must be issued within 18 months after the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The Commission will establish advisory standards for pool and spa safety, which will not be enforced except for specific circumstances. These standards are intended for determining State eligibility for grants under the Act. The Commission will establish advisory standards for pool and spa safety, with strong consideration given to published guidelines and national performance standards. Minimum standards for pools and spas will include requirements for appropriate fencing, drain covers for pools with main drains, and other barriers. The Commission will require new pools with a main drain to have at least 2 drains or a single unblockable drain, along with drain covers meeting specific requirements. Outdoor swimming pools must be enclosed by a 4-foot high barrier or fence with no openings except for a gate. The pool barrier must have no opening larger than 2 inches horizontally, with horizontal components at least 36 inches apart. The gate must be self-closing, self-latching, and open outward from the pool. No openings, handholds, or footholds accessible from the exterior side are allowed. The swimming pool safety standard requires barriers with no openings larger than 2 inches, horizontal components 36 inches apart, self-closing and self-latching gates that open outward, and no footholds accessible from the exterior side. Above-ground pools must have non-climbable sides at least 4 feet high and removable or lockable access ladders. The Commission may exempt hot tubs, spas, or portable spas with lockable covers meeting ASTM standard F1346 from safety requirements. For new swimming pools with main drains, a drain system with unblockable drains or multiple suction outlets per pump must be installed to prevent entrapment. For all swimming pools, a suction outlet drain cover meeting ANSI/ASME standard A112.19.8M and additional safety measures are required, unless the pool is constructed without a main drain. Safety measures for swimming pool suction outlets include a safety vacuum release system, suction-limiting vent system, gravity drainage system, or any other system meeting American National Standards. The safety measures for swimming pool suction outlets must meet the standards of the American National Standards Institute or the American Society for Testing and Materials. The State Swimming Pool Safety Grant Program is established under Section 4. The Commission establishes a grant program to assist States in hiring and training government employees to enforce swimming pool safety standards. States must have a statute in place that applies to all swimming pools to be eligible for the grant. The Commission establishes a grant program to assist States in enforcing swimming pool safety standards. States must meet the minimum standards and submit an application to receive a grant. The Commission determines the grant amount based on population and enforcement needs. Grant funds must be used to hire enforcement personnel and educate pool owners and operators. The Commission establishes a grant program to assist States in enforcing swimming pool safety standards. States must meet minimum standards and submit an application to receive a grant. Grant funds are authorized for education on drowning prevention and entrapment in pools, construction, and installation companies. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for this purpose. The Commission will establish a national education program to prevent drowning and entrapment in swimming pools and spas. This program will include educational materials for pool manufacturers, service companies, owners, and operators, as well as a national media campaign. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for this program. In this Act, ANSI/ASME standard refers to a safety standard accredited by the American National Standards Institute and published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. ASTM standard means a safety standard issued by ASTM International. Commission refers to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. New pool means any pool constructed more than 180 days after the effective date of a State statute enacted to establish State minimum swimming pool and spa safety standards. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to pool safety regulations, including terms like safety vacuum release system, single unblockable drain, suction outlet drain cover, and swimming pool/spa. The curr_chunk defines swimming and recreational bathing in various types of pools and water structures, including hot tubs, spas, portable spas, and non-portable wading pools. The Commission is required to report on rulemaking progress and grant program efficacy to Congress within specific timeframes."
