    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4652.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require entities receiving payments from regional centers to contract with an independent accounting firm for an audit or review of financial statements if payments exceed $500,000 but are less than $2,000,000. This also applies to work activity program providers receiving less than $250,000. Entities receiving payments from regional centers must obtain an independent audit of financial statements if payments exceed $2,000,000. This requirement excludes payments made at usual rates and does not apply to government agencies, universities, or state entities. The audit report must be provided to the regional center within 30 days of completion, within nine months of the fiscal year end. Regional centers must review audit reports and resolve identified issues within nine months of the fiscal year end. They should notify the department of any qualified opinion reports within 30 days and provide a plan for issue resolution. Independent accounting firms must review financial statements, including accounting principles and practices. An independent review report includes inquiries about recording procedures, analytical procedures, budgetary actions, financial statement preparation, and working papers for financial statement reviews. The certification in the review report includes adherence to AICPA standards, management representations, limited scope compared to an audit, and no material modifications needed for GAAP conformity. Requests for rate adjustments for compliance with regulations will not be considered by the department. An entity may apply for a two-year exemption from independent audit requirements if no issues were found in the prior year's audit that impact regional center services. Another entity may apply for an exemption if the prior year's audit resulted in an unmodified opinion or with additional communication. If the prior year's independent audit resulted in a qualified opinion that is not material and pervasive, the regional center may grant a two-year exemption to the entity. The entity and regional center must still address issues raised in the audit, regardless of the exemption. The regional center must inform the department of any exemptions granted to entities with qualified opinion reports."
