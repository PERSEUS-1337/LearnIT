    "content": "Conferees on the House and Senate energy bills met and approved a conference report for H.R. 6. The House approved the report, but a cloture motion in the Senate failed. The report covered various energy-related topics including electricity, ethanol, MTBE, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and more. For details on the electricity title of H.R. 6, refer to the report. The \"Electric Reliability Act of 2003\" requires FERC to establish an electric reliability organization to enforce standards for the bulk-power system. Penalties can be imposed for violations of these standards, with FERC having the authority to order compliance and impose penalties as necessary. The \"Electric Reliability Act of 2003\" mandates FERC to establish an electric reliability organization to enforce standards for the bulk-power system. The provision does not authorize ordering construction of additional generation or transmission capacity. It requires FERC to establish a regional advisory body if requested by two-thirds of states within a region with over half of their electric load served in that region. The advisory body would advise on reliability standards, proposed regional entities, fees, and other responsibilities. This provision excludes Alaska and Hawaii. NERC currently oversees bulk power system reliability but lacks enforcement authority. The proposed legislation aims to give FERC authority over activities supporting the reliability of the US bulk power system. Advocates argue that central jurisdiction would increase accountability, with FERC being responsible for enforcing penalties for non-compliance. This would clarify FERC's authority to regulate an ERO and improve reliability as the system undergoes restructuring. The proposed legislation would give FERC authority to enforce penalties for non-compliance with reliability standards, potentially improving coordination between market and reliability functions. Critics argue FERC lacks experience in this area and would rely on NERC for expertise, leading to uncertainty in the institutional changes. Additionally, Section 1221 addresses the siting of Interstate Electric Transmission Facilities, requiring the Secretary of Energy to conduct congestion studies every three years and allowing FERC to issue construction permits in congested areas. Under proposed legislation, FERC would have authority to issue construction permits for transmission facilities in congested areas. Stakeholders would have the opportunity to present their views, and permit holders could petition for rights-of-way through eminent domain. Compensation would be due for any takings of private property. It is unclear if property owners would need to reimburse compensation if rights-of-way are transferred back to them. Under proposed legislation, FERC would have authority to issue construction permits for transmission facilities in congested areas. Stakeholders could present their views, and permit holders could petition for rights-of-way through eminent domain. Compensation would be due for any takings of private property. An applicant for federal authorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands could request the Department of Energy to coordinate environmental review and other federal authorization. FPA section 216(h) would give DOE new authority to prepare environmental documents and have decision-making authority for rights-of-way and siting on federal lands. Review under section 503 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act could be streamlined by relying on prior analyses. If a federal agency denies an authorization required by a transmission or distributions facility, the denial could be appealed by the applicant or relevant state.

If a federal agency denies an authorization required by a transmission or distributions facility, the denial could be appealed by the applicant or relevant state to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy would be required to issue a decision within 90 days of the appeal's filing. States could enter into interstate compacts for the purposes of siting transmission facilities and the Secretary of Energy could provide technical assistance. This section would not apply to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). A similar provision was included in the House-passed H.R. 6. Regulatory jurisdiction over the electricity industry is divided between federal and state authorities, with individual states overseeing activities considered intrastate and with FERC regulating the interstate aspects of electricity and natural gas commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, siting of transmission lines is the responsibility of the states. Section 1222. Third-Party Finance. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and the Southwestern Power. Under proposed legislation, FERC would have authority to issue construction permits for transmission facilities in congested areas. Stakeholders could present their views, and permit holders could petition for rights-of-way through eminent domain. Compensation would be due for any takings of private property. An applicant for federal authorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands could request the Department of Energy to coordinate environmental review and other federal authorization.

This section would not apply to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Regulatory jurisdiction over the electricity industry is divided between federal and state authorities, with individual states overseeing activities considered intrastate and with FERC regulating the interstate aspects of electricity and natural gas commerce. No more than $100 million from third-party financing may be used during fiscal years 2004 through 2013. Section 1223 of the proposed legislation would require the Secretary of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study and report on creating a transmission monitoring system for the Eastern and Western interconnections. This system would provide real-time information on transmission line status to owners and Regional Transmission Organizations. Sections 1224 and 1225 aim to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies, but were not included in the passed legislation. Section 1225 of the proposed legislation mandates the Secretary of Energy to implement a program promoting reliability and efficiency of the electric transmission system. Reports detailing the program's plan and progress must be submitted to Congress within one and two years of enactment, respectively. Additionally, a research initiative focusing on high-temperature superconductivity would be established with authorized appropriations for FY2004 through FY2008. A provision in the House-passed H.R. 6 establishes an Advanced Power System Technology Incentive Program, offering incentive payments to owners of advanced power generation systems like fuel cells and turbines. $140 million would be authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. Another provision creates an Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution to improve electric transmission distribution. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of recommendations from the Department of Energy's National Transmission Grid Study, oversight of research and development related to electricity transmission, and the development of workforce training programs. It also mentions a provision in H.R. 6 that would authorize FERC to require unregulated transmitting utilities to charge rates comparable to what they charge themselves. Exemptions are established for certain types of utilities. The curr_chunk discusses FERC's authority to revoke exemptions for utilities that own transmission facilities not essential for a nationwide interconnected system. FERC cannot order states or municipalities to act if it constitutes private use. Rates may be remanded if they don't comply. FERC cannot force unregulated utilities to join transmission organizations. This section is known as \"FERC-lite.\" Open access provisions were in H.R. 6 but differed in the conference language. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for reliability purposes under the Federal Power Act, including the establishment of a sense of Congress on regional transmission organizations. FERC is directed to promote regional districts for interconnection and coordination of transmission facilities. Section 1233 requires FERC to report to Congress on the status of regional transmission organization applications. Section 1234 allows federal utilities to participate in regional transmission organizations, repealing a law on studying their formation. Section 1235 remands FERC's proposed rulemaking on standard market design for reconsideration. No final rule can be issued before October. FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on standard market design in 2002 to establish seamless wholesale power markets. The proposed rule would require transmission owners to turn over operation to an independent transmission provider, aiming to facilitate transactions across grid boundaries. Under the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) in 2002, FERC proposed a standard market design to establish seamless wholesale power markets. The NOPR suggested that transmission owners should transfer operation to an independent transmission provider (ITP), such as an RTO, to manage energy markets and provide services to all customers. Congestion would be managed through locational marginal pricing. The comment period for the NOPR was extended to January 10, 2003, to address issues like market design for the Western Interconnection, transmission pricing plans, Regional State Advisory Committees, resource adequacy, and congestion revenue rights. FERC would assert jurisdiction over all power transmission, including service to bundled retail customers. Commissioners from 15 states planned to challenge FERC's proposed changes. State regulators from 22 states and the District of Columbia support FERC's efforts to address discrimination in the transmission system for a competitive power market. Industry groups have concerns about the implementation of the Standard Market Design (SMD). FERC staff issued a White Paper in response to 1,000 formal comments on the SMD proposal. The White Paper responds to formal comments on FERC's proposal, stating utilities must join an RTO or ISO instead of an Independent Transmission Provider. FERC will not assert new jurisdiction over bundled retail sales, addressing concerns from state officials. The final rule will not include a minimum resource adequacy requirement or auctioning of Firm Transmission Rights. Each RTO or ISO must have a cost recovery policy outlined. The White Paper emphasized the need for each RTO or ISO to have a cost recovery policy in its tariff, with potential regional differences in participant funding usage. FERC allowed phased implementation to address regional variations. The Department of Energy analyzed the impact of the SMD NOPR on wholesale electricity prices and system safety, using economic models to assess price impacts. DOE assumptions for electricity demand growth, reserve margins, generator efficiency, and transmission capacity under SMD case. Savings from SMD adoption include control area consolidation and potential cost avoidance. DOE estimates a 10% savings from efficiency improvements with the implementation of the SMD rule, resulting in a median cost of $760 million per year. Costs vary by region, with GridFlorida at 47 cents per megawatt-hour and PJM at 12 cents per megawatt-hour. Regions with existing RTOs incur no additional costs. Retail rate effects are influenced by state regulations. The Department of Energy (DOE) found that the impact of electricity exports and imports on retail prices varies depending on the state's regulatory framework. Regions with cost-based rates may see increased costs passed on to retail customers, while regions with retail choice may experience higher market-clearing prices due to increased exports. However, areas like California could benefit from lower wholesale prices and consumer prices with increased imports. Overall, DOE projects a net benefit for all consumers, with projected changes decreasing through 2020. The DOE projects a net benefit of about $1 billion per year for consumers over the first 6 years, with costs factored in. Retail price changes vary by region, with the mid-Atlantic seeing a 4% decrease and Illinois, Wisconsin, and Arizona experiencing a 3% increase. Section 1236 clarifies load-serving entity rights under the Federal Power Act. Section 201 of the Federal Power Act gives FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission and wholesale energy sales. Section 205 prohibits utilities from showing undue preference. Section 1237 requires a study on economic dispatch benefits. The House-passed H.R. 6 includes a section on economic dispatch, defining it as the operation of generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost. FERC would be required to establish incentive-based transmission rates to promote reliable and economically efficient electric transmission and generation. The House-passed H.R. 6 includes provisions for FERC to implement incentive rate-making for utilities joining a Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. Section 1242 allows transmission providers to allocate costs of new facilities, with participant funding ensuring those who benefit pay their share. This protects native load customers from bearing costs for transmission upgrades not needed for their demand. Participant funding was included in the House-passed H.R. 6 to allocate costs of new facilities for utilities joining a Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. FERC regulates transmission and sets \"just and reasonable\" rates for wholesale transactions, using an embedded cost method. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) to promote competition in the industry. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) to promote competition in the industry and provide access to the transmission system owned by incumbent utilities. FERC issued a policy statement on transmission pricing policy to ensure economic efficiency, fair compensation for utilities, and reliability of the transmission grid. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) to promote competition in the industry and provide access to the transmission system owned by incumbent utilities. FERC established guidelines for comparable access to the transmission system in May 1994. By July 9, 1996, all utilities had filed a single open access tariff with FERC. Orders 888 and 889 in April 1996 clarified the open access transmission tariff policy, making it easier for merchant generators to access the transmission grid. The regulatory regime has shifted operations in the electric utility industry, leading to increased bulk power transfers across a transmission system designed for local service. However, infrastructure investment has not kept pace with growing electricity demand, resulting in congestion in various regions of the U.S. Some transmission-owning utilities argue that the current pricing mechanism discourages investment. Transmission owners are compensated based on a contract path for electricity movement, which may not incentivize necessary upgrades. Under Order 2000, FERC expressed interest in incentive ratemaking to encourage participation in regional transmission organizations and facilitate efficient expansion of the transmission system. Currently, FERC uses a \"license plate\" rate for transmission, but some transmission owners are not compensated for the use of their lines, leading to a lack of incentive to increase capacity. FERC is moving towards uniform access charges, known as postage stamp rates, to eliminate rate pancaking and increase available generation. However, this may result in rate increases for customers in low-cost transmission areas and challenges for high-cost providers. FERC-approved tariffs may not necessarily increase with new transmission capacity, but a new higher transmission tariff could be approved, impacting all users' costs. The new higher transmission tariff may increase costs for all users, but the revenue requirement of the transmission utility could be met with current tariffs. Retail customers are charged based on individual usage, so their rates may or may not change. Wholesale customers using transmission lines for wheeling will pay a FERC-approved tariff, with recovery of capital costs included. Proponents argue that wholesale customers not wheeling power out of the region are penalized by generators. Customers not wheeling power out of the region are penalized by wholesale generators who wheel power, arguing that tariffs do not benefit them. Opponents believe transmission interconnection should be offered equally to all generators for a competitive market. Participant-funded investment for interconnection could hinder competition, but proponents argue for locating where it's economically viable. FERC is addressing transmission interconnection issues, deviating from past policies. The FERC's Standard Market Design Notice of Proposed Rulemaking introduces participant funding for net metering and smart metering. States must consider implementing net metering standards within three years, allowing consumers to offset energy provided by utilities with on-site generation. Smart metering adoption is also encouraged for states. Section 1252 requires states to investigate and decide on implementing time-based meters and communication devices for electric utility customers within two years. It amends PURPA and mandates the Secretary of Energy to educate consumers on advanced metering technologies and address barriers to demand response programs. Technical assistance will be provided to identify demand response potential. The curr_chunk discusses the provision for real-time pricing and time-of-use metering standards in H.R. 6, as well as the repeal of mandatory purchase requirements for new contracts under PURPA if competitive electricity markets exist. It also mentions the need for qualifying facilities to have access to transmission and interconnection services provided by a FERC-approved regional transmission entity. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) requires utilities to purchase power from qualifying facilities and small power producers at a rate based on avoided costs. PURPA was enacted in response to the oil embargoes of the 1970s to ensure the security of the nation's electricity supply. Ownership limitations under PURPA would be repealed, as included in H.R. 6 passed by the House and Senate. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) helped qualifying facilities (QFs) establish themselves by allowing them to use natural gas and new generating technology. This led to a decrease in the financial threshold for entering the electricity generation business and challenged cost-based rates in wholesale transactions. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) allowed qualifying facilities (QFs) to use natural gas and new technology, lowering the financial threshold for entering electricity generation. This challenged cost-based rates in wholesale transactions, leading to the approval of market-based rates by FERC. The enactment of PURPA initiated a shift towards a market-oriented approach to electricity supply, with EPACT further removing regulatory barriers to increase competition in the electricity generation sector. EPACT and PURPA shifted regulatory responsibilities to the federal government, creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand. Proponents of PURPA repeal argue that state regulators' implementation in the 1980s led to high power prices for unnecessary power. The PURPA Reform Group, supporting investor-owned utilities, strongly advocates for repeal. The PURPA Reform Group, representing IOU interests, supports repealing \u00a7210 of PURPA, arguing that the mandatory purchase obligation is anti-competitive. Opponents, including independent power producers, industrial customers, and environmental groups, argue that PURPA promotes competition and cleaner energy sources. They fear that repealing PURPA would decrease competition and hinder renewable energy development. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2003 would repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which some state regulators are concerned about. It includes definitions for various terms related to the electric and gas utility industry. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regulates holding companies, prohibits those more than twice removed from operating subsidiaries, and requires SEC approval for mergers. Holding companies can be exempt if operations are within one state or contiguous states. The electric utility industry, traditionally seen as a natural monopoly, is now being challenged by market forces. Vertical integration, once considered necessary, is being questioned as evidence shows that utilities can operate efficiently without owning all generating facilities. Regulatory structures are evolving to adapt to these changes. Recent changes in electric utility regulation and improved technologies have allowed independent firms to provide additional generating capacity instead of utilities. The Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act of 1935 established a regulatory regime that gave specific powers to states and the federal government. Utilities must provide electricity at regulated rates in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory. State regulatory commissions oversee intrastate utility activities, with authority varying among states. The state public utility commission's authority varies from retail rates to overseeing utility operations. The essential mission is to establish retail electric prices through an adversarial hearing process. Federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce. The federal regulation of the electric utility industry, led by FERC and SEC, complements state regulation to fill regulatory gaps. FERC oversees wholesale rate regulation, transmission transactions, and ensures reliable service. SEC regulates corporate structure to prevent past abuses. The industry has undergone significant transformation in the past two decades. The electric utility industry has undergone a transformation in the past two decades, with a shift towards small-scale production facilities and lower entry barriers for non-utility entities. There is a call for additional PUHCA reform to allow electric utilities to diversify their assets. Reform to allow diversification in the electric utility industry is being advocated to improve risk profiles and utilize under-utilized resources. Utility holding companies argue that PUHCA discourages diversification, but there is bipartisan support for repealing parts of it. The SEC has stated that many provisions of PUHCA are no longer relevant. Enron's collapse led to a reevaluation of PUHCA regulations, with concerns raised about fraudulent filings and cross-subsidization. State regulators worry that increased diversification could lead to abuses in the electric and gas industry. Several consumer and environmental public interest groups, as well as state legislators, have expressed concerns about PUHCA repeal. They argue that repealing PUHCA could worsen market power abuses in the monopolistic electric and gas industry. Federal access to books and records of holding companies and their affiliates is also a point of contention. Federal access to books and records of holding companies and their affiliates would be provided, with confidentiality maintained. State commissions could also request access to specific books and records, which would be kept confidential. This provision was included in the House and Senate-passed H.R. 6. Federal access to books and records of holding companies and their affiliates would be provided, with confidentiality maintained. State commissions may request access to specific books and records, which would be mandatory and enforceable in U.S. District Court. FERC would be directed to exempt qualifying facilities, exempt wholesale generators, and foreign utilities from the federal access to books and records provision. The federal access to books and records provision (Section 1264) is included in the House- and Senate-passed H.R. 6. FERC would have authority to prevent cross-subsidization and ensure just and reasonable rates. The provision would not apply to the U.S. government, states, or foreign governmental authorities. Section 1269 of H.R. 6 allows FERC and state commissions to protect utility customers without precluding their jurisdiction under other laws. Section 1270 grants FERC enforcement authority under the Federal Power Act. Section 1271 ensures that individuals can continue legal activities authorized before the Act's effective date without limiting FERC's authority under existing laws. FERC would be required to promulgate regulations within 12 months of enactment to implement Section 1272 of H.R. 6, with recommendations for necessary amendments to federal law. The Securities and Exchange Commission must transfer applicable books and records to FERC, with no specified timeframe. Section 1274 of H.R. 6 establishes a twelve-month effective date for this subtitle. Section 1274 of this subtitle establishes a twelve-month effective date. FERC would review and authorize cost allocations for non-power goods or services provided by an associate company. Necessary funds for implementation would be authorized to be appropriated. Section 1277 of the bill includes conforming amendments to the Federal Power Act to reflect changes to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Section 1281 requires FERC to establish market transparency rules within 180 days, ensuring protection for consumers in competitive markets from anti-competitive behaviors. The section prohibits FERC from competing with price publishers or regulating them. It also addresses market manipulation by making it illegal to file false reports on electricity prices or transmission capacity with fraudulent intent. Individuals, corporations, and government entities are prohibited from engaging in such activities. The section prohibits FERC from competing with price publishers or regulating them. It also addresses market manipulation by making it illegal to file false reports on electricity prices or transmission capacity with fraudulent intent. Individuals, corporations, or government entities are prohibited from engaging in round-trip electricity trading, which involves contracts with no financial gain or loss to distort reported revenues, trading volumes, or prices. Mail and wire fraud laws apply to schemes to defraud or obtain money or property through false pretenses. The Federal Power Act would be amended to increase criminal and civil penalties for violations related to false representations or promises. Criminal penalties could include a fine of up to $1 million and/or five years imprisonment, with an additional fine of $25,000. Civil penalties could reach $1 million per day per violation. Current law imposes lower penalties for similar violations. Section 1284 of the Federal Power Act would be amended to allow refunds to begin at the time of a complaint filing with FERC, not later than five months after. FERC must state reasons for not acting within the provided timeframe. Refunds for unjust rates currently start 60 days after a complaint. Section 1285 expands FERC refund authority to entities not public utilities engaging in short-term electricity sales. A short-term sale of electric energy at wholesale for 31 days or less would be subject to FERC refund authority if rates are unjust. FERC would also have authority over power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority for refund orders to achieve just and reasonable rates. FERC could modify or abrogate contracts if it is in the public interest. FERC would have the authority to modify or cancel contracts entered into after the enactment of this section, except for contracts with a different standard of review. The Federal Trade Commission could issue rules to prevent slamming and cramming by electric utilities. State regulations would apply if they offer equal or better protection than regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission. The House and Senate passed H.R. 6 requiring the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules against slamming and cramming. Section 1291 focuses on merger review reform and accountability, requiring a study on FERC's merger review authority within 180 days. FERC must report annually to Congress on merger conditions under the Federal Power Act. Section 1292 amends the Federal Power Act to give FERC review authority for electric utility mergers. The Federal Power Act would be amended to give FERC review authority for asset transfers valued over $10 million, with notice to state commissions and governors required. Definitions for key terms like \"electric utility\" and \"transmitting utility\" would be updated, and the Act would be amended to conform with the changes."
