    "content": "Several comprehensive health reform bills were introduced in the 111th Congress, including H.R. 3962, S. 1679, and S. 1796. An additional health reform proposal, the Amendment to H.R. 3962, was made public on November 3, 2009. The Amendment aims to replace the substantive text of H.R. 3962 with the Common Sense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act, resulting in a net reduction in federal deficits of $68 billion over the 2010-2019 period. The proposed Amendment consists of seven divisions, with Division A focusing on improving the affordability of health insurance. Division B provisions aim to enhance access to health insurance for small businesses by establishing Association Health Plans, improving interstate purchasing of health insurance coverage, and expanding tax preferences for health savings accounts and high-deductible health plans. Division C would establish national medical malpractice laws that would preempt existing state laws, with exceptions. Division D focuses on the doctor-patient relationship and comparative effectiveness research, ensuring that the Act does not impact medical practice and repealing a federal council on comparative effectiveness. Division E focuses on employee wellness programs and specifies how group health plans or health insurers offering group health coverage could vary premiums and cost sharing based on participation in a standards-based wellness program. Division F addresses fraud, waste, abuse, and abortion. Division G focuses on the licensure of biosimilar products, providing a pathway for such licensure. The report discusses each topic in the Amendment, including an overview of the issue, current law, and a summary of the Amendment's provisions. State regulatory authority plays a significant role in regulating the private health insurance market, covering aspects like coverage issuance, benefits, rating, consumer protections, and more. Federal regulation also plays a role in certain areas. State regulatory authority plays a significant role in regulating the private health insurance market, covering aspects like coverage issuance, benefits, rating, consumer protections, and more. Federal regulation of the private market is more narrow in scope and applicable mostly to employer-sponsored health insurance. States have implemented unique reform strategies to address concerns about health insurance and the health care delivery system, focusing primarily on insurance coverage and cost concerns. Strategies such as reinsurance programs and high-risk pools have been undertaken by states to address cost and coverage issues. State reinsurance programs reimburse insurers for higher than average claims. States finance these programs through assessments on insurers, general revenue, and premiums. High-risk pools target individuals with pre-existing conditions who can't afford private insurance. 35 states have established high-risk pools to expand health coverage options. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires small group coverage to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis, ensuring acceptance of all small employers. HIPAA also mandates insurers in the individual market to offer at least two policies to all eligible individuals. Renewal or continuation of group and individual coverage is guaranteed under HIPAA, with some exceptions. Insurers must offer coverage to small groups and self-employed individuals on a guaranteed issue basis, in compliance with HIPAA. Some states also require guaranteed issue policies for non-HIPAA eligible individuals. States must establish reinsurance programs or high-risk pools for coverage. The HHS Secretary can waive these requirements. The Amendment authorizes $15 billion for seed and operational grants to states for FYs 2010-2019, and an additional $10 billion for FYs 2015-2019. Participation in high-risk pools and reinsurance programs is limited to U.S. citizens and nationals. Citizenship verification is required as per the Social Security Act. Legal permanent residents, refugees, and other lawfully residing aliens are not eligible. The proposal imposes new federal requirements on the private health insurance market, expanding eligibility for guaranteed availability protections and prohibiting annual limits by health insurance issuers. The curr_chunk discusses regulations in the individual health insurance market, including prohibiting benefit limits, rescissions, and requiring notice and appeal rights for policy changes. States are implementing innovative approaches to expand coverage and control premiums due to the lack of federal health care reform. The curr_chunk discusses financial struggles faced by new health programs and the lack of federal grants to assist states in implementing innovative health reforms. It also highlights the problem of asymmetric information in the health insurance market, where consumers have limited access to comparable information about plans. The Amendment provides $50 billion in incentives to states for health insurance reforms, including reducing costs and expanding coverage in the small group and individual markets. The goal is to decrease the number of uninsured individuals. The Amendment provides $50 billion in incentives to states for health insurance reforms in the individual market. States must meet targets for premium reductions and reducing the number of uninsured to receive funds. The Secretary will determine if targets are met based on a premium baseline and factors like inflation and demographic changes. The Amendment incentivizes states with $50 billion for health insurance reforms in the individual market. States must meet targets for premium reductions and reducing the number of uninsured to receive funds. The Secretary will determine if targets are met based on a premium baseline and factors like inflation and demographic changes. The Amendment also outlines a methodology for calculating the percentage of uninsured nonelderly residents, excluding unauthorized aliens. The Amendment allows for the creation of State Health Plan Finders to help consumers compare health insurance options. Each state can contract with a private entity to develop a plan finder website within 12 months. The plan finder must provide uniform information on costs and benefits of health insurance plans and be accessible to all individuals in the state. The Plan Finder, available online, allows consumers to search and compare health insurance plans based on specific criteria, including quality data. It complies with state laws and regulations, assists Medicaid and CHIP eligible individuals, and requires participating plans to be financially sound and meet certain requirements. The organization behind the Plan Finder must also meet solvency and privacy standards, with no conflicts of interest with health insurance issuers. The Plan Finder organization must not have conflicts of interest with health insurance issuers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the Amendment would increase the federal deficit by $8 billion over 2009-2019, but would lower average insurance premiums in the small group and individual markets by 7-10% and 5-8% respectively in 2016. Premiums in the large group market would also see a decrease of 0-3%. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the Amendment would reduce the number of nonelderly uninsured by about 3 million in 2019, leaving 52 million uninsured. They also predict a $6 billion reduction in the federal deficit over 10 years due to insurance reforms. Additionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) promotes electronic record keeping in the healthcare system. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandated electronic format and data standards for various healthcare transactions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued initial standards in 2000, with updated standards published in 2009. Compliance deadline for the updated standards is January 1, 2012. The HIPAA standard for health care payment and remittance advice transactions allows for electronic funds transfer (EFT) but does not mandate it. Providers can choose to submit transactions electronically, but if they do, they must comply with the standard. Congress mandated Medicare claims to be submitted electronically under the Administrative Simplification Compliance Act in 2001. The HIPAA Compliance Act mandated Medicare claims to be submitted electronically in the standard format, with exceptions for small providers. Providers face multiple companion guides and plan-specific requirements, customizing transactions accordingly. Unique identifiers for providers and employers have been adopted, while the health plan identifier is still under review. Congress has blocked the development of a unique individual identifier. The Amendment in the annual Labor-HHS appropriations bill aims to establish a timeline for developing consensus-based operating rules for HIPAA transactions, including EFT for health claims payment. Operating rules would be defined as necessary business rules for electronic information exchange, with adoption by July 1, 2011, and implementation by January 1, 2013. The Amendment in the annual Labor-HHS appropriations bill sets deadlines for adopting and implementing operating rules for various HIPAA transactions. These rules must be in place for status transactions by July 1, 2011, and effective by January 1, 2013. Operating rules for claims payment/remittance and EFT must be adopted by July 1, 2012, and effective by January 1, 2014. Additional operating rules for other HIPAA transactions must be adopted by July 1, 2014, and effective by January 1, 2016. Health plans must certify compliance with these standards by December 31, 2013. By December 31, 2015, health plans must certify compliance with the most current standards and operating rules for HIPAA transactions. The Secretary may designate an outside entity to verify certification and conduct audits to ensure ongoing compliance. Penalty fees will be assessed for non-compliance, with the Treasury responsible for fee collection. Interest will be added to unpaid penalty fees. The Amendment includes provisions for penalty fees, interest payments for unpaid fees, and requirements for Medicare payments to be made electronically. It also mandates a report on electronic transactions in Medicare and Medicaid programs and the establishment of a unique health plan identifier. The Secretary would issue a rule to establish a unique health plan identifier, with potential savings of $6 billion in Medicaid over 10 years and increased revenues of $13 billion from reducing private health insurance costs. Small employers often don't offer health insurance due to cost, as their limited risk pool makes them less stable than larger firms. The Amendment aims to establish Association Health Plans (AHPs) to help small employers offer health insurance through business associations that meet specific qualifications. Small firms face challenges in providing health insurance due to factors like being medically underwritten, having limited market power, and lacking economies of scale. The Amendment establishes Association Health Plans (AHPs) for small employers to offer health insurance. AHPs must meet certification requirements from the Labor Secretary and comply with specific criteria, including having at least 1,000 participants, a diverse membership, and fiscal responsibility. The Amendment imposes non-discrimination requirements on Association Health Plans (AHPs), ensuring that membership, dues, and plan coverage are not based on health factors. Participating employers must be eligible to qualify, and all coverage options must be available to them. Premiums cannot be based on health status or type of business. The Amendment allows Association Health Plans (AHPs) to determine benefits, set premiums based on claims experience, and establish an \"Association Health Plan Fund\" for distressed AHPs. The Labor Secretary would regulate AHPs and take action in case of failure. The Amendment establishes an \"Association Health Plan Fund\" for distressed AHPs, financed by annual payments, supplemental payments, penalties for non-payments, and investment income. Penalties for misrepresentation include imprisonment, fines, or both. The Secretary can require uncertified AHPs to cease activities and consult with the \"primary\" state for enforcement and certification. The Amendment establishes an \"Association Health Plan Fund\" for distressed AHPs, financed by annual payments, supplemental payments, penalties for non-payments, and investment income. The Secretary can require uncertified AHPs to cease activities and consult with the \"primary\" state for enforcement and certification. AHPs would be certified by the Secretary based on the state where policy approval was obtained, participant residence, and trust location. Title II of the Amendment, effective one year after enactment, requires the Secretary to issue regulations before implementation. Certain existing plans meeting specific criteria would be deemed group health plans under the Amendment. The Amendment clarifies that multiple trades or businesses can be considered a single employer if they establish a multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) for providing medical care to employees. The determination of common control and coverage of employees would be regulated by the Labor Secretary. The MEWA represents 75% of all workers with coverage. Employers are not required to offer health insurance, and there are no federal statutes on dependent coverage age limits. Some states allow young adults to stay on their parents' policy until a certain age or circumstance. Auto-enrollment in health insurance is not federally regulated. The Amendment would require group health plans to offer auto-enrollment. The Amendment would require group health plans to offer auto-enrollment for dependents up to age 25, with employers providing annual notification and the option to decline coverage. States could not prevent auto-enrollment, but individuals could opt out. State laws and regulations governing health insurance address patient protections, rate development, licensing requirements, grievance procedures, and taxation. The Amendment would allow health insurance issuers to offer coverage in multiple states. The Amendment allows health insurance issuers to offer individual health insurance in a secondary state exempt from that state's laws, as long as they do not prohibit the issuer's operation, require coverage to be countersigned, or discriminate against the issuer. The primary state has jurisdiction over enforcing its laws, while secondary states retain authority over certain regulatory activities. The Amendment allows health insurance issuers to offer individual health insurance in a secondary state exempt from that state's laws. Issuers must comply with various financial and regulatory requirements, including disclosure of coverage limitations and restrictions on reclassifying or increasing premiums based on health factors. Issuers are also permitted to terminate coverage for nonpayment of premiums. The Amendment allows health insurance issuers to offer individual health insurance in a secondary state exempt from that state's laws. Issuers can terminate coverage for nonpayment of premiums, raise premiums based on claims experience, offer premium discounts for wellness activities, reinstate lapsed coverage, and adjust rates retroactively for misrepresented information. Issuers must submit information to state insurance commissioners and quarterly financial statements certified by an independent public accountant. The Amendment aims to expand the tax-deductibility of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and allow premiums for certain high deductible health plans to be tax-deductible. Contributions to HSAs are tax deductible, withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, and unused balances can accumulate without limit. Premiums for high deductible health plans are not considered qualified medical expenses. The Amendment aims to improve coordination between administrators of HDHPs and HSA accounts, provide a 60-day grace period for medical expenses, and offer a non-refundable tax credit for HSA contributions. The HSA provisions in the Amendment are estimated to cost $5 billion over 10 years, with the tax credit phasing out for higher income levels. The Amendment proposes a non-refundable tax credit for HSA contributions, with thresholds set at $55,500 for joint filers and $27,750 for single filers. The credit is capped at $1,000 or the amount of tax owed without the credit. Additionally, it expands the definition of qualified medical expenses to include premiums for high-deductible plans purchased in the individual market. The Amendment proposes national medical malpractice laws that would preempt existing state laws, with exceptions. It includes provisions such as statutes of limitation, caps on damages, and changes to tort doctrines. Other reform efforts may require pre-trial dispute resolution or an affidavit of merit from an expert. The Amendment proposes national medical malpractice laws that would preempt existing state laws, with exceptions. It includes provisions such as statutes of limitation, caps on damages, and changes to tort doctrines. A \"health care lawsuit\" would encompass claims against various entities related to medical products and services affecting interstate commerce. The provisions are expected to reduce spending by $41 billion over a 10-year period. The lawsuit must be filed within three years of injury manifestation or discovery, with exceptions for fraud, intentional concealment, or foreign presence. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws would limit noneconomic damages to $250,000, while not restricting economic damages. It includes provisions for statutes of limitation and exceptions for cases involving fraud, intentional concealment, or foreign bodies. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws would limit noneconomic damages to $250,000, defining them as damages for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, and loss of enjoyment of life. A jury would not be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages, and any excess amount awarded would be reduced either before or after judgment. If multiple defendants are involved, each would be responsible for damages in proportion to their individual percentage. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws would limit punitive damages to the greater of $250,000 or two times the amount of economic damages awarded. Punitive damages would only be awarded if the defendant acted with malicious intent, and would not be given in a health care lawsuit without compensatory damages. The responsibility for damages would be determined by the trier of fact for each party involved. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws would limit punitive damages to the greater of $250,000 or two times the amount of economic damages awarded. Punitive damages would only be awarded if the defendant acted with malicious intent, and would not be given in a health care lawsuit without compensatory damages. A claimant could request punitive damages only after establishing a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim. Alternatively, either party could request a separate proceeding to determine if punitive damages should be awarded and the amount. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws would limit punitive damages to the greater of $250,000 or two times the amount of economic damages awarded. Punitive damages would only be awarded if the defendant acted with malicious intent. A claimant could request punitive damages only after establishing a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim. Alternatively, either party could request a separate proceeding to determine if punitive damages should be awarded and the amount, considering specific factors. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws would impose limits on punitive damages, with a cap of $250,000 or two times the economic damages awarded. It would also regulate attorney fees in health care lawsuits, with a sliding scale based on the amount recovered by the claimant(s). The court would have the power to supervise payment arrangements to prevent conflicts of interest. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws includes limits on punitive damages and regulates attorney fees in health care lawsuits. It allows parties to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits, with the opposing party able to present evidence of payments made for those benefits. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws includes limits on punitive damages, regulates attorney fees, and allows evidence of collateral source benefits in health care lawsuits. It precludes providers from recovering amounts from claimants or placing liens on their recovery. Future damages over $50,000 can be paid by periodic payments if the party has sufficient insurance or assets. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws limits punitive damages, regulates attorney fees, and allows evidence of collateral source benefits in health care lawsuits. It precludes providers from recovering amounts from claimants or placing liens on their recovery. Future damages over $50,000 can be paid by periodic payments if the party has sufficient insurance or assets. The Amendment would not apply to title XXI of the Public Health Service Act in vaccine-related injury or death claims, except where federal rule of law does not apply. It would preempt provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act to the extent that it provides for greater damages, longer lawsuit commencement period, or limits on future damages payments. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws limits punitive damages, regulates attorney fees, and allows evidence of collateral source benefits in health care lawsuits. It precludes providers from recovering amounts from claimants or placing liens on their recovery. The Amendment provides states with flexibility and does not preempt any state law specifying monetary damages. The proposed Amendment to national medical malpractice laws limits punitive damages, regulates attorney fees, and allows evidence of collateral source benefits in health care lawsuits. It precludes providers from recovering amounts from claimants or placing liens on their recovery. The Amendment provides states with flexibility and does not preempt any state law specifying monetary damages. Additionally, the Amendment's provisions apply to health care lawsuits initiated after its enactment, with exceptions for cases arising from injuries prior to the enactment date. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for various health-related programs under the Department of Health and Human Services. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (FCCCER) was established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to coordinate comparative effectiveness research activities among federal departments and agencies. The FCCCER is composed of senior officials from health-related federal agencies and is tasked with submitting annual reports on current CER activities and recommendations for future research. The Council is not allowed to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for public or private payers. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (FCCCER) was established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Council is not allowed to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer. The provisions in Division D of the Amendment clarify that nothing in this Act would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship or the practice of medicine. Wellness programs incentivize healthy behaviors to reduce healthcare costs. Wellness programs offered by employers are subject to federal laws like HIPAA, which prohibits discrimination based on health factors. This includes not charging higher premiums based on health-related factors. HIPAA allows group health plans and insurance issuers to offer premium discounts or modify copayments for participation in wellness programs. There are two categories of wellness programs under HIPAA regulations: those that reward participation without additional standards, and those that require meeting health-related standards for a reward. The Amendment modifies HIPAA's nondiscrimination requirements to allow group health plans to vary premiums and cost sharing by up to 50% based on participation in a standards-based wellness program. This applies to group health coverage and insurers in the individual market regulated by the PHSA. The changes will apply to plan years and insurance coverage offered or renewed at least one year after the enactment of the act. Health care fraud costs billions annually, with estimates ranging from 3% to 10% of all health care expenditures. These losses lead to higher costs for consumers, health plans, and public insurance programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) conduct program integrity activities to prevent, detect, and investigate health care fraud, aiming to reduce improper payments and identify fraudulent activities. Developing new approaches to combat fraud is crucial as health care expenditures continue to rise. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) collaborate with federal agencies like HHS OIG, DOJ, and FBI to combat health care fraud. The HCFAC program funds activities to detect and prosecute fraud in both public and private health care programs. The HCFAC program, established by HIPAA, consists of three funding streams for anti-fraud activities. Funding was extended by TRHCA in 2006. Total funding for health care fraud activities in FY2009 was approximately $1.4 billion. The Amendment to the Medicare program requires providers and suppliers to undergo screening with criminal background checks, fingerprinting, and other checks funded by an application fee. It also includes enhanced oversight measures such as prepayment claims review and penalties for false statements. The Amendment does not apply if funding is not provided. The Amendment aims to improve the identification of instances where Medicare should act as the secondary payer to private health insurance. It also includes a provision for Medicaid, requiring states to have a strategy in their Medicaid plan to ascertain third-party liability for payment. Compliance would make states eligible for bonuses. The Amendment includes provisions for compliance to receive bonuses or face a reduction in FMAP. It targets CMS's data systems, requiring the completion of an Integrated Data Repository for Medicare and Medicaid claims. The Amendment authorizes the Secretary to perform data matching between Medicare, Medicaid, and the Social Security Administration. It requires the consolidation of various databases into one centralized database to prevent excluded providers from billing Medicare or Medicaid. The Amendment requires the Secretary to consolidate databases into one centralized database for abuse/neglect registry, provider information, and sanctions. It authorizes the Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties on providers who submit erroneous information and to exclude them from Medicare and Medicaid. The Amendment authorizes the Secretary to exclude providers from Medicare for false statements and increase funding for the HCFAC account to $300 million annually, with additional funds for the OIG. The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of federal funds for abortions, with $100 million allocated annually from 2010 to 2019. This provision is included in the annual appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. The Hyde Amendment restricts federal funds from being used for abortions, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is in danger. The Weldon Amendment prohibits discrimination against health care entities that refuse to provide or refer for abortions, ensuring federal funds are not used for such purposes. The Amendment would codify the Hyde and Weldon Amendments, eliminating the need to add them to annual appropriations measures. It would also allow for the purchase of separate abortion coverage as long as federal funds are not used. The Amendment would codify the Hyde and Weldon Amendments, allowing separate abortion coverage without federal funds. A biosimilar is similar to a brand-name biologic, while a generic drug is the same as a brand-name chemical drug. Comparing the structure of a biosimilar and the brand-name biologic is scientifically challenging. Comparing the structure of a biosimilar and a brand-name biologic is scientifically challenging due to the complexity of biologics, which are made from living organisms and often require special handling. Congress is interested in creating an expedited pathway for biosimilar approval to achieve cost savings, similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act for generic chemical drugs. The Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, allows generic drug companies to prove their product is chemically the same as the innovator drug, saving costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. The Act aims to reduce the high prices of brand-name biologics like Enbrel, with hopes that FDA approval of biosimilars will lead to market competition and price reductions. The Amendment under the Hatch-Waxman Act would establish a pathway for the approval of biosimilars, which are biological products highly similar to reference products. The Secretary would have the authority to determine if certain elements in the application for licensure of a biosimilar are unnecessary, and to designate a biological product as interchangeable with a reference product based on specified criteria. The Amendment under the Hatch-Waxman Act would allow for the substitution of biosimilars without the intervention of a healthcare provider. Special requirements would apply to certain biosimilars with higher risks. It would provide a period of exclusive marketing for the first interchangeable biological product and a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product, with an additional six months if pediatric studies show benefits. The Secretary may publish proposed guidance for public comment on the licensure of biological products. The Amendment under the Hatch-Waxman Act establishes a process for public input on guidance issuance for biological products. It requires unique names for labeling and packaging, sets a process for patent infringement claims, and mandates filing copies of texts with the Assistant Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission. The Amendment under the Hatch-Waxman Act requires the filing of agreements regarding the manufacture, marketing, or sale of products with the Assistant Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission. Failure to comply may result in civil fines. The Amendment also allows for the collection of user fees for biosimilar approval applications and considers a biosimilar applicant's statement on patents as potential infringement. The Amendment under the Hatch-Waxman Act requires filing agreements related to products with the Assistant Attorney General and FTC, with civil fines for non-compliance. It also allows for the collection of user fees for biosimilar approval applications and considers a biosimilar applicant's statement on patents as potential infringement. If the biosimilar applicant asserts that patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, it could be deemed as patent infringement actionable in court."
