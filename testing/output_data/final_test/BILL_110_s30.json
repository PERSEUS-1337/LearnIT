    "content": "The \"Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act\" or the \"HOPE Act\" aims to intensify research for improved understanding and treatments of diseases. It also promotes the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines without creating or harming human embryos for research purposes. The Secretary will conduct research to develop techniques for stem cell isolation, production, and testing, aiming to improve treatments for diseases without creating or harming human embryos. Final guidelines will be issued within 90 days of enactment. The Director of NIH will issue final guidelines for additional research on human cells, prioritizing those with potential clinical benefits and considering techniques outlined by the President's Council on Bioethics. Grant applicants for research involving stem cells from naturally dead embryos must provide assurances. Grant applicants for research involving stem cells from naturally dead embryos must provide assurances that no alterations were made solely for deriving stem cells. Reporting requirements mandate an annual report on activities, and there is no change in policy regarding stem cell line funding eligibility. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the section, which includes definitions for \"naturally dead\" and \"human embryo or embryos.\" The term 'risk of injury' in the context of human embryos refers to subjecting them to a level of risk greater than permitted for research on fetuses in utero. SEC. 4. NATIONAL AMNIOTIC AND PLACENTAL STEM CELL BANK. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on an optimal structure for an amniotic and placental stem cell bank program. The study will address key issues such as collection, storage, standards, distribution, and research. Input will be gathered from relevant experts, and a report on the study's results will be submitted within 180 days. The Senate passed the bill on April 11, 2007. Attest: NANCY ERICKSON, Secretary."
