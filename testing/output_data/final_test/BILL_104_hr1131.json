Section 253 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include a mid-year sequester process where the Director of OMB determines deficit limits on April 1 each fiscal year. If the limit is exceeded, a preliminary sequester occurs to eliminate the excess, with budget authority permanently canceled on April 15. The margin for sequester determination is zero, and specific procedures are outlined. On September 30 of each fiscal year, the Director of OMB determines if laws will cause the deficit to exceed the limit. If exceeded, a preliminary sequester on October 1 eliminates the excess, with budget authority permanently canceled on October 15. The margin for sequester determination is zero. Sequestration procedures under this subsection shall have a zero margin. The President must submit a revised budget for fiscal year 1996 by May 6, 1995, conforming to spending limitations. The amendments and limits established in this title will apply to fiscal years starting from 1996 and will continue despite the termination of any related Act."
