    "content": "President Clinton used his authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906 to establish 19 new national monuments and enlarge 3 others, raising concerns about the President's authority, impact on development, access for recreation, and lack of environmental studies and public input. Lawsuits challenged several monuments, leading the Bush Administration to review monument actions. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands containing historic landmarks, structures, and objects of historic or scientific interest. The act does not specify procedures for creating monuments and was created to protect federal lands and resources from theft and destruction of archaeological sites. Congress has considered bills to restrict the President's authority to create monuments, but courts have supported presidential actions and segments of the public support monument protections. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands to protect historic landmarks and objects of scientific interest. Congress has limited the President's authority in Wyoming and Alaska. Over 120 national monuments have been designated, totaling more than 70 million acres. Presidents and Congress have modified and converted some monuments into other designations. President Clinton created 19 new and enlarged 3 monuments, totaling 5.9 million federal acres. President Roosevelt used his authority 28 times, and President Carter created 56 million acres in Alaska. Controversies have arisen over presidentially-created monuments. Various issues surrounding presidentially-created monuments have sparked controversy and legal battles. These issues include the size of protected areas, inclusion of non-federal lands, restrictions on land use, creation process, managing agency selection, and other legal concerns. Courts have upheld the President's authority to create monuments, dismissing challenges based on various grounds such as improper delegation of authority, lack of specificity, and alleged violations of environmental laws. Critics argue that President Clinton's designation of large monuments under the Antiquities Act exceeded the intended narrow and limited authority. They claim that the Act was used for broad purposes like general conservation and scenic protection. Supporters defend the President's discretion in determining acreage for resource protection. The Antiquities Act is debated for its broad discretion in protecting historic or scientific objects. Courts have upheld the President's authority on monument designations, which may include non-federal lands. Concerns exist about development on non-federal lands within monument boundaries, but land exchanges with the federal government are an option for concerned state and local landowners. The Antiquities Act grants the President broad discretion in protecting historic or scientific objects, including non-federal lands. Concerns arise about limiting development on federal lands through monument designation, impacting jobs and tax revenues. Recent proclamations restrict new mineral leases, mining claims, and energy development within monuments. Land exchanges with the federal government are an option for concerned state and local landowners. The FY2006 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-54) continued a ban on using funds for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except where allowed by presidential proclamations. Mineral activities within monuments may require higher environmental regulation standards. Monuments can have positive economic impacts like increased tourism and business relocation. Some argue that development is not sufficiently limited due to preserved rights for activities like mineral development and grazing. Opposition exists to restrictions on recreation activities within monuments. Critics of the Antiquities Act argue that it is inconsistent with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, which limited the President's withdrawal authority and required congressional review of large withdrawals. Supporters note that Congress did not repeal the Antiquities Act when enacting FLPMA. Critics of the Antiquities Act argue for amending it to require public and scientific input similar to other laws. They believe this would prevent resource impairment and additional expenses. President Clinton chose the Bureau of Land Management to manage new monuments, causing some concern. President Clinton chose the Bureau of Land Management to manage new monuments, leading to concerns about the agency's expertise in land conservation. The BLM's emphasis on land protection allows for multiple uses like mineral development, timber harvesting, and hunting, which may not be compatible with National Park Service management. Some argue that the Antiquities Act grants the President too much power, as it delegates Congress' authority to create monuments. The President's authority to create monuments is essentially limitless, raising questions about whether a President can modify or eliminate a national monument designation. The Bush Administration examined President Clinton's monument actions, including the exclusion of non-federal lands from monument boundaries. The Bush Administration reviewed President Clinton's monument designations, including excluding non-federal lands from monument boundaries. President Bush reestablished the Governors Island National Monument in New York in 2003. Legislation to amend the Antiquities Act has been considered in previous Congresses, but not yet in the 109th Congress. Legislation proposed to make presidential monument designations over 50,000 acres ineffective without Congressional approval within two years. It would also require public input and management plans in line with the National Environmental Policy Act. Previous Congresses have considered altering monuments to exclude private land."
