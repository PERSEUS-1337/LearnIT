The Commission is authorized to use the United States mails like other Federal departments and agencies. SEC. 5. COMMISSION PERSONNEL MATTERS. The Commission members are compensated differently based on their federal status. Non-federal members do not receive compensation, while federal officers or employees serve without additional pay. Travel expenses are allowed for Commission members at authorized rates. The chairperson has authority over the Commission staff. The chairperson of the Commission has the authority to appoint an executive director and additional staff without following civil service laws. The executive director can determine their own compensation, not exceeding the maximum rate for a GS-15 position. The executive director and personnel of the Commission are federal employees under title 5, United States Code. Members of the Commission are not included. Federal Government employees can be detailed to the Commission without reimbursement. Temporary and intermittent services can be procured. The chairperson of the Commission may procure temporary and intermittent services under section 3109(b) of title 5, United States Code, at rates not exceeding the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. The Commission will terminate 90 days after submitting the report under section 3(d). Congressional consideration of reform proposals will follow. In this section, an implementation bill is defined as a bill introduced without modification containing proposed legislation from a report submitted to Congress. A calendar day is defined as a day when either House is not in session due to an adjournment of more than 3 days. On the first day both Houses are in session following the report submission, a single implementation bill must be introduced in the Senate by the majority leader. Implementation bills introduced in the Senate by the majority leader and designated Members, and in the House of Representatives by the Speaker and designated Members, shall be referred to appropriate committees for jurisdiction. Implementation bills introduced in the House of Representatives may be reported without amendment by the committee. If a committee fails to report the bill within 15 days, it will be discharged and placed on the calendar for floor consideration. The motion to proceed to the consideration of the implementation bill is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate. It is not debatable, subject to amendment, or a motion to postpone. If agreed to, the implementation bill becomes the unfinished business. The implementation bill is the unfinished business of the House until disposed of. It cannot be amended in the Senate or the House of Representatives. Debate is limited to 10 hours, with equal time for those in favor and those opposing. Further debate limitations and amendments are not allowed. A vote on final passage follows immediately. After the conclusion of debate on an implementation bill, a vote on final passage occurs. Appeals on procedural rulings by the Chair are decided without debate. If one House receives an implementation bill from the other House before passing its own, specific procedures apply. The implementation bill of the other House shall not be referred to a committee. The procedure for voting on the bill in the receiving House is the same as if no implementation bill had been received, but the final passage vote will be on the bill from the other House. This section is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House for the procedure to be followed. The rules for an implementation bill in one House supersede other rules only if inconsistent, and each House has the right to change its rules regarding procedures at any time. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 is provided in this Act."
