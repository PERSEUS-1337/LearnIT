    "content": "With the end of the recession in June 2009, congressional focus remains on job creation and income security for workers. Despite the traditional path of education for high-wage jobs, recent graduates face challenges with high unemployment rates. Many young workers are either unemployed or underemployed, with a 16.3% unemployment rate among individuals aged 16 to 24 in the US in February 2013. Workers who lose their jobs often rely on Unemployment Compensation benefits for income support. Graduating students and recent graduates may be eligible for Unemployment Compensation benefits if they worked and became subsequently unemployed. However, students who worked while attending school may face barriers to their UC claims. Eligibility for benefits may differ by state, with some states disqualifying workers from UC. The report examines how states define student eligibility for Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits, which may vary by state. UC is a joint federal-state program providing benefits to eligible workers, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. The program is financed by federal taxes under FUTA and state payroll taxes under SUTA. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is financed by federal taxes under FUTA and state payroll taxes under SUTA. Federal law provides broad guidelines for UC coverage and eligibility, with each state establishing its own criteria resulting in essentially 53 different UC programs. State laws determine UC benefit eligibility, payments, and duration based on qualified wages. Eligible workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and are willing, able, and available to work can receive UC benefits. Recent college graduates and younger individuals may have difficulty receiving Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits due to specific eligibility criteria. To qualify, a recent graduate must have worked in covered employment, earned sufficient wages in the base period, and left their job involuntarily. While federal law does not exclude recent graduates from receiving UC benefits if unemployed, the likelihood of eligibility is low. In February 2013, the unemployment rate for individuals aged 16 to 24 was high. In February 2013, the unemployment rate for individuals aged 16 to 24 was 16.3%, with about 3.5 million in this age group unemployed in the United States. Younger workers received 8.9% of total UC benefits but made up 29.1% of the unemployed population. Only 1 in 10 unemployed workers aged 16 to 24 receives unemployment insurance. Graduates during a recession may face reduced earnings for up to 10 years compared to those in a booming economy. UC benefits are funded through employer taxes established by federal and state law. UC benefits are funded through employer taxes established by federal and state law, with federal taxes under FUTA and state taxes under SUTA. State laws govern student eligibility, with FUTA providing guidelines for school personnel. Most states disqualify students from UC benefits, presuming they are unable to work full-time while in school. Workers need established wages before receiving benefits, with sufficiency depending on part-time earnings. States vary in defining student eligibility for UC benefits, including distinctions between part-time and full-time students. FUTA mandates disqualifying school employees from benefits if they have a contract to return to work. This also applies to school personnel working irregularly across academic terms. The report discusses the eligibility of school personnel for UC benefits during non-successive academic terms. States generally disqualify students from UC benefits while attending school due to presumed unavailability for full-time work. Some states may allow students to qualify for UC benefits if certain conditions are met, such as school attendance not interfering with work availability. States vary in their exceptions to disqualification for UC benefits for students, with around 45% allowing eligibility if students can accept suitable work. Additionally, almost one-third of states permit students to qualify for UC benefits while in school if they are in an approved training program or willing to adjust their school schedule for work. However, some states have stricter eligibility requirements for students, while others have fewer restrictions on UC eligibility for students attending school. Some states have varying restrictions on UC eligibility for students attending school. Table 1 illustrates the differences, with only three states not providing an exception to benefits disqualification if attending school. State laws differ on eligibility criteria, with some requiring availability for work or seeking full-time work, while others consider students eligible if they are attending appropriate training. Additionally, states vary on disqualifying individuals from UC benefits for leaving work to attend school, with just over half of states, including the District of Columbia, having such disqualifications. Some states have restrictions on UC eligibility for students attending school. Most states disqualify students if they leave work to attend school, except for approved training or training under TAA. Only eight states have no restrictions on students leaving work and remaining eligible for UC benefits. Individual states approve training programs for students to attend and stay eligible for UC benefits. State workforce agencies determine qualified training providers for educational programs, including those under WIA and TAA. WIA supports workforce development through state grants for job training, while TAA assists workers affected by foreign trade. These programs are administered by DOL in partnership with each state. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 authorized various types of training programs, including employer-based, remedial, technical skills, and vocational courses. Training providers may offer programs through agreements with state workforce agencies, delivered in different formats such as classroom, correspondence, web-based, or apprenticeships. The treatment of students in the Unemployment Compensation program varies by state, with only a few allowing students to attend school and qualify for benefits while unemployed. In approximately half the states, students must show availability for full-time work to qualify for UC benefits. Some states require students to be willing to quit school for a job offer. States are less flexible when workers leave jobs for school. About one-third of states allow benefits for training courses under approved programs, with varying content. Each state workforce agency decides what training qualifies for benefits while attending school. States determine approved training for school attendance and benefits eligibility. Training providers must be eligible under WIA or TAA to receive funds."
