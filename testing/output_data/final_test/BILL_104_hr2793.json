    "content": "The \"Conservation Incentives Program Act of 1995\" establishes a program for conservation incentives, with defined priorities, duties for operators and the secretary, eligible lands, and funding. Definitions are provided in the Act. The \"Conservation Incentives Program Act of 1995\" defines conservation practices as structural, vegetative, or management practices tailored to protect soil, water, and related resources. Structural practices include constructed measures like waste treatment lagoons, while vegetative practices use vegetation such as crop rotation to achieve conservation goals. The \"Conservation Incentives Program Act of 1995\" defines conservation practices as practices used to manage crops, livestock, nutrients, or pesticides, as determined by the Secretary. The term \"management practice\" refers to measures used for this purpose. Additionally, a \"program plan\" includes an evaluation of farm resources, management decisions, implementation schedule, eligible conservation practices, and estimated total cost. The term \"large confined livestock operation\" applies to confined animal feeding operations with more than a specified number of animals. The term \"operator\" refers to a person engaged in crop or livestock production as defined by the Secretary of Agriculture. A \"large confined livestock operation\" is one that has more than a specified number of mature dairy cattle, beef cattle, laying hens or broilers, turkeys, swine, or sheep or lambs. Establishment and administration of conservation incentive program. During 1996-2005, the Secretary will implement a conservation incentive program providing technical assistance, cost-sharing, and incentive payments to operators for conservation practices. The program aims to address local resource issues in agriculture by offering flexible assistance for soil, water, and wildlife habitat conservation. The conservation incentive program aims to assist operators in complying with environmental laws, making beneficial changes to cropping and grazing systems, and simplifying the conservation planning process. It also aims to complement other Federal and State programs for optimal use at the local level where resource problems exist. The conservation incentive program aims to assist operators in complying with environmental laws, making beneficial changes to cropping and grazing systems, and simplifying the conservation planning process. It also aims to complement other Federal and State programs for optimal use at the local level where resource problems exist, including coordination through State technical committees and development of performance measurement processes for each local resource problem area. Technical assistance is provided to operators to develop and implement approved program plans. The conservation incentive program offers technical assistance for developing and implementing program plans on farms or ranches, cost-share payments for structural and vegetative practices, and incentive payments for management practices. Contracts between operators and the Secretary may include terms and conditions for participation in the program. The conservation incentives program allows the Secretary to apply to conservation practices, with contracts lasting up to 10 years and providing cost-share and incentive payments. If the operator is a tenant, they need the owner's approval. The total payments under the program cannot exceed $10,000 per fiscal year. The conservation incentives program allows contracts up to 10 years with cost-share payments. Payments can be up to $10,000 per fiscal year for one-year contracts or $75,000 for multiyear contracts. The Federal share of cost-share payments for structural or vegetative practices is limited to 75 percent. Livestock operations have a special rule. The conservation incentives program offers contracts up to 10 years with cost-share payments of up to $10,000 per fiscal year for one-year contracts or $75,000 for multiyear contracts. The Federal share of cost-share payments for structural or vegetative practices is limited to 75 percent. Livestock operations have specific rules regarding eligibility for cost-sharing on animal waste management facilities.

The Federal share of cost-share payments for structural or vegetative practices is limited to 75 percent. Livestock operations have specific rules regarding eligibility for cost-sharing on animal waste management facilities. The operator may perform management practices as necessary for program purposes and public interest. Funding for technical assistance is allocated based on purpose and projected cost, without affecting eligibility for assistance under other authorities. The Secretary can modify or terminate contracts with operators under the program if needed. The Secretary can modify or terminate contracts under the conservation incentives program if the operator agrees and it is in the public interest. The Secretary may also terminate a contract if the operator violates it. The Secretary can request assistance from various agencies for technical support in implementing conservation practices. Regulations must be established within 180 days of enactment. Within 180 days of enactment, the Secretary will issue regulations for the conservation incentive program administration. SEC. 4. PROGRAM PRIORITIES AND COORDINATION. The Secretary provides technical assistance, cost-share, and incentive payments to operators in priority areas based on soil, water, and natural resource problems. Coordination of priorities is done within States or multiple States to optimize program effectiveness. National criteria are established for selecting priority areas. State and local contributions are also considered. The Secretary prioritizes operations in areas where State or local governments provide financial or technical assistance for conservation purposes. Priority is also given to installing conservation practices on lands contributing to water quality standards or environmental objectives. SEC. 5. DUTIES OF OPERATORS. Operators participating in the conservation incentives program must agree to implement a program plan with approved conservation practices, refrain from actions that undermine program goals, and comply with contract terms. Violations may result in repayment of payments received and forfeiture of future incentives. Operators in the conservation incentives program must agree to assume obligations of the contract, refund payments received, provide necessary information for compliance, and adhere to additional provisions determined by the Secretary. The Secretary's duties include assisting operators in achieving conservation goals by providing eligibility assessments, technical assistance, cost-sharing payments, and encouraging obtaining assistance from other sources. Eligible lands are determined under the program. Agricultural land eligible for conservation incentives program includes land posing a threat to soil, water, or related resources and critical agricultural areas identified in a state plan under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The conservation incentives program includes agricultural land with priority pollution issues, areas recommended for protection by the State lead agency, and land that would defeat the program's purpose if not managed properly. The conservation incentives program prioritizes agricultural land with pollution issues, areas recommended for protection, and land crucial for the program's success. Funding is addressed in Section 8. The conservation incentive program funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation from 1996 to 2005 includes cost-sharing, incentives, and technical assistance. Funding is limited to $100 million for 1996 and $300 million for 1997-2005. At least 50% of funds must be used for livestock production conservation practices. The Secretary has the discretion to allocate less than 50% of the total program funding for a fiscal year. The Secretary can allocate less than 50 percent of the total program funding for a fiscal year for conservation practices related to livestock production, but not less than 35 percent if deemed necessary based on participant demand."
