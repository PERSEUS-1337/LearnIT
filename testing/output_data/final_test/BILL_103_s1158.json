    "content": "The Act titled \"Family Unity Demonstration Project Act of 1993\" is established for the purpose of promoting family unity. Congress finds that the increasing separation of children from their incarcerated parents can cause irreparable harm to the children's well-being and hinder their development. This separation prevents parent-child bonding crucial for children's sense of security and trust, while maintaining relationships with their children can incentivize prisoners to participate in rehabilitative programs. The Act aims to create projects to help children and caretaker parents affected by parental incarceration, promote policies for prisoners to be housed closer to their families, reduce prison populations, decrease recidivism by supporting family relationships, and cut correctional costs. Maintaining family ties during imprisonment can lower recidivism rates and prison expenses. The Act aims to reduce recidivism and maintain community correctional facilities at a lower cost. SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the Act, including the Attorney General, child, and community correctional facility. The community correctional facility is described as a residential facility for eligible prisoners and their children, located in a nonrural area with a maximum capacity of 25 prisoners and providing a safe environment for children. The community correctional facility provides a stimulating environment for children under professional supervision, medical care, culturally sensitive programs for parent-child relationships, alcoholism and drug addiction treatment, and support services for residents. The term \"eligible prisoner\" refers to a primary caretaker parent sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison, currently serving their sentence. Eligible prisoners have access to services such as mental and physical health support, housing assistance post-release, education, employment or training opportunities, and childcare. (B) is currently incarcerated to serve a sentence, (C) is not eligible for probation or parole for over 180 days, and (D) has never been convicted of specific serious crimes. The term \"Institute\" refers to the National Institute of Corrections. The term \"primary caretaker parent\" refers to a parent with legal custody of a child who was responsible for the child's housing, health, and safety before incarceration, or a woman who gives birth to a child while incarcerated or within a year before incarceration. The term \"State\" includes all states and the District of Columbia. Authorization of Appropriations: $8,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 1993-1997. 80% for title II grants to states, 20% for title III grants. The Director of the Institute can grant funds to States for family unity demonstration projects allowing eligible prisoners to live in community correctional facilities with their children. Preference is given to States that involve their corrections and health agencies in the project. The grant requested involves public and nonprofit organizations in project implementation. Boards with diverse members will advise the State. Community placement is prioritized over traditional incarceration. Economically disadvantaged prisoners and their children are targeted for participation. The State has a policy to place prisoners in facilities closest to their family homes, implement a project within 180 days of receiving a grant, and select eligible prisoners within 30 days of receiving the grant or being sentenced. The State policy aims to place prisoners near their families, start projects within 180 days of receiving a grant, and consider prisoner applications in sequence, giving notice at least 10 days before review. The State policy requires giving written notice to the guardian of a prisoner's child for review of the application, with a presumption that it's best for the child to live with the prisoner if approved. The State will accept comments on the application and must approve or disapprove it within 40 days of giving notice. The Institute will award grants based on competitive criteria and a preference for certain applicants. Grants will be given to 5 eligible States across the US each fiscal year. To be eligible for a grant under section 201(a), a State must submit an application to the Institute with required information. Each State receiving a grant must submit a report to the Institute on the family unity demonstration project. The report should include the number of prisoners participating, those returning to prison, details of educational activities, and the overall scope of the project. The State receiving a grant must report on the family unity demonstration project, including the number of participants, details of educational activities, and contracts with community-based organizations. TITLE III--FAMILY UNITY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR FEDERAL PRISONERS\n\nThe Attorney General has the authority to carry out a family unity demonstration project for federal prisoners, allowing eligible prisoners to live in community correctional facilities with their children. The Attorney General must comply with specific requirements, consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and submit a report to the National Institute of Corrections for the family unity demonstration project for federal prisoners."
