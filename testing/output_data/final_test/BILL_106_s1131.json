    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999\". It includes findings related to Fragile X research. The findings of Congress highlight the prevalence and impact of Fragile X, the need for lifelong care costing over $2 million per child, the lack of funding for research despite its potential for a cure, and the importance of research for related disorders. Fragile X is a valuable research model for X-linked mental retardation, neuropsychiatric disorders like autism, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and pervasive developmental disorder. Individuals with Fragile X provide a homogeneous study population for understanding these disorders. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is conducting research on Fragile X, a valuable model for understanding X-linked mental retardation and neuropsychiatric disorders like autism and schizophrenia. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is expanding and coordinating research activities on Fragile X. The Director of the Institute will establish research centers to improve diagnosis, treatment, and find a cure for Fragile X, with a minimum of three centers to be established. The establishment of at least 3 Fragile X research centers is mandated to conduct basic and clinical research, including clinical trials for diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and finding a cure. Centers may use funds to provide fees for individuals participating in clinical trials. The Director of the Institute coordinates activities among centers assisted under this section, ensuring information exchange. Each center must use facilities of a single institution or consortium. Support can be provided for up to 5 years, extendable for additional periods. The Director coordinates activities among centers assisted under this section, ensuring information exchange. Each center must use facilities of a single institution or consortium. Support can be provided for up to 5 years, extendable for additional periods with authorization of appropriations. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is amending the Public Health Service Act to include a loan repayment program for research on Fragile X. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, will establish a program for qualified health professionals to conduct Fragile X research in exchange for loan repayment of up to $35,000 per year. The program will follow provisions of the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program. Authorization of Appropriations: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and necessary sums for subsequent years are authorized for the Fragile X research program. Amounts appropriated shall remain available for two fiscal years."
