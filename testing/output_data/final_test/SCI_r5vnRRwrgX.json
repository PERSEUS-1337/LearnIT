    "content": "We introduce QCue, a novel workflow for enhancing mind-mapping by providing computer-generated cues to explore breadth and user-elicited queries to explore depth. A two-phase study validated the effectiveness of QCue compared to traditional digital mind-mapping workflows. The study compares QCue with a digital mind-mapping workflow without computer intervention. Mind-maps visually represent one's mental model around a central idea, promoting associative thinking for exploring breadth and depth. The integration of diverse knowledge elements into a coherent pattern enables critical thinking and learning through making synaptic connections and divergent exploration. Mind-maps are uniquely suitable for problem understanding/exploration prior to design conceptualization, helping designers develop new perspectives and driving the search for solutions within the iterative process. Effective exploration in computer-facilitated tasks requires a balance between logical, analytical thinking and lateral, systems-level thinking. This balance is crucial for addressing the conflict between breadth and depth of exploration, especially for first-time users. Quick thinking is linked to imagination and creating associations between information chunks, which takes time to develop. The act of responding to questions during exploration tasks stimulates reflection and expands designers' field of view. Asking questions in sketching activities keeps participants engaged and leads to reflecting on ambiguities. Exposing designers to text can enhance originality in idea generation. This approach is influenced by the concept of reflection in design, taking a Socratic approach to reasoning about design problems. The text discusses a Socratic approach to reasoning about design problems through question-based verbalization in a digital setting. It introduces a workflow for mind-mapping that involves query expansion, exploring related concepts, and answering questions posed by the tool itself. This approach is powered by ConceptNet, a semantic database. The text introduces a novel workflow called QCue, utilizing ConceptNet for cognitive stimulation in mind-mapping. It includes an adaptive algorithm for balancing breadth-depth in tasks and generating cues for user response based on mind-map evolution. The text introduces QCue, a workflow using ConceptNet for cognitive stimulation in mind-mapping. It includes an adaptive algorithm for generating cues based on mind-map evolution and conducting a user study to compare with traditional mind-mapping methods. The text discusses various techniques like brainstorming, SCAMPER, C-Sketch, and mind-mapping for promoting creative solutions. Mind-mapping is highlighted as a flexible technique useful for problem exploration, reflection, communication, and synthesis during idea generation. The curr_chunk discusses the use of digital workflows, pictorial stimuli, heuristic-based feedback generation, textual-mining, and speech-based interfaces to facilitate critical thinking and learning. Some works also utilize gamification to engage users in idea generation. In engineering design, computer systems support creativity during the conceptual stage, but are often domain-specific. There is ongoing exploration into automatic generation of mind-maps from speech and texts. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impact of computer support on creating mind-maps, comparing pen-and-paper and digital methods. Works by Kerne's group focus on curation and web-semantics for information-based ideation. Chen et al. studied collaboration in mind-mapping and how mind-maps evolve during collaboration. The curr_chunk provides insight on using intelligent systems to augment cognitive capabilities in free-form mind-mapping. It discusses the concept of cooperative contextual bandits (CCB) for providing cognitive support during design tasks. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of associative thinking in mind-mapping and highlights the limitations of current digital tools in supporting cognitive assistance and idea generation. Despite advancements in mind-mapping tools, creators still face challenges such as recalling concepts, dealing with ambiguity, and building relationships between concepts. The curr_chunk discusses investigating computational mechanisms to address difficulties in idea exploration in mind-mapping. It focuses on the effect of query expansion using ConceptNet to improve information retrieval and user reactions to suggestions during mind-mapping. The interface implemented records the usage of suggestions from ConceptNet, enabling query expansion for leveraging related concepts. ConceptNet, like WordNet, allows for leveraging related concepts through diverse relations for broader query scope. A web-based tool called query-expansion mind-mapping (QEM) was developed using ConceptNet, where users can create maps by adding nodes and linking them. The tool suggests the top 50 query results for new words or phrases, aiming to enhance mind-map creation compared to traditional pen-paper methods. Tasks were designed to compare user performance, preference, and completion time between pen-paper mind-mapping and QEMs, exploring how query-based search affects idea spanning in mind-map creation. Participants were asked to create two mind-maps for problem statements on pollution solutions and future human transportation. 18 engineering students aged 18-32 were recruited, with 6 familiar with mind-maps. The topics were chosen to be familiar yet encourage new ideas. Participants aged 18-32, with 6 familiar with mind-maps, created mind-maps using QEM. The experiment took 30-35 minutes, with a 10-minute limit per problem statement. Participants rated ease of use, intuitiveness, and effectiveness. No consensus on satisfaction with pen-paper mind-mapping. Participants in the study used QEM for mind-mapping and reported high satisfaction with the results. They suggested adding features like randomizing word searches, querying multiple phrases, and searching for images. However, users showed over-dependency on query-expansion, which had limitations such as needing to query new ideas. The study participants used QEM for mind-mapping and were satisfied with the results. However, they relied heavily on search and query functions, leading to a break in their flow of thought and inhibiting diversity in ideas. Users spent a lot of time searching for keywords instead of adding new ideas to the map, resulting in increased time taken to create maps. This over-reliance on search was reported by users, who expressed spending more time finding terms in search results rather than brainstorming. The design goal of QCue is to balance idea generation and search functionality. The design goal of QCue is to strike a balance between idea expansion workflow and cognitive support during digital mind-mapping. It aims to provide computer support that stimulates new directions of thinking without intruding on the user's own line of thought. The algorithm in QCue generates computer support based on the evolution of the user-generated map structure to balance exploration breadth and depth. QCue is designed to support divergent idea exploration in ideation processes with a simple and fast interface for natural interactions. The process of mind-mapping in QCue is seen as an iterative two-mode sequence: generating many ideas on a topic for breadth-first exploration, and refining a smaller subset for depth-first exploration. The design of QCue aims to balance idea expansion workflow and cognitive support during digital mind-mapping. It involves asking users questions to externalize assumptions and stimulate indirect relationships in the initial phases. For exploring ideas in depth, suggesting alternatives helps maintain idea addition rates. Users can create a mind-map using direct user input by double-clicking on existing nodes to add content for child nodes. The QCue feature in the editor workspace allows users to easily create a tree structure by automatically linking nodes. Users can query ConceptNet for related concepts, add them to the map, and respond to cues generated by QCue for further exploration. The QCue feature in the editor workspace allows users to easily create a tree structure by automatically linking nodes. Users can query ConceptNet for related concepts, add them to the map, and respond to cues generated by QCue for further exploration. The interface allows users to answer, ignore, or delete cues, with sliders to adjust exploratory directions. Cue generation is based on where and when to add cues, drawing from recent work by Chen et al. [13]. The algorithm for cue generation, inspired by Chen et al.'s work, utilizes the temporal and topological evolution of a mind-map to target nodes. Unlike Chen et al.'s sequential game model, our approach allows for asynchronous collaboration between humans and AI. The cue generation algorithm uses weighted relations from ConceptNet Open Data API to select potential nodes and generate cues at regular intervals. The algorithm for cue generation utilizes the topological and temporal evolution of a mind-map to target nodes for user exploration. It is designed to use penalty terms based on time elapsed and topological position, inspired by Chen et al. and Tesni\u00e8re et al.'s ideas on building connections for expressing continuous thoughts. The strategy for generating cue content involves utilizing semantic relationship types from ConceptNet to assist users in thinking broadly and maintaining a continuous flow of thoughts during the creation process. The approach developed considers 25 relationship categories and weighted assertions from ConceptNet, excluding ambiguous relations. The algorithm includes a time penalty measure for node inactivity, with a default threshold adjustable by users. Users can explore ideas using breadth-first exploration on the QCue interface. The QCue interface allows users to explore ideas through breadth-first exploration. A time penalty is applied to inactive nodes, with a customizable threshold. Lineage penalty measures the depth of nodes in a mind-map, with weights normalized and subtracted to range from 0 to 1. This feature supports exploration towards various nodes. QCue's support aids exploration towards leaf nodes by generating cues in the form of questions using ConceptNet semantic network. The algorithm involves scouting for potential nodes based on time and lineage penalties, querying ConceptNet for weighted relations, and generating cue nodes to guide users during mind-map creation. QCue identifies potential nodes for exploration based on time and lineage penalties. It queries ConceptNet for weighted relations to determine content and generates cue nodes to guide users in creating mind-maps. QCue formulates new cues based on fixed templates to avoid repetition during mind-map creation. The interface is a Javascript web application using NodeJS and D3JS, incorporating the JSON-LD API from ConceptNet. ConceptNet nodes contain words and phrases with relation information stored in edge lists. The QCue interface allows users to organize ideas in a mind-map by dragging them around the workspace. Users can adjust sliders to shape their exploration preferences. A listener function runs the cue generation algorithm at fixed intervals. Data is stored locally in a folder for each mind-map. The QCue interface enables users to create mind-maps by organizing ideas with cues and queries. Data is stored locally with a unique user ID, using a JavaScript prototype for structure. Videos of mind-maps are saved for further analysis. Pilot studies determined default values for time penalty and thresholds. A study with 12 participants observed user reactions to the cue-query workflow and generated problem statements. Participants in the study reacted to the cue-query workflow and determined evaluation tasks. Four different problem statements were designed, including pollution, toys in the future, camping underwater, and wedding on a space station. Users explored the ideas, causes, effects, and solutions of these statements. They needed time to prepare for topics like weddings on a space station and underwater camping, while showing immediate interest in pollution and toys. The study aimed to test the algorithm's robustness with different topics. In a user study, 24 students from various backgrounds created mind-maps for two topics: pollution and underwater camping. Participants were aged 19-30, with some having prior mind-map experience. The study compared the use of TMM and QCue, with each group creating mind-maps for a central topic. The experiment lasted 30-40 minutes, with topics randomized for participants. Participants in the user study were assigned different interfaces for mind-mapping tasks. They practiced using the interface for 5-10 minutes before creating mind-maps for two central topics. Each task was recorded with completion time and user-generated ideas. The user study involved participants using different interfaces for mind-mapping tasks. They created mind-maps for two central topics and answered questions about their exploration and perception of the interfaces. Metrics assessed the quantity, quality, novelty, and variety of ideas generated in each mind-map. The study evaluated the quality of mind-maps using metrics like structure, exploratory, communication, and extent of coverage. These metrics are commonly used to assess ideation success in design tasks and have connections to creativity support index and ideational fluency. The quality of mind-maps was evaluated using metrics like structure, exploratory, communication, and extent of coverage by two raters who were senior designers in mechanical engineering. They assessed 48 mind-maps on a scale of 1-4 for each criteria, with each mind-map assigned a score out of 16 points for comparison. In a study evaluating mind-maps, two raters independently rated every idea/concept. The ratings were checked for consensus, with Cohen's kappa used for integer metrics and Pearson's correlation for real values. Cohen's kappa showed moderate inter-rater agreement. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the correlation between raters' ratings, showing a value close to 0.8, indicating good agreement. Ratings for QCue were higher than TMM across all metrics. Two-way ANOVA was conducted, revealing higher mean ratings for structure and exploratory metrics for QCue compared to TMM. This suggests that mind-maps created using QCue were more balanced in depth and breadth. The study found that mind-maps created with QCue were more balanced and explored a wider variety of aspects compared to TMM. QCue also had a higher number of nodes added, indicating better exploration of diverse ideas and relationships. Main effect analysis showed significant differences in structure and exploratory metrics between pollution and underwater camping in QCue. This suggests that the effectiveness of QCue depends on the central topic being explored. The study compared mind-maps created with QCue and TMM, finding that QCue had higher ratings for pollution exploration. Node addition rate was steady in QCue, with users asking queries early on and using cue nodes later. Users appreciated cues between 5-6 minutes for pollution exploration. Users appreciated cues between the 5 and 6 minutes mark for pollution exploration and in the 2 to 7 minutes mark for underwater camping. Cues helped users reflect on existing concepts and generate new ideas during mind-mapping. Additionally, cues assisted in exploring different directions of exploration around the central idea for open-ended problems like underwater camping. Interestingly, the number of nodes added from query mode was lower than cue mode, indicating higher user engagement with cue mode. The effectiveness of cues in mind-mapping was evaluated through a questionnaire filled out by participants. Around 60% agreed that cues helped develop new thoughts at the right time, while some felt they were not helpful as they already had ideas. Users who struggled to add to existing ideas in the mind-map found cues and queries helpful in visualizing new dimensions to the central idea. Over 80% of users agreed that queries were useful, with some suggesting more context-specific queries. Mixed responses were received regarding the effectiveness of cues in mind-mapping. Users tended to respond more to cues than queries in the mind-mapping process. The ease of answering cues and the clarity they provided led users to add nodes manually. Users using QCue showed more consistent node generation compared to TMM. The questions in cues helped users create new chains of thoughts, even if they didn't have direct answers. Users using QCue showed more consistent node generation compared to TMM. The questions in cues helped users create new chains of thoughts, even if they didn't have direct answers. One user with negligible experience in brainstorming shared her excitement about the creation process, expecting questions from different angles. QCue users kept generating new ideas even after the initial creation phase, indicating the capability of QCue in guiding novices to explore problem spaces. Including expert users in future studies can help understand their performance using the workflow and transfer expertise to the system for better facilitation. A key challenge faced was the lack of methodology for determining the effect of cue-based stimulus during mind-mapping. Conducting a qualitative study on the mind-mapping process is planned as the next step. Another challenge was the effective formulation of questions for cue generation. The study highlighted the need for further investigation into natural language processing methods and new databases for domain-specific cues in areas like engineering design. Users suggested context-dependent queries, especially for complex tasks like underwater camping, which may require advancements in artificial intelligence for generating suggestions based on real-time synthesis of information. Preliminary exploration using a markov chain question generation method showed potential, but further studies are needed for more effective cue generation. Further studies are needed to improve the generation of cues for stimulating user ideas, with potential enhancements in textual and graphical representations. Textual stimuli can be generated through unsolicited suggestions or advanced contextual interpretation, while visual content databases like ShapeNet and ImageNet offer new ways to provide stimuli. Investigating colors, images, arrows, and dimensions tailored to individual interests is crucial for cognitive stimulation. Our research introduced a new digital workflow called QCue, which provides cues to users based on their mind-map and allows them to query suggestions. The experiments showed the potential of this mechanism in stimulating idea exploration, emphasizing the balance between computer-generated cues and user queries. Computer-facilitated textual stimuli were found to be beneficial, especially for those with little experience in brainstorming tasks. QCue is seen as a step towards further research on intelligent cognitive assistants."
