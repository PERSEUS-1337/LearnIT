It is defined as any meeting of Congress between a congressional election in November and January 3. A lame duck session occurs after Election Day and before the new Congress convenes in January. Participants are the sitting Members of the existing Congress, not those who will be entitled to sit in the new Congress. Factors contributing to lame duck sessions include dealing with unfinished business or urgent matters. Legislative proposals, especially those with significant budgetary implications, may be postponed until a lame duck session. For example, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted during a lame duck session on January 2, 2013. Lame duck sessions have been used for various purposes, such as closing action on regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year. Lame duck sessions occur after Election Day and before the new Congress convenes in January. They have been used for various purposes, including finalizing authorization measures and impeachment proceedings. Between 1935 and 2016, there were 21 lame duck sessions, with an increase in frequency in recent years. Between 1994 and 2016, there were several instances of unified or divided control of the federal government. Lame duck sessions occurred in both presidential and non-presidential election years, providing Congress with opportunities to address regular appropriations. A total of 136 regular appropriations acts and 61 continuing appropriations measures were enacted during lame duck sessions in this period. During the period of 1994-2016, there were 136 regular appropriations acts and 61 continuing appropriations measures enacted during lame duck sessions. The variation in the enactment of regular appropriations bills before, during, or after these sessions is shown in Table 2. During the 109th Congress, the number of regular appropriations acts was reduced from 13 to 11. In the 110th Congress, the number increased to 12 due to reorganization. Out of 136 regular appropriations acts from 1994-2016, 46 were enacted before lame duck sessions, 25 during, and 65 afterward. Lame duck sessions in 1994, 1998, 2008, and 2012 did not anticipate appropriations acts. In 1998, one FY1999 regular appropriations bill was enacted before the fiscal year began, with the remaining bills passed by October 21. In 2008, work on 3 out of 12 regular appropriations acts for FY2009 was completed before September, with a CR providing funding for the remaining 9 acts until early March of the following year. In 2012, a CR was enacted before the fiscal year, providing funding until March 27, 2013. Annual appropriations for FY2013 were later enacted after the beginning of the 113th Congress on March 26, 2013. In 2013, a consolidated measure containing 11 regular appropriations acts was enacted during a lame duck session, with the remaining DHS bill passed in March 2015. Different patterns were seen in other lame duck sessions in 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2016, where action on all regular appropriations acts was not completed. In 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2016, regular appropriations acts were not completed until after the session. In 2002 and 2006, some bills were enacted before the lame duck session, but final action on the remaining acts was not completed until the following session. In 2010, no regular appropriations bills were enacted before the lame duck session, and funding was provided in a consolidated measure enacted in April 2011. Continuing appropriations legislation has been a key part of the annual appropriations process for decades. In FY2017, most appropriations bills were funded through a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) during the lame duck session, with the remaining bills consolidated into an omnibus measure enacted in May 2017. Continuing resolutions (CRs) are used to provide stop-gap funding when regular appropriations bills are not completed before the start of the fiscal year. They can have short durations to allow time for negotiations or longer durations to delay decisions until after elections or the next congressional session. In some cases, CRs may provide funding for the entire fiscal year. During lame duck sessions, CRs have been used for stop-gap funding in various fiscal years. A total of 61 CRs were enacted during these sessions, with some before, during, and after the session. In certain years, regular appropriations bills were completed before the fiscal year, eliminating the need for CRs. During lame duck sessions, CRs have been used for stop-gap funding in various fiscal years. In 2008, a CR extended funding for remaining appropriations acts through March 6, 2009, completing action on annual appropriations. A long-term CR for FY2013 eliminated the need for stop-gap appropriations during the 2012 lame duck session. In contrast, other lame duck sessions involved the enactment of multiple CRs for different fiscal years. During lame duck sessions, CRs were used for stop-gap funding in various fiscal years. In 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2016, CRs were needed to provide funding both during and after the sessions. Multiple CRs were enacted during the lame duck sessions in these years to extend stop-gap funding until regular appropriations acts were enacted. During the lame duck session, multiple CRs were enacted for stop-gap funding. In 2010, three CRs were passed, and in 2014, 11 appropriations acts for FY2015 were consolidated. Additionally, two CRs were enacted for DHS funding until February 27, 2015. During the lame duck session, multiple CRs were enacted for stop-gap funding, extending through March 6. The purpose was to complete the remaining DHS regular appropriations act for FY2017. In 1994, a lame duck session was held from November 29 to December 1, where all 13 regular appropriations acts for FY1995 were enacted. In 1998, a lame duck session was held on December 17-19 where all 13 regular appropriations acts for FY1999 were enacted. Six CRs were enacted for stop-gap funding through October 21. In 2000, a lame duck session was held from November 13 to December 15. In 2000, a lame duck session was held from November 13 to December 15. Eight of the 13 regular appropriations acts for FY2001 were enacted prior to the lame duck session, with the remaining five acts considered and enacted during the session. An omnibus measure, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001, covered three regular appropriations acts. During the lame duck session in 2002, no regular appropriations acts were considered. Two regular appropriations acts for FY2003 were enacted before the session began, while the remaining acts were combined into the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 in the next Congress. During the lame duck session in 2002, the CR for the fiscal year was enacted (P.L. 107-294; November 23, 2002). In the following Congress, three more CRs were enacted. The lame duck session for 2004 saw four regular appropriations acts for FY2005 enacted separately before the session began. The remaining nine acts were passed during the lame duck session as part of an omnibus measure (P.L. 108-447; December 8, 2004). Two further CRs for FY2005 were also enacted during the lame duck session. The lame duck session for 2006 lasted from November 13 to December 9. Two appropriations acts for FY2007 were enacted before the session began, with the remaining nine acts extended through November 17. Only one act, H.R. 5385, was considered during the lame duck session, which was passed by the Senate on November 14. The nine regular appropriations acts were completed via a full-year CR (H.J.Res. 20) signed into law. During the lame duck session for 2006, two appropriations acts for FY2007 were enacted before the session began. The remaining nine acts were extended through November 17. A full-year CR (H.J.Res. 20) was signed into law to complete the appropriations acts. In the lame duck session for 2007, a second CR for FY2007 was enacted to provide appropriations through December 8. A third CR extended appropriations through February 15, 2007. The lame duck session for 2008 did not consider any regular appropriations acts. Three regular appropriations acts for FY2009 were enacted before the session. During the 2008 lame duck session, no action was taken on appropriations. The remaining appropriations acts were consolidated into the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, signed on March 11, 2009. In the 2010 lame duck session, no regular appropriations acts were considered, and a CR was enacted to extend budget authority. None of the regular appropriations bills were enacted during this session. During the 2010 lame duck session, funding for FY2011 was extended through multiple continuing resolutions (CRs) until the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 was enacted on April 15, 2011. The 2012 lame duck session did not see any regular appropriations acts or CRs being enacted. During the 2012 lame duck session, no regular appropriations acts or CRs were enacted. Continuing appropriations were provided through March 27, 2013, by P.L. 112-175. Annual appropriations were later provided by P.L. 113-6 on March 26, 2013. The lame duck session for 2014 also did not see any regular appropriations bills being enacted. During the 2014 lame duck session, multiple CRs were enacted to provide temporary funding for various government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, until regular appropriations bills could be passed. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for FY2015 (P.L. 114-4) was enacted on March 4, 2015. In the 2016 lame duck session, multiple CRs were enacted to provide temporary funding for government agencies. This included a CR in December 2016 (P.L. 114-254) and another in April 2017 (P.L. 115-30). An omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 115-3) encompassed the remaining 11 appropriations bills for FY2017 on May 5."
