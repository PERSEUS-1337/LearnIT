    "content": "The Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region is China's northwesternmost territory, bordering Afghanistan, Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and India. Uighurs are the dominant ethnic group at 47% of the population, with Han Chinese making up nearly 92%. The region also has smaller populations of other ethnic groups. China established military presence in Xinjiang in the 18th century, naming it \"new territory.\" In the 19th century, Britain supported Chinese sovereignty over Xinjiang to counter Russian influence. Revolts in the 1860s and 1870s led to the declaration of an independent state. Parts of Xinjiang were briefly held by Russia before returning to Chinese control in the early 1880s. Control of Xinjiang fluctuated in the early 20th century, with Chinese warlords acknowledging Chinese sovereignty but maintaining local control. In the 1930s and 1940s, local non-Chinese residents established independent republics in Xinjiang. In 1949, the People's Liberation Army annexed Xinjiang to China. Xinjiang became an autonomous region for ethnic minorities in 1955. Recent years have seen increased ethnic activities in Xinjiang, including cultural and religious practices, expressions of discontent with the government, and efforts to establish an independent state. The region has also experienced terrorist attacks by XUAR extremists. Beijing accuses Uighur activists of receiving training from the Taliban in Afghanistan and labels them as separatists. The Chinese government has increased security measures in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in response to perceived threats. International organizations report human rights violations in the region, alleging unjust targeting of Uighur residents. Monitoring ethnic activities in the XUAR is complicated by conflicting descriptions of the region. Uighur sources and international organizations point to human rights violations and unequal treatment as causes of protest and turmoil in the region. The Human Rights Watch notes that Communist Party officials, mainly ethnic Chinese, dominate local politics in the XUAR. Chinese immigration and restrictions on religious activities have led to protests and nationalist movements in the region since 1949. Activities with nationalist overtones have become more visible within the XUAR since the 1980s, especially since the early 1990s when Central Asian republics declared independence from the Soviet Union. The Turkey-based East Turkistan Information Center supports Uighur nationalist aims internationally. Ties may exist between Uighur separatist groups and Islamic fundamentalist organizations. The PRC government has identified internal separatist threats in the XUAR, but the extent and immediate threat of these movements are unclear. Beijing emphasizes equal protection for minority groups under the law, stating that all ethnic groups in China are equal and discrimination is prohibited. The PRC government responds to separatist incidents in the XUAR with heavy policing, arrests, and alleged torture of minority prisoners. A classified transcript highlights concerns with national separatism and illegal religious activity in Xinjiang, attributing support for separatist movements to counterrevolutionary organizations led by the United States. The United States is supporting separatist movements in Xinjiang. China signed a military treaty with Russia and neighboring Muslim states to combat cross-border crime and extremism. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was formed to combat cross-border crime, separatism, and extremism. China, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan pledged mutual cooperation in fighting terrorism and extremism. Human rights violations are reported in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), leading to protests fueled by dissatisfaction with the government. In 1996, the PRC launched a campaign against crime in the XUAR, targeting illegal ethnic and religious activities. Amnesty International reported human rights abuses including arbitrary arrests, unfair trials, and executions. Prominent Uighur businesswoman Rebiya Kadeer was arrested in August 1999 for allegedly providing information to foreigners. In November 1999, Rebiya Kadeer's son was sentenced to two years in a labor camp for aiding separatists. Kadeer herself was sentenced to 8 years in March 2000 for providing state secrets. Xinjiang has abundant resources but lags behind in economic output. It ranks second in China for border trade and has 699 enterprises funded by foreign sources. The Chinese government has launched a \"Go West\" campaign to focus on economic development in central and western China, with plans to improve infrastructure in Xinjiang. A 4,212-kilometer pipeline is set to be built from the XUAR to Shanghai, and a branch of the China Development Bank will open in Urumqi. There are concerns that these projects may increase ethnic tensions by bringing more ethnic Chinese into the region. Chinese migration and economic disparities in the XUAR fuel discontent among minority groups. Critics argue that development projects benefit Chinese over ethnic minorities. Foreign-funded projects, like the World Bank's Qinghai Resettlement Project, are controversial. The situation in the XUAR has implications for U.S. policymakers balancing human rights concerns with economic cooperation with China. The U.S. Department of State's 2000 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom highlighted China's crackdown on Muslim religious activity, particularly among the Uighur nationality in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The report mentioned ongoing violent incidents and bombings attributed to Uighur activists. The potential for Sino-U.S. cooperation against global terrorism post-9/11 may lead to changes in U.S. officials' policy calculations, despite uncertainties about the level of support the PRC will provide. The PRC prefers global anti-terrorism efforts through the U.N. Security Council, may link support to policy concessions, and aims to avoid appearing too \"pro-American.\" This could complicate U.S. policies. The PRC's preference for global anti-terrorism efforts through the U.N. Security Council could complicate U.S. policies towards Taiwan and the Dalai Lama's Tibetan community-in-exile."
