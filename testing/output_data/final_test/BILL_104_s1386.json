    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Metrification Amendments of 1995\" is cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the policy to convert to the metric system as per the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. Federal agencies are required to use the metric system in their activities, except when impractical. Federal construction contracting officers are mandating some industries to implement a hard-metric conversion. The implementation of hard-metric conversion incurs substantial costs and production changes, which may be impractical or lead to inefficiencies. Federal agencies are mandating certain industries to use hard-metric conversion for rounded numbers, causing upheaval for some domestic industries. The hard-metric conversion could force small businesses out of federal contracts, disadvantage domestic producers, reduce competition, and increase manufacturing costs. The hard-metric conversion increases costs for manufacturers, leading to a metric premium paid by the Federal Government. Taxpayers oppose this extra cost during budget constraints. Soft-metric conversion is a less intrusive and cheaper alternative. Soft-metric conversion using metric units can be achieved without causing excessive economic upheaval for domestic industries and small businesses. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205c) is amended to define 'hard-metric product' as a material produced from a hard-metric conversion, 'hard-metric conversion' as a conversion requiring a physical size change, and 'industry' as defined by the Board. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is amended to define 'soft-metric product' as a material produced from a soft-metric conversion, which is based on metric system dimensions without changing physical size relative to existing production practices. 'Small business' is also defined by the Board. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is amended to define 'soft-metric product' as a material produced from a soft-metric conversion, which is based on metric system dimensions without changing physical size relative to existing production practices. 'Small business' is also defined by the Board. SEC. 4. METRIC CONVERSION. Section 12 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is amended to prohibit federal agencies from requiring the use of hard-metric conversions or products in construction projects if soft-metric alternatives are technologically feasible. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is amended to prevent federal agencies from mandating hard-metric conversions or products in construction projects if soft-metric options are feasible. Manufacturers can certify that hard-metric products are not readily available from 50% of domestic manufacturers or do not make up 50% of total production to avoid conversion requirements for small businesses. Manufacturers, especially small businesses, are not required to invest over $25,000 in new equipment for hard-metric product conversion in federally assisted construction contracts if the economic benefits are negligible. Manufacturers, especially small businesses, may be exempt from investing in costly equipment for hard-metric product conversion in federally assisted projects if it would reduce competition, increase costs for taxpayers, or disadvantage domestic manufacturers. Federal agencies must establish a list of industry representatives. The agency head must update the list of industry representatives annually, including professional or trade associations. When a recognized industry representative submits a certification, they must also provide a list of manufacturers committed to providing soft-metric products to ensure competitive pricing and availability."
