    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sage-Grouse Protection and Conservation Act\" and includes measures for the protection and conservation of the Greater Sage-Grouse. The section aims to allow states to manage sage-grouse species through state-created conservation plans and demonstrate their effectiveness in protecting and recovering the species. It also requires the Secretary to implement recommendations from state plans on federal land. The term \"State\" refers to specific states including California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. \"National Forest System land\" is defined as federal land within the National Forest System. \"Public land\" is defined as described in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"sage-grouse species\" includes the greater sage-grouse and the Gunnison sage-grouse. The term \"Statewide plan\" refers to a conservation and management plan developed by covered Western States for the protection and recovery of sage-grouse species and their habitat. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior are defined as the \"Secretary\" for National Forest System land and public land, respectively. The Secretary will provide a list of designees from the Department of the Interior or Agriculture to assist in developing and implementing the Statewide plan for sage-grouse conservation in covered Western States. The Statewide plan for sage-grouse conservation in covered Western States includes an invitation for the Secretary to participate and a statement of submission. The covered Western State must prepare a Statewide plan within 1 year to protect and manage sage-grouse species and their habitat to avoid being listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 may no longer be needed in the covered Western State. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 may no longer be needed in the covered Western State. Monitoring data on sage-grouse species population trends, habitat condition, fuel reduction, predator and invasive species control are collected to address primary threats to sage-grouse species. The covered Western State is addressing threats to sage-grouse species and ensuring objectives in the Statewide plan are being met. The (BB) must provide the Secretary with annual data on sage-grouse species health, habitat condition, and Statewide plan implementation activities. To participate in the planning process, a covered Western State must submit a notice to the Secretary within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will provide relevant scientific data and information on sage-grouse species and habitat to the State within 60 days of receiving the notice. The Secretary shall manage public land in accordance with a Statewide plan from a covered Western State for at least 6 years after its submission. The plan will be reviewed annually using the best available science and data. The Secretary will use the Statewide plan as the basis for decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act, assist in adaptive management as needed, and require the covered Western State to submit recommendations for plan improvement to the Governor. The covered Western State must submit annual reports to the Secretary on the Statewide plan's implementation, including data on actions taken, population trends, fuel reductions, predator control, and sage-grouse habitat condition. They are also required to monitor sage-grouse species and habitat data for at least 5 years and submit recommendations for plan improvement to the Governor. The covered Western State must submit a report to the Secretary, within 6 years of the Statewide plan submission, detailing progress in achieving plan objectives. This includes data on sage-grouse population trends, habitat condition, fuel reductions, predator control, and other key threats to sage-grouse. The covered Western State must submit a report to the Secretary within 6 years of the Statewide plan submission, detailing progress in achieving plan objectives, including data on sage-grouse population trends, habitat condition, fuel reductions, predator control, and other key threats to sage-grouse. The Secretary will assist the state in monitoring and collecting relevant data on Federal land to assess sage-grouse species population trends, habitat condition, fuel reductions, predator control, invasive species control, and other parameters addressing primary threats to sage-grouse. The Secretary will take steps to maintain or restore sage-grouse species status under the Endangered Species Act for at least 6 years to monitor the Statewide plan's objectives. Land use planning activities related to Federal management of sage-grouse on public land will be paused. The Federal government will manage sage-grouse species on public and National Forest System land in Western States to comply with Statewide plans and conservation acts. The Secretary will reverse any land use restrictions not consistent with Statewide plans for sage-grouse protection, and use State annual reports for the Endangered Species Act review. The Secretary must also give effect to State conservation plans for sage-grouse in covered Western States. Actions proposed in covered Western States under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 cannot be denied based solely on sage-grouse presence if consistent with the Statewide plan. The Secretary has the authority to extend the provisions of the Act upon review of State reports. The Secretary can extend the Act for up to 6 years with the covered Western State's consent. The Secretary of the Interior must fully implement an order to prevent and suppress rangeland fires and restore sagebrush landscapes for at least 6 years."
