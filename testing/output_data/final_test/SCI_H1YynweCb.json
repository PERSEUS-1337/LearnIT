    "content": "Our work introduces Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU), a novel recurrent neural network model that addresses issues of over-parameterization and ill-conditioning in RNNs. KRU achieves parameter efficiency by using a Kronecker factored recurrent matrix and enforcing soft unitary constraints on the factors. Experimental results demonstrate that KRU can significantly reduce the number of parameters in the recurrent weight matrix without sacrificing statistical performance. Deep neural networks have been leading in various fields like computer vision, speech analysis, and natural language processing. However, they face challenges such as being over-parametrized and having poor conditioning of matrices, especially in recurrent neural networks. The introduction of Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU) addresses these issues by efficiently reducing the number of parameters in the recurrent weight matrix without compromising performance. The poor conditioning of recurrent matrices in RNNs leads to exploding or vanishing gradients, hindering long-term dependency capture. Various techniques have been proposed to address over-parametrization in neural networks, including weight removal, low-rank decomposition, training on soft-targets, low bit precision training, hashing, and structured linear operators like Fastfood transform. These methods are mainly focused on feed-forward fully connected networks. The problem of vanishing and exploding gradients in recurrent networks has been addressed through techniques like gating mechanisms in LSTMs, GRUs, and Highway networks. Other strategies include gradient clipping, orthogonal initialization of weights, and unitary recurrent weight matrices to prevent gradient issues and capture long-term dependencies efficiently. Unitary RNNs like RC uRNN and FC uRNN have limitations in exploring unitary matrices efficiently. FC uRNN sacrifices computational efficiency by using full dimensional unitary matrices, requiring an expensive projection step. oRNN addresses this by using Householder reflection vectors for parametrizing orthogonal matrices, allowing control over the number of parameters. The Efficient Unitary RNN (EURNN) parametrizes unitary matrices for fine-grained control over the number of parameters. However, strict unitary constraints in recurrent weight matrices limit the search space and make forgetting irrelevant information difficult. The Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU) model addresses the limitations of existing recurrent networks by using a Kronecker factored recurrent matrix, which improves convergence speed and generalization performance. This approach aims to overcome the issues of strict unitary constraints in recurrent weight matrices, which make it challenging to forget irrelevant information. The Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU) model utilizes Kronecker factored recurrent matrices to adjust the number of parameters efficiently. This factorization helps modulate the number of parameters needed to encode matrices, addressing the vanishing and exploding gradient problem through a soft unitary constraint. KRU can be integrated into various recurrent networks like RNNs and LSTMs, with the latter not requiring explicit orthogonality constraints due to its gating mechanism. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KRU. The paper introduces Kronecker recurrent units (KRU) as a parameter-efficient and robust solution to the vanishing and exploding gradient problem in recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that KRU variants of RNN and LSTM can significantly reduce the number of parameters without sacrificing performance. The paper is structured with a focus on the formalism of RNN, the motivation for KRU, experimental findings, and conclusion. In the paper, the focus is on the formalism of RNN and the motivation for using complex numbers instead of real numbers. The total number of parameters in a RNN grows quadratically with the hidden dimension, leading to over parametrization for many real-world problems. This quadratic growth impacts the computational efficiency of RNNs. The focus is on the formalism of RNN and the motivation for using complex numbers. The number of parameters in RNN grows quadratically with the hidden dimension, impacting computational efficiency. Efficient computation of components Ux t and Vh t can be done using modern BLAS libraries. Controlling the number of parameters in the recurrent matrix W can control computational efficiency. The vanishing and exploding gradient problem occurs as the number of time steps grows, and controlling the spectrum of W can prevent this issue. Complex-valued recurrent networks provide a solution to the issue of not being able to span the full unitary set in real space due to its disconnected nature. In contrast, the unitary set is connected in complex space, allowing for continuous optimization procedures. BID25 utilizes a tunable continuous parametrization from subspace to full unitary space, addressing the issue of not being able to span the full unitary set in real space. Parameterizing the recurrent matrix W as a Kronecker product of F matrices allows for spanning different representations, with varying number of parameters and time complexity for hidden state computation. The use of Kronecker factorization in recurrent neural networks allows for fine-grained control over parameters and computational efficiency, providing a balance between computational budget and statistical performance. This approach has gained attention for approximating Fisher matrix in natural gradient methods, with applications in convolutional layers, distributed optimization, and deep reinforcement learning. Kronecker matrices as learnable parameters have not been extensively explored. The Kronecker factorization in recurrent neural networks allows for control over parameters and computational efficiency. It has applications in natural gradient methods, convolutional layers, distributed optimization, and deep reinforcement learning. Kronecker matrices as learnable parameters have not been extensively explored. The spectral property of BID45 and BID46 is used for fast orthogonal projection and as a layer in convolutional neural networks. Poor conditioning leads to vanishing or exploding gradients. Enforcing strict unitary constraint can retain noise over time, so an approximate unitary constraint regularization is suggested for better performance. The Kronecker factored recurrent matrix is computationally efficient with small factors. Soft unitary constraints are applied as a regularizer to improve robustness and learning speed. Enforcing approximate orthogonality on weight matrices enhances network robustness and generalization performance in metric learning. The soft unitary constraints were applied to RNN models BID20 and BID41 to address issues with strict unitary RNN models. Custom CUDA kernels were developed for Kronecker operations due to the computational complexity. Different activation functions were used for various models, with plans to release a library for reproducing results. The model's ability to recall a sequence after a long time gap is tested in memory problem BID23. Sequences consist of elements from 10 classes, with the goal being to output a sequence followed by the original input sequence. KRU converges faster than FC uRNN for T = 1000 and T = 2000 settings. For T = 2000, KRU converges faster than FC uRNN in memory problem BID23. The recurrent matrix of KRU is initialized randomly as a unitary matrix, solving the problem faster than other methods. The model is similar to parametrized echo state networks (ESN) and argues that the dataset is not ideal for evaluating RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies. Just a unitary initialization of the recurrent matrix would solve the problem. The network aims to predict the sum of numbers from a sequence based on marked locations in another sequence. Different settings with varying sequence lengths are evaluated using different types of recurrent neural networks with specific parameters. Training and testing sets are defined, and models are trained using RMSprop with a specific learning rate. The effectiveness of different recurrent neural network models is evaluated for predicting the sum of numbers from a sequence. Results show that KRU converges faster with fewer parameters due to its soft unitary constraint. LSTM also converges well but has more parameters. RC uRNN and FC uRNN converge for T = 100 but exhibit unstable learning due to noise retention in strict unitary models. Results show that KRU consistently outperforms baselines on various settings for the Pixel by pixel MNIST task. The sequence length is T = 784, with 60K training points and 5K validation points. Models are trained using RMSprop, with the best validation accuracy chosen for test set evaluation. On the unpermuted task, LSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance despite slow convergence speed. A low-rank plus diagonal gated recurrent unit (LRD GRU) has shown to achieve 94.7% accuracy on permuted MNIST with 41.2K parameters, while KRU achieves 94.5% with just 12K parameters, making it 3 times less than LRD GRU. KRU is a simple model without a gating mechanism but can be easily integrated into LSTM and GRU for additional benefits. Next, experiments will be conducted with a KRU-LSTM. Character-level language modeling on Penn TreeBank dataset BID32 is considered, which consists of 5017K characters in the training set, 393K characters in the validation set, and 442K characters. The dataset consists of 5017K characters in the training set, 393K characters in the validation set, and 442K characters in the test set. The vocabulary is limited to 10K most frequent words, with the rest replaced by a special <UNK> character. Models were trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 50 using ADAM. Learning rate is set at 1e\u22123 and decreased by 0.30 if no improvement in validation bits per character (BPC) is seen. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) is unrolled for 30 time frames. Two sets of experiments were conducted for fair evaluation and to observe performance evolution. The performance of different models with varying parameter settings was evaluated. The strict orthogonal model, oRNN, showed poor generalization compared to other models. Models like KRU and KRU-LSTM performed similarly to RNN and LSTM with fewer parameters in the recurrent matrix, reducing training and inference time. HyperNetworks achieved state-of-the-art performance with a high number of parameters. Recurrent Highway Networks (RHN) also showed promise for deep learning tasks. Recurrent Highway Networks (RHN) BID47 is a promising model for deep recurrent neural networks. Due to computational limitations, exploring meta-parameters for large models was not feasible in this study. The objective is to evaluate different recurrent neural networks fairly, with models like KRU and KRU-LSTM showing better generalization and less overfitting compared to baselines. Wall-clock running times are also presented. The study evaluates different methods for phoneme classification using the TIMIT dataset. Features extracted include MFCC and log energy per frame, with a frame size of 10ms and window size of 25ms. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) is used with varying time steps for each sequence. The models were trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 1 using ADAM. The best learning rate was found to be 1e\u22123 for all models. KRU and KRU-LSTM outperformed baseline models on the TIMIT dataset with fewer parameters in the recurrent weight matrix, reducing training and inference time. LSTM and KRU-LSTM converged within 5 epochs, while RNN and KRU took 20 epochs. Similar results were obtained by BID16 using RNN and LSTM. In this study, the authors experimented with soft unitary constraints on KRU using Polyphonic music modeling datasets. They varied the amplitude of the constraints and observed improvements in the conditioning of the recurrent matrix. The results were presented in Figure 6, showing the impact of increasing the amplitude on the recurrent matrix. The authors experimented with soft unitary constraints on KRU using Polyphonic music modeling datasets. By varying the amplitude, they observed improvements in the conditioning of the recurrent matrix. The validation performance improved with an amplitude of 1e \u2212 2 for JSB Chorales and 1e \u2212 1 for Piano-midi. However, for TIMIT phoneme recognition, the best validation error was achieved at 1e \u2212 5, with a drop in performance as the amplitude increased. Cross-validating the amplitude of soft unitary constraints helped address the issue of vanishing long-term influence. Strict unitary models like RC uRNN BID1, FC uRNN BID42, oRNN BID35, and EURNN BID25 struggled with noise retention from vanishing long-term influence, leading to poor generalization. The use of soft unitary constraints in RNNs offers a principled alternative to gradient clipping for training. Recent research has shown that gradient descent can converge to the global optimizer of linear recurrent neural networks when the spectral norm of the recurrent matrix is bounded by 1. This theoretical result suggests using regularizers like soft unitary constraints to control the spectral norm of the recurrent matrix. The new recurrent neural network model is based on a Kronecker factored recurrent matrix, chosen for its algebraic and spectral properties. Kronecker factorization allows for fine control over model capacity and enables the design of fast matrix multiplication algorithms. The spectral properties are used to enforce constraints like positive semi-definitivity and unitarity. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to classical methods, especially on both toy and real problems. The new recurrent neural network model utilizes a Kronecker factored recurrent matrix, allowing for superior performance with fewer parameters. This approach challenges traditional memory-capable architectures by emphasizing high dimensionality for encoding input and predicting values, while implementing the recurrent dynamics with a low-capacity model. The method is applicable to various machine learning models beyond RNNs and LSTMs, such as feed-forward networks and boosting weak learners.

It challenges traditional memory-capable architectures by emphasizing high dimensionality for encoding input and predicting values, while implementing recurrent dynamics with a low-capacity model. Future work involves exploring other machine learning models and dynamically increasing model capacity during training for a balance between computational efficiency and sample complexity. The gradient problem in the model is caused by the norm of the Jacobian matrix of the non-linear activation function and the hidden to hidden weight matrix. LSTM networks address the vanishing and exploding gradient problem by introducing gating mechanisms. These mechanisms include gates for deciding what information to keep, erase, add, and output from the cell state. Additionally, LSTM prepares candidates for information from the input gate to be added to the cell state. LSTM networks use gating mechanisms to address vanishing and exploding gradients. Parameters Wc, Uc, bc prepare candidate information from the input gate. At each time step, LSTM performs gating operations and updates the cell state. Unitary evolution RNN (uRNN) tackles gradient issues with a unitary recurrent matrix. The unitary evolution RNN (uRNN) uses diagonal matrices with parameters \u03b8 to operate efficiently. The orthogonal RNN (oRNN) utilizes Householder reflections to parametrize recurrent matrices, with a total of 7N parameters. The oRNN is parameter efficient and fast but lacks flexibility and may retain noise during optimization. The Kronecker product of matrices is used to reduce computational complexity in matrix operations. By exploiting the recursive definition of Kronecker matrices, the matrix product can be computed more efficiently. This method involves strided matrix multiplication based on the algebra of Kronecker matrices. The algorithm caches intermediate outputs to compute gradients during back-propagation, saving computation. It can be organized to not cache for memory efficiency during inference. The GPU implementation can parallelize most of the algorithm for dense and Kronecker factored matrix product computation. The GPU implementation of the algorithm exploits the fact that the Kronecker layer is parametrized by a Kronecker factored matrix. Algorithm 1 stores the factors {W0, ..., WF-1} and computes the output Y using input X. Algorithm 2 calculates the Gradient of the Kronecker factors and the Jacobian of the input matrix given the Jacobian of the output matrix."
