    "content": "The Act titled \"Revitalizing Older Communities Through Housing Improvements Act of 2004\" aims to improve utilization and success rates. The Act \"Revitalizing Older Communities Through Housing Improvements Act of 2004\" allows public housing agencies to set payment standards between 110 and 150 percent of fair market rent for certain dwelling units in specific market areas. The Act allows public housing agencies to set payment standards between 110 and 150 percent of fair market rent for specific dwelling units in certain market areas. If the agency has a voucher success rate of not more than 80 percent or has provided an extended search time of not less than 90 days to a significant number of voucher recipients, or if there are problems with concentration, the new payment standard can be established. The Act allows public housing agencies to set payment standards between 110 and 150 percent of fair market rent for specific dwelling units in certain market areas. A public housing agency may establish a payment standard of not more than 150 percent of the fair market rent as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability, without approval of the Secretary. A public housing agency can set a payment standard without Secretary approval if it includes reasons for the increase, how it meets requirements, and other steps in its annual plan submitted to the Secretary. The public housing agency is increasing the payment standard and implementing measures to improve voucher utilization, success rates, and concentration of voucher holders for fiscal year 2005. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will issue regulations to improve the housing choice voucher program, including expanding resources for rent surveys and setting fair market rentals to match actual rents. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will issue regulations to improve the housing choice voucher program, including quicker approval of exception payment standards based on census data showing average area rents at the desired level. SEC. 3 amends Section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to include a provision that failure to pay state or local real estate taxes, fines, or assessments for a dwelling unit under a housing assistance payment contract is a breach of contract. SEC. 4 establishes a commission to study public and Section 8 housing. A Commission to Revitalize Older Communities Through Housing Improvements is established with 9 members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, minority leader of the House, and majority leader of the Senate. The Commission to Revitalize Older Communities Through Housing Improvements consists of 9 members appointed by various leaders. The Commission elects a chairperson from its members, requires a majority for a quorum, fills vacancies in the same manner as the original appointment, prohibits additional pay for full-time officers, and covers travel expenses for members. The Commission to Revitalize Older Communities Through Housing Improvements covers travel expenses for its members, including per diem, and conducts a study on the effectiveness of the public housing community service requirement. The Commission is studying the effectiveness of the public housing community service requirement, including compliance levels and feasibility for recipients of rental housing voucher assistance under section 8(o) of the Act. The Commission is studying the feasibility of reducing poverty concentration by limiting the number of rental housing assistance vouchers that can be used in a single municipality or area under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The Commission is considering limiting rental housing assistance vouchers in a municipality to reduce poverty concentration. This limitation will be based on recipient percentage, portability requirements, and solutions to avoid voucher recipient concentration. The Commission will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development within 180 days after appointing members. The Commission has the power to hold hearings, take testimony, and adopt rules and regulations for its operations. The Commission has the authority to obtain official data from government agencies and public housing agencies as needed. The Administrator of General Services will provide administrative support services to the Commission upon request. The Commission can request administrative support services from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, detail personnel from the Department, use the United States mails, and appoint a Director. The Commission may appoint personnel and set their pay rates according to regulations. It will function as an advisory committee and will terminate 30 days after submitting a report. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums may be appropriated as necessary for this section."
