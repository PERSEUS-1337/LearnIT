    "content": "The \"TRICARE Enhancement Act of 2000\" improves access to health care under the TRICARE program. The TRICARE Enhancement Act of 2000 enhances access to health care for covered beneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code. It waives the requirement for nonavailability statements or preauthorization for authorized health care services, excluding mental health services, under new contracts for health care services. Covered beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Standard are not required to obtain nonavailability statements for care in specialized treatment facilities outside a 200-mile radius of a military medical treatment facility. The Secretary of Defense may require covered beneficiaries to inform their primary care manager of any health care needs. The TRICARE Enhancement Act of 2000 improves access to healthcare for covered beneficiaries by waiving the need for nonavailability statements or preauthorization for authorized healthcare services. Covered beneficiaries must inform their primary care manager of any healthcare received from civilian providers or in specialized treatment facilities. Exceptions to this requirement include significant cost avoidance, maintaining proficiency levels of practitioners, or interference with TRICARE contract administration.

The Secretary of Defense directs the use of the Composite Health Care System to measure performance in scheduling appointments at military medical facilities for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries. Modifications will be made to ensure standardized access standards are met, and compliance with appointment timeliness standards will be reported at various levels within the military health-care system. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2000, on efforts to implement standardized access standards for scheduling appointments at military medical facilities for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries. Expanded access to certified mental health counselors. Expanded access to certified mental health counselors by amending Section 1079 of title 10, United States Code to include certified mental health counselors in the services provided. The amendment allows certified mental health counselors to provide substance abuse treatment services and mental health evaluations to covered beneficiaries under the TRICARE program. This applies to services provided under Section 1079 or 1086 of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 5. Reimbursement of certain costs for covered beneficiaries referred for care outside local catchment area. The Secretary of Defense mandates that new TRICARE health care contracts must reimburse covered beneficiaries for travel expenses if they are referred to a provider more than 100 miles away due to local unavailability. Reimbursement can be for personal automobile mileage or air travel, following standard Federal reimbursement rates. This removes the restriction on reimbursement caps. SEC. 6. REMOVAL OF RESTRICTION REGARDING REIMBURSEMENT CAP. Amends Section 1097b(a) of title 10, United States Code to allow TRICARE Standard to reimburse health care providers as a secondary payer up to 115 percent of CHAMPUS maximum allowable charges. Total reimbursement from TRICARE Standard and primary insurance provider cannot exceed the total charges for the health care provided. SEC. 7. IMPROVEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO PROVISION OF DENTAL CARE. The Secretary of Defense will extend the appeals process for non-network dental care providers under the TRICARE program. Disenrollment process for TRICARE Retiree Dental Program will allow for disenrollment within 10 business days of enrollment application submission. Limited circumstances will permit disenrollment during the 24-month initial period. Disenrollment during the 24-month initial enrollment period is allowed under specific circumstances, such as military retirees assigned overseas, serious illness, severe financial hardship, or other reasons deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Initial requests for disenrollment must be made within a specified timeframe. Initial requests for disenrollment under specific circumstances must be made to the contractor, with appeals referred to the TRICARE Management Activity upon beneficiary request. SEC. 8. REPORTS REQUIRED. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress by February 1, 2001, regarding the use of authority to provide reimbursement to health care providers at rates higher than authorized, not exceeding 115 percent of CHAMPUS maximum allowable charges. The report should include details on the rate and incidence of this authority's use, locations where it was exercised, procedures involved, and an analysis of its effectiveness in improving health care services under the TRICARE program network, especially in rural and remote areas. The Secretary of Defense will report to Congress by February 1, 2001, on the comparison of rates for medical procedures under the TRICARE program and Medicare. The Comptroller General will also submit a report on whether a mandatory reimbursement floor of 70 percent of usual and customary rates would improve the health care network under TRICARE."
