    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bosnia Force Realignment Act.\" The Congress finds that US ground combat forces in Bosnia have completed their mission, and their continued presence is subject to Congressional oversight. Congress has the authority to limit funds for withdrawal of these forces. The President confirmed US participation in the multinational military force in Bosnia. The Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina would end in approximately 1 year, with a deadline set for December 20, 1996. The Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed confidence in completing the mission within that timeframe. It was emphasized that establishing a firm deadline was crucial to prevent potential expansion of the mission. The United States Administration announced a delay in the removal of US ground forces on October 3, 1996. The Administration decided to delay the withdrawal of US ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina until March 1997, with a further extension announced by the President until June 1998. Despite previous deadlines and endorsements of having a deadline as a precaution against mission expansion, Congress was not asked for authorization for the extended deployment. The President announced on December 17, 1997, that establishing a deadline for US ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a mistake, committing them to the NATO-led mission indefinitely. NATO forces have increased participation in law enforcement, with US military commanders stating that responsibility lies with Bosnian parties according to the Dayton Peace Agreement. The United States is withdrawing ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina. No funds for the Department of Defense can be used for deploying US ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1999, except for protecting diplomatic facilities or advising NATO peacekeeping operations. No funds appropriated for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999 or later can be used for certain activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1999, including law enforcement support, activities jeopardizing NATO's mission, and refugee transfers. The text prohibits the use of funds for activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina that may lead to the acquisition of control by one Bosnian Entity over territory allocated to another Entity under the Dayton Peace Agreement or pose a risk to US Armed Forces. It also states that any decision to change the legal status of territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be agreed upon by all signatories to the Dayton Peace Agreement. This does not limit the President's authority to protect US citizens. The President must submit a report to Congress by December 1, 1998, detailing the progress of withdrawing US ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The report should outline steps taken to transfer the US portion of the peacekeeping mission to European allies. The Act defines key terms related to the Dayton Peace Agreement, including IFOR, NATO, and the Stabilization Force. The Stabilization Force (SFOR) was authorized under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1088 in December 1996."
