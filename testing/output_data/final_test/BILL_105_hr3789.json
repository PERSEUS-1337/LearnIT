    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Class Action Jurisdiction Act of 1998\" and any reference to an amendment or repeal in the Act is considered to be made to a section of title 28, United States Code. District courts have jurisdiction as outlined in the Act. The \"Class Action Jurisdiction Act of 1998\" expands federal jurisdiction by granting district courts original jurisdiction over class actions involving diverse citizenships or foreign states. The term 'foreign state' is defined in section 1603(a). In civil actions where the majority of plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of the same state, and the claims are governed by that state's laws, the district court should abstain. Additionally, in civil actions where the total claims do not exceed $1,000,000 and the number of plaintiffs is less than 100, the district court should also abstain. The district court may abstain from hearing a class action if the total claims are less than $1,000,000 and the number of plaintiffs is less than 100, or if the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other governmental entities. Certain class actions under the Securities Act of 1933 or based on the statutory or common law of the State where the issuer is incorporated are exempt from this provision. The text chunk discusses communication and recommendations related to the sale of securities by an issuer or its affiliate to equity holders. It also defines terms like 'issuer', 'security', and 'equity security' based on the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The text chunk amends Section 1332 by adding a conforming amendment and determining diversity for a proposed class in relation to a defendant corporation's citizenship. SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF CLASS ACTIONS. Section 1453 of Chapter 89 allows for the removal of class actions to a district court of the United States. This can be done by any defendant or by a plaintiff class member who is not a named or representative class member without the consent of all members. The section applies before or after the certification of a class, and the procedure for removal follows the provisions of section 1446(a). Section 1453 of Chapter 89 allows for the removal of class actions to a district court of the United States. This can be done by any defendant or by a plaintiff class member who is not a named or representative class member without the consent of all members. The requirement relating to the 30-day filing period for removal shall be met if a plaintiff class member files notice within 30 days after receiving the initial written notice of the class action. Section 1446(b) is amended to include limitations on removal, requiring due diligence and referencing section 1332. Technical and conforming amendments are made to the table of sections for chapter 89. Section 1453 allows for the removal of class actions to a district court of the United States. If a court determines that no aspect of an action subject to its jurisdiction under section 1332(b) can be maintained as a class action under Rule 23, the class allegations will be struck and the action remanded to State court. The period of limitations for any claim asserted on behalf of a proposed class member will be tolled to the full extent provided under Federal law upon remand. The amendments made by this Act apply to actions commenced on or after the enactment date. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the impact of these amendments on Federal courts' workload and report to Congress within a year."
