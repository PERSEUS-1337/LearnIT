    "content": "The President responded to reports of deteriorating aquatic conditions by creating the Committee on Ocean Policy within the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The Bush Administration released a U.S. Ocean Action Plan supporting the development of a Global Ocean Observing System, partnerships in ocean stewardship, individual fishing quotas, and a National Freight Action Agenda. The President's Ocean Action Plan includes pursuing Coral Reef Local Action Strategies, U.S. accession to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and legislation to define NOAA's responsibilities. Debate surrounds the need for a more comprehensive marine resource preservation system, with various U.S. marine sites already receiving special protections under existing laws. The Executive Order 13,158, initiated by President Clinton and continued by the Bush Administration, prioritized Marine Protected Area (MPA) designation and management at a national level. It directs federal agencies to enhance protections for existing MPAs, prevent harm from federal actions, and establish a comprehensive national MPA system. The Order does not specify the jurisdiction for creating MPAs or the laws authorizing their creation, but it does not grant new designation or management authority to federal agencies. The Executive Order 13,158 prioritizes Marine Protected Area (MPA) designation and management at a national level. Federal agencies are directed to enhance existing MPAs and establish new ones, in accordance with international law and previous Presidential Proclamations. The National Marine Protected Areas Center issued a Draft Framework for Developing the National System of Marine Protected Areas in 2006. The Draft Framework for Developing the National System of Marine Protected Areas was issued in 2006 by the National Marine Protected Areas Center. It provides guidance for collaborative efforts to establish an effective National System of Marine Protected Areas, without creating new legal authorities or altering existing MPA laws or programs. Each MPA will continue to be independently managed by its respective agency. The Draft Framework for Developing the National System of Marine Protected Areas in 2006 aims to coordinate existing programs under legal authority to establish MPAs. International law grants coastal nations jurisdiction over marine resources up to twelve nautical miles from their coast, as recognized by UNCLOS III. Coastal nations have jurisdiction over marine resources up to 24 nautical miles from the coast, including the contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) under UNCLOS III. The United States, although not a formal party to the treaty, has proclaimed its own EEZ jurisdiction. The United States, while not a formal party to UNCLOS III, has claimed jurisdiction over zones similar to those in the treaty through presidential proclamations and federal laws. Congress has the authority to regulate U.S. waters, including the territorial sea, contiguous zone, and EEZ. Resource protection laws could also apply to ocean resources in these areas if designated for protection by Congress or the President. The President and Congress may have authority to regulate ocean resources under various statutes and treaties, including UNCLOS III, to protect and preserve marine habitats and execute treaty obligations. The U.S. government may have authority to protect ocean resources under treaties like the Protocol Amending the 1916 Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds. The extent of this authority is complex and must be considered in relation to the international community and the states. The United States claims a twelve nautical mile territorial sea where it exercises full jurisdiction, including airspace and ocean resources. This authority is recognized internationally, similar to a nation's sovereignty over its land territory. The United States has jurisdiction over its territorial sea and coastal waters, with coastal states having authority under the Federal Submerged Lands Act of 1953. The country also claims an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles from its coasts, granting sovereign rights over exploration activities. In its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the United States has sovereign rights over natural resource management, economic activities, and environmental protection, as outlined in UNCLOS III. However, the US has less than full sovereignty and ownership in its EEZ, which may limit its regulation and application of federal law. The United States has sovereign rights in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under UNCLOS III, but its regulation and application of federal law may be limited. President Clinton extended the U.S. territorial sea to twenty-four nautical miles, allowing control to prevent infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws within its territory or territorial sea. The exact extent of U.S. authority in the contiguous zone remains unclear. The United States has extended its territorial sea to twenty-four nautical miles, granting control to prevent infringement of laws within its territory. The exact extent of U.S. authority in the contiguous zone is not clearly defined, with some regulatory control but not full sovereignty. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) provides a legal framework for creating marine protected areas, focusing on protecting entire marine ecosystems. Thirteen national marine sanctuaries have been established, covering 18,000 square miles in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sanctuaries can be designated by Congress or administratively. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of marine protected areas through administrative or congressional action. The Secretary of Commerce, through NOAA, can designate marine sanctuaries and implement regulations. The administrative designation process involves publishing various documents in the Federal Register, including a proposal notice, draft management plan, regulations, Environmental Impact Statement, and cost estimates. Public hearings are required in the affected coastal areas, with congressional oversight of the designation process. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of marine protected areas through administrative or congressional action. Congressional oversight is required for the designation process, ensuring that the new designation will not negatively impact the existing system and that there are sufficient resources for implementation. The Secretary may designate a marine sanctuary if it fulfills the purposes of the Act and is of special national significance. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of marine protected areas based on cultural, archaeological, educational, or esthetic qualities, living marine resources, or resource values. Existing authorities may be inadequate, and designation as a national marine sanctuary can facilitate conservation and management. Factors to consider include size, nature, and consultation with state and federal authorities. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of marine protected areas based on various qualities and values. Designations are subject to approval by the Governor within state boundaries. Regulations can vary between sites, with sanctuaries often allowing multiple uses like fishing and shipping. The Act emphasizes compatible uses in resource assessment reports for proposed sanctuaries, considering impacts on income-generating activities. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of marine protected areas with considerations for negative impacts on income-generating activities. Fishing interests are protected, and the Regional Fishery Management Council drafts fishing regulations. Existing leases, permits, and rights are not terminated upon designation. The Secretary has the authority to approve Council's proposed rules unless they do not align with the Act's goals. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of marine protected areas with considerations for negative impacts on income-generating activities. Fishing interests are protected, and the Secretary can regulate rights, excluding fishing from special-use permit requirements. The Act authorizes necessary actions to prevent damage, funded by damages received. Liability is broad, with strict liability for injuries to protected marine resources. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act establishes a national program for fishery conservation. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act establishes a national program for the conservation and management of fishery resources in the United States. It aims to prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, ensure conservation, and maximize the nation's fishery resources. The law assigns primary responsibility for marine resources to eight regional Fishery Management Councils, which develop and implement Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) and regulations to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act aims to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield for the United States fishing industry. \"Optimum yield\" is defined as the amount of fish that will provide the greatest benefit to the nation, considering food production, recreational opportunities, and marine ecosystem protection. The act also defines \"overfished\" as a rate of mortality that jeopardizes a fishery's capacity to produce sustainable yield. Regional councils submit regulations and Fishery Management Plans to the Secretary of Commerce for review. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for various management techniques to regulate fisheries, such as limiting access, setting fishing quotas, imposing gear restrictions, and taxing fish caught. The Secretary of Commerce reviews regulations submitted by regional councils for approval. The Magnuson-Stevens Act authorizes regional councils to close fisheries to prevent overfishing and protect essential fish habitat. Regional regulations provide specific guidance for fishery closure, and councils must identify and conserve EFH for species in need of protection. The National Marine Fishery Service has refined EFH requirements in its regulations. The National Marine Fishery Service has refined EFH requirements in its regulations, focusing on protecting species and adopting an ecosystem approach. Regional councils are required to prevent degradation of EFH from fishing operations, with no specific protection measures mandated. The Magnuson-Stevens Act emphasizes management flexibility and adaptive regulatory techniques for fishery management. It requires periodic review and continuous assessment of Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) and allows for necessary amendments to FMP implementing regulations. The regulations also recognize the need for flexibility in fishery management and encourage FMPs to include multiple regulatory options that can be implemented as needed without amending FMPs. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for flexible and responsive management of marine resources through various regulatory options. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act grants federal jurisdiction over submerged lands outside state jurisdiction and authorizes mineral leases on Outer Continental Shelf lands. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) grants the Secretary of the Interior broad authority to manage OCS mineral resources through a comprehensive leasing program. This program includes a five-year leasing schedule that considers economic, social, and environmental values, allowing the Secretary to impose conditions or refrain from leasing areas altogether. The OCSLA grants the Secretary of the Interior authority to manage OCS mineral resources through a leasing program. Lessees must submit development plans and permits, which can be disapproved if they harm environmental or mineral resources. Plans must also comply with state regulations under the Coastal Zone Management Act. States can prevent Interior approval unless overridden by the Secretary of Commerce. The OCSLA, along with other resource-oriented statutes, grants authority for environmentally sensitive mineral development and preservation. Coastal states have regulatory responsibility for coastal areas, with the CZMA encouraging preservation and sustainable development in coordination with state management plans. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) promotes sustainable use and development in coastal areas, managed by states, NOAA, and EPA. Approved state programs receive federal assistance for land and water conservation measures, pollution control, and regulating federally permitted activities. The Antiquities Act allows for the designation of national monuments, including marine areas, by the President. The Antiquities Act grants the President authority to declare national monuments on government-owned lands, including historic landmarks, structures, and objects of scientific interest. The Act has been broadly interpreted to include submerged lands under U.S. jurisdiction. The Antiquities Act grants the President authority to declare national monuments on government-owned lands, including submerged lands under U.S. jurisdiction. Submerged lands, such as coral reefs, have been included in national monuments in connection with protection of associated surface lands. The act has been interpreted to authorize protection of the water column above submerged lands if necessary for the protection of qualifying objects. The Clinton Administration expanded protection for the Buck Island Reef National Monument, prohibiting fishing in addition to protecting submerged lands. A monument designation solely for water resources, without underlying land-based protection, may stretch the language of the statute. The Antiquities Act allows the President to designate national monuments on government-owned lands, including submerged lands. Ownership and control of these submerged lands are complicated by jurisdictional zones in the sea. The U.S. asserts sovereignty over the territorial sea and jurisdiction over the EEZ. The question of whether the U.S. \"owns\" or \"controls\" these submerged lands under the Antiquities Act remains unresolved. The U.S. asserts sovereignty over the territorial sea and jurisdiction over the EEZ. The question of whether the U.S. \"owns\" or \"controls\" these submerged lands under the Antiquities Act remains unresolved. The Supreme Court has held that the United States owned the lands within the territorial sea and that the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution authorized Congress to dispose of such lands. President Reagan's proclamation extended U.S. jurisdiction over the seas to parallel international law, expanding the territorial sea to three miles from the shoreline. The Supreme Court affirmed federal ownership and control of submerged lands within one-mile belts as national monuments under the Antiquities Act. The Submerged Lands Act altered this balance by establishing state title and ownership of lands beneath navigable waters within state boundaries. The federal government retains navigational servitude and regulatory control over submerged lands up to three miles from state coasts, while states have proprietary rights for management and development. Federal ownership vis-\u00e0-vis other nations is maintained, but determining federal control is complex. The federal government retains navigational servitude and regulatory control over submerged lands up to three miles from state coasts. The standard for determining \"control\" is unclear, with significant federal controls ceded and retained. The Antiquities Act may not apply to state submerged lands affected by the Submerged Lands Act, but areas beyond this region remain subject to federal ownership or control. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) does not clearly state that the U.S. owns submerged lands beyond state coasts. The extent of U.S. claim to these lands remains uncertain, as the statute defines the Outer Continental Shelf but does not explicitly mention ownership. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) does not explicitly state U.S. ownership of submerged lands beyond state coasts. The U.S. jurisdiction and control over the subsoil and seabed are outlined in the law, indicating control rather than ownership, especially beyond the territorial sea. The Antiquities Act may still apply to U.S. waters in the EEZ. The U.S. claims sovereign rights in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under the Antiquities Act, with control extending 200 nautical miles. The extent of control in the EEZ is less than in the territorial sea, but a contiguous zone allows for additional regulatory authority up to 24 nautical miles from the coast. The levels of regulatory authority in these zones may impact the determination of U.S. \"control\" under the Antiquities Act. The United States has authority to regulate the EEZ and contiguous zone for environmental and economic purposes. The issue of whether this control meets the Antiquities Act requirements is unresolved. The Secretary of the Interior can recommend areas to Congress for inclusion in the National Park System, considering factors like resource rarity and threats. The Secretary of the Interior can recommend areas to Congress for inclusion in the National Park System, considering factors like resource rarity, threats, public use potential, interpretive and educational potential, costs, socioeconomic impacts, public support, and long-term resource protection. Marine sites could be included in the recommendations, as Congress has the power to designate such areas, including coral reefs in the National Park System. The National Park System includes marine resources like coral reefs. Congress created the National Park of American Samoa to protect the tropical forest, cultural resources, and associated reefs. Fishing is prohibited in designated areas unless for subsistence. The National Park Service manages parks and prepares general management plans for resource preservation. The Secretary of the Interior has authority to prescribe rules for park management, including boating and water-related activities. The National Park System includes marine resources like coral reefs. Congress created the National Park of American Samoa to protect the tropical forest, cultural resources, and associated reefs. Fishing is prohibited in designated areas unless for subsistence. The National Park Service manages parks and prepares general management plans for resource preservation. The Secretary of the Interior has authority to prescribe rules for park management, including boating and water-related activities. Located within areas of the National Park System, marine resources are not outside the scope of the system now in place. The broad management powers available under the National Park Service Organic Act and Congress' power to further refine marine resource management could provide flexible and comprehensive regulation. The United States owns and exercises full sovereignty over its territorial seas, so establishment of a park in that zone would not pose jurisdictional problems. Designation within other zones may be more complicated, but the National Park Service Organic Act makes no apparent distinction among waters or ocean resources based on the various zones. The National Park Service Organic Act allows for regulation of boating and activities in waters within the National Park System, in compliance with the U.S. Coast Guard's authority. Designating a park in any zone is permissible under the Act as long as it aligns with U.S. sovereignty. The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to manage marine resources through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to manage a national network of lands and waters for conservation and restoration of fish, wildlife, and plant resources in the United States. This includes the potential for marine resources to receive wildlife refuge status, with current refuges connected to Hawaiian islands or U.S. territories. An independent refuge in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has not been established. The Fish and Wildlife Service's jurisdiction over marine resources has been limited, with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries transferred to the Department of Commerce. The Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife remained under DOI but lost authority over migratory marine species. The FWS now only retains authority over Great Lakes fishery research. The Fish and Wildlife Service's jurisdiction over marine resources has been limited since the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries was transferred to the Department of Commerce. The FWS now only retains authority over Great Lakes fishery research and activities related to the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, Missouri River Reservoir research, Gulf Breeze Biological Laboratory in Florida, and Trans-Alaska pipeline investigations. Its authority to manage resources as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System remains intact. Refuges are typically created through legislation, executive order, or acquisition of private land. The Secretary of the FWS has broad discretion to regulate activities in refuge areas, permitting uses that are compatible with the area's established purposes. Key statutes guiding FWS regulation include the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The FWS regulations allow for recreational, economic, hunting, fishing, and subsistence uses of refuges under specified circumstances. The standards for refuge protection are more permissive than national parks but less permissive than multiple-use lands. There is a question of whether the NWRSAA applies in the territorial sea and EEZ. The mission of the System is to conserve, manage, and restore fish, wildlife, and plant resources. The NWRSAA aims to conserve and manage fish, wildlife, and plant resources within the United States for future generations. There is a debate on whether refuge designation in the territorial sea is permissible, but it is argued that the territorial sea could be considered \"within the United States.\" Designation within the territorial sea is permissible, but whether it would be allowed in the EEZ or contiguous zone is questionable. The EEZ is considered beyond US territory, but the US has sovereign rights there for natural resource management. Creating refuge-like protections in the EEZ may be possible if authorized by Congress. President Clinton issued Executive Orders 13,178 and 13,196 near the end of his administration, creating the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve (NHIR) covering approximately 99,500 square nautical miles. This reserve, the first of its kind in the U.S., surrounds certain U.S.-owned Pacific islands and was authorized by the 2000 amendments to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The amended Act directs the Secretary of Commerce to designate the NHIR as a marine sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The NHIR has been designated, and the process for redesignation as a marine sanctuary has begun. Congressional authorization does not compel designation, and executive orders can be delayed, abandoned, or overturned. The Executive Orders issued by President Clinton direct federal agencies to protect the NHIR using various legal authorities, including the Constitution and several statutes. The Orders do not give the NHIR any additional force of law but rather authorize actions within the executive branch. The Executive Orders establish protections for the NHIR, limiting development and prohibiting certain activities like oil and gas exploration. They allow for some fishing in designated areas while prohibiting resource development in others. Additional management and conservation measures will be developed. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with other agencies and councils, will develop detailed management and conservation measures for the NHIR. This includes creating Reserve Management Principles, conservation measures, and a Reserve Operations Plan. Additional regulatory authorities such as the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Clean Water Act, and Ocean Dumping Act also play a role in species protection. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protections for individual species and their habitat, including critical habitat designation. \"Take permits\" allow for harm if deemed incidental to lawful activities. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) focuses on species management and prohibits taking marine mammals, except incidentally during fishing operations. The Secretary of Commerce can close fisheries or revoke permits for non-compliance with incidental take restrictions. The Clean Water Act prohibits pollutants discharge into ocean waters that may harm marine environment. EPA guidelines determine degradation of marine waters and permits are issued only if no unreasonable degradation will occur. The Marine Protection Act supplements discharge limitations and prohibits dumping in ocean waters. The Marine Protection Act supplements the Clean Water Act by prohibiting dumping in ocean waters that may harm human health, welfare, marine environment, and economic potentialities without appropriate authorization. Permit issuance is governed by ocean discharge criteria and the London Dumping Convention, with potential tension due to overlapping agency jurisdiction. The NHIR has jurisdiction over portions of a National Wildlife Refuge, which may pose challenges due to conflicting management authorities between the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior. Coordination with state or federal agencies may be necessary to address this issue. The NHIR has jurisdiction over parts of a National Wildlife Refuge, leading to potential conflicts between the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior in managing refuge resources. The law authorizing presidential designation of the NHIR may impact refuge authority placement in the DOI, potentially allowing the Secretary of Commerce to have primary management authority. This could result in weaker protective standards for the refuge, raising questions about Congress's intent on this issue. The NHIR may impact refuge authority placement in the DOI, potentially allowing the Secretary of Commerce to have primary management authority. Congress's intent on this issue is unclear, as there is a general presumption that Congress will specify its intention for a new statute to supersede an earlier one. The reserve designation provision may leave primary refuge management authorities with FWS alone, but cooperative management efforts among relevant agencies are authorized. Executive Orders do not definitively clarify where management authority rests. The NHIR may impact refuge authority placement in the DOI, potentially allowing the Secretary of Commerce to have primary management authority. Congress's intent on this issue is unclear, as there is a general presumption that Congress will specify its intention for a new statute to supersede an earlier one. The reserve designation provision may leave primary refuge management authorities with FWS alone, but cooperative management efforts among relevant agencies are authorized. Executive Orders do not definitively clarify where management authority rests. The Secretary of Commerce is directed to manage the Reserve and facilitate coordination among state and federal agencies. There is some indication that regulatory authority over the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge is separate from the rest of the reserve, but efforts are made to ensure coordinated management between the two areas. The Executive Orders and enabling statute leave the role of the regional fishery management council, WesPac, relatively vague. WesPac is intended to remain an active regulator under Magnuson-Stevens, with primary responsibility for regulatory activities. WesPac, as the regional fishery management council, is concerned that Executive Orders and NHIR regulations may conflict with Magnuson-Stevens Act by limiting resource utilization. Magnuson-Stevens requires fishery management plans to achieve \"optimum yield\" while preventing overfishing based on scientific information, potentially conflicting with the restrictions imposed by the Executive Orders. The regional council determines the maximum sustainable yield from fisheries, considering social, economic, and ecological factors. Conservation and management activities are necessary to rebuild, restore, or maintain fishery resources and the marine environment. The President may direct fishery management to prioritize conservation. If scientific information does not support specific restrictions on resource exploitation, additional fishing may be permitted. It is important to understand the statutory and regulatory background for marine protected areas. The statutory and regulatory background for the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is important. Various legislation, such as the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, provide potential protections for marine resources. Additionally, general preservation laws like the Antiquities Act, National Park Service Organic Act, and National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act allow for the designation of marine resources as national monuments, parks, or wildlife refuges. The creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) using various conservation authorities like the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is subject to concerns specific to each statute and limited by U.S. jurisdiction over offshore lands and waters. Application of these authorities to the territorial sea is generally permissible, but less certain beyond that."
