    "content": "The \"Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act\" or the \"LEAP Act\" provides a tax credit for employees participating in qualified apprenticeship programs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"LEAP Act\" offers a tax credit under section 38 for employers with apprentices exceeding the apprenticeship level. The credit amount varies based on the age of the apprentice, with a limit of 2 taxable years per apprentice. The \"LEAP Act\" provides a tax credit under section 38 for employers with apprentices in officially recognized apprenticeable occupations, registered under an apprentice agreement with the Department of Labor or a recognized State agency. The \"LEAP Act\" offers a tax credit for employers with apprentices in recognized apprenticeable occupations, based on the average number of apprentices in the preceding 3 taxable years. The \"LEAP Act\" provides a tax credit for employers with apprentices in recognized apprenticeable occupations. For employers without any apprentices in the 3 previous taxable years, the apprenticeship level is zero. The credit allowed under this section reduces other applicable credits for the same employee. Rules similar to section 51 apply to this credit. The \"LEAP Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit for employers with apprentices in recognized apprenticeable occupations. The amendment includes adjustments to paragraphs (35) and (36), denial of double benefit, and a clerical amendment to the code. Employees in qualified apprenticeship programs will be affected by the amendments made in this section, applying to those starting programs after the enactment of the Act."
