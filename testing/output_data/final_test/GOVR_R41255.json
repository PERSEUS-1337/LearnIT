    "content": "The original House-passed version of the \"tax extenders\" bill, H.R. 4213 in December 2009 included two agricultural-related tax provisions: extending biodiesel tax credits until December 31, 2010, and extending conservation tax deductions for contributions of capital gain real property until the same date. The estimated costs for these extensions were $634 million in FY2010 and $235 million in FY2011 for biodiesel tax credits, and $23 million in FY2010 and $190 million over 10 years for conservation tax deductions. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4213 includes $1.48 billion in agricultural disaster assistance, with direct payments to producers for 2009 crop losses and assistance for specialty crops, cottonseed, aquaculture, and Hawaiian sugarcane cooperative. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4213 includes $1.48 billion in agricultural disaster assistance, with direct payments to producers for 2009 crop losses, assistance for specialty crops, cottonseed, aquaculture, and Hawaiian sugarcane cooperative. Additionally, the bill provides no-interest emergency loans for poultry producers facing contract terminations, additional funding for grazing losses, and administrative costs for USDA. The creation of permanent agricultural disaster programs was intended to reduce the need for ad hoc disaster assistance. The House version of H.R. 4213, passed on May 28, 2010, includes agricultural disaster assistance and tax extensions, along with funding for the Pigford discrimination case against USDA. It provides $1.15 billion for the Pigford settlement, in addition to $100 million from the 2008 farm bill, totaling $1.25 billion. The 2008 farm bill allowed claimants in the original Pigford decision to petition for a determination in civil court. A $1.25 billion settlement for Pigford II claims was announced by USDA and the Department of Justice. The House amendment to H.R. 4213 would be the first bill to provide funds for the settlement. Despite a deadline passing for Congress to appropriate $1.15 billion, efforts are underway to secure the funds to avoid voiding the settlement. The House-passed amendment includes extensions for Biodiesel Tax Credits and Conservation Tax Deduction until December 31, 2010. Senate discussions in June focused on budget impacts and offsets for emergency spending, potentially jeopardizing provisions like agricultural disaster funding. The original House-passed version of H.R. 4899 did not provide supplemental funding for agriculture but included rescissions from agricultural accounts for offsets. The House-passed bill on March 24, 2010, would have rescinded $465 million from agricultural accounts for offsets in other programs. This included $361.8 million from unobligated funds for the WIC program and $102.7 million from prior-year rural development appropriations. The Senate passed H.R. 4899, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010, which included $200 million for USDA programs. This bill also allocated $150 million for agricultural programs, including P.L. 480 \"Food for Peace\" Title II grants. Additionally, $150 million was designated for USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service for humanitarian food aid grants in response to the January 2010 earthquake. The Senate-passed Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 included $200 million for USDA programs, with $150 million allocated for agricultural programs and humanitarian food aid grants in response to the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The bill also allows USDA's Farm Service Agency to issue an additional $950 million in loans and guarantees to address higher loan demand during the financial crisis. The Senate provision in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 includes $32 million for loan authority ($31 million for loan subsidy and $1 million for administrative expenses). USDA's Farm Service Agency would receive $18 million for a cost-share program to restore nonindustrial private forest land damaged by natural disasters. USDA's Rural Housing Service would receive an additional $697 million in loan guarantee authority for the Section 502 Single-Family Housing Guaranteed Loan program. The Section 502 Single-Family Housing Guaranteed Loan program would raise guarantee fees to offset additional guarantees, increasing fees from 1% to 3.5% of the principal of new loans. The increase in fees is permanent, while the increase in loan authority is temporary. Demand for loan guarantees was heavy in FY2009, depleting the guarantee authority. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) receives mandatory funds from the CCC to encourage cellulosic production. The 2008 farm bill created BCAP to promote cellulosic feedstock production for biofuels with incentives for harvest and storage. CBO projects $602 million in budget authority for FY2010 and $432 million for FY2011. The Senate-passed supplemental appropriation limits funding to $552 million in FY2010 and $432 million in FY2011, saving an estimated $50 million in FY2010. The Senate report directs FNS to review program effectiveness. The bill directs USDA's Food and Nutrition Service to review reprogramming funds for The Emergency Food Assistance Program due to high demand on food banks. The House passed amendments to the Senate version, including additional appropriations for the Pigford settlement and emergency food assistance. The House version of the tax extenders bill includes $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and $979 million in rescissions from agriculture accounts. It also includes a rescission of $487 million from reserve funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and $422 million from rural development programs. The House bill includes a rescission of $422 million from rural development, with $300 million for rural broadband funding from the ARRA and $122 million from prior-year rural development appropriations. Additionally, $70 million would be rescinded from unobligated prior-year balances from the Natural Resources Conservation Service."
