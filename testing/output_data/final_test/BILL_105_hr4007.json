    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act\" and establishes the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group. The \"Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act\" establishes the Interagency Group to oversee Nazi war criminal records for a period of 3 years. The President appoints members to the group within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Interagency Group, appointed by the President, includes key individuals to oversee Nazi war criminal records for 3 years. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, the group must hold an initial meeting and begin their functions. The Interagency Group, appointed by the President, is tasked with locating, identifying, and making available classified Nazi war criminal records of the United States within 1 year of the Act's enactment. They must coordinate with agencies to expedite the release of these records and submit a report to Congress detailing their activities. Funding is authorized to carry out the provisions of the Act. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT OF DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS REGARDING PERSONS WHO COMMITTED NAZI WAR CRIMES. The term \"Nazi war criminal records\" refers to classified records related to individuals involved in the persecution of others based on race, religion, national origin, or political opinion during the Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945. The provision pertains to transactions involving assets taken from persecuted persons during the Nazi regime, completed without the consent of the owners or their legitimate representatives. The Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group releases Nazi war criminal records, with exceptions for privacy and confidentiality concerns. Unauthorized disclosure of the source would damage national security interests of the United States, reveal information on weapons of mass destruction, impair cryptologic systems, affect state-of-the-art technology in US weapon systems, expose military war plans, and harm relations with foreign governments. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for unauthorized disclosures that could harm national security, diplomatic activities, protection of government officials, national security emergency preparedness plans, or violate treaties. The curr_chunk discusses the presumption of public interest in releasing Nazi war criminal records, with exemptions only allowed if disclosure would harm a specific interest. Agency heads must report such determinations to Congress, and these exemptions are the only authority for withholding records. The curr_chunk explains that agency heads can only exempt records from release under specific circumstances, with limitations on application to certain investigations or records in their possession. The exemptions must adhere to the same review standards as records withheld under title 5 of the United States Code. The curr_chunk specifies that the National Security Act of 1947 exemption does not apply to operational files that contain Nazi war criminal records. SEC. 4 of the Act expedites the processing of FOIA requests for Nazi war criminal records, deeming such requests as having a compelling need. A \"requester\" is defined as a person persecuted as described in the Act who requests a Nazi war criminal record. SEC. 5 states that the Act and its amendments will take effect 90 days after enactment."
