    "content": "The House and Senate passed the FY2004 DOD authorization bill, which was signed into law by the President. Compromises were made on key issues, including Buy American provisions and TRICARE for non-deployed reservists. The FY2004 DOD appropriations bill provided $368.7 billion in funding and was quickly passed by both chambers. The FY2004 DOD Authorization Act (P.L. 108-87) settled contentious issues through negotiations. Provisions were added to assess the U.S. defense industrial base and foreign supplier reliance. A compromise was reached on the tanker lease, opting to lease 20 and buy 80 Boeing KC767 tankers. The deal's fate is uncertain due to Boeing's recent controversies. Compromises were also made on other issues to avoid a veto threat from the Administration. The Administration agreed to new benefits for military retirees with disabilities, including concurrent receipt of retirement and disability payments, expansion of benefits for combat-related disabilities, and a pilot program for non-deployed reservists. H.R. 1588 authorizes a new National Security Personnel System for DOD civilian employees, exemptions for environmental statutes, and lifting the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill provide $400.5 billion in authorization. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 1588 authorize $400.5 billion for national defense programs, slightly above the Administration's request of $399.7 billion. The FY2004 DOD appropriations bill provides $368.7 billion for defense programs, slightly less than the House and Senate versions. This decrease allowed for funds to be allocated to other appropriations bills while staying within the discretionary spending cap. The final version of DOD's FY2004 appropriations included a $3.6 billion rescission from the FY2003 supplemental appropriations to offset a $3.5 billion cut in the request. Rescissions are counted as a credit in the year enacted, allowing appropriators to meet FY2004 targets without reducing funding for programs. The FY2004 DOD Authorization Act, H.R. 1588, was passed by the House and Senate in November 2003. The President signed the bill into law on November 24, 2003. Both chambers passed their respective versions of the bill after floor debates, with the House passing by 361 to 68 and the Senate by 98 to 1. Amendments were adopted on concurrent receipt and expedited immigration approval. During the recess, the Senate adopted amendments on concurrent receipt and expedited immigration approval for selected reservists and their families during wartime. They rejected an amendment to cancel the 2005 round of base closures before passing the bill again by voice vote and appointing its conferees. Debate took place in the House on May 20 and May 21, and in the Senate on May 19, 20, 21, 22, and June 4, 2003. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1050 on May 13, after completing markup on May 9. The bill did not include the DOD proposal to redesign its civilian personnel system. The House Armed Services Committee reported its bill on May 16 after completing markup on May 14. The House adopted a rule on May 21 that limited general debate to two hours and amendments to those specified in the rule. The Senate rule required all amendments to be considered relevant by the Parliamentarian. The Senate rule required that all amendments be considered relevant by the Parliamentarian. The House bill included much of DOD's legislative proposal for a new civilian personnel system. The Senate initially passed S. 1050 by 98 to 1 on May 22, 2003, and the bill was then passed by voice vote after compromises on major issues were reached in the conference report. The curr_chunk discusses various proposals and compromises related to military retirement benefits, acquisition of Boeing KC767 tanker airplanes, National Security Personnel System, TRICARE health system, environmental statutes, and research on low-yield nuclear weapons. The Administration also proposed changes to domestic preference restrictions to allow DOD to buy from foreign sources. The Buy American Act requires the federal government to purchase from American producers unless a waiver is granted. The Berry Amendment mandates that DOD buy from U.S. sources for specific items, with exceptions for combat operations. DOD can buy from foreign sources for certain items under specific conditions. The Secretary of Defense has waived domestic preference restrictions in some cases. This year's debate focused on the extent of these restrictions. The debate this year focused on widening DOD's waiver authorities for preference restrictions. The House bill aimed to require DOD to buy critical items from U.S. sources and prohibited purchases from countries that restricted sales due to U.S. operations in Iraq, potentially impacting France and Germany. The Administration threatened to veto the bill. The House bill aimed to expand protections for the defense industrial base and restrict purchases from countries like France and Germany. Senator Warner requested assessments on the legislation's impact on trade and defense relationships. The conference version dropped some restrictions but required DOD to assess vulnerabilities. The bill stated that provisions would not apply if deemed detrimental to U.S. international agreements. The Defense Department is tasked with developing a list of critical items and components for military systems to assess reliance on foreign sources. A new fund is established to support domestic producers, but no funds are allocated for it in FY2004. DOD is also given authority to prioritize domestic producers in source selection. The bill gives authority to prioritize domestic producers in source selection for defense goods. The conference agreement softens the House's proposed prohibition on buying from countries opposing U.S. actions in Iraq. Waivers to Berry Amendment restrictions are broadened to include contingency operations. The bill expands the scope of prioritizing domestic producers for defense goods beyond combat operations to include contingency operations. The debate may focus on providing protections or incentives to domestic producers. The Administration previously opposed concurrent receipt of military retirement and VA disability benefits, citing cost concerns. Military retirees currently face a dollar-for-dollar reduction in retirement benefits to receive tax-exempt disability payments. The conference bill provides new benefits to military retirees with twenty or more years of service and disability ratings of 50% or higher. It expands eligibility for special compensation under the \"Purple Hearts Plus\" program for those with combat-related disabilities. The Senate dropped its proposal for full concurrent receipt, and the House did not include it in their version. Over 200,000 military retirees may qualify for the new concurrent receipt benefit. The new benefits provide additional compensation for military retirees with disability ratings of 50% or higher, including those with combat-related disabilities under the \"Purple Hearts Plus\" program. Eligibility criteria include Guard and Reserve retirees with 20 or more years of service and disability retirees whose payments exceed their retirement benefits. The benefits will go into effect on January 1, 2004, with varying monthly amounts based on disability rating percentage. The new benefits provide additional compensation for military retirees with disability ratings of 50% or higher. Eligible retirees will receive varying monthly amounts based on their disability rating percentage. The cost of the new benefit is estimated to be $800 million in FY2004 and $22.1 billion over ten years. The annual cost would increase steadily to $3.5 billion by 2013. Unlike current military retirement, the legislation creates a new entitlement program that would increase the deficit through annual outlays for current beneficiaries. H.R. 1588 establishes new benefits for military retirees with disability ratings of 50% or higher, funded by general revenues instead of the Defense Department. It also creates a Veterans Disability Benefits Commission to evaluate VA benefits for combat-related disabilities. The concurrent receipt issue may be revisited next year due to pressure from those not covered by the new benefit. The FY2004 DOD Authorization conference included controversial provisions such as allowing the Air Force to lease 20 KC767 Boeing tanker aircraft and buy an additional 80 aircraft. The signing of the contract was delayed due to questions of impropriety by Boeing officials. Budget impacts and concerns about DOD visibility of military personnel costs were also raised. Druyan allegedly discussed job opportunities with Boeing while negotiating the tanker deal. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz requested a review by the DOD Inspector General, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Warner called for a broader review. There is controversy between the House and Senate on interpreting the lease 20, buy 80 proposal, with differing views on contract negotiations. The Air Force's original proposal to contract with Boeing was different from the current alternative. The Air Force's alternative proposal differs from the original plan to lease and buy 100 aircraft from Boeing for $29 billion over 15 years. Leasing is attractive as it delays major funding until 2006, with the bulk needed in 2010-2017. However, competition with other Air Force programs could be a concern in later years. It is uncertain if the Air Force can delay payment until delivery, as suggested by Under Secretary Wolfowitz. Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, Michael Wynne suggested that the Air Force may need to pay for the aircraft when ordered instead of delaying payment by three years. The Air Force has not identified funding for the tanker within its current budget plans. Leasing the aircraft is controversial as it is more expensive than buying, with estimates ranging from $5 billion to $6 billion more. The proposed lease of 20 Boeing KC767 aircraft and incremental purchase of the remaining 80 has been met with scrutiny. The Air Force plans to lease 20 Boeing KC767 aircraft and buy the remaining 80 incrementally, with funding delayed until 2006 and 2008. The new proposal would cost $18.3 billion, $3.2 billion less than the original plan for 100 aircraft but still more than CBO estimates for a straight multiyear contract. CBO considers this a lease/purchase requiring $3.6 billion in budgetary authority in FY2004. The Air Force requested $3.6 billion in budget authority for FY2004, although not provided in the Act. The bill's language implied funding for a multiyear contract, but it is unclear if the new language allows for incremental funding. The Defense Department proposed a new National Security Personnel System for its civilian employees. The Defense Department proposed a new National Security Personnel System for its civilian employees, aiming for flexibility and modernization. Key issues included designing a fair performance rating system linked to pay, appeals processes for disputes, and the level of bargaining between employees and DOD. The Defense Department proposed a new National Security Personnel System for its civilian employees, aiming for flexibility and modernization. The proposal was debated within committees and raised concerns about authority and effects on government workers. The FY2004 DOD authorization modified many provisions, with the Senate version not including any new personnel system provisions. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee proposed a National Security Personnel System in S. 1166, which was adopted in the final version. The system requires collaboration between the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, with disputed parts needing approval from labor organizations representing DOD's civilian employees. Labor organizations have 30 days to review proposals, DOD has 30 days to resolve disputes, and Congress has the final say after a 90-day period. The proposed National Security Personnel System requires collaboration between the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. Labor organizations representing DOD's civilian employees have 30 days to review proposals, DOD has 30 days to resolve disputes, and Congress is notified of remaining disputes 30 days before implementation. The new system can be implemented for up to 300,000 DOD civilian employees initially, with criteria in place for expansion. The system must be fair, credible, and transparent, linking employee performance to agency plans and including safeguards for fairness. Employees, supervisors, and managers must be involved in the design, evaluation, and training for the new system. An equitable method for appraising and compensating employees is required in the pay-for-performance evaluation system. The pay-for-performance evaluation system in the proposed National Security Personnel System includes grouping employees into pay bands based on position responsibilities, setting up a performance rating system with feedback processes, tying salary changes to a scoring system, and linking individual performance factors to agency goals. DOD policymakers intend to design a system similar to the pay banding system used by DOD's laboratories, with exemptions until 2008 unless the new system offers greater flexibility. The DOD is planning to implement a new personnel system with an internal appeals process for disputes about personnel actions. Employees can appeal decisions to the Merit System Protection Board, which will only hear cases involving specific criteria. The DOD will collaborate with unions and the Office of Personnel Management in designing the new system. The new labor management system under the new law allows DOD to develop its own system in collaboration with unions. The process includes a 90-day period for unions to review, discuss changes, and notify Congress of disputes. Decisions made through this process can override existing collective bargaining agreements if desired by the Secretary of Defense. The new law allows DOD to develop its own labor management system in collaboration with unions, with decisions made at the national level. H.R. 1588 endorses two systems of labor-management relations: a new \"collaborative\" system and the traditional collective bargaining system. Critics have raised concerns about local circumstances being considered in national decisions, which could be reviewed by a third party. The new law endorses two systems of labor-management relations: a new \"collaborative\" system and the traditional collective bargaining system. It allows DOD to set up its own labor management system in collaboration with unions at the national level. The legislation gives precedence to the new system in case of overlap with the traditional system. Funding levels for civilian employees under the National Security Personnel System should be budgeted to prevent employees from being disadvantaged. The new law allows DOD to implement a collaborative labor-management system and traditional collective bargaining system. It ensures civilian employees are not disadvantaged financially and provides incentives for early retirement. Additionally, it authorizes pay for performance pilot projects, higher pay caps for Senior Executive Service employees, and a Human Capital Fund for exceptional performance rewards. The budgetary implications and impact on DOD's plans to transfer military jobs are unclear. The FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Act includes a $1 million Capital Fund for exceptional performance rewards in DOD. Congress is receptive to modifying DOD's responsibilities regarding environmental laws, wetlands mitigation banks, and Restoration Advisory Boards. Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant concern for DOD. The debate over DOD's compliance with environmental laws and the need for additional authority to consider military training requirements and wildlife protection on DOD installations. Congressional action on the Endangered Species Act allows DOD to substitute an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan. The DOD can use an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan instead of designating lands as \"Critical Habitat\" under the Endangered Species Act to protect endangered species. Environmental groups are concerned about potential weakening of protection. The INRMP is prepared under the Sikes Act by the Secretary of the military department in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but military readiness takes precedence. The DOD can use Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans instead of designating lands as \"Critical Habitat\" under the Endangered Species Act to protect endangered species. Critics question the criteria of \"benefit to the species\" and enforcement of the plans under the Sikes Act. The final version amends the Endangered Species Act, creating concern among environmental groups for potential exemptions. Other environmental interests oppose amending Title 10, as it may give the Secretary of Defense a primary role in determining plan adequacy. The conference agreement includes changes to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, allowing for new exemption authority and a revised definition of \"harassment.\" The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior, can now exempt certain actions from compliance with the Act. The conference agreement includes new exemption authority under the Marine Mammal Protection Act for national defense purposes. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other departments, can renew exemptions for two-year periods. The new law requires reporting of exemptions to the armed services committees and adopts a narrower definition of harassment of marine mammals for DOD. The Administration proposes narrower definitions of harassment of marine mammals for DOD's military readiness and scientific activities than for other agencies. DOD's activities are defined as \"harassment\" only if they injure or significantly disturb marine mammals' natural behavior patterns. The Act limits the exemption to include training, combat operations, and testing, excluding support activities. This change was prompted by a court case restricting DOD's use of low-frequency SURTASS sonar. The FY2004 DOD authorization exempts DOD from complying with current standards for evaluating the impact on marine mammals in specified geographical regions or small numbers. Congress also made other changes requested by the Administration, including allowing DOD to purchase credits from a mitigation bank and exempting DOD's Restoration Advisory Boards from certain requirements. The Administration's efforts to provide special treatment for the Department of Defense (DOD) to protect readiness activities may lead to exemptions from environmental statutes. Congress did not approve all requested exemptions but required DOD to report on how environmental laws and residential development impact readiness activities. Additionally, Congress approved a demonstration project to provide access to DOD's TRICARE health care system for reservists returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2004 DOD Authorization Act approved a demonstration project to provide TRICARE health care access to non-deployed reservists who receive unemployment compensation or lack employer coverage. Reservists would pay a premium of 28% of the plan's actuarial cost. The project is estimated to cost about $200 million annually. The FY2004 DOD Authorization Act approved a demonstration project costing about $200 million annually to provide TRICARE health care access to non-deployed reservists. The Senate proposal for a $2 billion annual cost was dropped in conference, setting a ceiling of $400 million for the project. GAO will evaluate reservists' health care needs by May 1, 2004, with potential benefits expansion for reservists likely due to future military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The conferees also adopted a Senate change to ban R&D of low-yield nuclear weapons. H.R. 1588 repeals the ban on R&D of low-yield nuclear weapons but requires specific congressional authorization for further development. Funding for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator was reduced to $7.5 million, while the Advanced Concepts Initiative received $6 million. The bill also maintains higher levels of imminent danger pay and family separation allowance for service members. The FY2004 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-87) was signed into law on September 30, 2003, resolving funding level differences. Conferees passed the bill on September 23 and 24 after a hiatus caused by Hurricane Isabel. Full committee markups for H.R.2658 and S. 1382 were completed in June and July 2003, with major changes to the Administration's request shown in Table 2. The FY2004 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-87) was signed into law on September 30, 2003, after major changes to the Administration's request were made. The House version of the FY2004 DOD appropriations act allocated $2.0 billion to O&M appropriations and $2 billion as a rescission to the Iraq Freedom Fund for later costs of the war and occupation in the FY2003 supplemental. The FY2004 DOD Appropriations Act included reductions from general provisions, with $3.2 billion rescinded from the Iraq Freedom Fund for war costs. The Iraq Freedom Fund is a flexible account for war expenses. Total funding differences between the House and Senate bills were due to rounding. Funding restrictions were placed on the Total Information Awareness R&D Program. The Total Information Awareness program, now called Terrorism Information Awareness, was previously overseen by retired Admiral Poindexter at DARPA. Some components were transferred to classified venues with restricted information sharing on U.S. citizens. Funding details are classified, but less controversial components like language translation remain at DARPA. This compromise agreement allowed for continued research under safeguards, balancing Senate restrictions on controversial R&D funding with the Administration's objections. The TIA program faced a funding cutoff, with restrictions on deployment similar to previous legislation. DARPA avoided funding cutoff by submitting a required report. Admiral Poindexter resigned due to controversy over the FutureMAP component. The TIA program, which made predictions about potential terrorist events, was cancelled due to public and congressional concerns. The FY2004 military construction appropriations bill faced delays and controversy over funding for overseas bases in Europe and Korea. An eight-member congressional commission was established to review overseas base structure and report back to Congress by December 31, 2004. The Administration planned substantial changes in overseas bases to \"reduce.\" The Administration proposed substantial changes in overseas bases to \"reduce the footprint\" of the U.S. military overseas. The FY2004 budget request included $399.7 billion for national defense, an increase from FY2003. This does not include the $62.6 billion in supplemental defense appropriations approved for the Iraq war and other costs in FY2003. The FY2004 defense budget request is over $100 billion higher than in FY1999, representing a 20% increase over five years in inflation-adjusted dollars. The Administration plans to continue annual increases of about $20 billion, aiming to reach $480 billion by FY2008. The FY2004 defense budget request is $399.7 billion, with $370.6 billion for defense programs, $9.0 billion for military construction, $17.3 billion for Department of Energy defense activities, and $2.8 billion for other appropriations. The FY2004 defense budget request is $399.7 billion, with $370.6 billion for defense programs. The FY2004 congressional budget resolution endorses the Administration's proposed growth of $20 billion annually for defense over the next five years. Defense would grow by about $10 billion annually over the following five years. The chief issue in this year's budget resolution was the amount to be provided for tax cuts. The FY2004 budget resolution projects significant increases in spending on entitlement programs, with a 40% increase by FY2008 and an 80% increase by FY2013. Congressional support for defense budget increases has been questioned due to high federal budget deficits and costs associated with the retirement of the baby boom generation. The FY2004 budget resolution projects a five-year total for defense spending of $2.2 trillion, with House and Senate differences leading to a compromise of $4.758 trillion through FY2013. The budget resolution also removed two Senate provisions related to funding for the war in Iraq. The Senate bill included funding for the war in Iraq and phased in concurrent receipt benefits for military retirees with disabilities. The FY2004 budget did not include funding for occupation costs in Iraq or continued presence in Afghanistan. The Senate version also proposed allowing military retirees with disabilities of 60% or higher to receive both military retired pay and VA disability benefits. The FY2003 DOD Authorization Act considered but rejected a proposal to allow military retirees with disabilities to receive both military retired pay and Veterans Administration benefits. Congress provided special compensation for combat-related disabilities instead. The budget resolution did not allocate funds for expanding benefits for military retirees with disabilities. The cost estimate by the CBO for DOD's request was $400.5 billion, $800 million higher than the Administration's estimate. The difference in estimates was mainly due to a new account proposal costing $675 million according to the CBO. The DOD proposed a new account for Refined Petroleum Products transfer costing $675 million to cover fuel cost differences. CBO estimates fuel prices higher than DOD, leading to the likely cost of the new account. Congress is unlikely to agree to set up the new account as neither the House nor the Senate version of the FY2004 DOD Authorization Act includes funds for it. The FY2004 DOD Authorization Act does not include funds for a proposed new account for Refined Petroleum Products transfer costing $675 million. Both the House and Senate rejected DOD's proposal and transferred the funds to other programs. The outcome of decisions on fund distribution to appropriations subcommittees may indicate future budget pressure on DOD. The annual congressional budget resolution sets discretionary spending amounts, with appropriations committees having discretion to allocate funds. The conference agreement allocates $784.7 billion in discretionary budget authority. The budget resolution allocates $784.7 billion in discretionary budget authority to appropriations committees. Committee leaders negotiated across both houses and with the White House to establish a common framework for subcommittee allocations. On June 11, an agreed package was announced to address a funding gap while staying within the FY2004 discretionary budget cap. Defense spending was reduced as part of the approved plan. The appropriations committees reduced defense spending by $3.1 billion and moved $2.2 billion in FY2004 advance appropriations to FY2003. Long-term trends in the defense budget are difficult to assess due to the impact of supplemental funding received since September 11, 2001. Comparisons are challenging, especially for operation and maintenance spending. Administration Request: National Defense Budget Function by Title, FY2001-FY2008 (in billions of dollars) Source: Office of Management and Budget, Budget of the U.S. Government, FY2004: Historical Tables and Budget of the U.S. Government, FY2004: Analytical Perspectives (February 2003), and H.Rept. 108-10, conference report on FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations. In FY2003, DOD received supplemental appropriations totaling $31.3 billion, including $17.3 billion for emergency terrorism response and $14.0 billion. An additional $10 billion was provided for classified intelligence programs and costs related to the U.S. presence in Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. The $62.6 billion received in FY2003 supplemental appropriations is not included in the figures. DOD's procurement funding remained relatively unchanged in FY2004, while an increase in RDT&E funding was mainly attributed to a rise in the missile defense program budget from $7.6 billion to $9.1 billion. DOD's missile defense program funding increased to $9.1 billion, with plans for deployment of interceptors and R&D ramp-up. Since September 11 attacks, DOD received $103.3 billion for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, security enhancements, and global terrorism. FY2003 saw $10 billion for intelligence programs and war costs. Administration did not budget for FY2004, hinting at a supplemental or amendment. DOD received $10 billion in FY2003 for Afghanistan occupation and intelligence programs. Requests for supplemental funding emphasized flexibility in fund use due to war cost uncertainty. Congress provided requested amounts but resisted DOD's flexibility requests. Congress rejected DOD's request for 95% funding flexibility in the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental. Instead, they allocated 45% of the $40 billion in flexible accounts. DOD received $17.3 billion in the Defense Emergency Response Fund, with discretion to allocate funds as long as Congress was informed. Congress set spending levels in ten categories for the remainder of the funds in the FY2002 supplemental. In the FY2003 supplemental, DOD requested 95% funding in the Defense Emergency Response Fund for flexibility, but Congress set up different arrangements. In response to DOD's request for funding flexibility, Congress rejected 95% flexibility in the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental. Instead, they allocated 45% of the funds to flexible accounts. DOD received $17.3 billion in the Defense Emergency Response Fund with discretion to allocate funds, while Congress set spending levels for the remainder of the funds in the FY2002 supplemental. In the FY2003 supplemental, DOD's request for 95% funding flexibility was not granted, and a new fund, the Iraq Freedom Fund, was set up with specific requirements for fund allocation. The Administration's FY2004 request emphasized flexibility in transforming military doctrine, technology, personnel systems, and defense acquisition practices. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld highlighted the need for agility in both armed forces and support personnel to adapt to security challenges, including the global war on terrorism. A legislative proposal titled the \"Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act\" was presented to Congress, granting the Secretary of Defense authority to redesign military operations. The legislative proposal aimed to redesign the civil service system for 700,000 civilian employees in the Department of Defense, provide flexibility for managing senior military officers, modify acquisition requirements, and exempt DOD from certain environmental statutes. Some members of Congress were concerned about the ambitious proposal being presented shortly before the defense authorization bill markup. DOD had discussed the proposal earlier in the year but specific details were not available until April 10. The Administration's proposal aimed to transform weapons modernization and operational practices in the Department of Defense. The FY2004 budget reflected President Bush's commitment to challenge the status quo and balance current challenges with the need for long-term transformation. DOD emphasized unmanned vehicles, precision guided munitions, special operations forces, and missile defense. Transformation efforts included the establishment of NORTHCOM for homeland security and changes in training practices for joint operations. DOD's proposals for military pay raises, benefits, and operational training aim to maintain recruitment, retention, and readiness goals. Long-term plans include reviewing basing strategies in Europe and reserve forces. Congressional debates focus on DOD's authority over its civilian workforce, exemptions from environmental laws, investment priorities, and base closure criteria for FY2005. Various organizational and transformational issues are also being discussed. DOD's legislative package includes provisions to increase flexibility in contracting for defense systems and IT programs, waivers from Buy America requirements, and outsourcing firefighting and security services. Congress has opposed privatizing security guards and expanding the definition of in-house work. The DOD proposed organizational and financial changes to increase flexibility, including giving the Secretary of Defense discretion to reorganize, transferring personnel, and raising the limit on transfers between appropriation accounts. They also suggested changing the standard for awarding contracts to government entities based on A-76 competitive sourcing rules. The DOD proposed transferring civilian personnel performing security investigations to OPM and eliminating 184 reports to Congress. They also requested permanent authority to allocate $200 million to support foreign militaries without congressional oversight. In the FY2003 supplemental, Congress required DOD to report by July 1, 2003 on its plan to allocate funding for coalition forces. The Defense Department's ability to afford major weapons modernization programs, especially with new programs planned for full-scale production, is a perennial issue. The commitment to defense transformation has further complicated this issue, with efforts to accelerate programs and introduce new ones. Governor Bush previously proposed skipping a generation of weapons programs to prioritize transformational priorities. The Defense Department has been making efforts in this direction in recent years. In the FY2004 budget, the Defense Department allocated $24.3 billion for modernization programs considered transformational, totaling $239 billion over the FY2004-FY2009 period. To fund these programs, DOD cut $82 billion from service budgets, including terminating Army programs, retiring Navy ships and aircraft, reducing Navy personnel, retiring Air Force fighter and tanker aircraft, and implementing efficiencies. Final conference action on these cuts will be addressed later. In the FY2004 budget, the Defense Department requested $74.4 billion for weapons procurement and $61.8 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E). The Army has been pursuing upgrades to the current force, deploying an interim force with Stryker wheeled vehicles, and developing the Objective Force with the Future Combat System. Additionally, the Army is continuing to develop the Comanche helicopter. The Army has been developing the Comanche helicopter and facing cuts in planned upgrades for legacy systems like the M1 and Bradley. Congress added $727 million to the budget for M1 and Bradley upgrades in response to the Army's success in the Iraq war. Legacy force modernization is a key issue addressed in the House authorization bill. The House authorization bill adds funding for Bradley Fighting Vehicle and M1 tank upgrades, despite the Administration's plan to terminate these programs for budget savings. The House appropriators also urged DOD to continue upgrading M1 tanks to equip the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. The House rejected DOD's plans to cut back on Army \"legacy force\" upgrades. The House appropriations added funding for Stryker armored vehicle procurement to equip the 5th and 6th Stryker brigades, urging DOD to fill out the planned six-brigade force. The Senate Appropriations Committee also allocated funds for Stryker procurement and other Army equipment to accelerate brigade deployment. Additionally, all committees included funding for UH-60 utility helicopters, mainly for the National Guard. The committees added money for UH-60 utility helicopters, particularly for the National Guard, with some differences in allocation. They also supported the continued development of the Comanche helicopter despite cost increases and program cuts. The FY2004 Navy budget includes funding for key ship-acquisition programs such as the Virginia class submarine, Littoral Combat Ship, Arleigh Burke class destroyer, DD(X) next-generation destroyer, San Antonio class amphibious ship, Trident cruise-missile submarine conversion, and Aegis cruiser conversion. Congressional hearings focus on the planned size and structure of the Navy, with the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review revalidating a 310-ship Navy plan. The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review revalidated a 310-ship Navy plan, but the Department of Defense has launched studies that may change the planned number of attack submarines and amphibious ships, indicating a potential shift away from the 310-ship goal. The Secretary of Defense has also declined to endorse a plan for a 375-ship fleet. The Secretary of Defense has declined to endorse a plan for a 375-ship fleet, causing uncertainty about the planned size and structure of the Navy. The 310-ship plan includes 116 surface combatants, while the 375-ship plan includes 160 surface combatants, including smaller Littoral Combat Ships. Congressional action is being taken on major Navy programs. In Senate and House markup, action was taken on major Navy programs. The new carrier development program was supported by all congressional defense committees, with a projected cost of almost $12 billion. The House Appropriations Committee denied funds for a multi-year procurement contract for Virginia-Class Attack Submarines. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved multi-year procurement of Virginia-Class submarines, but only for 5 boats over the FY2004-FY2009 planning period rather than the 7 boats that the Navy had requested. The Navy announced an agreement with contractors for a multi-year procurement deal for 7 boats, with an option to reduce procurement to 5 or 6 boats with some increase in costs per ship. The Senate Armed Services Committee added funds for attack submarine refueling overhauls, while the House defense committees did not allocate any funds for this purpose. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) development program, citing issues with Navy cost estimates and program priorities. They added $35 million for experimentation. The House committees also allocated funds for module design. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated funds for module design and advance procurement for the LPD-23 ship, with the Senate adding $75 million for the LPD-23."
