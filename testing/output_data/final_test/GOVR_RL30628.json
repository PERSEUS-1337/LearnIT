    "content": "The Senate approved the conference report on the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill, allowing the export of food and medicine to Cuba and other sanctioned countries. No U.S. assistance or financing is permitted for sales to Cuba, which must be paid for in advance or through third-country financing. The bill also prohibits the importation of merchandise from Cuba and travel for tourism to Cuba. Cuba experienced severe economic deterioration from 1989-1993 due to the cutoff of assistance from the former Soviet Union. Despite some improvement since 1994, estimates of economic decline in the 1989-93 period range from 35-50%. The economy grew 0.7% in 1994, 2.5% in 1995, and 7.8% in 1996, but only 2.5% in 1997 largely due to disappointing sugar production. President Clinton waived compensatory damages for certain claims against Cuba in the interest of national security in 2000. In 1998, Cuba's economy grew by just 1.2% due to poor sugar harvest, drought, and Hurricane Georges. However, in 1999, the economy grew by 6.2%, with a projected growth rate of 5% for 2000. Despite economic decline, Cuba has high literacy rates, life expectancy, and low infant mortality compared to other developing countries. Cuba's economic decline since 1989 led to shortages in medicines and medical supplies. In response, the government implemented market-oriented reforms in 1993, allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars, engage in self-employment, and reform agricultural practices. These changes aimed to improve living standards amidst the economic challenges. In the 1990s, Cuba implemented market-oriented reforms to improve living standards, including allowing the sale of produce on the open market, establishing artisan markets, legalizing private food catering, approving a new foreign investment law, and creating free trade zones. Despite these measures, many Cubans still face difficulties such as low wages, high prices, shortages of medicines, and power outages. Some analysts fear that the Cuban government is backtracking on reform efforts, with regulations and new taxes making it difficult for self-employed individuals. Foreign investors have also complained about deals being canceled or businesses being forced to close. Despite limited economic reforms, Cuba remains a hard-line Communist state under the rule of Fidel Castro since the 1959 revolution. Fidel Castro consolidated power in Cuba, proclaiming the Cuban Revolution as socialist and himself as a Marxist-Leninist. He ruled by decree from 1959 to 1976, with the Communist Party as the leading force. The constitution established governmental structures with executive power in a Council of Ministers led by Castro. The National Assembly of People's Power, with 601 members, holds legislative authority, but elections offer limited choices. In January 1998, the Cuban Communist Party reaffirmed its commitment to a single-party state and reelected Fidel and Raul Castro as the party's first and second secretaries. Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in January 1998, criticizing the U.S. embargo as unjust and the Cuban government for denying freedom to the Cuban people. He also asked for the release of prisoners. The Vatican officials gave Cuba a list of over 200 prisoners of conscience, leading to the release of dozens of detainees on February 12, 1998. Despite speculation on the impact of the Pope's visit to Cuba, it did not result in unrest or political changes. However, the visit could potentially elevate the Catholic Church's profile in Cuba's civil society, improving its ability to influence government policies. Cuba's poor human rights record includes severe restrictions on basic rights. Cuba has a poor record on human rights, with the government sharply restricting basic rights such as freedom of expression and assembly. They have cracked down on dissent, arrested activists and journalists, and continue to target critics. Estimates suggest there are between 350 and 400 political prisoners in Cuba, with the number likely increasing in 1999. In 1999, the number of political prisoners in Cuba likely increased slightly compared to the previous year. Human Rights Watch issued a critical report on Cuba's repressive machinery, highlighting severe restrictions on fundamental human rights. Cuba has implemented new repressive laws, continued prosecuting dissidents, and released political prisoners sporadically to appease international visitors. The State Department reported deteriorating human rights situation in Cuba in 1999, with authorities harassing and imprisoning human rights advocates. Political repression increased from November 1999 to February 2000, but Cuba released three prominent dissidents in May 2000. Three leaders of the \"Dissident Working Group\" were imprisoned in July 1997 and convicted of \"sedition\" in March 1999. Sentences ranged from 3 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd years to 5 years. Before their trial, human rights advocates and activists were detained. The dissidents had criticized the Cuban Communist Party in a document released in June 1997. The Cuban dissidents urged a boycott of legislative elections and foreign investment in Cuba. The UNCHR called on Cuba to cooperate with a Special Rapporteur to investigate human rights but Cuba refused. In 1998, the UNCHR rejected a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights record. Observers criticized the UNCHR vote on Cuba, expressing disappointment and noting it did not indicate human rights improvement. The resolutions in 1999 and 2000 were approved with close votes and abstentions. There is uncertainty about the future of the Castro government, with differing opinions on potential scenarios for its end. Some predict Castro's resignation due to age, while others believe the Cuban government will remain stable. The elite supports Castro, and there are doubts about a stable democratic Cuba post-Castro. The Castro government has impeded the development of independent civil society in Cuba, making the task of building a democratic Cuba formidable. U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated in the early 1960s due to Castro's communist dictatorship and close ties with the Soviet Union, leading to events like the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved isolating the island nation through economic sanctions. This policy was continued by the Clinton Administration, with comprehensive sanctions strengthened by the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The relationship between the two countries has been strained by events such as the Cuban missile crisis and the shootdown of U.S. civilian planes by Cuban fighter jets in 1996. The Helms/Burton legislation, enacted in response to Cuba shooting down U.S. planes in 1996, imposes trade restrictions and holds those trafficking in confiscated U.S. property liable for damages. President Clinton has suspended the implementation of certain provisions, while also supporting measures for the Cuban people. The U.S. policy towards Cuba includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as humanitarian donations, democracy-building efforts, and radio and TV broadcasting. After the Pope's visit in 1998, President Clinton announced the resumption of humanitarian charter flights and cash remittances to support relatives in Cuba. President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including broadening cash remittances to Cuba for all U.S. residents to send $300 per quarter to any Cuban family, streamlining licensing procedures for medical supplies, and working with Congress on food transfers to Cuba. These actions aimed to build on the impact of the Pope's visit, support civil society in Cuba, and prepare for a democratic transition. President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including broadening cash remittances to Cuba for all U.S. residents to send $300 per quarter to any Cuban family, streamlining licensing procedures for medical supplies, and working with Congress on food transfers to Cuba. Additionally, there were plans to expand direct passenger charter flights to Cuba from more U.S. cities, re-establish direct mail service to Cuba, authorize the commercial sale of food to independent entities, and increase people-to-people contact through exchanges among academics, athletes, and scientists. Some U.S. policymakers have different approaches to U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government while others support constructive engagement and normalization of relations by lifting the embargo. Advocates for loosening sanctions argue that increased travel and trade could lead to positive changes in Cuba. Advocates for a more moderate approach towards Cuba believe that increased travel, trade, and diplomatic dialogue could lead to positive changes on the island, preventing violent upheaval and potential civil war scenarios. They argue for lifting the U.S. embargo, citing international support, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering for the Cuban people. They emphasize the need for the United States to adopt a more realistic strategy in inducing change in Cuba. Opponents of changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue that maintaining the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while reaching out to the Cuban people is the best approach for promoting political change. They believe that softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms would only benefit the Castro regime, enabling the survival of the Communist regime. They stress the importance of staying committed to democracy and human rights in Cuba. The United States should maintain its commitment to democracy and human rights in Cuba through sustained sanctions, as opponents argue that Cuba's economic policies, not the U.S. embargo, are to blame for the economy's decline. Legislative measures in the 106th Congress reflect varying views on U.S. policy towards Cuba, including easing restrictions on exports and travel, as well as increasing sanctions by conditioning aid to Russia on closing the Russian signals intelligence facility in Cuba. In the 106th Congress, initiatives were introduced to enforce anti-terrorism judgments in U.S. courts, including a $187.6 million judgment against Cuba for shooting down two U.S. planes in 1996. Other issues addressed included Cuba's human rights situation, cooperation on drug trafficking, and the Elian Gonzalez immigration case. In 1996, Cuban Mig-29 fighter jets shot down two Cessna 337s in the Florida Straits, resulting in the death of four members of the Cuban American group Brothers to the Rescue. In 1996, Cuban Mig-29 fighter jets shot down two U.S. planes, resulting in the death of four members of the Cuban American group Brothers to the Rescue. President Clinton authorized compensation for the victims' families from frozen Cuban assets. A federal judge later awarded $187.6 million to three victims' families, but Cuba refused to recognize the court's jurisdiction. U.S. citizens are trying to collect the judgment from Cuba through proceeds from U.S. telephone companies. On March 18, 1999, a federal judge awarded $6.2 million to the families of victims from U.S. telephone companies. However, a federal appeals court later ruled that the families could not collect the money due to the Cuban telephone company, ETECSA, being separate from the Cuban government. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure could have affected the payment from Cuba's frozen assets in the United States, stating that foreign states are not immune from U.S. judgments for violations of international law. The provision in Section 118 of the Senate-approved version of H.R. 2490, the FY2000 Treasury Appropriations bill, aimed to limit the President's ability to prevent frozen assets from being seized. This provision was later introduced as a standalone bill, S. 1796, on October 26, 1999, to amend the enforcement of certain anti-terrorism measures. The Clinton Administration opposed this provision, arguing that it would undermine the President's authority to use assets of countries under economic sanctions as leverage. S. 1796, introduced on October 26, 1999, would amend the enforcement of anti-terrorism judgments in U.S. courts against state sponsors of terrorism, removing the presidential waiver for national security interests. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported the bill on March 9, 2000, and an identical House bill, H.R. 3485, was introduced on November 18, 1999. The House approved H.R. 3485 on July 25, 2000, and it was received in the Senate on July 26, 2000. The Clinton Administration proposed a $50 million settlement with families of shootdown victims, using frozen Cuban assets. The victims' families rejected the deal, seeking punitive damages. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 directed compensatory damages for claims against Cuba and Iran, but President Clinton waived payments for national security reasons. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, P.L. 104-114, signed into law in 2000, contains provisions codifying existing Cuban embargo regulations and allowing U.S. nationals to sue for damages related to confiscated property in Cuba. The President has the authority to delay implementation for six months. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, P.L. 104-114, signed into law in 2000, allows U.S. nationals to sue for damages related to confiscated property in Cuba. The President can delay implementation for six months at a time if it is in the national interest. Title IV of the law denies admission to the U.S. for aliens involved in the confiscation or trafficking of U.S. property in Cuba, with limited waivers for humanitarian or legal reasons. President Clinton has suspended the right to file lawsuits against those benefitting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba under Title III. Liability for trafficking under this title became effective on November 1, 1996, putting foreign companies in Cuba on notice of potential lawsuits and liability in the U.S. The President continued to suspend the right to file lawsuits as long as efforts to promote democracy in Cuba continued. The President has suspended the right to file Title III lawsuits against those benefitting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba to promote democracy. The State Department has banned executives from companies like Grupos Domos, Sherritt International, and BM Group for their investment in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. Executives of STET avoided action by paying ITT Corporation $25 million for the use of ITT-claimed property in Cuba. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure included a provision requiring the Administration to report on the implementation of the Helms/Burton legislation. The State Department is investigating Sol Melia for investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. U.S. allies have criticized the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act for its extraterritorial application of U.S. law. The EU and U.S. reached an understanding in April 1997 to promote democracy in Cuba and develop investment protection principles. The EU suspended its WTO dispute settlement case and let it expire in April 1998. Talks on investment between the U.S. and EU continued. After difficult talks on investment disciplines, the EU and U.S. reached a second understanding in May 1998. The agreement focused on EU disciplines for investment in expropriated properties globally, in exchange for the U.S. obtaining a waiver from Congress for Title IV visa restrictions. Future investment in expropriated property would be prohibited, and support for past illegal expropriations would be denied. A Registry of Claims would be established to alert investors and government agencies of properties with claims. Some Members of Congress have mixed reactions to the EU-U.S. accord on investment disciplines. Representative Gilman and Senator Helms criticized the understanding for not covering companies already invested in expropriated property. They argue that the proposed weak sanction may not deter companies willing to invest in Cuba. However, other Members support the understanding, stating that it increases protection for Americans' property worldwide and discourages investment in illegally confiscated property in Cuba. The EU-U.S. accord on investment disciplines is criticized by some Members of Congress for not covering companies already invested in expropriated property. However, others support it for increasing protection of Americans' property worldwide and discouraging investment in illegally confiscated property in Cuba. Another potential challenge in the WTO involves a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi over the Havana Club rum trademark. US law prohibits accepting payment for trademarks used in connection with confiscated assets in Cuba without the original owner's consent. Pernod Ricard is in a legal battle with Bacardi over the Havana Club rum trademark in the United States. Despite the trade embargo, Pernod Ricard aims to protect its distribution rights for the future. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled against Pernod Ricard's joint venture, leading them to consider appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. EU-U.S. consultations in 1999 did not resolve the issue, with the EU proposing a prospective law change that the U.S. has not responded to. In July 2000, the EU requested a WTO dispute resolution panel. In July 2000, the EU requested a WTO dispute resolution panel to consider the trademark issue, which the United States blocked. The Clinton Administration did not support the trademark provision in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill, citing violations of TRIPS Agreement. Despite this, no changes were made to the provision. The U.S. sanctions regime has allowed the sale of food and medical exports with restrictions. The agricultural appropriations bill for FY2001 broadens what can be sold and to whom, but maintains restrictions on U.S. financing and limits licenses to one year. President Clinton announced streamlined licensing procedures for commercial sale of medicines and medical supplies to Cuba in 1998. President Clinton also authorized commercial food sales in 1999. In May 1998, President Clinton authorized commercial food sales in Cuba. In 1999, regulations were issued for sales to independent entities like religious groups, private farmers, and restaurants. Despite hopes to support Cuba's private sector, actual food sales have been minimal. U.S. agribusiness companies are still exploring the Cuban market for potential sales, but financing for the sales remains a challenge. Cuba expressed interest in buying U.S. agricultural exports but refuses to purchase U.S. food without financing. Cuba is interested in buying U.S. agricultural exports but refuses to purchase U.S. food under financing restrictions. Opponents argue against easing restrictions, stating that U.S. policy allows medical sales to Cuba and humanitarian donations have been made. They believe easing pressure on Cuba would support the Castro regime. Supporters advocate for easing restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba. Supporters of easing restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba argue that the licensing procedures for medical exports are overly complex, hindering the Cuban population's health and nutrition. They believe the embargo benefits Castro by providing a scapegoat for his failed economic policies and political repression. Additionally, they argue that the embargo complicates relations with allies who have a more constructive engagement approach towards Cuba. U.S. agribusiness companies support the removal of trade restrictions. U.S. agribusiness companies advocate for the removal of trade restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, citing a potential market worth $700 million. In the 106th Congress, a modified Ashcroft amendment was approved, allowing agricultural and medical exports to Cuba under one-year licenses issued by the U.S. government, without federal financing or export assistance. In the 106th Congress, efforts were made to pass the Ashcroft amendment, which was modified to restrict exports to sponsors of international terrorism. The Senate approved S. 1233 and included the amendment as subsection 748 (k) in H.R. 1906. However, the House version of the bill did not include this provision, and it was ultimately dropped from the conference report due to disagreements among Senators. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee included a provision in the FY2001 foreign aid authorization bill to lift restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba. The bill would allow licensed exports of these goods to countries classified as state sponsors of international terrorism, including Cuba. Medical exports to Cuba and other countries would be allowed through one-year licenses issued by the U.S. government. The Senate and House versions of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill included provisions to permit U.S. food and medical exports to Cuba. The Senate approved the provision through an amendment by Senator Byron Dorgan, while the House approved a similar amendment by Representative George Nethercutt. The House Appropriations Committee defeated an attempt to lift restrictions on U.S. food and medical exports to Cuba. A compromise agreement was reached allowing exports through one-year licenses, but without U.S. government or private financing. Travel to Cuba for tourist activities is prohibited under the agreement. The House Appropriations Committee reached a compromise agreement on U.S. food and medical exports to Cuba, allowing exports through one-year licenses without financing. Restrictions on tourist activities in Cuba were also maintained. Critics argued that the restrictions would make sales practically impossible and tighten regulations on non-tourist travel. Representative Diaz-Balart deleted a provision on food and medical exports during the House debate on H.R. 4461. The Senate-passed provision was less restrictive than the House compromise agreement. Representative Rangel proposed an amendment to ease trade restrictions. In the final version of the FY2001 Agriculture appropriations bill, the sale of agricultural and medical products to Cuba is allowed, but U.S. financing is prohibited. The bill also prohibits imports from Cuba and travel for tourism to Cuba. An amendment was approved to prohibit any funds from being used to implement U.S. sanctions on private commercial sales of agricultural commodities or medicine to Cuba. The FY2001 Treasury Department appropriations bill, H.R. 4985, initially allowed the sale of agricultural and medical products to Cuba but the language was removed in a new version. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a key component of U.S. efforts to isolate the communist government of Fidel Castro. There have been changes to these restrictions over the years, including a period from 1977 to 1982 with no restrictions. Despite attempts to end the restrictions in 1999, they remained in place. The introduction of freestanding legislation in both the Senate and House, along with a Sanford amendment prohibiting funds for enforcing Cuban travel regulations, marked a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba. However, the language of the amendment was later removed from the FY2001 Treasury Department appropriations bill. The final version of the appropriations bill on Cuba travel states that licensed U.S. travel to Cuba cannot include tourist activities and imposes tighter restrictions on non-tourist travel. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include influencing conditions in Cuba, abridging the rights of Americans, and the ability to travel to other countries with authoritarian governments. Arguments against lifting the ban include supporting Castro's rule financially, existing legal provisions for humanitarian travel to Cuba, and the President's authority to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. Cuba's geographic location allows drug traffickers to use its waters and airspace to transit drugs to the United States. Cuban officials are concerned about this and have made efforts to combat the drug problem, including legislation to stiffen penalties for traffickers. The United States cooperates with Cuba on anti-drug efforts on a case-by-case basis, with ongoing efforts to make bilateral cooperation more systematic. On June 21, 1999, U.S. and Cuban officials met in Havana to discuss improving anti-drug cooperation. Cuba accepted upgrading the telex link with the U.S. Coast Guard and stationing a U.S. Coast Guard officer in Havana. Cuba has shown willingness to help but lacks resources. Some call for closer U.S.-Cuban anti-drug cooperation, while others oppose it and want Cuba added to the list of major drug-producing countries. The Cuban government is suspected of involvement in the drug trade, but the State Department has no recent evidence of high-level corruption. Legislation requires a report on drug trafficking through Cuba since 1990. Despite objections from some Members of Congress, Cuba was not added to the list of major drug transit countries in 1999. During a hearing in November 1999, Congress objected to Cuba's exclusion from the list of major drug transit countries. In June 2000, an amendment for funding cooperation with Cuba in drug interdiction was approved by the Senate but later omitted from the final bill. Concerns have been raised about the Russian signals intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba, which monitors U.S. communications. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act in the 104th Congress reduces U.S. assistance for Russia related to intelligence facilities in Cuba, with exceptions and a presidential waiver provision. In the 106th Congress, H.R. 4118 aimed to prohibit rescheduling or forgiving bilateral debt owed to the United States by Russia. The bill aimed to prohibit rescheduling or forgiving any outstanding bilateral debt owed to the United States by Russia until Russia closed the intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. It also required the President to oppose debt rescheduling or forgiveness at the Paris Club of official creditors. The bill aims to prohibit debt forgiveness for Russia until they close the intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. Critics argue the facility invades privacy and props up the Castro government financially. The Clinton Administration opposes the bill, fearing it could undermine U.S. leadership in engagement with Russia and Paris Club negotiations. Senator John Warner and others support the bill. In mid-October 1998, Senator John Warner and 14 other senators called for a \"National Bipartisan Commission on Cuba\" to analyze U.S. policy towards Cuba. The senators recommended a bipartisan group of experienced Americans to be part of the commission. However, the Clinton Administration decided not to establish the commission in January 1999. A year and a half later, Senator Christopher Dodd proposed a bipartisan commission on Cuba during consideration of the FY2001 defense authorization bill. The Senate voted 59-41 to table the amendment, with Senator Warner not supporting it to avoid hindering the bill's passage. Supporters argued that the commission would offer new ideas for the next administration and that there was a double standard in U.S. policy towards Cuba compared to other nations. U.S. policy towards Cuba contrasts with engagement towards China, Vietnam, and North Korea. Opponents of a proposed commission argued it would interfere with setting Cuba policy, and change should wait for political change in Cuba. Controversies surround U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, with funding cuts attempted due to low viewership caused by Cuban jamming efforts. TV Marti broadcasts daily from 3:30 am to 8:00 am. For FY2000 and FY2001, the Administration requested funding for broadcasting to Cuba, with allocations for Radio Marti and TV Marti. The omnibus appropriations measure appropriated funds for Cuba broadcasting, with authorization for each fiscal year. The House and Senate versions of the FY2001 appropriations bill allocated funds for broadcasting to Cuba, including $650,000 for a transmitter for Radio Marti. The final bill, signed into law in December 2000, provided $22.095 million for radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. The FY2001 appropriations bill, signed into law in December 2000, allocated $22.095 million for radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. In response to the threat of another Mariel boatlift, U.S. officials changed migration policy in 1994, taking rescued Cubans to Guantanamo Bay instead of allowing them into the United States. Despite the policy change, Cubans continued to flee in large numbers. In September 1994, Cuba and the United States reached an agreement to control the flow of Cuban migrants to the U.S. The agreement aimed to ensure safe and orderly migration, with the U.S. committing to accept a minimum of 20,000 legal Cuban migrants annually. The U.S. also stopped granting parole to all Cuban migrants reaching its shores, while Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures. In May 1995, an additional agreement was reached for the U.S. to parole over 30,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo into the country. The United States and Cuba reached an agreement in 1995 to parole over 30,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo into the United States, while intercepting future Cuban migrants at sea and returning them to Cuba. The last of the 32,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo left in January 1996. Periodic talks have been held to implement the migration accords, with the U.S. Coast Guard intercepting over 3,500 Cubans at sea since then. Tensions escalated in South Florida after the U.S. Coast Guard used force to prevent six Cubans from reaching Surfside beach. President Clinton condemned the incident as \"outrageous.\" Another tragic event occurred when a boat capsized, resulting in the drowning of a Cuban woman. The State Department expressed regret and promised investigations. The Department of Justice and Immigration and Naturalization Service are investigating possible alien smuggling cases in Cuba. Cuba has strict penalties for alien smuggling, with potential prison sentences of up to three years or life for incidents involving death or violence. 30 U.S. residents are detained in Cuba on aliensmuggling charges, with Cuba offering to return them to the U.S. for trial. In late September 1999, two U.S. residents were convicted in Cuba for smuggling migrants. Additionally, a 5-year-old boy named Elian Gonzalez was found clinging to an innertube off the coast of Florida after a boat carrying 13 Cubans capsized in November 1999. The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that Elian Gonzalez should be returned to his father in Cuba by January 14, 2000, citing the unique relationship between parent and child in U.S. and international law. Efforts by the boy's Miami relatives to challenge the ruling were extended by the Attorney General to accommodate federal court proceedings. A Florida judge ruled that returning the boy to Cuba could cause harm and scheduled a hearing for March 6. The judge issued a temporary protective order for the child to remain with his Miami relatives until the hearing. The Attorney General reaffirmed the INS ruling and stated that the Florida court had no jurisdiction. Attorneys for the Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit on January 19, 2000. On January 19, 2000, a federal lawsuit was filed in Miami by the boy's Miami relatives to block Elian's return to Cuba, citing violations of his constitutional rights. Despite efforts to grant him asylum, on April 22, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the forced removal of Elian from his Miami relatives' home by INS agents, reuniting him with his father at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. After being removed from his Miami relatives' home by INS agents, Elian Gonzalez was reunited with his father at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. They stayed at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland before moving to a home in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on June 1 that the INS acted lawfully in refusing to consider an asylum request for Elian Gonzalez. The Miami relatives' appeals to block Elian's return to Cuba and seek political asylum were rejected by the Supreme Court on June 28. The boy and his father returned to Cuba the same day as the Appeals Court injunction expired. Congress considered legislation for U.S. citizenship or legal residency for Elian Gonzalez. The 106th Congress debated legislation regarding the return of Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, with some members supporting congressional intervention while others believed the issue should be resolved in federal court. Fidel Castro demanded the boy's return in December 1999, leading to mass demonstrations in Cuba until his return in June 2000. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the INS's armed removal from the Miami relatives' home. The 106th Congress passed legislation related to Cuba, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113). This act allocated funds for Cuba broadcasting and included provisions for investigating violations of freedom of expression by Cuba. The 106th Congress passed legislation related to Cuba, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113) which allocated funds for Cuba broadcasting and provisions for investigating violations of freedom of expression by Cuba. P.L. 106-429 (H.R. 4811) and P.L. 106-386 (H.R. 3244) also included provisions regarding funding and assistance to Cuba, with restrictions on direct and indirect funding unless certified by the President as contrary to U.S. national interests. President Clinton waived payments for national security when signing the bill into law on October 28, 2000. S. 1796 (Lautenberg) / H.R. 3485 (McCollum) amend enforcement of anti-terrorism judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, removing the presidential waiver for national security interests except for diplomatic property protection. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported the bill on March 9, 2000, and it was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. An identical House bill, H.R. 3485 (McCollum), was introduced on November 18, 1999, and reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on July 13, 2000. The House approved H.R. 3485 on July 25, 2000, and it was received in the Senate on July 26, 2000. H.R. 181 repeals the President's authority to suspend Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. H.R. 3329 amends the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act to extradite U.S. fugitives from Cuba. H.R. 4118 / S. 2748 are also mentioned. The Russian-American Trust and Cooperation Act of 2000 prohibits debt forgiveness to Russia until the closure of the intelligence facility at Lourdes. H.R. 4118 was introduced on Mar. 29, 2000, approved by the House International Relations Committee on May 4, 2000, and passed by the House on July 19, 2000. S. 2748 is identical to the House-approved bill. Two bills, S. 1796 and H.R. 3485, aim to enforce anti-terrorism judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, including Cuba. The bills could impact a $187.6 million court judgment against Cuba for the 1996 shootdown of two U.S. civilian planes. S. 1796 was introduced on October 26, 1999, and H.R. 3485 was introduced on November 18, 1999. The House approved H.R. 3485 on July 25, 2000. The House approved H.R. 3485 on July 25, 2000; received in Senate and placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders July 26, 2000.
