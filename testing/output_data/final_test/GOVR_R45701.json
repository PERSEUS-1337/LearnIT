    "content": "Congress has tried to determine the government's spending on homeland security, facing challenges due to the lack of a clear definition and the dispersed nature of homeland security activities. The Department of Homeland Security is not solely focused on homeland security missions, and other federal agencies also have responsibilities in this area. The concept of homeland security in U.S. policy evolved over the last two decades, with a focus on responding to terrorism and other threats. After the 9/11 attacks, new approaches were established, including the creation of a presidential council and department, and the issuance of presidential directives. The concept expanded to include disasters, public health emergencies, and other events that threaten the United States. The evolution of homeland security in U.S. policy includes responding to terrorism and other threats. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate efforts involving military and civilian agencies at all levels of government. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002 from components of 22 government agencies. It officially began operations in 2003 and has undergone restructurings to improve effectiveness. Some functions remain in original agencies, and not all DHS missions are strictly related to homeland security. Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 required the President's annual budget request to include an analysis of homeland security funding across the federal government. From FY2003 to FY2017, the U.S. government directed roughly $878 billion to preventing terrorist attacks, protecting critical infrastructure, and responding to incidents. Annual budget authority peaked at almost $74 billion in FY2009. The homeland security budget authority increased from $41 billion in FY2003 to almost $74 billion in FY2009. Annual budget authority for homeland security agencies ranged between $66 billion and $73 billion. The DHS budget rose from $31.2 billion in FY2003 to almost $68.4 billion in FY2017. The Trump Administration requested nearly $75 billion for DHS in FY2019, including funds for major disasters and additional funding for the Coast Guard. The FY2019 DHS annual appropriations act included almost $56 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, with $12 billion for major disasters and $165 million for Coast Guard OCO funding. The current budget environment may pose challenges for homeland security programs and DHS due to ongoing capital investment efforts like the proposed border wall. Funding demands for capital investment, border security, and cybersecurity within DHS may compete for limited government funding. The Intelligence Community has improved integration and support for homeland security post-9/11, addressing barriers between intelligence and law enforcement for more effective coordination against threats. The 9/11 Commission identified barriers to information sharing that degraded U.S. national security. Legislation like the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to enhance information sharing and coordination in the government to combat terrorist threats. The National Counterterrorism Center and the Director of National Intelligence were established to improve strategic management across the Intelligence Community. New legal authorities accompanied these organizational changes. The 17 organizational elements of the IC underwent changes with new legal authorities. Initiatives at federal, state, and local levels include FBI-led JTTFs and DHS NNFC for improved collaboration. FBI/IB, DHS's OIA, and CG-2 are closely linked to homeland security within the IC. OIA combines information from various sources to analyze threats to the homeland. The OIA analytical products focus on threats like terrorism, border security, human trafficking, and public health. OIA serves customers ranging from the U.S. President to border patrol agents, Coast Guard personnel, and local first responders. The Coast Guard Intelligence (CG-2) enterprise is the intelligence component of the United States Coast Guard, providing analysis and products on maritime border security. The FBI/IB includes four component organizations: The Directorate of Intelligence oversees all FBI intelligence functions, the Office of Partner Engagement maintains intelligence sharing relationships, the Office of Private Sector conducts outreach to businesses impacted by threats, and the Bureau Intelligence Council provides a forum for senior-level dialogue on integrated security. The FBI's Bureau Intelligence Council facilitates senior-level dialogue on integrated assessments of domestic threats within the Intelligence Community. The Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC), established in 2015 under the Office of the DNI, provides all-source analysis of cyber threats to the United States, coordinating with other intelligence organizations for a unified effort in assessing and warning of cyber threats to the homeland. The importance of adhering to privacy and civil liberties protections in the Intelligence Community's efforts to assess and warn of cyber threats to the homeland has been underscored by organizational developments since 9/11. The focus has shifted from state-centric threats to nonstate actors, necessitating strict adherence to intelligence oversight rules and regulations, as well as annual training for the protection of privacy and civil liberties within the IC workforce. In the Department of Homeland Security, the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is responsible for establishing and administering these efforts. The Department of Homeland Security's Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is primarily responsible for coordinating research and development activities, including those related to nuclear and radiological threats. Other DHS components, such as the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Coast Guard, also fund R&D activities. Coordination, organization, and impact are key issues for DHS R&D in the 116th Congress. The Under Secretary for S&T and the Director of DNDO have statutory roles in coordinating homeland security R&D efforts. The Department of Homeland Security's Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is responsible for coordinating research and development activities, including nuclear detection R&D. Congressional interests in internal and external coordination have been long-standing. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted challenges in overseeing R&D department-wide in a 2012 report. In response, DHS was directed to implement new policies for R&D prioritization and review policies for defining and overseeing R&D department-wide. GAO reported in 2014 that DHS had updated its guidance for R&D but had not yet developed policy guidance for DHS-wide R&D oversight, coordination, and tracking. The Department of Homeland Security lacks a mechanism for capturing and understanding research and development activities conducted across various agencies, hindering external coordination. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directs the Under Secretary for S&T to develop a government-wide national policy and strategic plan for homeland security R&D, but no such plan has been issued. Instead, the S&T Directorate has developed R&D plans with selected individual agencies. The National Science and Technology Council has issued government-wide R&D strategies in selected areas like biosurveillance. DHS reorganized its R&D activities by establishing the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office in 2017. The 116th Congress may examine the implementation of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018. The organization of DHS laboratory facilities may also be a focus of attention in the 116th Congress. The Science and Technology Directorate in the 116th Congress acquired laboratories from various departments, including the Plum Island Animal Disease Center and the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory. The Federal Bureau of Investigation agreed to cover some operational costs of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, and there were proposals to transfer operational responsibility for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. The Science and Technology Directorate in the 116th Congress acquired laboratories from various departments, including the Plum Island Animal Disease Center and the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory. The Federal Bureau of Investigation agreed to cover some operational costs of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, and there were proposals to transfer operational responsibility for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility to the Department of Agriculture. Testimonies from Senate and House hearings have discussed the focus of the S&T Directorate on delivering timely results and balancing near-term operational impact with long-term goals. In the 116th Congress, there is a focus on examining the effectiveness and impact of DHS R&D. President Trump released a National Strategy for Counterterrorism to defeat terrorists and protect national interests. The strategy aims to counter all terrorists with the ability and intent to harm America. The National Strategy for Counterterrorism released by President Trump focuses on countering all terrorists with the ability and intent to harm the United States. It includes six primary thematic areas of focus and emphasizes the protection of American infrastructure and enhancing resilience. President Trump stated that the nation will do whatever is necessary to protect itself from terrorism. The National Strategy for Counterterrorism released on June 28, 2011, focused on global terrorist threats from Al Qaeda and its affiliates. The strategy aimed to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda to ensure the security of the United States. It identified principles guiding counterterrorism efforts and emphasized building security partnerships and resilience. President Obama quoted his speech on Osama Bin Laden's killing, emphasizing the country's intolerance towards security threats. President Obama emphasized the country's commitment to defending its citizens and allies in the wake of Osama Bin Laden's death. Security observers have compared the counterterrorism strategies of the Obama and Trump administrations, highlighting both similarities and differences. Concerns about security risks to natural gas, oil, and refined product pipelines persist, with a focus on their connection to the electric power sector and federal security programs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted new threats to the nation's pipeline systems post-9/11, including sabotage by activists and cyber attacks. The Transportation Security Administration expects pipeline companies to report around 32 security incidents annually. The Pipeline and LNG Facility Cybersecurity Preparedness Act aims to enhance coordination in pipeline security, incident response, and cybersecurity development. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted new threats to the nation's pipeline systems post-9/11, including sabotage by activists and cyber attacks. Congress and federal agencies have raised concerns about the physical security of energy pipelines, especially cross-border oil pipelines. Security concerns were heightened in 2016 after environmentalists disrupted five pipelines transporting oil from Canada. The Transportation Security Administration's Surface Security Plan identified improvised explosive devices as key risks to energy pipelines. The possibility of multiple, coordinated attacks with explosives on the natural gas pipeline system could create unprecedented challenges for restoring gas flows. Pipeline cybersecurity risks have been a growing concern since 2012, with reports of cyber intrusions and attacks on natural gas pipeline operators. In 2018, cyberattacks led to the shutdown of customer communications systems at major pipeline companies. Congressional testimony in 2019 highlighted the vulnerability of gas pipelines to cyberattacks, which could cause disruptions lasting for days to weeks. The interdependency between pipelines and technology poses significant challenges for ensuring their security. Pipeline cybersecurity concerns are heightened by the increasing reliance of the electric power sector on natural gas-fired generation, leading to security vulnerabilities in pipeline gas supplies. Reports from various sources emphasize the urgency of addressing cybersecurity threats to fuel supplies, especially natural gas and fuel oil. The head of NERC testified on the interdependency of pipeline and electric grid security. TSA administers the federal program for pipeline security but has not issued regulations, relying on industry compliance with voluntary guidelines. The pipeline industry argues against regulations, citing voluntary physical and cybersecurity programs in place. The TSA's program was criticized for staffing issues and outdated risk assessments. Collaboration between TSA, DOT's PHMSA, and DOE's CESER aims to enhance transportation security and emergency response to energy disruptions. The TSA's mission includes emergency preparedness and coordinated response to energy sector disruptions, collaborating with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security at FERC. Debate surrounds TSA's pipeline security authority, with some suggesting a need for greater resources, mandatory security standards, and potential regulatory authority shifts. Some have questioned if TSA's regulatory authority over pipeline security should be transferred to other agencies like DOE, DOT, or FERC. Concerns about information sharing and specificity of pipeline threats have also been raised. Congress has historically overseen the U.S. Secret Service due to its mission of protecting the President and investigating financial crimes. Recent challenges facing the Service include costs associated with protective detail operations and special agents' pay, which remain relevant in the current Congress. Presidential safety concerns have a long history, with various security breaches reported by the media. Recent incidents include attempted bombings targeting former President Obama, Vice President Biden, and First Lady Clinton. Security breaches at the White House and the loss of a government laptop with Trump Tower blueprints have raised questions about USSS protection costs. Presidential safety has been a concern since Abraham Lincoln's inauguration in 1861, with ten Presidents being victims of direct assassination attempts. Since the USSS began protecting Presidents in 1906, there have been seven assaults, resulting in one death (President John F. Kennedy). 18 U.S.C. Section 3056(a) authorizes USSS protection for Presidents, Vice Presidents, President- and Vice President-elect, their immediate families, former Presidents and Vice Presidents, visiting foreign heads of state, and major presidential and vice presidential candidates. The USSS is required by law to provide full-time security for protectees regardless of location or costs. Congress mandated this in 1976, extending security to the personal residences of the President and Vice President. The costs incurred during the Trump Administration, including leasing property from President Trump and frequent travel by the Trump family, have raised concerns. The USSS leased property in Trump Tower in New York City, but did not confirm or deny this. Leasing property from protectees is not new, as the USSS previously leased a structure at former Vice President Joe Biden's personal home in Delaware for security purposes. The USSS is responsible for providing security for protectees at all locations, including their personal residences. Concerns have been raised about the costs incurred during the Trump Administration, such as leasing property from President Trump and the frequent travel by his family. The security cost of presidential and immediate family travel is difficult to assess as the USSS only provides annual budget justification information on \"Protection of Persons and Facilities,\" without specific costs related to individual travel. The USSS does not disclose specific costs for protectee protection due to security concerns. Congressional oversight is needed for funding and evolving threats to USSS protectees. Recent bombing attempts on government officials may spark interest in policy issues regarding protective details. Attacks on political leaders and public figures have been a consistent security issue in the United States. Public figures, especially elected officials, are a consistent security concern in the United States. Reports show that Congress may be interested in the costs associated with funding security details for heads of departments and agencies. The Government Accountability Office found only one instance of a Cabinet Secretary being physically harmed in an assassination attempt. The Government Accountability Office reported that federal law enforcement entities have provided personal protection details to selected executive branch officials since the late 1960s. From FY1997 through FY1999, 42 officials at 31 executive branch agencies received security protection from personnel of various agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service and the US Marshals Service. The Trump Administration proposed consolidating this security under the USMS, raising issues for congressional consideration. The USSS and the State Department are the only agencies with specific statutory authority for protection. The USSS and the State Department are the only agencies with specific statutory authority to protect executive branch officials. Other agencies providing protection cited various legal authorities. The Trump Administration proposed consolidating protective details at certain civilian executive branch agencies under the USMS for more effective monitoring and response to threats. The Trump Administration proposed consolidating protective details at certain civilian executive branch agencies under the USMS to standardize protection for specified officials, with threat assessments supported by the USSS. The Trump Administration proposed consolidating protective details for certain Cabinet officials under the US Marshals Service, expanding beyond current protection for only the Secretary of Education and Deputy Attorney General. This proposal would authorize the USMS to provide security for executive branch officials deemed to need protection, potentially requiring additional U.S. Marshals. The Trump Administration proposed expanding protective details for executive branch officials under the US Marshals Service, with coordination on budgetary implications. The US faces a significant illegal drug market dominated by Mexican transnational criminal organizations, posing a major threat according to the DEA. The DEA states that Mexican transnational criminal organizations control smuggling corridors along the Southwest border and collaborate with other criminal networks. They transport drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border using various methods like tunnels, aircraft, and vehicles. TCOs also profit from human trafficking, weapons smuggling, counterfeiting, and extortion. Mexican drug traffickers collaborate with U.S. gangs to distribute illicit drugs in the United States, generating revenue for the gangs. They use various methods like bulk cash smuggling, money transfer systems, and virtual currencies like Bitcoin for money laundering. Gangs often work with different drug trafficking organizations and engage in a variety of criminal activities. Gangs collaborate with drug trafficking organizations, including Mexican traffickers, to sell various drugs in the U.S. The current drug threats include opioids like heroin and fentanyl, marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, and synthetic drugs. There is a growing concern about the U.S. opioid epidemic, with elevated heroin use and overdose deaths. Mexican criminal networks have increased heroin production and trafficking, leading to more heroin availability in the U.S. and higher seizures at the Southwest border. Increased heroin seizures at the Southwest border in the United States have been coupled with a rise in nationwide heroin seizures over the past decade. In 2017, 39% of the 7,979 kg of heroin seized was at the Southwest border. Officials are also concerned about the trafficking of nonpharmaceutical fentanyl, which is often mixed with other drugs and has led to a growing number of opioid overdoses. Nonpharmaceutical fentanyl is manufactured in China and Mexico and trafficked into the U.S. through various means. Federal law enforcement in the United States has initiatives to combat drug trafficking, including the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program targeting major drug trafficking organizations. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program provides financial assistance to law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking regions. There are 29 designated HIDTAs in the U.S. and its territories, including the Southwest border. The HIDTA program in the U.S. includes 29 designated regions, such as the Southwest border HIDTA. Strategies like the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy and the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime aim to reduce drug trafficking. The 116th Congress may consider various options to combat drug trafficking from Mexico. The United States aims to reduce drug trafficking from Mexico through various strategies. Congress may question the Trump Administration's priorities in this area and examine the roles of federal drug control agencies, such as CBP and ONDCP, in overseeing border security efforts. The southern border with Mexico spans 2,000 miles over diverse terrain and ownership types. DHS CBP is primarily responsible for border security. The Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for border security, including infrastructure construction, surveillance technology installation, and deploying agents to prevent unlawful entries into the United States. CBP's duties also involve facilitating legitimate travel and commerce. Various statutes authorize DHS to construct barriers along the U.S. border, specifically directing the deployment of fencing along at least 700 miles of the southern border with Mexico. President Trump issued Executive Order 13767 \"Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\" in 2017, instructing the DHS Secretary to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border. The order did not specify the expected mileage of barriers to be built. Border security includes tactical infrastructure, surveillance technology, and personnel, with about one-third of the southern border having a primary layer of fencing at the end of FY2015. Approximately one-third of the southern border, totaling 654 miles, has primary fencing. This includes 350 miles for pedestrians and 300 miles for vehicles. Most of the fencing is in California, Arizona, and New Mexico, with some in Texas along the Rio Grande River. The majority of the fencing is considered \"modern\" and was built between 2006 and 2011. There have been no new miles of primary fencing constructed since 2015, but some legacy fencing has been replaced. In 2015, legacy fencing and breached areas were replaced with additional tactical infrastructure including roads, gates, bridges, and lighting to support border enforcement and disrupt illicit activity. CBP utilizes border surveillance technology such as ground sensors, cameras, and radar, as well as aerial and marine surveillance vessels. Approximately 19,500 Border Patrol agents are stationed nationwide, with most at the southern border in FY2017. Executive Order 13767 calls for hiring an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents. Border Patrol faces challenges in reaching minimum staffing levels despite recruitment efforts. Improving southern border security may involve changes to infrastructure, technology, and personnel. Policymakers struggle to determine the most effective mix of strategies due to difficulties in measuring their impact. Apprehensions alone do not reflect the full extent of illegal border crossings, making it hard to assess the effectiveness of current security efforts. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides annual metrics on border security to measure the impact of enforcement actions and progress towards goals. Congress has invested in infrastructure, technology, and personnel for border security since the 1980s. Apprehensions alone do not fully reflect illegal border crossings, posing challenges in assessing the effectiveness of current security efforts. Since the 1980s, Congress has invested in infrastructure, technology, and personnel for border security. CBP allocated over $5.0 billion between FY2007 and FY2018 for border barrier planning, construction, and operations. The 116th Congress is considering a mix of tactical infrastructure to enhance border security, including fencing, surveillance technologies, and personnel. Experts have warned that the northern border may need more resources and oversight. The United States faces various threats, including natural disasters, terrorism, and pandemics. Strategic allocation of resources for preparedness is crucial to minimize human casualties and economic damage. The 116th Congress is considering enhancing border security with improvements to facilities, screening capacity, and detection at U.S. POEs. Experts suggest that the northern border may require more resources and oversight for national security. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator is tasked with creating a \"national preparedness goal\" (NPG) and developing a \"national preparedness system\" (NPS) to ensure the nation's ability to prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate natural disasters, terrorism, and other man-made disasters. This is guided by Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness (PPD-8), which replaced Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8: National Preparedness (HSPD-8). The NPS is supported by various strategic component policies, national planning frameworks, and federal interagency operational plans. The National Preparedness System (NPS) and its component policies outline the federal government's strategic vision for preparing the nation for all hazards. It identifies core capabilities needed to achieve the National Preparedness Goal (NPG) and defines core capabilities as necessary for preparing for incidents posing the greatest risk to national security. The National Preparedness System (NPS) includes annual National Preparedness Reports that track progress towards national preparedness objectives, using self-assessment processes like THIRA and SPR. The NPS influences budget decisions, assigns responsibilities, and sets long-term disaster preparedness policies. The Administration can update PPD-8 guidance, and Congress may oversee the NPS. Congress may oversee various factors related to the National Preparedness System (NPS), ensuring alignment with objectives outlined in the PKEMRA statute, informed by data and metrics, proper federal roles and resources allocation, incorporation of nonfederal resources, and appropriate allocation of resources relative to other homeland security missions. The 116th Congress could consider amending the PKEMRA statute to manage the President's discretion in NPS implementation by assigning preparedness responsibilities to federal agencies and prioritizing budget authority for core capabilities. The 116th Congress may prioritize budget authority for core capabilities in federal programs, such as \"Screening, Search, and Detection,\" over \"Fatality Management Services.\" FEMA provides temporary housing assistance programs after disaster declarations, but limitations may hinder the transition to permanent housing. Congress should consider potential changes to the Stafford Act for better housing assistance. FEMA provides temporary housing assistance programs under the Stafford Act, including the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program for disaster survivors. TSA offers short-term hotel/motel accommodations for individuals unable to return to their uninhabitable primary residence. Assistance lasts 5-14 days initially and can be extended up to 6 months. Challenges in transitioning to permanent housing were highlighted during Hurricane Maria. Some Hurricane Maria disaster survivors from Puerto Rico remained in the TSA program for nearly one year due to extensions, similar to survivors of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Sandy. Research suggests that prolonged stays in emergency sheltering solutions like TSA may lead to adverse mental health outcomes. FEMA's Individuals and Households Program (IHP) may be a better option for interim housing needs. IHP assistance provides temporary lodging and housing accommodations for disaster survivors with uninsured or under-insured necessary expenses. Eligibility and program limitations exist, such as ineligibility for those with habitable primary residences or access to rent-free housing. Assistance is generally limited to 18 months but can be extended by FEMA. Challenges in providing financial and direct assistance post-disaster include lack of affordable housing, restrictions on rental payment rates adjustments, and limitations on MHU placements. Additionally, FEMA's direct lease assistance program is only offered in scarce rental resource areas. Restoring infrastructure, community services, and employment opportunities post-disaster also impact survivor relocation decisions. Following disasters, survivor relocation decisions may be influenced by available services, employment opportunities, and housing options. FEMA implemented the Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) in collaboration with HUD after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike, Gustav, and Sandy to provide rental assistance and case management services. DHAP, funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, offered more assistance for longer periods compared to the Individual Assistance program. Despite being recognized as a promising housing strategy, FEMA has not consistently implemented DHAP. FEMA has not implemented DHAP following recent disasters despite requests, citing better housing solutions and concerns about cost effectiveness. Clear definitions and processes may be needed to address disaster housing needs comprehensively. Congress may request an evaluation of FEMA's capacity. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) requires Congress to evaluate FEMA's capacity to meet disaster survivors' needs, collaborate with housing partners for solutions, update the National Disaster Housing Strategy, and consider legislative solutions to address unmet needs. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) is a comprehensive legislation focusing on improving disaster planning, response, and recovery, and increasing FEMA accountability. It amends the Stafford Act and applies to disasters declared after August 1, 2017. Congress may monitor the implementation of DRRA's requirements. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) includes over 50 provisions for FEMA policy changes, reporting, and rulemaking with 2019 deadlines. Implementation is largely at FEMA's discretion, impacting disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. DRRA allows the President to allocate up to 6% of certain federal grant assistance for Predisaster Hazard Mitigation. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) allows for a significant increase in federal grant assistance for Predisaster Hazard Mitigation, including grants for Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) under the Stafford Act. This new funding mechanism has the potential to provide higher financial assistance to individuals and households, with the amount being significantly increased compared to previous limits. The implementation and management of this new funding by FEMA remains uncertain. Post-DRRA, financial assistance for repairs and replacement of housing and other needs assistance may not exceed $34,900 annually. Financial assistance for renting alternate housing is not capped. Changes post-DRRA may lead to increased spending on temporary disaster housing assistance and other needs assistance. FEMA may pilot some DRRA provisions, such as management costs for the PA Program and HMGP. Following the passage of DRRA, the PA management cost reimbursement rate increased to 12% of the total grant award, with 7% for the grantee and 5% for the subgrantee. The HMGP management cost reimbursement rate also increased to 15%, with 10% for the grantee and 5% for the subgrantee. Prior to DRRA, there was no pass-through requirement for subgrantees to receive a percentage of management costs. Some DRRA provisions may limit FEMA's ability to recoup assistance, including the potential waiver of debts owed in error. DRRA amends the statute of limitations on FEMA's ability to recover assistance, limiting the collection of debts owed in error and extending the time frame for initiating administrative actions. This change is significant as it allows for a longer period to close projects associated with disasters before recouping funds. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) includes reporting requirements that may influence decision-making regarding future disaster response and recovery. Reports were due within 90 days of DRRA's enactment, with some provisions also requiring briefings before the deadline. Other federal entities, such as the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security, have specific responsibilities. Congress may evaluate FEMA's implementation of DRRA provisions, review the effectiveness of regulations and policy guidance, and assess changes to federal assistance for past and future disasters. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the primary source of flood insurance coverage for residential properties in the United States. It aims to provide access to flood insurance, transfer financial risk to the federal government, and reduce the nation's flood risk through floodplain management standards. NFIP also works to reduce federal expenditure on disaster assistance after floods by engaging in noninsurance activities such as identifying flood hazards and disseminating flood-risk information. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) identifies and maps flood hazards, disseminates flood-risk information, requires community land-use and building-code standards, contributes to community resilience by funding rebuilding after floods, and offers grants for flood-risk reduction. Managed by FEMA, NFIP has over 22,000 participating communities with 5.1 million policies providing $1.3 trillion in coverage. It collects $4.7 billion in annual revenue and is voluntary for communities to participate. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the US, and NFIP aims to reduce federal expenditure on disaster assistance. The NFIP requires communities to adopt land-use and control measures for access to flood insurance. FEMA sets minimum standards for participation, but enforcement is the responsibility of local governments. Communities collaborate with FEMA to develop Flood Insurance Rate Maps to reduce flood risk. Property owners in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) must purchase flood insurance for federally backed mortgages. Non-compliance may result in ineligibility for disaster assistance. NFIP funding comes from policyholder payments, appropriations, borrowing, and reinsurance. The program can borrow money for extreme events. The NFIP can borrow money from the Treasury for extreme events, with borrowing limits increased after major hurricanes like Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The program owed $24.6 billion at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, borrowing $5.825 billion to cover claims from Hurricane Harvey. Total claims paid in 2017 were approximately $10.5 billion. The NFIP borrowed $5.825 billion from the Treasury to cover claims from Hurricane Harvey, reaching its borrowing limit. Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP debt to pay claims for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. FEMA borrowed an additional $6.1 billion, bringing the debt to $20.525 billion. As of November 2018, $117 million was paid in claims for Hurricanes Florence and Michael. The NFIP has $9.9 billion in remaining borrowing authority as of January 2019. The NFIP's debt is owed by current and future participants, with $2.82 billion in principal repayments and $4.2 billion in interest paid since 2005. The NFIP debt was canceled in October 2017, totaling $16 billion. Congress has enacted 10 short-term NFIP reauthorizations since the end of FY2017. The NFIP is authorized until May 31, 2019, with no comprehensive expiration provision. If not reauthorized by Congress, new flood insurance contracts will expire, and the NFIP's borrowing authority will be reduced to $1 billion. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the main source of flood insurance for residential properties in the US, with over 5.1 million policies providing $1.3 trillion in coverage. Without reauthorization by Congress, new flood insurance contracts will expire, and the NFIP's borrowing authority will be reduced from $30.425 billion to $1 billion. Several bills have been introduced in Congress for longer-term reauthorization and program changes. The House passed H.R. 2874 on November 14, 2017, but three reauthorization bills introduced in the Senate were not considered. Congress has historically asked FEMA to set NFIP premiums that are \"risk-based\" and \"reasonable.\" NFIP flood insurance rates should reflect true flood risk, with subsidies for properties built before the community's first Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). When FIRMs are updated, properties are \"grandfathered\" at their past rates. Reforming the NFIP premium structure to reflect full risk-based rates could lead to a more financially sustainable path. However, charging risk-based premiums may make insurance unaffordable for some properties. FEMA lacks the authority and funding to implement an affordability program, which would require raising rates for NFIP policyholders or diverting resources. Controversy surrounds NFIP coverage for properties with multiple flood losses. The NFIP faces controversy over insuring properties with multiple flood losses, leading to concerns about program costs and future losses. FEMA reports that RL and SRL properties have accounted for $17 billion in claims since 1968. Introducing an SRL premium and reducing the number of these properties through mitigation or relocation could improve the NFIP's financial position. Private insurers, through the WYO program, play a significant role in administering NFIP policies. Private insurers, through the WYO program, assist in issuing and servicing NFIP policies, with little flood risk taken on by them. Private insurer interest in flood coverage has grown, seen as a way to transfer risk from the federal government. FEMA has transferred $4.322 billion of flood risk to the capital markets through reinsurance. Private flood insurance offers advantages like flexible policies, broader coverage, integrated coverage with homeowners' insurance, and potentially lower costs. Increased private marketing could boost overall flood coverage purchased. Increasing private flood insurance could help reduce federal disaster assistance by boosting overall coverage purchased. However, private insurance may not guarantee coverage for all floodplain residents and could lead to varying consumer protections. Competition from the private sector may also increase NFIP's financial risk by cherry-picking profitable policies, leaving NFIP with more financially unsound policies. Private flood insurance policies may depopulate the NFIP, reducing its revenue and ability to repay debt. The NFIP's broader role includes providing insurance in flood-prone areas and reducing government costs after floods through flood-mapping and mitigation efforts. Funding for these efforts comes from the Federal Policy Fee. The Federal Policy Fee (FPF) funds flood mapping and floodplain management for the NFIP. As private flood insurance policies grow, FEMA may collect less FPF, affecting funding for these efforts. The Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program, administered by FEMA, helps local governments with financial liquidity after disasters through structured loans that can be converted to grants. Non-traditional CDL programs were developed after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005. Non-traditional CDL programs were developed in response to Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005, and for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. This Insight provides an overview of traditional and non-traditional CDLs and the policy issues they may raise in the 116th Congress, particularly with regard to CDL-type instruments developed for Puerto Rico and USVI. The CDL program may be of interest to Congress due to increased frequency and severity of disaster events and congressional interest in oversight issues related to federal disaster response in Puerto Rico and USVI. The Community Disaster Loans (CDLs) program provides financial assistance to local governments in presidentially declared disaster areas with substantial revenue losses. CDLs are capped at $5 million and structured around underwriting criteria that consider revenue losses, operating budgets, and economic effects of the disaster. These five-year loans, extendable to 10 years, have interest rates determined by the Treasury Secretary. FEMA issues guidance on canceling CDLs, requiring evidence of disaster-related deficits and revenue analyses. The Community Disaster Loans (CDLs) program provides financial assistance to local governments in disaster areas with revenue losses. Congress has authorized FEMA to administer non-traditional CDLs with different eligibility requirements and no $5 million cap. Legislation in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made $1 billion available for non-traditional CDLs. Subsequent legislation allowed for cancelation of these loans. After Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, funding was provided for CDL-type loans for Puerto Rico and USVI. The 2017 loan instruments for Puerto Rico and USVI provided funding through CDL-type loan instruments, with significant exceptions and modifications compared to previous CDLs. Territorial governments were treated as municipalities, the $5 million cap was lifted, recipients could receive multiple loans, and loan cancelation required approval from the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of the Treasury. Terms and conditions were determined solely by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. The 2017 loan instruments for Puerto Rico and USVI provided funding through CDL-type loan instruments, with exceptions and modifications. The terms, conditions, eligible uses, and timing of the loans were determined solely by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. The statutory ambiguities of the CDL-type instrument were complicated by Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis and the federal oversight board established by PROMESA. Legislation in February 2018 required oversight board-approved recovery plans for loan disbursement. The CDL-type program for Puerto Rico and USVI raises questions of equity compared to federal disaster response to states like after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Traditional CDLs may be inadequate for widespread disasters, while non-traditional CDLs lack defined criteria, raising concerns over equity and utility. Congress may need to specify terms for disaster response in the territories. Congress may need to specify program terms and cancellation criteria for CDLs in Puerto Rico and USVI to align them with traditional CDLs used after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They could consider restructuring CDLs to account for a wider range of disaster scenarios, such as state-based declarations, lifting the $5 million cap, or simplifying loan forgiveness. One option is to implement automatic forgiveness thresholds based on predetermined criteria. Additionally, Congress could develop separate disaster assistance instruments for governmental liquidity, disaster response, and long-term recovery needs. During the 1990s, shortfalls in state and local budgets led to calls for federal financial support for local fire departments. In response, Congress established the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) in 2000 within FEMA to provide grants for equipment, training, and other firefighter-related needs. AFG also supports fire prevention projects and firefighter health. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) was established in 2000 to provide grants for equipment, training, and EMS needs. AFG also supports fire prevention projects and firefighter health and safety research. In 2003, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Program was established to fund firefighter hiring and recruitment. Grants are distributed nationwide to various types of fire departments, with decisions made based on the application's merits and community needs. The majority of AFG funding goes to rural volunteer fire departments, while SAFER funding goes to urban career fire departments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $700 million for firefighter assistance grants, split evenly between AFG and SAFER. Since establishment, AFG has received $8.325 billion and SAFER has received $4.235 billion in appropriations. The United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 extended authorization for both programs through FY2023 at $750 million each, with annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) may offer online training for AFG and SAFER grant administration, expanded SAFER hiring grant eligibility, directed FEMA to develop a grant monitoring framework, and made technical corrections to the AFG and SAFER statute. Firefighter assistance grants were affected by a government shutdown, causing delays in the application and awards process for AFG, SAFER, and FP&S grants in 2018. The government shutdown caused delays in processing SAFER grant applications and award disbursements, impacting grant recipients' ability to fund grant-related activities. A backlog of payment requests will need to be addressed once FEMA grant personnel return to work. The 116th Congress faces the challenge of ensuring equitable and effective distribution of grants for health and safety protection. The distribution of grants for health and safety protection, including firefighting personnel, is facing challenges due to concerns over federal budget deficits and potential funding impacts. There are ongoing issues with annual appropriations for AFG and SAFER grants, with questions about waiving restrictions on SAFER funds for retention and rehiring. FEMA has the authority to grant waivers but chose not to for the 2018 round of SAFER awards. FEMA has chosen not to provide SAFER hiring grants for retaining or rehiring firefighters for the FY2019 round of SAFER awards. Emergency communication systems are crucial for first responders and emergency personnel to communicate during day-to-day operations and disasters, including 911 systems and land mobile radio systems. The First Responder Network (FirstNet) is a nationwide public safety broadband network under deployment, scheduled for completion in 2022. It will enable communication between response agencies via voice and data. Various technologies hinder interoperability among emergency communication systems used by police, firefighters, and EMS workers. Federal, state, and local public safety agencies are investing in IP-based technologies to enhance communications and response. The federal government has established a national alerting system and FirstNet, a high-speed mobile communications network for public safety users. Upgrading 911 systems to IP-based platforms is a priority at all government levels. Geo-location technologies offer opportunities for easier 911 caller location, but integration poses challenges. Advancements in alerting and IP-based technologies present challenges in integrating new systems into legacy 911 systems. Interconnecting systems could improve information sharing but raises concerns about privacy and security. The emergence of nationwide systems may require new policies to integrate technologies into response plans and protocols, with a focus on collaborative planning and training across all government levels. Migration to new technologies is costly, posing funding challenges for some jurisdictions. Adoption of new technologies may also require policy support. The 116th Congress may oversee emergency communications effectiveness during disasters and federal program support. This includes the National 9-1-1 Program and First Responder Network Authority for optimal 911 services and coordination. Funding technology upgrades and policy support for new technologies may be necessary. The 116th Congress may focus on overseeing emergency communications, including the Network Authority, Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, Emergency Communications Division, federal grant programs, and FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau. The 116th Congress may focus on overseeing emergency communications, including rules for carriers supporting 911 services, state and local use of 911 fees, public safety spectrum, public alerts, disaster management, and restoration efforts to protect national health security. The HHS Secretary leads federal public health and medical response to emergencies, while state and local agencies are primarily responsible for health security. Federal government's impact on national health security is limited. Public health emergency management laws have expanded. The nation's public health emergency management laws have expanded considerably following the terrorist attacks in 2001. The National Health Security Preparedness Index assesses preparedness across all states, revealing differing levels among regions. Large differences in preparedness persist, with states in the Deep South and Mountain West lagging behind. The average state will need 9 more years to reach the health security levels of the best-prepared states. Health care delivery measures, such as the number of providers per population and access to trauma centers, still score low. The readiness of health care facilities to respond to emergencies remains a challenge. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have implemented a rule requiring facilities to meet preparedness benchmarks to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Emergency Preparedness (EP) Rule, effective since November 2017, requires facilities to meet preparedness benchmarks to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Policymakers are interested in seeing if the EP Rule leads to improvements in national health system preparedness. Federal assistance is available for public health emergency response activities during major disasters, but there is no specific program to cover uninsured costs of individual healthcare services post-disaster. During mass casualty incidents, hospitals may face expectations to deliver care without clear reimbursement. Stafford Act reimbursement may not cover all necessary activities, and there is limited funding available from the Public Health Emergency Fund. Congress has provided supplemental appropriations for disaster-related healthcare costs in the past. During public health emergencies like Hurricane Katrina and the Ebola outbreak, supplemental appropriations were needed for unreimbursed state and local response costs. Some policymakers have proposed dedicated funding approaches for public health emergency response, but specific measures in the 115th Congress did not advance. In FY2019 appropriations, Congress established the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF). In FY2019, Congress established a $50 million Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund to be administered by the CDC. The 116th Congress may examine the fund's uses and consider appropriations to the Public Health Emergency Fund for national health security preparedness. Policymakers view cybersecurity as the security of cyberspace, allowing them to address specific elements through legislation. Cybersecurity encompasses various aspects such as internet infrastructure, services, devices, and users. It involves issues like education, workforce management, and defense. The 116th Congress may focus on five cybersecurity topics related to homeland security: Information Sharing, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management, Federal Agency Oversight, and Data Protection and Privacy. Computer scientists emphasize risk management in cybersecurity discussions. When discussing cybersecurity, scientists focus on risk management rather than achieving absolute security. Risks can be avoided, transferred, controlled, or accepted. Organizations must understand the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences of attacks they face. Risks can be managed for systems, networks, and data using an information security model. Policymakers can consider holistic risk management or specific tools like information sharing to strengthen cybersecurity. Information sharing is a key factor in strengthening cybersecurity. It allows organizations to learn from each other, reduce vulnerability to hacking, and adapt quickly to changing conditions. Successful information sharing involves receiving, processing, and using information to make valuable changes in behavior. However, some organizations may struggle to understand or act on critical information. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan directs critical infrastructure sectors to consider cybersecurity risks, but organizations may lack expertise or resources to act. Policymakers could direct federal agencies to provide assistance, engage in rulemaking, or incentivize cybersecurity activities. Some agencies have programs to provide information and technical assistance for critical infrastructure. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published a cybersecurity framework to assist those responsible for critical infrastructure, focusing on cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) to address risks from foreign adversaries and poor quality control. Policymakers may pursue legislative options to clarify agency responsibilities in C-SCRM. Federal agencies rely on IT to manage sensitive information and have requested over $17 billion in cybersecurity funding for FY2020. Despite existing resources, agencies face challenges in IT management highlighted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Congress could pursue investigations or legislation to improve oversight of IT programs and cybersecurity efforts, reviewing agency spending and following up on GAO and Inspector General recommendations. Data security and privacy are crucial in light of recent data breaches like Equifax and Facebook incidents. While related, they are distinct concepts - security focuses on keeping out unauthorized users, while privacy concerns how data is used and accessed. Policymakers can choose between comprehensive or sectoral approaches, such as the General Data Protection Regulation or HIPAA standards, to address these issues effectively. Recent discussions at both state and federal levels have shifted towards more comprehensive approaches to data security and privacy, moving away from sectoral solutions. The Department of Homeland Security's Chief Human Capital Officer plays a crucial role in overseeing human resources management, including workforce planning, recruitment, performance management, and employee development. This aligns with Title 5, Section 1402 of the United States Code, which outlines the CHCO's responsibilities in setting workforce development strategies in line with organizational goals. The Department of Homeland Security's Chief Human Capital Officer oversees workforce development strategy aligned with organizational goals. The CHCO position is a career Senior Executive Service role within DHS. Congressional oversight may focus on DHS HRM operations, including the CHCO's placement and functions within the department. Congress may also review DHS activities related to HRM as outlined in the department's Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Report. Congress may conduct oversight on DHS HRM operations, including the CHCO's role and functions within the department. The DHS FY2020 budget request, expected in March 2019, could facilitate a review within the context of the department's Strategic Plan and Performance Report. The DHS Strategic Plan, required by P.L. 111-352, outlines goals, objectives, and resources needed for implementation. It emphasizes the importance of strategic human capital planning and budgeting. The plan mentions HRM briefly, focusing on strengthening service delivery and resource management. The DHS Strategic Plan emphasizes the importance of strategic human capital planning and budgeting to strengthen service delivery and resource management. Specific objectives include building effective leaders, recruiting a diverse workforce, retaining engaged employees, and solidifying a culture of mission performance. Congress could request documentation on progress and an updated Strategic Plan publication timeline. The DHS Strategic Plan emphasizes strategic human capital planning and budgeting to strengthen service delivery and resource management. The Performance Report, required by law, must cover program activities and describe how performance goals will be achieved. The Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP) focuses on goals, objectives, and performance measures linked to DHS strategy, emphasizing management integration and accountability tracking. The Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP) is used to identify and address critical skills gaps in order to meet DHS mission needs. The Performance Report emphasizes recruitment strategies as key elements for progress in closing skill gaps. The President Donald Trump Administration's Performance Management Agenda (PMA) aims to modernize the Federal Government through CAPs addressing critical challenges, such as developing a workforce for the 21st century. Congress could suggest making HCOP and Component Recruitment and Outreach Plans publicly available on DHS.gov for consultation and oversight. The DHS is working on developing a workforce for the 21st century through a strategic human capital management framework. The focus is on improving employee performance, reskilling and redeploying human capital resources, and simplifying hiring processes. Congressional oversight could include monitoring key initiatives, results, and timelines for achieving goals. The debate surrounding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) management involvement has been ongoing since its inception in 2003. Some experts advocate for a strong management function to replace component leadership, while others support a limited management role to allow components to operate independently. However, it became evident that a small management cadre was insufficient for coordinating policy and overseeing the department's diverse missions. Efforts were made to establish a unified identity and improve coordination within the department. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) undertook efforts to establish a unified identity and way of doing business under various secretaries. Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memorandum in 2014 to reform DHS by implementing new processes for strategy development and decision-making to ensure unity of effort across department components. The Department of Homeland Security initiated a unity of effort initiative to enhance coordination, centralized decision-making, strategic budget building, and department-wide acquisition strategy. Component leadership is encouraged to participate in a more strategic approach for greater efficiency in operations, budget processes, and acquisitions. The memorandum outlined four areas of focus, including the formation of a Senior Leaders Council. The Department of Homeland Security established a Senior Leaders Council and a Deputies Management Action Group to improve policy, strategy, operations, and budget processes. They also aimed to enhance departmental management processes for investments, develop a stronger analytic capability within the Office of Policy, and improve coordination of cross-component operations. Bipartisan support was evident in hearings for these reforms. The Department of Homeland Security received bipartisan support for reforms aimed at improving policy, strategy, operations, and budget processes. Key accomplishments included the establishment of a Cost Analysis Division and the development of a Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan. In 2015, DHS implemented a Unity of Effort Award to recognize outstanding efforts. The Unity of Effort Award was implemented by the Department of Homeland Security to recognize outstanding efforts in improving efficiency and effectiveness. Legislative changes were made to support the initiative, including authorizing joint task forces and redefining the role of the Office of Policy. General John Kelly and some Senators praised the progress of the initiative during his confirmation hearing, but Secretary Kelly's focus during his tenure was on other issues. During her tenure, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen aimed to assess and strengthen unity of effort programs at DHS, focusing on integrating capabilities and promoting joint education and training. Congress may debate the role of departmental management, engagement in reforms, and the progress of management reforms. Following up on the Secretary's priorities is recommended. Following her tenure, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen aimed to assess and strengthen unity of effort programs at DHS, focusing on integrating capabilities and promoting joint education and training. Congress may wish to follow up on the Secretary's priorities as outlined in her questionnaire."
