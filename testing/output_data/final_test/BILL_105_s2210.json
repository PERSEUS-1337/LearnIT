The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1998 establishes a new nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health professional shortage areas. The amendment allows registered nurses to temporarily work in the United States if they meet specific qualifications and have an attestation on file. The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1998 creates a nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health professional shortage areas. Registered nurses can work in the US temporarily if they meet specific qualifications and have an attestation on file. The requirements for alien nurses include having a full nursing license, passing an appropriate examination, and meeting all legal qualifications for practice in the intended employment location. The attestation for a facility where an alien nurse will work includes ensuring the facility meets requirements, does not negatively impact wages or working conditions of other nurses, pays the same wage rate, and actively recruits and retains enough nurses. The facility must take significant steps to recruit and retain enough registered nurses who are US citizens or authorized immigrants to reduce reliance on nonimmigrant nurses. This includes not being involved in a labor dispute, not laying off nurses, and not using alien nurses to influence union elections. The facility must also provide notice of the petition for registered nurses to the bargaining unit. The facility must ensure that the number of nonimmigrant nurses does not exceed 33% of the total registered nurses employed. Nonimmigrant nurses are not allowed to work at any other worksite. The facility must ensure that nonimmigrant nurses do not exceed 33% of total registered nurses employed and are not allowed to work at any other worksite. Significant steps to recruit and retain registered nurses include operating a training program at the facility or financing a training program elsewhere. A copy of the attestation must be provided to registered nurses within 30 days of filing. The facility must take significant steps to recruit and retain registered nurses, such as operating a training program at the facility or financing a program elsewhere, providing career development programs, paying higher wages, offering support services, and opportunities for salary advancement. These steps are not exclusive, and facilities are not required to take more than one step if they can meet the conditions. The facility must take significant steps to recruit and retain registered nurses, such as operating a training program, providing career development programs, paying higher wages, and offering support services. An attestation under subparagraph (A) shall expire after one year or at the end of the period of admission for the last alien it was applied to, and applies to petitions filed within one year if the facility continues to comply with the conditions. The facility must comply with conditions in the attestation, which may include filing petitions for multiple registered nurses. The Secretary of Labor will compile and make available a list of facilities that have filed petitions, along with their attestations and petitions. A process will be established for investigating complaints of noncompliance or misrepresentation. The Secretary will investigate complaints of noncompliance with attestation conditions filed by aggrieved parties. A determination will be made within 180 days to decide if a basis exists for further action. If the Secretary of Labor finds noncompliance with attestation conditions, they may impose penalties and notify the Attorney General, who will restrict petitions for nurses to be employed by the facility for at least one year. The Secretary of Labor may impose penalties on facilities that violate attestation conditions, including ordering back pay for registered nurses paid below the prevailing wage rate. Facilities filing an attestation must pay a filing fee, not exceeding $250, which is deposited into a fund in the Treasury of the United States. The fund in the Treasury of the United States is available to cover costs for the Secretary of Labor related to violations of attestation conditions. Nonimmigrant visas under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) have a 3-year admission period, with a limit of 500 visas issued per fiscal year. Each State has specific limits on the number of petitions granted based on population size. Facilities filing petitions under section 101(a)(15)(H)(I)(c) must provide nonimmigrant nurses with fair wages, working conditions, and hours. Nonimmigrants have the right to join or organize a union. The term 'facility' refers to a subsection (d) hospital as defined in the Social Security Act.

Clause (i) of section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended by removing subclause (a). The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must implement these changes within 90 days of the Act's enactment.

The changes will only apply to nonimmigrant status petitions filed within a 4-year period after the regulations are implemented. SEC. 3. Recommendations for alternative remedy for nursing shortage.
