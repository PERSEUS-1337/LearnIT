    "content": "The APT T-X acquisition strategy raises oversight concerns for Congress due to budget issues. The addition of a new Major Defense Acquisition Program alongside existing purchases will impact USAF budget requests. Congress should consider the number of trainer aircraft and ground-based training systems, as well as their timing of procurement and fielding. Trainer aircraft are designed for aircrew or pilot flight training, with features like tandem flight controls and simplified cockpit arrangements. The U.S. Air Force's trainer aircraft fleet, managed by the Air Education and Training Command's 19th Air Force, consists of various models and is used at multiple training locations. The fleet includes the T-6 Texan II, T-1A Jayhawk, and T-38 Talon, with pilots starting in the T-6 before moving to other aircraft based on their assigned role. The T-6 Texan II is a single-engine, two-seat turboprop aircraft used for basic flying skills training for both USAF and USN pilots. The T-6 Texan II is a military trainer aircraft used by the USAF and USN in Joint Primary Pilot Training. It has tandem seating, advanced avionics, ejection seats, and is part of the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS). Currently in use at various Air Force bases in Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. The T-1A Jayhawk is a twin-engine jet used in advanced pilot training at various Air Force bases. It was derived from the Beechjet 400A and has structural enhancements for bird strike resistance. The cockpit accommodates an instructor pilot and two student pilots. The T-38C Talon is a high-performance twin-engine jet trainer used for pilot training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL. It has a history of economy of operations, ease of maintenance, and exceptional safety. Manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation, over 1,100 T-38s were delivered to the USAF between 1961 and 1972. The aircraft features swept wings, tricycle landing gear, a glass cockpit, and tandem seating for more than 60,000 USAF pilots trained since entering service. More than 60,000 USAF pilots have trained in the T-38 since entering service. The T-38 is also in service in several other countries. Various design improvements have been made to operational T-38s, including avionics upgrades and replacement wing sets. In 2015, the USAF started a structural modernization program called PACER CLASSIC III to extend the life of T-38C aircraft through structural upgrades performed by USAF maintainers. The USAF's Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah, is responsible for extending the life of the T-38 aircraft to 2029. The modifications are carried out at Randolph AFB, Texas. The T-38C is used for training USAF, USN, and NATO pilots, as well as test pilots and flight test engineers. NASA also uses the T-38C to train astronauts. In 2018, the USAF identified gaps in advanced pilot training requirements for the T-38C Talon aircraft. The USAF conducted an analysis in 2011 to address training shortfalls for the T-38C Talon aircraft. A materiel solution was recommended, leading to the development of the APT T-X program. The planned IOC for APT T-X is 2024 with FOC in 2034, aiming to prepare student pilots for fourth- and fifth-generation fighters and bombers. The USAF plans to integrate the APT T-X within the advanced phase of the fighter/bomber track of SUPT as well as IFF. The acquisition program aims to acquire an advanced trainer aircraft and ground-based training system for the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) pilot training pipeline. The APT T-X system includes multiple components such as aircraft, ground-based training systems, virtual training systems, electronic classrooms, aircraft maintainers, maintenance training systems, and support infrastructure. It is designed to bridge the gap between the T-6 Texan and fifth-generation Formal Training Unit (FTU) aircraft. The APT T-X system aims to close 12 capability gaps identified by the USAF, better preparing student pilots for fifth-generation fighters and bombers. It will provide more effective high-G and high-angle-of-attack training, resembling fifth-generation operational environments. Improved fidelity in the Ground-Based Training System will allow tasks to be moved from flight training to simulators, reducing the high cost of flight hours in fifth-generation aircraft. Additionally, the more capable aircraft will enable training to be shifted from FTUs to SUPT and IFF, leading to operational training gains. The USAF plans to reduce costs and increase readiness with the APT T-X system for training future fighter and bomber pilots. The current T-38C fleet has low availability and cannot meet advanced training requirements. By 2031, 60% of combat air forces will be fifth-generation aircraft, necessitating a modern training aircraft. The T-38C fleet, originally serving as an advanced pilot trainer for older fighters, is now facing challenges in meeting modern training requirements. The bridge course for transitioning to fifth-generation fighters was deemed inefficient and discontinued. The 430 T-38C aircraft are projected to remain in service until 2034 when the APT T-X system reaches full operational capability. The APT T-X System Specifications outline the system requirements for the new trainer aircraft to meet the USAF's mission tasks. The USAF plans to upgrade five T-38C bases with APT: Columbus AFB, Laughlin AFB, Vance AFB, Sheppard AFB, and Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. The Ground-Based Training System includes simulators, training devices, and academics, with the largest portion being the Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) consisting of Unit Training Devices (UTDs), Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs), and Weapons Systems Trainers (WSTs). The Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) include Unit Training Devices (UTDs), Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs), and Weapons Systems Trainers (WSTs). The UTD provides basic training in flying tasks, while OFTs offer more advanced flight profiles and simulation capabilities. WSTs have a greater field-of-view for training in fighter maneuvers and formation flight. The ability to link simulators allows for virtual battlespace training. The USAF emphasizes the importance of a high-fidelity Ground-Based Training System (GBTS) for training fighter formation flight and tactical maneuvering. The system must integrate all aspects of aircraft maintenance training into Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) and be web-based for seamless communication with student management systems. The goal is to transition simulator training from traditional stick-and-throttle flying to sensor-driven tactics, reflecting fifth-generation fighter capabilities. The USAF is seeking a high-fidelity Ground-Based Training System (GBTS) for fighter formation flight and tactical maneuvering. The current inventory of T-38C ATDs is 36 systems, while the USAF's requirement for T-X is 46 systems. In March 2015, the USAF initiated the pursuit of the APT family of systems through an RFI to industry, focusing on draft requirements and holding a presolicitation conference at Wright-Patterson AFB. Numerous engagements between the government and industry followed to ensure clear communication. The USAF engaged with industry to ensure clear communication and transparency during the solicitation process for the Ground-Based Training System. Written communication was conducted through FedBizOpps.gov, with a draft RFP issued in July 2016. Interactive dialogue continued to improve system specifications, leading to the final RFP release in December 2016. The final solicitation RFP for the APT aircraft was released on December 30, 2016, including engineering and manufacturing development, production, and sustainment activities. The SOW also calls for Field Service Representatives and Interim Contractor Support. The USAF awarded a 16-year contract for up to 475 T-X aircraft and up to 120 GBTS devices. The contract types include fixed-price incentive firm and firm fixed-price. The GBTS program involves a 16-year contract for up to 475 T-X aircraft and 120 GBTS devices. The contract types are fixed-price incentive firm and firm fixed-price. The acquisition strategy prioritizes mature technologies over new systems, although the winning Boeing design is new. The program schedule aims for initial operational capability in FY2024. Analysts debate the disadvantage of fixed-price contracts for new designs, as they require corporate investment for design costs. The USAF APT competition for the contract award was based on best value source selection criteria outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15. Lessons from previous source selections were applied, with evaluation factors and subfactors detailed in the solicitation. Offeror proposals had to be under $16.3 billion to be considered for evaluation. The USAF APT competition for the contract award required proposals to be under $16.3 billion to be evaluated. Proposals needed to meet affordability measures and receive specific technical risk ratings to be considered awardable. Nonprice factors rated as High or Unacceptable would disqualify the entire proposal. Offerors had to meet standard government solicitation requirements. Each subfactor was evaluated individually based on detailed criteria in the solicitation. The USAF APT competition required proposals under $16.3 billion to be evaluated based on affordability and technical risk ratings. Nonprice factors rated High or Unacceptable would disqualify proposals. Five aerospace company partnerships intended to compete for the contract, with Boeing and Saab unveiling a purpose-built trainer in anticipation of the program in 2016. The contract was awarded on September 27, 2018. Boeing unveiled the T-X trainer in September 2016 at their St. Louis facility. It is a production aircraft, not a prototype, with two aircraft already flown by December 2016. The trainer was designed with the Ground-Based Training System and support. Parts were made in Sweden and final assembly in St. Louis. Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems planned to offer the BAE Hawk as a replacement bid for the T-38C, but later announced a new purpose-built jet trainer system. The partnership between BAE Systems and L-3, along with Lockheed Martin and Korean Aerospace Industries, developed modernized training systems for the T-X program. Northrop Grumman-BAE-L-3 Comm decided not to compete for the T-X contract. Lockheed Martin and KAI introduced the T-50A as a contender, featuring upgrades like air refueling capability and embedded training. The T-50 aircraft, designed by KAI and LM in 2002, is used as a trainer in several countries. The T-100, a variant of the M-346 trainer, is in use in Italy, Israel, Poland, and Singapore. Leonardo plans to build the T-100 in Tuskegee, AL, partnering with DRS as the prime contractor. Sierra Nevada Corp. and Turkish Aerospace Industries have also entered the T-X competition. Freedom Aircraft Ventures LLC in Centennial, Colorado is developing a lightweight, all-composite trainer. The DOD's APT T-X acquisition strategy raises questions for Congress regarding pilot shortage, aircraft purchase levels, consolidation of pilot training locations, and budget impact. The impact of a fourth major defense acquisition program on the USAF budget is being questioned, along with the need to recapitalize the training fleet sooner for fifth-generation platforms. Acquisition reform initiatives are also being considered for faster procurement of the T-X. Additionally, there is a discussion on modifying the selected T-X platform for use as a light-attack fighter. Boeing's ability to execute the program within budget is also a concern. The USAF pilot selection process involves academic and psychomotor tests for candidates. The USAF pilot selection process includes academic and psychomotor tests, flight physical requirements, and the use of a Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM) tool to predict candidate ability for pilot training. The PCSM score combines performance on the Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) and Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) with flying hours from civilian training. A pilot selection board uses the PCSM score and other factors to choose candidate pilots, with higher PCSM scores potentially indicating greater training success and fighter aircraft qualification. The Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) measures motor skills, cognitive aptitude, and attitude toward risk using a joystick, throttle, and rudder pedals. The Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) is mandatory for USAF commission applications and includes a pilot aptitude section. The pilot composite test assesses aviation and mechanical knowledge for pilot selection. The Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) measures motor skills, cognitive aptitude, and attitude toward risk using a joystick, throttle, and rudder pedals. The Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) is mandatory for USAF commission applications and includes a pilot aptitude section. The pilot composite test, another test for pilot selection, assesses aviation and mechanical knowledge, spatial ability, and interpretation skills. Flight Training Pilot candidates attend the Introductory Flight Training (IFT) course in Pueblo, CO, administered by Doss Aviation, to prepare for Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) or other pilot training programs. Doss Aviation operates Diamond DA20-C1 aircraft for Introductory Flight Training (IFT) to screen aviation candidates before undergraduate flight training. After IFT, student pilots attend either the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) program or the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) program. ENJJPT is a 55-week training program at Sheppard AFB, Texas, with classes of 20-25 students. Graduates receive follow-on training on their assigned aircraft at various bases. Pilots selected for fighter aircraft attend the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) course at Sheppard AFB, Texas, with 15 classes per year lasting eight weeks. After IFF, pilots train on their assigned aircraft at bases in the US. SUPT is a 54-week joint USAF and USN pilot training program at Vance AFB, Oklahoma, and Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Florida. Graduates attend follow-on training at Formal Training Units (FTUs) in the US. SUPT classes have 8-10 student pilots and enter/graduate every eight weeks. Following primary flight training on the T-6 aircraft, students are divided into different tracks for further training. Fighter/bomber track students train on the T-38 focusing on low-level tactics, instrument procedures, formation flying, and navigation. Airlift and tanker pilots undergo advanced training on the T-1A, learning crew resource management, air-to-air refueling, airdrop missions, and radar positioning. Multiengine turboprop aircraft pilots train on the T-44 or C-12 turboprop trainers at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. After completing primary flight training, students are assigned to different tracks for further training. Fighter/bomber track students undergo instruction on the T-38, focusing on various tactics and procedures. Airlift and tanker pilots receive advanced training on the T-1A, while multiengine turboprop aircraft pilots train on the C-12 at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. Graduates assigned to fighter/bomber aircraft attend IFF at Randolph AFB, Texas, or Columbus AFB, Mississippi, where they undergo a four-week entry/graduation cycle. Simulators are used to provide cost-effective training and prepare pilots for emergency conditions they may face during flight. Advancements in pilot training include the use of emergency simulations to enhance awareness and skills for encountering emergencies in flight. Ground-based training has evolved to focus on training wartime mission skills using realistic and advanced synthetic environments, linking various simulators and live aircraft in a wide area network for mission training. Modeling and simulation increase the scope and realism of training. According to USAF researchers, modeling and simulation enhance warfighter training by providing realistic combat environments and enabling joint combined training. Simulators help develop spatial awareness for aircrew training, with advancements in technology offering more realistic 3-D views through virtual reality. Technology has advanced to provide more realistic 3-D views through virtual reality for pilot trainees to experience spatial situations in a computer-generated virtual battlespace. This spatial cognition training augments academic instruction by allowing trainees to practice visualization skills for in-flight spatial problem-solving. The use of distributed mission training (DMT) and advanced distributed simulation technology is seen as a significant improvement in aircrew training by USAF analysts. The USAF is looking to significantly improve aircrew training through the use of Distributed Mission Training (DMT) for multiplayer scenarios. The planned T-X program includes state-of-the-art Ground-Based Training System (GBTS) requirements to enhance pilot modeling and simulation training. Analysts argue that increasing simulator use is a cost-saving measure that reduces flight-hour costs and maintenance. The current Air Force live flight/simulator training balance varies across different training pipelines. The USAF is working on improving aircrew training through Distributed Mission Training (DMT) for multiplayer scenarios. The current balance between live flight and simulator training varies across different pipelines, with plans to increase simulator use for cost-saving measures. For example, in the airlift/mobility pipeline, the balance is currently 71 percent live flight and 29 percent simulator, but it is expected to shift to a 60/40 split by 2013. This shift will involve upgrading simulation devices for the T-1 Jayhawk aircraft. The Air Force is increasing simulator time for training programs, with a shift towards more simulator use to reduce costs. Despite this trend, new pilots in undergraduate pilot training still receive biased live flight training to ensure they understand the simulation experience. Analysts agree that simulators can help cut pilot training costs. Analysts agree that simulators can help reduce pilot training costs, with the global flight simulator market expected to grow by 4.5% by 2022. High-fidelity simulators are costly to operate and maintain, requiring consideration of initial costs, maintenance, and upgrades. The Navy plans to enhance simulator fidelity for improved mission experience. The Navy is increasing virtual training for pilots and sensor operators to save costs while ensuring safety. Simulators are currently used for a significant portion of training for Boeing F/A-18 Hornet, Romeo, and Sikorsky MH-60 Sierra aircraft. Upgraded simulators will allow for a higher ratio of virtual training by 2020. The Navy is increasing virtual training for pilots and sensor operators to save costs while ensuring safety. Capt. Craig Dorrans, program manager of PMA-205 at the Naval Air Systems Command, mentions that crews for the Boeing P-8A Poseidon will be able to perform 70% of their training in a TOFT. Training for Fire Scout pilots is moving to 100% synthetic training, with plans to train aircrew for the Fire Scout and MQ-4 Triton using 100% simulation. The FY2018 Administration budget request included $105.999 million for the Advanced Pilot training program. In the FY2018 Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, Congress reduced funding for the Advanced Pilot Training program by $19.8 million due to a contract award delay. The Administration's FY2017 defense budget requested $12.377 million for Air Force research and development for APT T-X development. The FY2017 Defense Authorization Act included $12.377 million for the program. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended funding the Advanced Pilot Training program at $4.477 million, $7.9 million below the requested level, citing early funding as unnecessary. The final action in the FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $7.377 million for the program, a reduction of $5 million from the Administration's request. The defense budget request included $11.395 million in Air Force research and development funding for the APT T-X program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommended funding the program at the requested level. However, the House Appropriations Committee proposed a reduction to $10.395 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee supported the full request. The FY2015 Defense Authorization and Appropriations funded the Advance Pilot Training program at $8.201 million, meeting the Administration's request. This was the first year of funding for the program. The program included Appendix C - APT Capability Gap Summary and Appendix D - System Specification for the Advanced Pilot Training Program Aircraft System."
