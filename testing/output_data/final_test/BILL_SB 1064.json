    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The heading of Chapter 4.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to focus on the Sexually Exploited Minors Program. The County of Alameda may establish a project to address the needs of commercially sexually exploited minors who have been arrested or detained for specific violations or adjudged dependent by the juvenile court. The County of Alameda, in collaboration with various agencies, may develop protocols for identifying and assessing minors who may be victims of commercial sexual exploitation upon arrest or detention by law enforcement. The protocol includes reporting to the child welfare agency and investigating the report. The District Attorney of the County of Alameda, in collaboration with various agencies, may develop a diversion program and a multidisciplinary team to address the needs of minors who are victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Develop a training curriculum based on best practices for identifying and assessing minors who may be victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Provide this training to law enforcement, child protective services, and other relevant parties. Repeal Section 18259.1 and amend Section 18259.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code to define a \"commercially sexually exploited minor\" as a person under 18 who meets specific criteria. The curr_chunk states criteria for individuals who may be considered victims, including being abused, adjudged dependent by juvenile court, abducted, or trafficked severely. If a minor is arrested for certain offenses or is the subject of a dependency petition, they are presumed to be a commercially sexually exploited minor. Section 18259.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed. The Legislature finds that a special law is needed for the unique circumstances of the County of Alameda to address human trafficking. This includes implementing a service model for youth victims to provide intervention and rehabilitation services instead of traditional prosecution or incarceration."
