    "content": "The \"Link-up for Learning Act\" is the short title of this legislation. The findings section highlights key points related to the Act. The Congress finds that a significant number of children are at risk of academic failure due to social and economic conditions. Over 20% of children live in poverty, with eroded social support systems. Many at-risk students lack adequate nutrition, healthcare, and face various forms of abuse and violence. Children and youths face various challenges such as substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, involuntary migration, and limited English proficiency, creating barriers to learning. Factors like single-parent families, disadvantaged backgrounds, and fragmented services further hinder their education and development. Services for at-risk students are fragmented, expensive, overregulated, often ineffective, and duplicative, focusing on narrow problems rather than the needs of the whole child and family. School personnel and support service providers lack knowledge and access to available services, face bureaucratic obstacles, and have limited resources for coordination. Service providers for at-risk students are trained in separate institutions and practice in separate agencies, hindering coordination and integration of services. Coordination and integration of services for at-risk students offer a great opportunity to break the cycle of poverty and academic failure. It is cost-effective, reduces duplication, improves service quality, and emphasizes prevention over crisis intervention. The purposes of coordinating and integrating services for at-risk students are to break the cycle of poverty and academic failure, be cost-effective, reduce duplication, improve service quality, and emphasize prevention over crisis intervention. The purpose of this Act is to establish a grant program to improve the educational performance of at-risk students by removing barriers to learning, enhancing support services, increasing parental involvement, and focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies. The Act aims to improve educational performance by fostering coordination among various agencies and levels of government, removing obstacles, enhancing communication, creating joint funding pools, providing cross-training, and increasing parental and community involvement in education. SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY. Local educational agencies can apply for coordinated services programs for at-risk students by partnering with other public agencies. Consortia formed by educational agencies and public service agencies can also apply to coordinate support services for at-risk students. Nonprofit organizations, higher education institutions, and private enterprises with experience in serving at-risk students can participate as cooperating agencies. Educational agencies receiving assistance under the Head Start Transition program are also eligible. Local educational agencies can apply for coordinated services programs for at-risk students by partnering with other public agencies. They must meet certain requirements and be eligible for financial assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 5. TARGET POPULATION. Eligible students in chapter 1 schools or schoolwide projects, along with their family members, can receive services from projects funded under this Act. An eligible local educational agency can choose any school, grade span, or program area for project services as long as requirements are met.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZED USES OF FUNDS. Local educational agencies receiving grants under this Act can use the funds to improve school-based or community-based education support services for at-risk students. These services may include child nutrition, health education, counseling, substance abuse prevention, tutoring, mentoring, and parent education activities. Additionally, agencies can collaborate with other organizations to plan, develop, and operate programs. The curr_chunk focuses on developing and operating coordinated services programs for at-risk students to increase their access to various social support services. This includes child nutrition, health and mental health services, substance abuse prevention, foster care, job training, and alternative living arrangements. Effective strategies for highly mobile families and early intervention are also emphasized. The curr_chunk outlines strategies to support at-risk students and families, improve interagency communications, and enhance coordination of services through technology. It also emphasizes the colocation of support services in schools or nearby sites and the need for unified eligibility procedures and secure data management. The curr_chunk outlines strategies to support at-risk students through integrated case planning, subsidizing education-related services, staff development, and operating 1-stop school-based services. The curr_chunk outlines the plan to operate 1-stop school-based or community-based service centers for at-risk students and their families, providing various support services. Additionally, it supports the dissemination of a coordinated educational support services program to other local educational agencies. The curr_chunk focuses on the application requirements for operating service centers for at-risk students and their families. An applicant seeking assistance under this Act must submit an application that includes evidence of the need for a coordinated services plan among students, expected improvements in educational outcomes for at-risk students, a plan for assessing outcomes of support services, participation of a program advisory council, and a plan for enhancing educational achievement. The applicant must submit a plan for improving educational achievement of at-risk youth through coordination of support services, staff development, and parental involvement. The plan should also include continuing support services after Federal assistance ends and the capacity to serve as a model for other educational agencies. Special considerations for awards under this Act include geographic distribution, districts with at-risk students, interagency collaboration, and districts experiencing an increase in at-risk students. The Secretary of Education will coordinate application reviews with other relevant departments. Grants can last up to 3 years, contingent on satisfactory progress. The Federal Share for project costs is limited to 80%, with the remaining funds from non-Federal sources. Local educational agencies are not liable for costs of services not required by law. Support services provided do not guarantee continuation if the program is terminated. Planning costs are capped at 1/3 of project funds. Project funds can be used for planning a coordinated services program, with a limitation of 50% for direct services delivery. Federal funds must supplement, not replace, non-Federal funds for the project. SEC. 12. FEDERAL INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE. A Federal Interagency Task Force is established to improve support services for at-risk students by facilitating interagency collaboration and coordination at the Federal, State, and local levels. The Task Force will identify and eliminate barriers to collaboration, develop joint programs, and make recommendations to Congress. The Federal Interagency Task Force aims to improve support services for at-risk students by facilitating collaboration at various levels and making recommendations to Congress for a comprehensive youth policy and legislative action. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on grantees under the Act to identify obstacles in developing coordinated support services programs and report findings to Congress with recommendations for legislative action. $250,000,000 is authorized for the fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for subsequent years."
