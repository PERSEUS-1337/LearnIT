Key issues include the cost-effectiveness and safety of commercial services for transporting astronauts, readiness of spacecraft for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, and the impact on resources for science missions and education programs. NASA's budget constraints have led to reductions in funding for science missions and education programs. Major policy developments include the cancellation of the Vision for Space Exploration and reliance on commercial services for crew access to Earth orbit. The final space shuttle flight took place in July 2011, and annual budget reductions have been implemented since FY2011 due to government-wide fiscal constraints. NASA's budget constraints have led to reductions in funding for science missions and education programs. The agency's FY2015 budget is $18.010 billion, with approximately 17,700 civil servants. NASA has four mission directorates, including Human Exploration and Operations for spaceflight activities and Science for robotic missions like the Hubble Space Telescope and Mars rover Curiosity. NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate develops new technologies for future space missions, while the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate focuses on aircraft and aviation systems. The Office of Education manages education programs for students and the public, conducted by NASA's nine field centers. NASA has several field centers including the Space Center in Houston, TX; Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, FL; Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA; Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL; and Stennis Space Center near Slidell, MS. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA is operated by the California Institute of Technology. Goddard Space Flight Center manages various facilities in NY, WV, and VA. Marshall Space Flight Center manages the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, LA. The NASA Shared Services Center is located at Stennis Space Center. Congress passed NASA authorization acts regularly until the 1990s, with fewer acts in recent years. In the past decade, Congress enacted three NASA authorization acts: in 2005, 2008, and 2010. The 2010 act terminated the space shuttle program and established new programs for human spaceflight, including developing a commercial space transportation capability and a crew capsule known as the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). The 2010 NASA authorization act terminated the space shuttle program and established new programs for human spaceflight, including the development of the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Space Launch System (SLS) for cargo and crew access to the ISS. It supported the full utilization of the ISS through at least 2020 and directed NASA on ISS utilization and management, cancelling the Constellation program aimed at implementing the Vision for Space Exploration announced by President Bush in 2004. The Vision for Space Exploration included returning the space shuttle to flight status, retiring it in 2010, using Russian Soyuz spacecraft for human access to space, completing construction of the ISS, developing new systems for human space exploration under the Constellation program, and concerns about cost and schedule. In 2009, a committee chaired by Norman R. Augustine found that developing Ares I, Orion, and other Constellation systems would take longer than anticipated. Without increased funding, human exploration could not continue meaningfully. The committee also highlighted the importance of extending U.S. use of the ISS and noted that commercial services for launching crews into Earth orbit were feasible. In 2010, the Obama Administration proposed changes for NASA based on the Augustine report, leading to a debate in Congress about the Constellation program. The 2010 NASA authorization act addressed human spaceflight, science, aeronautics, space technology, and education, authorizing appropriations through FY2013. In July 2013, the House Committee considered new authorization legislation. In July 2013, the 113th Congress considered new NASA authorization legislation. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology passed the NASA Authorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 2687) and an alternative bill (H.R. 2616) was introduced. A bipartisan compromise bill, the NASA Authorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4412), was later passed by the House. In the Senate, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation also considered a NASA Authorization Act of 2013 (S. 1317). However, none of these bills were ultimately enacted. The 114th Congress is expected to make a renewed effort to pass NASA authorization legislation. The 114th Congress is expected to make a renewed effort to pass NASA authorization legislation. Funding for NASA is provided in the annual Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations act, with $18.010 billion allocated for NASA in FY2015. The Administration's FY2015 budget requested $17.461 billion for NASA, with an additional $886 million proposed as part of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. Congressional budget justifications provide detailed information on how the funding would be used. NASA funding has been a topic of discussion, with advocates comparing current levels to historical trends. Funding has remained fairly steady in inflation-adjusted terms over the past 20 years, but dropped in FY2013 to a level below any other year since FY1988. The ratio of NASA funding to U.S. gross domestic product is often cited as well. The ratio of NASA funding to U.S. GDP has shown a decline over the past 20 years, with peaks after Apollo and Challenger missions. FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015 appropriations were lower than any year since FY1960. Advocates argue for increased funding, while others suggest allocating based on current program merit or reducing federal programs to address deficit and debt. Actual appropriations for NASA often do not match the amounts authorized and may not trend in the same direction. Concerns arise that NASA is being asked to do more than it can afford, as seen in the discrepancies between authorized and actual funding levels. The Vision for Space Exploration proposed limited funding increases in FY2005 and FY2006, with a budget projection until FY2020 that only kept up with inflation. Concerns were raised about the impact on NASA's other programs, such as science and aeronautics, due to the emphasis on human spaceflight. Former NASA officials criticized the decreasing budget support for the Vision, leading to potential budget pressures on the agency's science program. The Augustine report in 2009 highlighted the need for an additional $3 billion per year for NASA's plans, leading to the 2010 NASA authorization act. Despite changes made, concerns persist about NASA being asked to do too much with too little funding. NASA's goals and priorities face challenges due to limited budget, as highlighted by the NASA Inspector General in 2014. The agency has a history of successful space missions, including the Mercury and Apollo programs. The space shuttle program was launched in 1981 after a hiatus, but faced setbacks like the Columbia disaster in 2003. NASA limited space shuttle flights after the Columbia disaster in 2003, with the last flight in July 2011. Currently, NASA relies on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for ISS access, focusing on ISS operations, U.S. commercial crew launches, and future spacecraft for exploration beyond Earth orbit. The ISS, assembled in space, houses crew living space, labs, solar arrays, and more. International cooperation on the ISS is governed by the Intergovernmental Agreement on Space Station. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Space Station Cooperation, signed in 1998 by multiple countries, governs international cooperation on the ISS. It is implemented through memoranda of understanding between NASA and partner agencies. The United States also has a separate ISS participation agreement with Brazil. Issues of congressional interest include maximizing ISS research utilization and management. During the design and construction of the ISS, cost growth and schedule delays led to downsizing, raising concerns about its research capacity. Congress is interested in maximizing research utilization on the ISS and prioritizing human spaceflight research. Factors limiting research use include limited cargo capacity and funding constraints. The ISS faces challenges such as limited cargo capacity, funding constraints, and crew time for research utilization. Despite exceeding its goal of spending 35 hours per week on scientific investigations since 2011, research facility occupancy was at 60% as of mid-FY2014. Increasing crew members could potentially add 33 hours of crew time for research. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 required NASA to allocate funds for ISS research to life and microgravity science research. A research plan was issued in June 2006, outlining R&D activities in various areas and describing the ISS as a test-bed for future missions to the moon and Mars, a laboratory for human space exploration research, and a platform for managing international partnerships. The National Research Council expressed concern that the objectives of the ISS no longer prioritize fundamental biological and physical research. They emphasized the importance of fully utilizing the ISS for life and physical sciences research, as it is the only platform of its kind available. The National Research Council emphasized the need for full utilization of the ISS for life and physical sciences research in the upcoming decade, recommending NASA to intensify research efforts and engage world-class scientists and engineers. NASA will consider these recommendations in decisions on investments for new research facilities and capabilities on the ISS. NASA officials stated that a steering committee will develop a framework for implementing the decadal survey's recommendations, with current ISS experiments aligning with high-priority areas. NASA will adapt survey results in future research solicitations, and an evaluation committee will assess progress annually. The 2005 NASA authorization act designated the U.S. portion of the ISS as a national laboratory to increase utilization by federal agencies and the private sector. NASA designated the U.S. portion of the ISS as a national laboratory in 2005 to increase utilization by federal agencies and the private sector. In 2007, NASA submitted a plan for this designation, emphasizing the need for cost-effective transportation services. Congress directed NASA to establish an advisory committee in 2008, but the appointment of members was delayed due to the transition of ISS national laboratory management to an independent organization in 2010. In 2010, NASA transitioned ISS national laboratory management to an independent, nonprofit organization. The 2010 authorization act directed NASA to contract with a nonprofit organization, resulting in the selection of CASIS as the managing organization for the ISS national laboratory in 2011. CASIS issued its first research proposal solicitation in 2012 and awarded its first grants in November of the same year. In November 2012, CASIS awarded its first grants for research on protein crystallization. NASA Inspector General recommended developing precise annual performance metrics to assess CASIS's success in fostering private research on the ISS. CASIS identified performance metrics in its FY2014 program plan. Government rights to intellectual property on the ISS may deter commercial research. Authorization bills in the 113th Congress aimed to address this issue. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 extended U.S. operation of the ISS until at least FY2020, stating that systems can perform safely beyond their original design lifetime with proper maintenance. A comprehensive review identified spare parts needed for utilization through 2020, finding no issues outside the normal range of spaceflight risk. The ISS components are compatible with the extension to 2020 either as is or with modification. The Government Accountability Office found NASA's analysis of extending the ISS to 2020 to be supported by reliable data and reasonable methodologies. Estimates for spare and replacement parts are sensitive to hardware reliability assumptions. The Administration plans to extend the ISS service life to 2024. NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Committee recommended reviewing objectives for continued ISS use to balance costs and safety risks. The NASA Inspector General highlighted challenges in extending the ISS. The NASA Inspector General's report examined challenges in extending ISS operations to 2024, noting risks like insufficient power generation and optimistic cost projections. Russia initially announced not extending ISS participation past 2020, but subsequent reports suggested they were still considering an extension. The space shuttle and Russian spacecraft were previously used for ISS missions. The Russian Soyuz spacecraft carries crews and cargo to the ISS, while the Progress spacecraft only carries cargo. Soyuz is currently the only option for crew access to the ISS since the end of the space shuttle program. Congress extended a waiver for payments to Russia for Soyuz flights until July 1, 2016. A Soyuz is always attached to the station as a \"lifeboat\" in case of emergency and must be replaced every six months. NASA has contracted with U.S. companies for cargo delivery to the ISS under the Commercial Resupply Services program. The first operational commercial cargo mission for ISS resupply was in October 2012. Commercial cargo missions for ISS resupply were conducted by SpaceX in October 2012 and Orbital Sciences Corporation in January and February 2014. These missions were part of NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. Other noncommercial options for cargo delivery include the European ATV and Japanese HTV, but they have smaller cargo capacities. Only SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft can return cargo to Earth. NASA is also collaborating with U.S. companies to develop commercial crew transportation services to low Earth orbit. NASA collaborated with U.S. companies to develop commercial crew transportation services to low Earth orbit. The Commercial Crew Development program partnered with eight companies to develop crew transportation concepts. In 2012, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corporation under the Commercial Crew Integrated Capability program. Boeing and SpaceX agreements are expected to result in critical design reviews, while Sierra Nevada's agreement will advance towards critical design with less funding. In 2014, contracts were awarded to Boeing and SpaceX under the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability program for final development and testing necessary for crewed demonstration. NASA collaborated with U.S. companies to develop commercial crew transportation services to low Earth orbit. The final development, testing, and verification for crewed demonstration flights are underway, with initial service missions to the ISS planned. Commercial services are expected to be available by 2017, with potential providers aiming for an earlier date. Congress is monitoring progress, including the potential commercial market, use of Space Act Agreements, and crew safety. Moving to a commercial model could reduce costs by sharing operating costs and fostering competition among providers. NASA conducted an assessment in 2011 to determine the commercial market for crew and cargo spacecraft, identifying potential demand in space programs of other countries and private space tourism. The assessment projected a non-NASA market for crew transportation of 44 to 359 individuals over a 10-year period. The assessment projected a non-NASA market for crew transportation of between 44 and 359 individuals, driven by foreign space programs and private tourism. NASA's requirements for ISS crew rotation include two flights per year with up to four astronauts per flight, totaling up to 80 individuals over a 10-year period. Boeing is optimistic about non-NASA customers but primarily focuses on NASA. SpaceX is optimistic about the commercial potential of manned space flights, predicting more commercial flights than government ones in the future. However, some question whether the market can support multiple providers if NASA only requires two flights per year to the ISS. The Augustine report emphasized the importance of having multiple providers for reducing costs through competition in NASA's programs. The use of Space Act Agreements (SAAs) for CCDev and CCiCap awards allows for flexibility in milestones, schedules, and payments, but limits NASA's ability to set requirements. SAAs are funded partly or entirely by the company, avoiding accounting requirements and FAR rules. The use of Space Act Agreements (SAAs) for NASA's programs allows for flexibility in milestones, schedules, and payments, but limits NASA's ability to set requirements. SAAs cannot be used for procurement and may not be suitable for safety certification activities. NASA issued FAR-based contracts for early-stage activities related to safety certification and intends to do so for future crew transportation services procurements. The advent of commercial spacecraft carrying crews into space will require new processes for ensuring crew safety. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NASA are working to ensure safety regulations for commercial spacecraft carrying human crews. The Augustine committee recommended a strong mission assurance role for NASA in commercial crew transport services. A consistent regulatory regime is crucial for the success of commercial human spaceflight providers. The Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC) strongly supports FAA licensing of commercial human spaceflight activities, including those conducted for NASA. NASA is committed to ensuring safety requirements for crewed commercial spacecraft, which are equivalent to those for NASA spacecraft. NASA's goal is to develop new customers and markets for private human spaceflight capabilities. NASA is committed to ensuring safety standards for Crew Transportation System certification for commercial missions, equivalent to Government human spaceflight missions. Certification covers all aspects of the system, including development, test, evaluation, program management, flight readiness, launch, landing, recovery, mission operations, engineering, and maintenance. Concerns in the Commercial Crew program include insufficient funding, which can lead to lower performance and higher failure risk, and safety risks related to the CCtCap acquisition strategy. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to develop the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Space Launch System (SLS) for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit. The MPCV, now known as Orion, is required to advance the development of the Constellation program's Orion capsule. Issues for Congress include the schedule for Orion and SLS development and the likely schedule of flights. The 2010 NASA authorization act set a target date of December 31, 2016, for full operational capability of the MPCV (now Orion) and an initial version of the SLS. NASA plans an uncrewed test flight of Orion and SLS (EM-1) in FY2018 and a crewed flight (EM-2) in FY2021-FY2022. An uncrewed test flight of Orion on a commercial Delta IV rocket was conducted in December 2014. The first flight of Orion without the SLS was conducted in December 2014 on a commercial Delta IV rocket. Congressional advocates of the SLS have tried to speed up the schedule, but NASA states that the EM-1 test flight date is difficult to move up due to technical requirements. However, accelerating the schedule for the EM-2 flight may be more feasible with additional funding. Increased funding would not speed up the EM-1 flight, but would provide more schedule confidence. On the other hand, the EM-2 flight is constrained by proposed budgets, and additional funds could accelerate it. The launch schedule for the SLS core stage has been delayed, with the EM-1 launch date set for 2017 and EM-2 for 2021. Concerns arise over the low expected launch rate for Orion and SLS once operational, with NASA aiming for missions every two years. The low flight rate is seen as a serious problem, as maintaining program momentum and keeping flight teams sharp will be challenging. NASA officials have expressed a desire to fly at least once per year to address these issues. NASA aims to fly at least once per year with the SLS and Orion programs, analyzing the feasibility within budget constraints. Cost estimates have been established for the SLS and ground systems, with a similar baseline expected for Orion. However, the long-term affordability of the human exploration program remains uncertain due to incomplete cost estimates that do not include life-cycle expenses. The baseline estimate for the SLS does not include costs after EM-1 or future SLS versions. NASA policy requires a 70% joint cost and schedule confidence level, but the program is pursuing more aggressive internal schedule goals with confidence levels as low as 30%. Administrator Bolden expressed confidence in the SLS program even with lower joint confidence levels. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 directed NASA to include funding and schedule projections for Orion and the SLS consistent with a 70% joint confidence level. Initial skepticism was expressed about the SLS capabilities, with debates on its necessity for lifting payloads weighing up to 130 metric tons. The NASA Administrator argued against the immediate need for a 130 metric ton rocket, citing advancements in technology that may reduce its weight in the future. Some believe the 130 metric ton version is essential for missions to Mars or asteroids. NASA has identified three generations of the SLS: Block 1 (70 metric tons), Block 1A (105 metric tons), and Block 2 (130 metric tons). The NASA Administrator questioned the necessity of a 130 metric ton rocket, suggesting future technology advancements could reduce its weight. NASA has outlined three generations of the SLS: Block 1 (70 metric tons), Block 1A (105 metric tons), and Block 2 (130 metric tons), each serving specific roles in exploration missions beyond Earth orbit. The SLS and Orion spacecraft are designed for deep space exploration, but can also serve as backup systems for delivering crew and cargo to the ISS if needed. The Augustine report suggested that if NASA's commercial crew efforts fail, developing Orion and a heavy lift vehicle like the SLS would be a cost-effective backup option. However, concerns exist about the SLS's overcapacity for ISS missions and the ISS's planned end date in 2020 conflicting with the timeline for Orion and SLS development. If NASA's commercial crew efforts fail, using Orion and the SLS as a backup for ISS access is a possibility. However, concerns arise regarding the SLS's overcapacity for ISS missions and the planned end date of the ISS in 2020 conflicting with the timeline for Orion and SLS development. This could lead to continued reliance on Russia for Soyuz flights, which is seen as an unattractive option by many policy makers. The Vision for Space Exploration aimed to establish the Moon and Mars as NASA's goals for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. Experts suggested alternative goals such as immediate missions to Mars or human missions to asteroids as steps towards future destinations. The Augustine committee highlighted Mars as the most scientifically interesting destination in the inner solar system with resources similar to Earth's. The Augustine committee concluded that Mars is not a viable first destination for human exploration due to cost and safety risks. NASA's plan is for an asteroid to be the first destination beyond Earth orbit, followed by an orbit of Mars and a Mars landing. NASA aims to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s, in line with the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. The 2010 act mandated a review by the National Academies of human space flight goals, finding Mars as the horizon goal for human space exploration. All long-range space programs converge on Mars as the ultimate destination, with various mission sequences considered. No specific pathway was recommended. NASA's proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) aims to capture a small asteroid robotically and explore it with astronauts around the Moon. There is more international enthusiasm for a mission to the Moon rather than an asteroid, but interest in robotic missions to asteroids remains high. NASA's proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) aims to capture a large boulder from the surface of an asteroid using new solar electric propulsion technology. The mission would serve as an early destination for Orion and the SLS, meeting goals for asteroid science and advanced technology demonstration. The Keck Institute for Space Studies estimated the full life-cycle cost of the mission to be around $2.6 billion, with NASA officials noting differences in the proposed mission. The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) aims to capture a large boulder from an asteroid using new solar electric propulsion technology. The cost of the mission is expected to be less than the estimated $2.6 billion. A Mission Concept Review is scheduled for February 2015, but the ARM has faced opposition in Congress. An alternative option proposed is a fly-by of Mars for the first crewed flight of Orion and SLS. NASA's current focus is on Orion and the SLS, with little work being done on developing complementary missions. NASA's current focus is on Orion and the SLS, with limited work on developing landers and surface systems. Without a program for these systems, astronauts will be restricted to orbital missions using Orion. Funding constraints make it unlikely for NASA to start developing additional exploration hardware, delaying such efforts until the 2020s. Surface exploration missions may not be possible until the late 2020s at the earliest. Human spaceflight activities at NASA are funded by the Exploration account, which supports the development of future capabilities like Orion, the Space Launch System, and the Commercial Crew program. The Space Operations account funds operational programs such as the International Space Station, Soyuz flights, and commercial cargo flights. The Exploration account supports the development of Orion, the SLS, and the Commercial Crew program. In FY2015, funding for Orion and the SLS decreased while funding for the Commercial Crew program increased. This difference in priorities was noted by many in Congress. The FY2015 report of the Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed requiring certified cost and pricing data for NASA's commercial crew contracts, which was seen as controversial due to differing priorities between Congress and the Administration. NASA's Science Mission Directorate conducts research in various divisions, and the Joint Agency Satellite Division handles systems engineering and hardware. The Science Mission Directorate at NASA utilizes decadal surveys for program planning and prioritization, with a focus on Earth Science, Mars exploration, near-Earth object research, the James Webb Space Telescope, and budget issues. The National Research Council plays a key role in providing recommendations for research in science and engineering fields. Decadal surveys play a crucial role in guiding NASA's science programs by establishing a consensus within the scientific community on priority research areas and future missions. Congress often references these surveys to support NASA programs. NASA uses the recommendations from these surveys to prioritize future flight missions, including space observatories and probes. NASA must adapt science-based decadal survey recommendations to actual budgets, technological capabilities, national policy, partnership opportunities, and programmatic factors for future flight missions, technology development, and research proposals. The Earth Science program aims to study planet Earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs, focusing on advancing knowledge of Earth as a system to address environmental challenges and improve life on our planet. The statutory goal is to pursue Earth observations, research, and applications to better understand Earth, its support for life, and the impact of human activities on its future. The Earth Science program has expanded recently, with increased funding from Congress and the Administration to support research on climate change. Some in Congress oppose further funding for Earth Science, citing potential decreases in other NASA activities. Congressional policy makers have a long-standing interest in Earth Science and its impact on the environment. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a strategic plan for greater cooperation among U.S. civilian Earth observation programs, including NASA, NOAA, and USGS. This plan aims to transition NASA research and assets to NOAA and USGS operations. Achieving Congress's goals for the NASA-NOAA relationship is challenging. The Joint Agency Satellite Division acquires Earth-observing satellites for NOAA using funds from NOAA. In the 112th Congress, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding these activities in NASA's budget. NASA's goals for the Mars Exploration program include determining if life ever arose on Mars, characterizing the climate and geology of Mars, and preparing for human exploration. The NRC decadal survey identified high-priority science goals related to Mars exploration. In recent years, NASA has proposed near-term reductions in funding for Mars Exploration. The Mars Science Laboratory mission delivered the rover Curiosity, which discovered flowing streambeds on Mars. The MAVEN mission aims to study liquid water on Mars, atmospheric loss, climate history, and habitability. Despite higher costs for mission development, NASA projects funding increases for new Mars missions in the future. Advocates fear near-term cuts in funding for Mars missions despite projected increases in the future. Research on near-Earth objects (NEOs) has gained attention due to concerns about potential threats to Earth from asteroids and comets. Hearings have been held by government committees on tracking and mitigating the threat of NEOs. NASA committed to cataloging 90% of NEOs larger than 1 kilometer in 1998. NASA committed in 1998 to catalog 90% of NEOs larger than 1 kilometer. By December 2014, 868 asteroids of this size had been discovered, representing about 95% of the total. Despite the potential global catastrophe, none of these NEOs pose a threat to Earth in the next 100 years. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 expanded the survey to objects larger than 140 meters, aiming to catalog 90% within 15 years. However, as of September 2014, only about 10% of NEOs larger than 140 meters had been cataloged, with challenges in structure and resources hindering progress towards the 90% goal by 2020. The NEO program faces challenges due to lack of structure and resources, could benefit from better oversight of grants and partnerships with other agencies. The Chelyabinsk asteroid was 17 to 20 meters in diameter, while the Tunguska explosion object was 50 to 100 meters. NASA's proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission targets a 7 to 10-meter asteroid. The James Webb Space Telescope is larger than Hubble and operates in deep space. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is located in deep space, with a primary mirror larger than Hubble's and optimized for infrared observations. It is set to launch in October 2018, with a cost cap of $8 billion set by Congress. Despite technical challenges, work on JWST is on schedule and on budget according to a 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office. NASA is advised to update its cost risk analysis. The report recommended that NASA update its cost risk analysis regularly. Continued congressional oversight of the JWST program is likely. Funding for the James Webb Space Telescope is budgeted separately from the rest of the Astrophysics Division. Congress provided funding for a potential future mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. The NRC expressed reservations about the cost of a potential Europa mission, with NASA seeking concepts costing less than $1 billion. Congress appropriated $100 million in FY2015 for planning the mission in line with the planetary science decadal survey. NASA was directed to evaluate using the Space Launch System for the mission. In Astrophysics, the President's FY2015 request included funding for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). NASA planned to place the SOFIA aircraft in storage due to lack of international support for operating costs. Despite reaching full operating capability in 2014, delays in development led to reduced scientific impact. Congress allocated $70 million in FY2015 to maintain core operations and urged NASA to seek partners for full operational capacity. Recommendations in 2009 emphasized technology development for future missions. The Augustine committee and NRC recommended revitalizing NASA's space technology program through independent technology development. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 approved the establishment of a new space technology program, which later became the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) in 2013. NASA identified 14 space technology areas and prepared draft roadmaps for advancement. NASA identified 14 space technology areas and prepared draft roadmaps identifying the top technical challenges, spaceflight missions, and important terrestrial fields they could advance. The NRC evaluated and prioritized these results, which have been incorporated into revised roadmaps and form the basis of the current STMD research and development portfolio. The 2010 authorization act directed NASA to prepare an implementation plan, which included using space technology roadmaps and three thematic grand challenges to guide and prioritize future investments. The strategic plan for space technology, released in December 2012, outlined four goals: sustain human presence in space, explore the solar system, understand Earth and the universe, and energize the domestic space enterprise. The plan emphasized core investments in near-term technologies for mission-specific objectives, making up 70% of the portfolio. The strategic plan for space technology, released in December 2012, outlined core technology investments in eight areas including launch and in-space propulsion, high data-rate communications, lightweight space structures, robotics, environmental control, space radiation mitigation, scientific instruments, and entry, descent, and landing. The plan also directed the Administration to develop a national policy for space technology development programs through 2020. NASA collaborates with other federal agencies on space technology initiatives. NASA collaborates with federal agencies on space technology initiatives, sharing scientific data and avoiding duplication of effort. The President's FY2015 request for Space Technology was $706 million, with Congress providing a more modest increase. NASA also conducts research on aeronautics, with a history of disagreement in Congress about its role. NASA's aeronautics programs focus on long-term research with public benefits like reducing noise and emissions, improving safety, and air traffic control. In 2013, NASA announced a new vision for aeronautics research, highlighting global growth in air mobility and climate issues as key drivers for aviation changes in the next 20-40 years. NASA announced a new vision for aeronautics research in 2013, focusing on global growth in air mobility, sustainability, and technological advancements. The vision identified six research thrust areas, including safe, efficient global operations, innovation in supersonic aircraft, and a transition to low-carbon propulsion. NASA plans to reorganize its aeronautics research program to align with this vision, with existing projects expected to continue while research not related to the six thrust areas will be phased out. NASA's aeronautics research program is undergoing reorganization to align with a new vision focusing on global air mobility, sustainability, and technological advancements. Funding for education activities within NASA's mission directorates has historically been significant, with a policy to allocate at least 1% of the mission budget for education and outreach. The Administration proposed a government-wide reorganization of STEM education activities in the FY2014 budget, leading to the termination of numerous NASA education programs. NASA's education activities, including those by the Science Mission Directorate, were proposed for termination as part of a government-wide reorganization plan. Nearly half of the activities to be terminated were at NASA. Funding for STEM education at NASA was to be reduced and consolidated in the Office of Education, with more funding directed to other agencies like the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education. NASA planned to share its knowledge and assets with these agencies and fund the best education programs through an internal competitive process. Congressional reaction to the reorganization plan was mixed. The proposed government-wide reorganization plan faced mixed reactions, with particular concern for its impact on NASA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 did not adopt the reorganization, maintaining STEM activities funding within existing structures. NASA was allowed to reorganize and consolidate activities in the Office of Education. In the FY2015 budget, a new reorganization of the federal STEM education portfolio was proposed, focusing on consolidating funding within agencies. The FY2015 proposal aimed to consolidate funding within agencies, terminating the previous Science Mission Directorate policy of allocating 1% of funding to education and public outreach. Some education activities continued to be funded through Science. Funding for the Office of Education is provided by NASA's Education account, supporting programs like the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, EPSCoR, and MUREP. Congress also created a new budget line item for Education in Science. Congress established a new budget line item for Education in the Science appropriation for FY2015, following the 2010 authorization act that set a new direction for NASA. Key issues include the cost-effectiveness and safety of commercial services for transporting astronauts to Earth orbit, the readiness of Orion and SLS spacecraft for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, and the sufficiency of budgets for these projects. Key questions regarding the development and use of Orion and the SLS spacecraft include their schedules, budgets, lift capability, backup options for crew access to the ISS, potential destinations, and the impact on NASA's science missions. Balancing priorities in a time of budget constraints is crucial, including determining the appropriate level of support for Earth science, planetary science, and other scientific fields. Key questions regarding NASA's science missions include the expansion of Earth science in its portfolio, proposed reductions in funding for planetary science, concerns about collisions with near-Earth objects, and budget constraints. The 114th Congress will likely address these concerns during oversight of NASA."
