The industry-government working group is focusing on the health of U.S. herds as a top priority, especially in light of concerns such as BSE and bioterrorism. There is also a debate on the need for mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meats and other products. The industry-government working group is focusing on the health of U.S. herds as a top priority, especially in light of concerns such as BSE and bioterrorism. The debate on the need for mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) for meats and other products has fueled interest in increased animal ID capabilities. Animal ID and meat traceability are topics of discussion for the new omnibus farm bill in 2007. Traceability, identity preservation, and product segregation also apply to other agricultural products and issues like genetically modified crops, labeling of GM foods, and organic foods. Animal ID is the marking of farm animals for tracking purposes, but a nationwide system in the US is not yet in place. It is a component of meat traceability, which involves tracking products from birth to consumption. Traceability can provide information about the source animal and the entire production process. Traceability conveys product information from source animal to consumer, aiding in production characteristics identification. Bar codes on processed food help with tracking and managing inventories. Consumers may prefer meat from animals with traceability. Traceability helps firms separate and verify unique products like organic, humane, or environmentally raised meat, eggs, or milk. Animal ID aids in tracking diseases in U.S. herds or flocks, eradicating them, and preventing spread. It reassures foreign buyers about U.S. animal health and meets other countries' import requirements. ID and tracing systems have commercial and regulatory uses in animal health programs. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) work to protect animal populations from diseases and ensure the safety of meat and poultry. They collaborate with other agencies to safeguard the food supply from threats like bacterial foodborne illnesses and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Improved traceability in the U.S. food safety system, including rigorous traceback and animal ID systems, could help facilitate recalls, contain the spread of illnesses, and limit legal and financial liabilities for firms. This enhanced traceability is essential for building public confidence and has both commercial and regulatory implications. The 2002 farm bill requires retailers to provide country-of-origin information on raw products like beef, pork, and lamb. The implementation of the COOL law was postponed multiple times, with meats labeled as U.S. origin needing to come from animals born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States. The law prohibits a mandatory ID system to verify country of origin. The COOL law prohibits a mandatory ID system for country of origin verification but allows for a \"verifiable audit trail\" for compliance. This could lead to tracing red meats back to their birth animals. Animal ID methods have evolved from hot iron brands in the 1800s to current methods like ear tags and freeze brands. Some producers use various identification methods like neck chains, freeze brands, and leg bands, including radio frequency ID (RFID) transponders for tracking animals. Mandatory ID requirements for interstate swine movements have been in place since 1988 for disease control. Brucellosis, a contagious disease affecting cattle, bison, and swine, has been largely eradicated in commercial U.S. herds. APHIS also has programs for tuberculosis, scrapie in sheep, pseudorabies in swine, Texas fever, and scabies. APHIS has established programs for various animal diseases such as tuberculosis, scrapie in sheep, pseudorabies in swine, Texas fever, and scabies in cattle. Additionally, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service operates a voluntary process verification program for livestock and meat producers to ensure consistent quality products. This program allows for marketing claims to be verified by USDA and marketed as \"USDA Process Verified.\" The USDA has programs for animal diseases and a voluntary process verification program for livestock and meat producers. These programs aim to ensure quality products and traceability, but there are gaps in the national ID system. Only a small percentage of U.S. calves are vaccinated and tagged, and existing ID programs may not document all animal movements. Place of birth is not always denoted in these programs. Existing animal ID and traceability systems in the U.S. can be tedious and time-consuming to navigate due to independent implementation, conflicting purposes, and disparate information collection. These limitations were highlighted after cases of BSE emerged, with the first case in 2003 involving a Holstein dairy cow traced back to a herd in Alberta, Canada. Dairy farmers typically have more detailed information about individual animals for milk production and breeding. The U.S. authorities ended their BSE field investigation after identifying only 28 out of 80 cows that entered the country with the BSE cow from Canada. An international expert panel recommended implementing a national identification system for North American farming to improve traceability. The lack of a national ID system was lamented during the investigation of the second U.S. BSE case in a Texas-born cow. A national animal ID system was lacking during the investigation of a third BSE case in an Alabama beef cow in 2006, hindering traceability efforts. Efforts to establish a coordinated national animal ID system began in the early 2000s, with USDA taking the lead in planning and funding its establishment. The USDA led efforts to establish a national animal ID system, facing criticism for indecision and confusion among livestock producers. Producers expressed concerns about privacy and mandatory participation. The National Food Animal Identification Task Force presented a draft plan accepted by the U.S. Animal Health Association in 2002. The USAHA asked APHIS to form a team to develop a detailed animal ID system in 2002. The plan aimed to identify all animals and premises exposed to disease within 48 hours. The USAIP published in 2003 focused on maintaining the health of the U.S. animal herd. The USAIP proposed a centralized database for individual animal and group identification for disease control purposes. States were required to implement premises identification systems by specific deadlines, with all animals to have unique IDs for rapid traceback in case of disease outbreaks. The USDA announced initiatives to restore confidence in U.S. beef safety after BSE was discovered in a cow. This included implementing a national animal identification system with funding from Congress. The USDA received $33 million for its animal ID activities in FY2005 and FY2006, with a pending $33 million request for FY2007. By late November 2006, over 332,000 premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million sites. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) builds upon the USAIP and seeks industry input as it progresses. USDA released a draft strategic plan in May 2005 for achieving a nationwide program, proposing stakeholders to identify premises and animals according to NAIS standards. The USDA proposed requiring stakeholders to identify premises and animals according to NAIS standards by January 2008, and full recording of animal movements by January 2009. Secretary Johanns announced four guiding principles for a national ID system on August 30, 2005, emphasizing the need for efficient tracking of animals without burdening producers and incorporating new technologies. The USDA proposed a national ID system with guidelines for animal movement data maintenance in a private system accessible to state and federal authorities. They considered developing a metadata repository to work with multiple databases for tracking animal movement in case of disease incidents. The USDA outlined an aggressive timeline for full implementation of the NAIS by 2009, with benchmarks for achieving operational status by 2007. A draft user guide was distributed in November 2006, replacing previous program documents and assuring producers that participation is voluntary and their private information will be protected. The draft user guide outlines steps for full participation in the NAIS, including premises registration, animal identification, and selection of an animal tracking database. Covered animal species include cattle, bison, poultry, swine, sheep, goats, cervids, horses, and camelids. Household pets and animals not listed are excluded. Animals moved in groups do not need individual identification. The NAIS requires animals entering commerce or commingling with others to be identified. Producers are responsible for ID device costs. Approximately 348,000 premises with animals are registered, representing a fourth of US livestock farms. Registration rates vary among states. The NCBA announced a privately-held ID system for tracking cattle. The United States Animal Identification Organization (USAIO) formed under NCBA auspices in January 2006 to manage the industry-led animal movement database in accordance with the NAIS. Some members of the House Agriculture Committee called on USDA to implement a private sector-based system, citing the success of private-based systems in other nations. R-CALF has not endorsed the private approach. R-CALF United Stockgrowers of America has not endorsed the private approach to the USAIP plan, citing national security and public accountability concerns. The USDA's latest thinking on the NAIS is that participation is voluntary at the Federal level, but some state animal health officials disagree. The USDA is facing disagreement over the implementation of a mandatory national animal ID system for breeding cattle. Various groups, including state animal health officials and consumer advocacy organizations, are pushing for the system despite concerns about costs and effectiveness. Estimators have differing assumptions about the costs of a national animal ID program, with estimates ranging from $122 million annually for a multi-species plan to $540 million over five years for a cattle program. Costs include initial tagging of newborn bovines and tracking animals as movements warrant. As traceability increases, so do likely costs for animal ID and product tracking. The meat industry argues that linking animal ID prior to slaughter with product tracking after processing will be difficult and costly. Estimates for industry COOL costs range from $1-$3 billion for cattle and beef sectors alone. Some challenge these costs, with one study estimating COOL recordkeeping costs for all covered commodities at $70-$193 million annually. The meat industry argues that the costs associated with the USAIP will be substantial, with estimates ranging from $70-$193 million annually. Producer groups suggest that the government should share costs with the industry to prevent the burden from being passed on to farmers, ranchers, or consumers. USAIP acknowledges the need for a public/private funding plan to oversee, maintain, and improve necessary infrastructure for safeguarding animal health in American agriculture. The need for public funding for an animal ID program to protect American animal agriculture is debated, with some arguing for federal spending control. Proposed bills suggest shared expenses between the government, states, and industry, with producers covering costs for ID devices. USDA estimates costs for visual ID tags, devices with radio frequency transponders, and injectable electronic ID devices. Tracking database costs are not provided. In Canada, the cattle ID program was developed for less than $4 million (Canadian dollars) and costs approximately C$1 million per year. Producers buy tags for C$0.80 to C$1.60 each and are moving to an RFID system at an estimated cost of C$2.00 per animal. Some producers are concerned about liability and public scrutiny regarding the use of RFID systems for animal identification. Documentation of management practices can help protect against liability, but there are concerns about public access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. The evolving ID system for animal movement records aims to protect business information and limit government involvement to obtaining disease information only. Some in the industry prefer a private third party to collect and maintain animal data to avoid government intrusion. Several proposed bills have called for more explicitly shielding animal ID data from public scrutiny. Traceability costs could impact the industry's competitiveness, with larger retailers and meat packers potentially shifting compliance costs to farms and ranches. This could make it harder for smaller, independent operations to survive. On the other hand, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be better equipped to implement traceability. Improved traceability is crucial for maintaining foreign market access, as other countries are developing systems that could become technical barriers to trade. The United States needs to align with international animal tracking systems to avoid losing international markets. Quick tracing of suspected diseases will be vital as export potential grows. Japanese officials required proof that U.S. beef was not of Canadian origin, complicating decisions on reopening borders. The \"Beef Export Verification\" program was introduced to satisfy Japanese demands. However, after a U.S. BSE cow was announced in December 2003, Japan suspended imports of U.S. cattle and beef. After difficult negotiations, the Japanese market briefly reopened in late 2005 for some U.S. beef meeting special requirements. However, in January 2006, Japan blocked all U.S. beef again due to finding ineligible products. Resumption of beef exports to Japan occurred later in 2006, with Korea also opening its market to some U.S. beef. Additionally, an international team emphasized the need for mandatory ID in Canada's BSE response. The adoption of a system in Canada in 2001 led to extended herd depopulations, with 2,800 animals killed. The European Union has mandatory programs for BSE cases, requiring all cattle to be tagged with a unique registration number and maintaining computerized databases. EU beef products must have labels indicating origin and traceability. Other beef importers are also moving towards national ID and traceability systems. Japan has implemented full traceability measures. Japan and Canada have implemented full traceability measures for their domestic beef industries. Japan began tagging all beef and dairy cattle in response to BSE cases, while Canada requires unique tags for cattle leaving their herd of origin. Australia also has a system to identify all cattle. Australia, like Canada, has a system to identify all cattle and uses labeling procedures to trace meat back to the animal's origin. Australia is moving towards a fully integrated program with electronic ID devices and a central database. USDA claims authority under the Animal Health Protection Act to implement an animal ID program, but some believe this may limit options. Congress has introduced bills to clarify USDA's authority and funding for animal ID programs. Congress has provided funding for animal ID and set conditions on its use. Policy options, including legislative alternatives, are expected to be discussed in the 110th Congress, particularly in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee has sponsored legislation mandating a program in the past. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a mandatory animal ID program and exempt certain information from FOIA disclosure. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a mandatory animal ID program and exempt certain information from FOIA disclosure. H.R. 3170 proposed a Livestock Identification Board for this purpose. Funding for animal ID development in FY2007 was included in the USDA appropriation bills, with the House version requiring a detailed plan from the Secretary before releasing funds. Concerns about progress and transparency were raised in both House and Senate reports. The Senate report (S.Rept. 109-266) requested a review of USDA's progress on the animal ID program and emphasized collaboration with private industry. Various amounts were allocated to ongoing ID pilot programs, with final action uncertain as of mid-January 2007. A floor amendment to prohibit funding for the program was defeated, and a proposal for a mandatory privately administered animal ID system was withdrawn. In the 108th Congress, several proposals were made to establish animal ID. In the 108th Congress, various proposals were introduced to establish animal ID programs, including H.R. 3170. The debate over the costs and benefits of expanded animal ID and meat traceability was discussed within the context of COOL. Panels of both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees held hearings on COOL implementation, providing lawmakers with more information on how animal ID systems could be utilized. Lawmakers learned about using animal ID systems for disease eradication and trade implications. Agriculture committees held hearings on animal ID, with industry lobbyists agreeing on the need for a national plan but consensus on key elements still evolving. Events like BSE outbreaks or bioterrorism could prompt further action."
