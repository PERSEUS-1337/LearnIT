    "content": "The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to assist small businesses to prevent monopoly formation and market failures. The Act defines a small business as one organized for profit, with a place of business in the U.S., operating primarily within the U.S., independently owned and operated. The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as one that is organized for profit, operates primarily within the U.S., is independently owned and not dominant in its field nationally. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards and alternative size standards based on net worth and income to determine eligibility for assistance and federal contracting purposes. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting. The size standards are based on number of employees, average annual receipts, average asset size, or a combination of factors. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses industry-specific size standards to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting. About 97% of all employer firms qualify as small, representing 30% of industry receipts. The SBA's size standards have been challenged due to lack of precise guidance on defining small businesses. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the SBA to establish an alternative size standard based on net worth and income after taxes. The SBA established an interim alternative size standard for loan guaranty programs, with limits on tangible net worth and average net income after taxes. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 directed the SBA to assign appropriate size standards to each industry classification. The SBA was directed to assign size standards to each industry classification, addressing the practice of limiting size standards and combining them within industrial groups for consistency. Recent legislation allows the SBA to establish different size standards for agricultural enterprises and directs federal agencies to use average annual gross receipts for size standards. Legislation introduced in multiple Congresses aims to authorize the SBA's Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy to approve or disapprove a size standard requested by a federal agency based on average annual gross receipts from the previous five years. In 2016, there were over 5.95 million employer firms in the United States, with most having 4 or fewer employees. The SBA's Administrator currently has the authority to approve or disapprove a size standard requested by a federal agency. The SBA traditionally applies economic factors to specific industries to determine small businesses. The data in Table 1 show how economic factors affect the definition of small businesses. For example, using the mid-point (50%) for three economic factors would result in different employee firm sizes being designated as small. In 2016, small businesses were defined based on the number of employees, total employment, and total annual payroll. Different thresholds were proposed, such as having no more than 999 employees or 1,999 employees. Other economic factors like assets or market share could also be used to define small businesses. The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized the SBA to establish size standards for determining eligibility for assistance. Decisions made in 1957 continue to shape current policy, with the SBA analyzing economic factors to ensure businesses are not dominant nationally. The SBA's size standards have been challenged due to a lack of precise guidance on defining small businesses. The agency has reviewed its standards periodically, but comprehensive revisions proposed in 1980, 1982, 1992, 2004, and 2008 were not fully implemented. Industry representatives and Members of Congress have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the size standards in targeting assistance to truly small firms. The SBA periodically reviews its industry size standards, as required by P.L. 111-240, to determine small business eligibility. The agency completed its first five-year review in 2016, resulting in over 72,000 small businesses gaining SBA eligibility. Multiple criteria are used to define a small business for spending and tax programs. The House Select Committee on Small Business in 1952 reviewed federal statutes, executive directives, and academic literature to define small businesses based on size relative to others in the field and independence. This was necessary to enhance economic competition and combat monopoly formation. The House Select Committee on Small Business in 1952 reviewed federal statutes and executive directives to define small businesses based on size relative to others in the field and independence, aiming to enhance economic competition and combat monopoly formation. The criteria for defining small businesses included factors like the number of employees, independence, and non-dominance within specific industries. The U.S. Census Bureau and the Select Committee on Small Business in 1952 defined small businesses based on criteria such as number of employees and annual sales. Small businesses accounted for a significant portion of business establishments, employees, and sales in 1952. Manufacturers are classified as small or large based on the percentage of total output produced by large firms. Most manufacturing firms with fewer than 50 employees are considered small, while others, like aircraft manufacturers, can have up to 2,500 employees and still be considered small. Federal agencies define small businesses using 500 employees as the dividing line between large and small firms for procurement purposes. The Select Committee reviewed the definition of small businesses, which was defined by Abraham Kaplan as those with no more than $1 million in annual sales, $100,000 in total assets, and no more than 250 employees. They decided not to create a rigid definition, stating that the concept of small business should be flexible and adaptable to different needs. The definition of small should be relative rather than absolute. The Small Business Act of 1953 provided flexibility in defining small businesses as independently owned and operated firms not dominant in their field. The SBA could adjust size standards for federal program eligibility based on industry-specific needs, recognizing that firms of varying sizes face similar economic challenges. The Small Business Act of 1953 allows for flexibility in defining small businesses for federal program eligibility, with size standards based on factors like number of employees, business volume, and industry characteristics. The act authorizes the SBA to determine specific concerns within industries to be designated as small businesses. The Small Business Act of 1953 allows the Administration to determine small-business concerns based on factors like number of employees and industry characteristics. Data from 1948 showed that the majority of business concerns had fewer than 8 employees. The SBA initially created two sets of size standards for federal procurement preferences and loan services, with a limit of 500 employees. The SBA determined small-business size standards based on industry dominance and economic data from the Census Bureau. Techniques were used to identify small concerns in each industry, with a dividing line separating small businesses from larger ones. The SBA adjusted its small business size standards in response to industry feedback, making them more liberal to include more firms. The new criteria focused on the number of employees for manufacturing firms and annual sales or receipts for other industries. The SBA adjusted small business size standards based on industry feedback, using number of employees for manufacturing firms and annual sales/receipts for other industries. Mr. Abels explained the rationale for this classification at a congressional hearing, highlighting the impact of automation on firm output. The SBA's size standards for small businesses vary by industry, with manufacturing firms based on number of employees and other industries based on annual sales/receipts. Manufacturing firms with up to 250 employees are considered small, while wholesalers need annual sales of $5 million or less to qualify. Construction firms must have average annual receipts below a certain threshold to be classified as small. The SBA's size standards for small businesses vary by industry, with manufacturing firms based on number of employees and other industries based on annual sales/receipts. Construction firms must have average annual receipts below a certain threshold to be classified as small. In 1977, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed the SBA's size standards, which remained mostly unchanged since 1957. In 1978, the GAO criticized the SBA's size standards as outdated and not economically justified. The standards had not been reviewed for over 15 years, leading to a high percentage of firms being classified as small. The GAO recommended that the SBA update and review its size standards. The GAO criticized the SBA's outdated size standards in 1978, recommending a reexamination to determine the size of businesses needing set-aside protection. Members objected to the standards at a House Committee hearing in 1979, suggesting a two-tiered system for set-aside contracts. The SBA faced criticism for outdated size standards in 1978, with calls for a reexamination. Representative Tim Lee Carter expressed concerns about the agency becoming a bank forum for all businesses. The SBA planned to analyze industry data to potentially update its size standards, acknowledging the complexity of the task. The SBA faced criticism for outdated size standards in 1978 and planned to update them by analyzing industry data. The market structure and size distribution of firms vary from industry to industry, presenting unique challenges for defining small businesses. The SBA proposed a single set of size standards based on the number of employees to reduce administrative complexity. The SBA proposed using a single factor, number of employees, for defining size standards across industries to address inflation issues and reduce administrative complexity. Proposed size standards range from 15 to 2,500 employees for different industries. The SBA categorized industries into concentrated, competitive, or mixed groups based on sales distribution. They set size standards differently for each group to promote competition and prevent concentration. The SBA proposed new size standards to promote competition and prevent industry concentration, but faced criticism for reducing the number of small firms by 225,000. Over 86% of public comments criticized the new standards, with concerns raised by federal agencies about eligibility for procurement contracts. The Small Business Administration faced criticism for proposed size standards, leading Congress to delay final regulations until March 31, 1981. The new Administrator, Michael Cardenas, planned to increase size standards for 51 industries, addressing concerns from federal agencies. The Small Business Administration proposed changes to size standards for various industries, including lowering standards in manufacturing and increasing the lowest size standard for service and trade industries. These changes aimed to restore eligibility for 60,000 firms affected by previous proposals. The SBA, under new leadership by James C. Sanders, engaged in consultations with trade organizations and federal agencies regarding the proposal. The Small Business Administration, led by James C. Sanders, proposed new size standards on May 3, 1982. The proposal aimed to narrow the range to 25-500 employees, with a focus on smaller firms and higher standards for procurement-sensitive industries. Over 500 comments were received, with 72% opposing the rule. The SBA reexamined its size standards after receiving 630 comments on the proposed rule, issued in May 1983. The proposal included a single set of size standards for all programs, adjusted for inflation, with a 500-employee ceiling for most industries. The SBA revised its size standards proposal, receiving support from 70% of comments. Administrator Sanders stated that the majority of firms would gain small business status under the new rules, with an increase from 97.9% to 98.6% of all firms classified as small. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on February 9, 1984. Representative Parren J. Mitchell criticized the SBA's failure to address issues in the small business sector, introducing legislation (H.R. 1178) to adjust size standards based on market share and federal procurement contracts. Mitchell expressed disappointment at a congressional hearing on July 30, 1985, stating that the promised fixes had not been implemented since six years ago. The SBA proposed to streamline size standards by reducing fixed levels from 30 to 9, with new standards based on employee count and annual receipts. This aimed to help small businesses and restore eligibility to firms affected by inflation. The proposed rule was later withdrawn as a courtesy. The SBA withdrew a proposed rule to convert size standards due to anomalies. In 1994, size standards were adjusted for inflation, restoring eligibility to 20,000 firms. In 2002, standards were adjusted again, benefiting small businesses. The SBA adjusted size standards for inflation, benefiting thousands of firms. A new proposed rule aimed to streamline size standards based on the number of employees, reducing complexity. The SBA proposed a rule to simplify size standards by using 10 size standards based on number of employees. This would affect 514 size standards, potentially redefining small businesses. Majority of comments supported the proposed rule. The SBA proposed a rule to simplify size standards by using 10 size standards based on number of employees. Majority of comments supported the proposed rule, but there were concerns raised by the House and Senate Committees on Small Business. The SBA withdrew the proposed rule in 2004. In 2005 and 2008, the SBA made adjustments for inflation to its size standards, restoring eligibility to firms that lost small-business status due to inflation. The SBA made adjustments for inflation to its size standards in 2005 and 2008, restoring eligibility for firms that lost small-business status. In June 2008, the SBA announced a comprehensive review of its size standards due to industry changes. The SBA announced a review of its size standards in response to industry changes, focusing on average firm size, asset size, competition, and market share distribution. The analysis would determine appropriate size standards based on industry characteristics and small business participation in federal programs. The SBA simplified its size standards by reducing the number of receipts based size standards from 31 to 8. This was done to address the complexity of determining small business status. The SBA reduced the number of receipts based size standards from 31 to 8, ranging from $5.0 million to $35.5 million, to simplify managing and using size standards for businesses in related industries. The SBA increased receipts based size standards to $5.5 million to $38.5 million in 2014 to adjust for inflation. They also shifted to using eight employee based size standards and maintained asset, megawatt hours, and employee/barrel per day refining capacity size standards. The SBA may propose a common size standard for closely related industries to simplify size standards further. The SBA may propose a common size standard for closely related industries to simplify size standards further, aiming for consistency among related industries. The number of size standards gradually decreased as new rules were issued from 2010 to 2016. The SBA decided not to lower size standards from 2010 to 2016, despite data supporting it, due to high unemployment. Some size standards were kept in place, and new employee-based standards were added. Industry groups opposed reducing receipts-based standards and proposing a common size standard for related industries. In 2013, Congress passed legislation directing the SBA to assign appropriate size standards to each industry classification. Currently, there are 27 SBA industry size standards in effect, with the number expected to increase. The SBA is required to review industry size standards regularly and make adjustments as needed to reflect market conditions. Reports on the factors evaluated and criteria used for any changes must be made public within 30 days of each review. Each industry size standard must be reviewed at least once every five years. The SBA reviews industry size standards every five years. In 2011, a comprehensive review began for six industries, with final rules issued between 2012 and 2013. The SBA completed size standard reviews for all industries in January 2016, with final rules issued for various sectors. The SBA reviewed industry size standards every five years, with final rules issued for various sectors between 2012 and 2016. During the first five-year review cycle, 621 size standards were increased, and 3 were decreased. The SBA increased 621 size standards, decreased 3, and retained 388 at their pre-existing levels. 214 size standards were retained based on economic analysis, while 174 were kept due to national economic conditions. The SBA has begun its second five-year review of size standards and plans to issue final rules in 2019 using a new methodology announced in April 2018. The policy of not lowering size standards when justified by analysis will no longer be in effect during this review cycle. During the second five-year review cycle, the SBA will make decisions on size standards based on analytical results, public comments, impacts on businesses, and other important factors. The process will take several years, and the impact of the future economic environment on SBA's policy decisions regarding size standards is uncertain. The SBA defines a small business as a profit-oriented entity with a place of business in the US, operating primarily within the country or making a significant contribution to the economy. The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as a profit-oriented entity with a place of business in the US, operating primarily within the country or making a significant contribution to the economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor. The business must be independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field on a national basis, and can be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income to determine if a business is small. For example, the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program allows businesses to qualify as small if they meet the SBA's size standard for the industry or an alternative net worth and net income based size standard. The SBIC's alternative size standard is currently set at a maximum net worth of $19.5 million and average after-tax net income of $6.5 million for the preceding two years. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income to determine if a business is small. For the SBIC program, businesses can qualify as small with a maximum net worth of $19.5 million and average after-tax net income of $6.5 million for the preceding two years. Additionally, businesses participating in the SBA's 504/CDC loan guaranty program are deemed small if they have a tangible net worth not exceeding $8.5 million and an average net income not exceeding $3 million after taxes for the preceding two years. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income to determine if a business is small. Before May 5, 2009, businesses participating in the SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program were deemed small if they met the SBA's size standards for firms in the industries described in NAICS. From May 5, 2009, through September 30, 2010, the SBA temporarily applied the 504/CDC program's size standards as an alternative for 7(a) loans. This was to enhance small businesses' access to capital. The Small Business Administration (SBA) made the use of alternative size standards for the 7(a) program permanent to help small businesses access capital for economic recovery. The act established interim alternative size standards for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs until a new standard is set. The SBA Administrator can modify size standards for specific industries, with about 97% of all employer firms qualifying as small. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses average annual receipts as a size measure for small firms, accounting for about 97% of all employer firms. The SBA analyzes proposed changes to size standards, focusing on economic factors like average firm size and entry barriers before implementation. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses various factors like average firm size, assets size, and industry competition to determine size standards for small businesses. They also consider factors like federal contracting opportunities and technological changes. The methodology for setting size standards has evolved over the years based on new data and research. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses anchor size standards for different industries, such as 500 employees for manufacturing and 100 employees for wholesale trade. In April 2018, the SBA switched to a percentile approach due to the anchors no longer being representative of the size standards used. The SBA switched from anchor size standards to a percentile approach in April 2018. The new approach evaluates industries based on four economic factors and computes percentile values for each industry. The SBA evaluates industries based on four economic factors and computes percentile values for each industry. If an industry's characteristics are similar to the 20th percentile, SBA may adopt that as an appropriate size standard. If characteristics are similar to the 80th percentile, SBA will assign a corresponding size standard. Size standards are established for each factor based on differences between industries. The SBA establishes size standards for industries based on four economic factors, using 20th and 80th percentile values. The size standard for each industry factor is calculated through linear interpolation. Receipts based size standards are rounded to the nearest $500,000, while employee based size standards are rounded to the nearest 50 employees for most sectors and 25 employees for certain industries. The SBA is transitioning from using the anchor approach to the percentile approach for industry size standards. Changes to size standards require a rulemaking process, including public comment and economic analysis. Currently, employment size is used to determine eligibility for nearly half of industries. The SBA is transitioning to the percentile approach for industry size standards, with employment size used to determine eligibility for 48.6% of industries. Manufacturing, mining, and wholesale trade industries have varying upper limits for employee counts. The SBA has industry size standards based on employee counts, with upper limits ranging from 100 to 1,500 employees. They also use average annual receipts and asset size for eligibility in different industries. There are 16 receipts based industry size standards in effect, with variations in size standards within each industrial sector. The SBA uses various size standards to determine eligibility for different industries, with upper limits ranging from $0.75 million to $36.5 million in average annual sales or receipts. The SBA uses different size standards to determine eligibility for various industries, with upper limits ranging from $7.5 million to $38.5 million in average annual sales or receipts. Additionally, a $550 million average asset limit is applied to determine eligibility in certain finance industries. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses size standards based on annual sales or receipts and average assets to determine eligibility in finance industries. Federal statutes provide special considerations for small businesses, such as set-asides in federal contracting and lower fees for patents and trademarks. Federal agencies can establish their own size standards through the rulemaking process. Federal agencies establishing their own size standards through the federal rulemaking process must conduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, transmit it to the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy for comment, and publish responses to comments in the final rule. Public notice and comment opportunities are also required before issuing the final rule. Prior to issuing the final rule, federal agencies must have the approval of the SBA's Administrator. The SBA's Office of Size Standards consults with the SBA's Office of Advocacy before making decisions. H.R. 585, the Small Business Size Standard Flexibility Act of 2011, was reported by the House Committee on Small Business. The bill aimed to retain the SBA Administrator's authority to approve size standards for certain programs. Advocates have proposed splitting the SBA Administrator's small business size standards authority between the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the SBA's Administrator. This proposal has been included in various legislative provisions introduced in Congress in recent years. Advocates have proposed splitting the SBA Administrator's small business size standards authority between the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the SBA's Administrator. This is due to the expertise of the Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy in understanding regulatory regimes outside the SBA's usual scope. Transferring the function of determining size standards for small businesses to the Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy is seen as a logical move, as the Administrator may not have the necessary expertise for this task. The SBA Administrator is not equipped to determine size standards for other agencies' regulatory activities, lacking expertise and communication with affected small entities. Opponents suggest consulting the Office of Advocacy for a better understanding of regulatory impacts. Advocacy has significant knowledge of the regulatory environment outside of SBA law, but the SBA's Office of Size Standards is the appropriate entity to approve size standards. The legislation would create duplicate size standard authority in both the SBA and the Office of Advocacy, leading to inefficiencies and forgoing economies of scale. Having two entities with the same mission is duplicative and inefficient. The legislation introduced during the 114th Congress aimed to authorize the SBA to establish size standards for agricultural enterprises within 18 months. This would have included limiting industry categories more than the North American Industry Classification codes for small business procurement if necessary. The Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018 directs federal agencies, including the SBA, to use the average annual gross receipts from the previous five years when proposing a size standard, instead of the previous three years. This provision was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The SBA may use average annual gross receipts from the previous five years instead of three years for size standard approval. The SBA relies on economic analysis to define small business eligibility, but there is no consensus on defining small business based on economic factors. The SBA faced resistance in reassessing its size standards, as firms and federal agencies objected to potential loss of eligibility. Despite a mandate for regular reviews, comprehensive revisions were not fully implemented, hindering accuracy and eligibility for SBA assistance. The SBA's economic analyses supported adjustments to size standards for small businesses, leading to increased eligibility for assistance and federal contracts. Despite occasional support for decreases, changes were mostly not implemented, preventing outdated standards and improving accuracy. The SBA adjusts size standards for small businesses based on economic analyses and inflation every five years. They also review standards in specific industries when market conditions change. Congress can provide input on the SBA's size standards review process. Congress typically waits for the SBA to issue proposed rules on size standards before providing input, deferring to the agency's expertise. They then consider economic conditions and feedback before responding. This approach has pros and cons, such as insulating the rule from political influence. The advantage of insulating proposed rules from political influence and respecting separation of powers is balanced by the disadvantage of potential miscommunication and wasted effort. Congress may also consider targeting the SBA's resources, focusing on industry competitiveness to remove eligibility for large firms. There has been little discussion on targeting SBA resources to struggling industries. GAO recommended this in 1978, suggesting a more focused approach to revising SBA size standards. This could reduce eligible firms but increase benefits for small firms in certain industries without raising costs. The alternative approach to determining program eligibility for SBA assistance has not been seriously considered in recent years due to resistance to reducing the number of eligible firms. However, it remains an option for Congress to consider if it decides to change current policy."
