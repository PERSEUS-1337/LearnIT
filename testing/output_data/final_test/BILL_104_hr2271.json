The Act mandates free broadcast time for political advertising on television stations, with license renewal subject to compliance. License renewal for TV stations is contingent on compliance with providing free broadcast time to political candidates.

The free broadcast time allotted to political candidates by TV stations must be composed of varying lengths of units, with specific time allocations during election years. At least half of the broadcast time should be during prime time hours, and a significant portion should be aired in the weeks leading up to election day. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in non-renewal of the station's license. The free broadcast time allotted to political candidates must be comparable in length and time slot to other candidates, with a maximum of 4.5 hours per week for political advertising. Candidates must speak directly to the camera in unedited segments during this broadcast time.
