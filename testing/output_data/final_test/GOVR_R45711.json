    "content": "The concept of \"Too big to fail\" (TBTF) refers to the idea that the failure of a financial firm could lead to widespread disruptions in financial markets and have devastating economic consequences. This was exemplified during the 2008 financial crisis when the failure of Lehman Brothers caused systemic risk. The near-collapse of several large financial firms in 2008 brought attention to the issue of TBTF. To prevent the failures of Wachovia and Washington Mutual, the FDIC facilitated their acquisition by other banks without government assistance. Citigroup and Bank of America were also offered additional support during this time. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) offered Citigroup and Bank of America additional preferred shares and government guarantees on selected assets. Government intervention was justified for firms deemed \"systemically important\" during the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to promote financial stability, end 'too big to fail,' and protect taxpayers from bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed the TBTF problem through enhanced prudential regulation for large banks and nonbank financial firms designated as systemically important. Basel III imposed capital requirements on large banks, and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act made changes in 2018. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in 2018 eliminated most enhanced prudential regulation requirements for banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion. Banks designated as Global-Systemically Important Banks or with over $250 billion in assets remain subject to all EPR requirements. The Fed has discretion to apply individual EPR provisions to banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion on a case-by-case basis. The report discusses rules proposed by the Fed to reduce EPR requirements for some large banks in response to P.L. 115-174. The Fed is reducing EPR requirements for some large banks in response to P.L. 115-174. EPR is mainly based on asset size and charter type, with only banks, thrifts, and credit unions allowed to accept insured deposits. Enhanced regulation applies to large U.S. bank holding companies. A Bank Holding Company (BHC) structure allows for a large financial firm with depository banks to operate multiple subsidiaries in different sectors. Five large investment banks that operated in securities markets were not BHCs but became BHCs during the financial crisis. All major U.S. investment banks are now BHCs subject to enhanced regulation. If a bank does not have a BHC structure, it is not subject to enhanced regulation. Zions, one of two banks over the $50 billion threshold without a BHC structure, converted to a standalone bank in 2018 to avoid enhanced regulation. FSOC allowed Zions to withdraw from enhanced regulation due to low risk to U.S. financial stability. The Fed's proposed rule would subject large thrift holding companies (THCs) to enhanced prudential regulatory requirements for the first time if they are not substantially engaged in insurance. Only one THC, Charles Schwab, with over $100 billion in assets, is not substantially engaged in insurance and is subject to EPR. Two THCs with assets between $50 billion to $100 billion are not subject to EPR. The proposed rule creates four categories of banks based on their asset size. The Fed's proposed rule creates four categories of banks based on asset size and systemic importance, with increasingly stringent EPR requirements for each category. G-SIBs are subject to the most stringent tier of regulation. The Financial Stability Board designates G-SIBs annually based on their systemic importance. The Financial Stability Board designates G-SIBs annually based on their systemic importance, with 30 banks worldwide currently designated as G-SIBs. The Fed's proposed rule creates four categories of banks based on asset size and systemic importance, with increasingly stringent EPR requirements for each category. The enhanced prudential regime applies to foreign banking organizations with over $250 billion in assets globally. Foreign banks with over $50 billion in U.S. nonbranch, nonagency assets must form intermediate holding companies for their U.S. operations. P.L. 115-174 raised the EPR threshold for global assets but did not introduce a threshold for U.S. assets of foreign banks. The Dodd-Frank Act clarified that the threshold for domestic banks has been raised, prompting a question of whether to raise the threshold for U.S. assets of foreign banks to maintain regulatory parity with U.S. banks. The act emphasizes the need for enhanced regulation of foreign banks to consider national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity, as well as the comparability of home country standards to U.S. standards. The issue of regulatory parity can be viewed from the perspective of U.S. assets or foreign assets. Under proposed rules, foreign banks with more than $250 billion in global assets, including foreign G-SIBs, would be subject to some enhanced prudential requirements (EPR). The rules use $50 billion in U.S. assets as a minimum threshold for EPR, with most requirements applying at higher thresholds. Total U.S. assets would be used to determine EPR requirements for foreign banks, resulting in more banks being subject to these regulations. Over 80 foreign banks with over $250 billion in worldwide assets would need to submit resolution plans under a proposed rule. Non-BHCs and other financial firms in the US may be designated as systemically important financial institutions by the FSOC. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designates Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) based on the risk they pose to financial stability. Three insurers and one financial firm have been designated as SIFIs, but some designations were later rescinded. Former SIFIs underwent significant changes in operations. Other insurance companies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) with large assets were also identified. Only one credit union, Navy Federal Credit Union, has assets exceeding $50 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act created specific prudential requirements for large banks, with some overlapping with Basel III. The Federal Reserve administers the Enhanced Prudential Regulation (EPR) regime, applying higher standards to large banks. The regime includes requirements related to capital and liquidity. The Enhanced Prudential Regulation (EPR) regime imposes stricter standards on large banks to ensure their safety and soundness. The Fed finances the administration of the regime through assessments on firms. EPR includes provisions to prevent financial difficulties and address regulatory shortcomings. Despite no banks facing financial troubles under EPR, the effectiveness of risk mitigation provisions during an economic downturn remains untested. The risk mitigation provisions under the Enhanced Prudential Regulation regime have not been tested in a downturn, and some regulatory changes are still pending implementation. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III impose requirements on banks subject to EPR, including stress tests and capital planning. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires stress tests for financial firms with over $10 billion in assets, raised to over $250 billion. The tests project potential losses in a crisis to ensure solvency. Stress test rules were finalized in 2012, effective in 2013, with reduced scenarios and frequency. Fed discretion applies to firms with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets. The stress tests for financial firms with over $250 billion in assets project potential losses in a crisis to ensure solvency. The tests incorporate adverse scenarios focusing on projected asset values based on specific areas of concern each year. In 2019, the Fed increased transparency in the stress test process. Capital requirements aim to ensure banks have enough capital to absorb unexpected losses without failing. Enhanced capital requirements were required for banks with over $250 billion in assets, with Fed discretion for banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets. The final rule for capital planning was implemented in 2011, requiring banks to submit annual capital plans to the Fed under CCAR. Plans must show how the bank will meet capital requirements, including debt issuance and dividend payments, to remain compliant with stress tests. The Fed evaluates plans quantitatively and qualitatively to ensure sufficient capital under stress scenarios. The Fed evaluates banks' capital plans annually under CCAR to ensure sufficient capital under stress scenarios. If the Fed rejects a bank's plan, they cannot make capital distributions until a revised plan is approved. Some banks have had to revise their plans due to qualitative or quantitative issues. Policymakers intervened during the financial crisis to prevent large financial firms from failing quickly and safely through bankruptcy. Title I applies to banks with over $50 billion in assets. Title I of P.L. 115-174 requires banks with assets over $250 billion (or between $100 billion and $250 billion at Fed discretion) to submit living wills to regulators outlining how they can safely enter bankruptcy. The final rule in 2011 mandated details on ownership, structure, assets, obligations, and subsidiary protections. Proposed rules aim to reduce the frequency of living will submissions. The proposed rules aim to reduce the frequency of living will submissions for banks with assets over $250 billion. The resolution plan must explain how the firm could be resolved under the bankruptcy code without government support or disrupting financial stability. The resolution plan for banks with assets over $250 billion must detail core business lines, funding, critical operations, legal entities, information systems, and operating jurisdictions. Plans are divided into public and private parts, with regulators able to require revisions if found incomplete or not credible. Inadequate plans may lead to increased capital and liquidity requirements, growth restrictions, or resolution actions. Multiple firms' plans have been deemed insufficient since 2013, including all eleven in the first wave. Wells Fargo faced issues in 2016. In 2016, Wells Fargo was sanctioned for inadequate living will submission, highlighting bank liquidity importance. Banks face liquidity crises due to mismatch between illiquid loans and deposits. Title I imposes stricter liquidity requirements on banks with over $250 billion in assets, implemented through firm-run stress tests, Fed-run liquidity coverage ratio, and proposed rules. The final rule implementing firm-run liquidity stress tests was issued in 2014, applying to domestic banks with over $100 billion in assets. More stringent versions of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) apply to G-SIBs and Category II banks, with a less stringent version for Category III banks. Proposed rules extend the LCR and NSFR to large foreign banks operating in the United States. Banks subject to EPR must establish a liquidity risk management framework, conduct monthly internal liquidity stress tests, and maintain a buffer of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA). The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was implemented in 2014, requiring banks to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to match net cash outflows in times of market stress. Assets must be low risk, easily traded, and accepted as collateral by the Fed. Different assets are categorized based on liquidity, with disagreement on the cutoff point for HQLA qualification. The proposed rule to implement the net stable funding ratio, issued in 2016, has not been finalized. It would require banks to have stable funding backing their assets over a one-year horizon, with different weights assigned based on stability and liquidity. Funding stability is determined by availability in a panic, classified by type, counterparty, and maturity. Assets not meeting the criteria would be assigned to different liquidity categories. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requires banks to have stable funding backing their assets over a one-year horizon, with different weights assigned based on stability and liquidity. Assets that do not qualify as High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) would require more stable funding under the NSFR. Different types of assets receive varying levels of credit towards fulfilling the NSFR, with long-term equity receiving the most credit. Certain types of deposits and borrowing do not qualify under the rule. Systemic risk associated with Too Big To Fail (TBTF) banks includes spillover effects that can threaten financial stability. Title I of the rule applies to banks with more than $250 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve raised the asset limit to $250 billion to limit exposure to counterparties and require periodic credit exposure reports. The Single Counterparty Credit Limit (SCCL) rule was finalized in 2018, with increasingly stringent requirements based on asset size. Counterparty exposure for all banks was regulated before the crisis but did not cover certain off-balance sheet or holding company exposures. The SCCL aims to address these gaps in regulation. The SCCL rule sets limits on counterparty credit exposure based on asset size, with stricter requirements for larger banks. G-SIBs have lower limits on exposure to other G-SIBs or nonbank SIFIs. The 2011 credit exposure reporting proposal aimed to have banks report on their credit exposures to significant counterparties to help regulators understand potential spillover effects. However, there has been no further rulemaking on this since 2011. Publicly traded banks with at least $10 billion in assets are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to have their board of directors oversee management on behalf of shareholders. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded banks with at least $50 billion in assets to form risk committees on their boards of directors, including a risk management expert. The Fed issued a final rule in 2014, effective in 2015 for domestic banks and 2016 for foreign banks, requiring the risk committee to be led by an independent director. Banks with over $50 billion in assets must also employ a chief risk officer for risk management. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act grants powers to FSOC, the Fed, or the FDIC for oversight. P.L. 115-174 raises the threshold for financial stability powers to be applied to banks with $250 billion in assets, excluding banks between $100 billion and $250 billion. These powers are triggered only in case of a perceived threat to financial stability, and have not been activated yet. They provide new regulatory authority over nonbank SIFIs, expanding the oversight of bank regulators. FSOC may require banks with over $250 billion in assets to submit certified reports to determine financial stability threats. If a bank poses a grave threat, the Fed can restrict mergers, products, and activities, or require asset divestment. Fed hearings can be requested to contest these actions. Title I of the provision broadens the requirement for banks with over $250 billion in assets to notify the Fed of nonbank acquisitions exceeding $10 billion in assets and 5% of voting shares. It also establishes an emergency 15-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio for banks with over $250 billion in assets. The Fed implemented a leverage ratio rule in 2014 for domestic banks and in 2016 for foreign banks. This rule applies when a bank poses a grave threat to U.S. financial stability. Early remediation requirements aim to address financial problems at banks early to prevent failure, especially for banks with over $250 billion in assets. The Fed's proposed rule in 2011 for early remediation requirements has not been finalized. Title I expands FDIC's powers over large banks, allowing examination of banks with over $250 billion in assets and enforcement powers over risky BHCs or THCs. Basel III reformed bank regulation parallel to the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III reformed bank regulation after the financial crisis, implementing nonbinding international agreements through rulemaking. It determined current capital requirements for all U.S. banks to ensure sufficient capital backing assets. Large banks face more stringent capital requirements, including the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for banks with over $250 billion in assets or significant foreign exposure. The SLR requires banks with over $250 billion in assets to hold 3% capital, including off-balance-sheet exposures. G-SIBs must meet an enhanced SLR of 5% at the holding company level and 6% at the depository subsidiary level by 2018. Basel III also mandates G-SIBs to hold a common equity surcharge of at least 1%. The Federal Reserve implemented a common equity surcharge of at least 1% for Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) to reflect higher risks to the financial system. The surcharge could increase to 4.5% and apply to additional firms designated as G-SIBs. Additionally, a Basel III countercyclical capital buffer requires banks with over $250 billion in assets to hold more capital during high-risk financial conditions. The Federal Reserve implemented a common equity surcharge for G-SIBs to reflect higher risks to the financial system. The Basel III countercyclical capital buffer requires banks with over $250 billion in assets to hold more capital during high-risk financial conditions. The TLAC rule requires G-SIBs to hold a minimum amount of capital and long-term debt to absorb losses and avoid taxpayer bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes assessments on banks with assets over $50 billion, with some fees raised under P.L. 115-174. Fees are assessed on BHCs with over $250 billion in assets and designated SIFIs to fund the Office of Financial Research. Assessments on BHCs and THCs with assets over $100 billion fund the cost of administering EPR, while those with $100 billion to $250 billion must reflect the tailoring of EPR. BHCs with assets over $50 billion and designated SIFIs repay any uncompensated costs in the event of liquidation. The Fed and other bank regulators have proposed rules to modify EPR, including raising asset thresholds and reducing EPR requirements for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. Additionally, proposed rules would reduce capital requirements under the SLR for three custody banks, two of which are G-SIBs. Another rule would create a stress capital buffer requirement for large banks by combining stress test requirements and Basel III elements. The proposed rules aim to modify EPR by raising asset thresholds and reducing requirements for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. Additionally, changes to the SLR would reduce capital requirements for G-SIBs. The rules also include creating a stress capital buffer requirement for large banks. The proposed rules aim to modify EPR by raising asset thresholds and reducing requirements for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. P.L. 115-174 expanded tiered regulation for EPR and other types of bank regulation, making EPR much more tiered and tailored by bank size. Fed's rules had tailored some EPR requirements for banks with more than $50 billion in assets before P.L. 115-174. The proposed rules aim to modify EPR by raising asset thresholds and reducing requirements for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. Under the proposed rules, EPR would impose progressively more stringent requirements across four categories of banks, with exemptions for banks with under $100 billion in assets. Foreign banks would be placed in the same categories based on their U.S. assets, with similar requirements to those applied to U.S. banks. The proposed rules aim to modify EPR by raising asset thresholds and reducing requirements for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. Foreign banks in Category II and III would see little change, while those with an IHC in Category IV may be exempted or face less stringent requirements. Some requirements would apply to all U.S. operations, including branches and agencies. The proposed rules would mostly defer to home country regulation for foreign banks not in Category II or III. Stress tests and capital planning requirements are key components of EPR. The Fed uses stress tests and capital planning requirements to assess large banks' ability to withstand crises. Banks with over $100 billion in assets must comply with multiple capital requirements, leading to redundancy. To address this, the Fed proposed combining elements of stress tests and Basel III requirements to reduce the number of simultaneous capital requirements for banks. The proposed rule aims to reduce the number of simultaneous capital requirements for banks by combining elements of stress tests and Basel III requirements. This would involve eliminating certain requirements tied to stress test scenarios and merging others with Basel III capital requirements. The proposed rule aims to replace separate capital requirements with a combined stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement for banks to cover stress test losses and dividends, or 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, whichever is larger. The Fed justifies this change by stating that capital distributions would face restrictions if the SCB requirement is not met. The Fed's proposed stress capital buffer would impose restrictions on capital distributions if not met, reducing the need for banks to hold excess capital. Stock repurchases would be removed from capital planning, with only dividends likely to continue during financial stress. The assumption of balance sheet growth in a stressed environment is deemed unreasonable. This change would lower capital requirements for non G-SIBs compared to current stress tests. The Fed's proposed stress capital buffer would adjust capital requirements based on stress test results, potentially reducing the need for excess capital. Banks would face a stress leverage buffer instead of the leverage ratio, requiring Tier 1 capital equal to stress test losses and dividends. This change aims to streamline capital planning and distribution restrictions during financial stress. The Fed's proposed stress capital buffer would adjust capital requirements based on stress test results, potentially reducing the need for excess capital. The stress leverage buffer would replace the leverage ratio, requiring Tier 1 capital equal to stress test losses and dividends. This change aims to streamline capital planning and distribution restrictions during financial stress, with capital restrictions automatically triggered if a bank's capital level falls below the buffers. The Fed's proposed stress capital buffer would adjust capital requirements for banks based on stress test results, potentially reducing excess capital needs. Custody banks offer unique services such as holding securities, receiving interest, and providing administrative services, subject to similar regulatory requirements as other banks. Asset managers utilize custodian banks to access central counterparties and payment systems. Custodian banks play a passive role in their clients' decisions, providing access to central counterparties and payment systems for asset managers. They argue that leverage ratios, like the SLR, require holding capital against all assets regardless of risk, including deposits at central banks. This disproportionately burdens custodian banks, as they are considered \"safe\" assets. Section 402 of P.L. 115-174 addresses this issue for custody banks. Section 402 of P.L. 115-174 allows custody banks to no longer hold capital against funds deposited at certain central banks to meet the SLR, up to an amount equal to customer deposits linked to fiduciary, custodial, and safekeeping accounts. The proposed rule uses a ratio of at least 30 times more assets under custody than the banks' assets to determine eligibility. Three banks would qualify under this measure. The proposed rule under Section 402 of P.L. 115-174 allows custody banks like Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust, and State Street to reduce their capital requirements by a certain percentage based on their assets under custody. Northern Trust could reduce its capital by $3 for every $100 deposited at central banks, while Bank of New York Mellon and State Street could reduce their capital by $6 for every $100 of banking subsidiary deposits at central banks. The exclusion granted to these banks would be equivalent to 21% to 30% of their assets. The proposed rule allows custody banks like Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust, and State Street to reduce their capital requirements by a certain percentage based on their assets under custody. The SLR was not the binding capital requirement for the custody banks at the holding company level, but it was the binding requirement at the depository level for two of the banks. G-SIBs must currently comply with a higher SLR than other banks with $250 billion in assets. In April 2018, the Fed and the OCC proposed a rule to modify the enhanced SLR for G-SIBs. The OCC proposed a rule to modify the enhanced SLR for G-SIBs, setting it at 3% plus half of the G-SIB surcharge for both the holding company and depository subsidiary. This would increase capital requirements based on systemic importance, reducing the requirement to between 3.75% and 4.75% for each G-SIB. The Fed reported the SLR was the binding ratio for G-SIB bank subsidiaries in 2017. The proposed rule aims to reduce capital requirements for G-SIBs' bank subsidiaries by $121 billion in total, while only decreasing required capital at the holding company level by $400 million. The Fed argues against the SLR being the binding capital requirement, as it could incentivize banks to hold riskier assets. The proposed changes would still leave the SLR as the binding ratio for three G-SIBs and would also impact G-SIBs' TLAC requirements. The proposed rule would change G-SIBs' TLAC requirement to a leverage buffer of 7.5% plus half of their G-SIB surcharge, reducing their TLAC requirement. This would also affect the TLAC long-term debt requirement for G-SIBs, lowering capital and EPR requirements for banks with over $50 billion in assets. Supporters believe these changes align EPR with the risks posed by large banks, while opponents fear increased systemic risks outweigh the benefits of reduced regulatory burden. Enhanced regulation (EPR) aims to prevent risks to financial stability from large banks, focusing on systemic risk and the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) issue. It complements general prudential regulation by addressing broader risks posed by interconnected financial institutions. Combining EPR with other policy approaches could dilute its effectiveness in eliminating TBTF. Different parts of the Dodd-Frank Act pursue various approaches to eliminating TBTF, with a focus on systemic risk. The main question is whether non-G-SIBs with over $50 billion in assets pose systemic risk. While G-SIBs are widely seen as the biggest risk, there is uncertainty about the systemic risk posed by the next tier of institutions. The effectiveness of Enhanced Prudential Regulation (EPR) in mitigating risks from large bank failures remains uncertain until such an event occurs. The effectiveness of Enhanced Prudential Regulation (EPR) in mitigating risks from large bank failures remains uncertain until such an event occurs. Quantifying the benefits of EPR is challenging due to the difficulty in isolating the effects of specific provisions on financial stability. Additionally, the joint effects of various proposals on systemic risk may exceed the sum of their individual parts. Enhanced regulation could also reduce taxpayer exposure to FDIC insurance losses or bailouts resulting from bank failures. Enhanced Prudential Regulation (EPR) aims to reduce taxpayer exposure to FDIC insurance losses or bailouts from bank failures. It could prevent localized disruptions in credit availability and financial services. Some argue that EPR requirements are good risk management practices for large firms. Enhanced Prudential Regulation (EPR) aims to reduce taxpayer exposure to FDIC insurance losses or bailouts from bank failures by imposing costs on large banks. The overall effects on the cost and availability of credit throughout the financial system are more relevant than the costs to large banks. If banks subject to EPR face higher costs, more credit will be supplied by other financial firms, partially offsetting the reduction in credit from banks subject to EPR. The possibility of financial intermediation migrating from large banks to less regulated sectors raises concerns about overall systemic risk. Even with heightened prudential regulation, the net benefits in reducing systemic risk may be smaller than expected. Additionally, the moral hazard created by too-big-to-fail banks incentivizes greater risk-taking behavior. Enhanced regulation may increase efficiency by reducing risk-taking and addressing the TBTF subsidy. Tailoring EPR to different banks can help mitigate compliance costs and maintain benefits without a substantial decline. The costs and benefits of tailoring EPR will depend on which banks are TBTF, a question that can only be definitively answered after a bank fails. Enhanced regulation can be tailored to reduce costs for non-TBTF banks without losing benefits, but there is disagreement among opponents."
