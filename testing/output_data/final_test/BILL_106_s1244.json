    "content": "The \"Truth in Regulating Act of 1999\" aims to increase transparency in regulatory decisions, promote congressional oversight, and enhance accountability of Congress and agencies to the public. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, the term \"agency\" is defined as specified in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code. An \"economically significant rule\" refers to any proposed or final rule with an annual economic impact of $100,000,000 or more, or that significantly affects the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments. \"Independent analysis\" involves a thorough review of an agency's assessments and assumptions for regulatory actions, as determined by the Comptroller General.\n\nSEC. 4. PILOT PROJECT FOR REPORT ON RULES. The Comptroller General of the United States may review economically significant rules at the request of a congressional committee and submit an independent analysis within 180 days. The Comptroller General must analyze the potential benefits and costs of economically significant rules, including identifying who will receive the benefits and bear the costs. They must also consider alternative approaches that could achieve the statutory goal more cost-effectively or provide greater net benefits. The Comptroller General must analyze the benefits, reasons for not adopting alternatives, and the impact on State or local governments. They will prioritize and determine the number of review requests. Each agency must cooperate by promptly providing information. The agency must cooperate with the Comptroller General by providing necessary records and information promptly. Authorization of appropriations for the General Accounting Office under this Act is set at $5,200,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002. The pilot project established by this Act will last for 3 years, contingent on an annual appropriation of no less than $5,200,000. A report on the project's effectiveness will be submitted to Congress before the end of the 3-year period for consideration on its permanent authorization."
