    "content": "The Act titled \"Improved Workplace and Community Transition Training for Incarcerated Youth Offenders Act of 2005\" amends Section 821 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 to provide grants to states for enhanced training programs for incarcerated youth offenders. Congress finds that a significant portion of the prison population is young and lacks education, with a decrease in educational programs for inmates despite their proven effectiveness in reducing recidivism. Inmates released in 1999 served an average of 29 months for their current offense. In 2001, 592,000 offenders were released from State prison, with an average age of 34 years. Approximately 62 percent of State prisoners will be rearrested within 3 years, but participation in education programs while incarcerated reduces recidivism by 10 percent. Approximately 10 percent lower recidivism rate for youth offenders with education and training during incarceration. Intense supervision, support, and counseling needed post-release for effective reintegration. Grant program established by the Secretary of Education to assist youth offenders in acquiring literacy and job skills. Definition of youth offender as under 35 years old in State prison.
