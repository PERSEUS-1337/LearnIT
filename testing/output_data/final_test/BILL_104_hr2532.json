    "content": "The Family Farm Empowerment Act of 1995 includes provisions for marketing loans, total acreage base system, amendments to price support programs, elimination of acreage reduction programs, extension of export programs, suspension of permanent price support authority, and removal of certain rules. The Family Farm Empowerment Act of 1995 includes provisions for marketing loans for certain agricultural commodities from 1996 through 2002. The Family Farm Empowerment Act of 1995 provides marketing loans for covered commodities such as rice, upland cotton, feed grains, wheat, and oilseeds. The loans have a 15-month term and are available to eligible producers from 1996 through 2002. Eligible producers for marketing loans must not exceed total acreage base of the farm. Loans are at 115% of the average national price. Total loans per producer cannot exceed $175,000. Repayment terms apply. Producers on a farm may repay marketing loans for covered commodities at a rate determined by the loan rate or the prevailing domestic market price set by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a formula to determine the market price for each commodity and announce it periodically. The Secretary will establish an Adjustment Account to make payments to producers participating in the marketing loan program for covered commodities. Payments will also be made to producers of previous crops authorized under specific sections but not yet paid. The Adjustment Account will provide necessary funds for marketing loans under subsection (b) and remain available until expended. Producers can request an advance payment of up to 10% of the projected marketing loan before planting. The Secretary may make payments to producers who agree to forego obtaining marketing loans for covered commodities from 1996 to 2002. Producers can receive payments under this subsection by forgoing marketing loans for covered commodities. Payment is calculated by multiplying the loan payment rate by the quantity of the commodity foregone. The loan payment rate is the difference between the loan rate and the repayment rate for the commodity. SEC. 3. TOTAL ACREAGE BASE SYSTEM.
