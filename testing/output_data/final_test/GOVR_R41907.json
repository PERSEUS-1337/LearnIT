    "content": "The debate over establishing a constitutional limit on spending or debt dates back to the nation's founding. Thomas Jefferson advocated for a constitutional amendment to prevent government debt. Support for a balanced budget amendment has been a persistent political issue, with calls for it echoed in various political campaigns and movements. The current push for a balanced budget amendment in Congress reflects the ongoing debate on fiscal responsibility. The House Judiciary Committee has reported a proposal, H.J.Res. 1, that includes provisions requiring a super majority for budget approval, limiting outlays to 18% of the US economic output, increasing the debt limit, and raising revenues. Defining a balanced budget has been a key issue, with disagreements on its components and measurement. This definitional problem is significant as it determines what is included and who is responsible for ensuring compliance. The goal of balancing the budget was rarely controversial during the 18th and 19th centuries, with deficits considered abnormalities tolerated only in extraordinary circumstances like war. The 1920s saw congressional commitment to surpluses to reduce the huge debt from WWI. The Great Depression and WWII deficits were significant in American fiscal history but did not revolutionize fiscal policy. The New Deal and Keynesian economics did not directly influence Roosevelt's fiscal policies in the 1930s. Deficits were accepted as a consequence of providing relief, not as a deliberate policy for recovery or full employment. The impact of Keynesian economics on fiscal policy grew after World War II, as seen in legislation like the Employment Act of 1946. Eisenhower, despite aiming for a balanced budget, also embraced some Keynesian principles. During the Kennedy Administration, the focus shifted from balancing the budget to Keynesian economic theories, advocating for counter-cyclical spending and \"full employment\" budgeting. This approach aimed to balance the economy rather than just the budget, allowing for increased government spending and tax cuts during economic downturns, and decreased spending or tax increases during upswings. The debate on government impact on the economy and budget balancing has led to opposition efforts to establish legal requirements for a balanced budget. In 1935, Senator Millard Tydings introduced a measure to require a balanced federal budget, followed by Representative Harold Knutson proposing a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget in 1936. In 1935, Senator Millard Tydings proposed a balanced federal budget requirement, followed by Representative Harold Knutson suggesting a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget in 1936. Subsequent proposals aimed to limit the federal budget size or growth, public debt, or require a balanced budget, with the first congressional action occurring in 1947. The issue of a balanced federal budget has been a topic of discussion, with various proposals and efforts made to address the growth of the federal budget or public debt. Concerns arose in the 1990s as deficits increased, leading to a lack of balanced budgets until FY1999 and surpluses until FY1998. The popularity of mandating a balanced budget increased as the federal deficit and debt rose. Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton supported the idea, but Clinton opposed a constitutional amendment. The balanced budget amendment lost popularity in the late 1990s as the budget balanced due to statutory controls and a thriving economy. The budget was in surplus from FY1998 to FY2001 due to revenue increases and a thriving economy. Concern has risen over the growing deficit, the highest in dollar terms from 2009 to 2011, and unsustainable federal debt growth. There are worries that investors may stop financing deficits they deem unsustainable, attributed to a budget process allowing persistent deficits and a political system rewarding deficit spending. The growing deficit and unsustainable federal debt have raised concerns. The budget surplus from FY1998 to FY2001 was due to revenue increases and a thriving economy. There is worry that investors may stop financing deficits deemed unsustainable, attributed to a budget process allowing persistent deficits and a political system rewarding deficit spending. President Ronald Reagan advocated for a balanced budget despite policies that doubled the national debt in the first five years of his Administration. President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton all discussed the importance of a balanced budget amendment to address the growing deficit and national debt. Reagan criticized public spending that increased deficits, while Bush and Clinton had differing views on the necessity of a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. Clinton viewed the proposed amendment as a \"budget gimmick\" that could lead to appointed judges making budget decisions. President Clinton opposed a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, stating it was unnecessary and could have negative consequences like judges halting Social Security checks or raising taxes. This stance was reiterated in his 1997 State of the Union Address. During the 1994 congressional election campaign, the Republican Party and some Democratic candidates supported a balanced budget constitutional amendment. The \"Contract With America\" signed by many Republican House candidates included this agenda. The amendment also required a three-fifths vote of both houses of Congress to increase revenues. Some governors urged caution in embracing specific amendment language, complicating the debate. The 1994 Republican Governors' Conference attendees supported the concept but expressed concerns about increasing the financial burden on states. The proposal for a balanced budget amendment raised concerns about increasing financial burden on states by allowing Congress to pass laws without funding. The National Governors' Association chairman criticized the proposal as a political show and emphasized the need for safeguards against unfunded mandates. Despite waning popularity, more proposals have been introduced in the 112th Congress than in previous ones. All 47 Senate Republicans support a balanced budget amendment. A Balanced Budget Amendment Caucus was formed by a bipartisan group of Members of Congress with over 60 Members. However, there has been recent objection to the idea of a balanced budget amendment, with concerns raised about under-funding Medicare and Social Security. Former lawmakers from both parties have also voiced objections to the amendment. Former GOP appropriator and Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg opposes coupling a balanced budget amendment with legislation to increase the federal debt limit. He believes that unrealistic ideas will not solve the fiscal chaos and criticizes lawmakers who propose unviable amendments to avoid tough votes. The debt ceiling is an opportunity for real action to adjust the nation's course towards fiscal disaster. Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle believes a constitutional balanced budget amendment alone is not enough; real solutions require lawmakers to work together, make difficult choices, and achieve results. In 1990, 1993, and 1997, unpopular choices were made to reduce spending and raise taxes, leading to a budget surplus from 1998 to 2001. In 2011, the House passed H.R. 2560, proposing a balanced budget amendment to raise the debt limit, but it was tabled by the Senate. Eventually, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to increase the debt limit. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) was enacted on August 2, 2011, with a provision for a balanced budget amendment vote in the House and Senate. Despite broad public support for a balanced budget, achieving a two-thirds vote in Congress has been challenging due to the complexity and implementation difficulties. Public opinion polls show support for a balanced budget but also indicate a preference for spending increases and tax reductions. The public supports a balanced budget but also favors spending increases and tax reductions, creating conflicting policy mandates for Congress and the President. The debate on a balanced budget amendment has been ongoing for over 50 years, with discussions on whether there should be a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. Advocates often propose a constitutional amendment as the most popular method to ensure a balanced federal budget, despite the challenges of obtaining the necessary approval from Congress and states. Arguments for and against a balanced budget amendment include economic, symbolic, and political appeals. Proponents emphasize the morality of balanced budgets, economic benefits like lower interest rates, and improved public attitudes towards politicians. They argue that a constitutional amendment would be more effective than past statutory attempts in achieving a balanced budget. A constitutional amendment is seen as a more effective way to achieve a balanced budget compared to statutes or rules. It is believed that without this discipline, conflicting pressures to spend would hinder the goal of a balanced budget. Proposed amendments often assume that enforcement mechanisms can be enacted separately as statutes, with the constitutional provision being primarily self-enforcing. For example, the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1985 expected Congress and the President to fulfill their responsibilities under the proposed amendment through existing authority and any new authority created by Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993 emphasized the importance of adhering to the clear provisions of a proposed balanced budget amendment, warning that failure to do so would be a betrayal of public trust. Elected officials who disregard their responsibilities under the amendment may face consequences in the political process. Advocates of the amendment argue that judicial interference with federal budgeting would be minimal, as most parties would lack standing to bring suit and many issues would not be justiciable. Standing under an amendment may not be justiciable as it requires a case or controversy under Article III. For instance, in Frothingham v. Mellon, standing was denied to a taxpayer suing to restrain federal money disbursements to states participating in a program to reduce maternal and infant mortality, citing lack of power by Congress and potential future tax increase. The Court held that the plaintiff's interest in Treasury funds was minimal and uncertain, thus lacking standing. The court held that plaintiffs lacked standing due to the remote and uncertain nature of the injury. Some suggest limiting judicial involvement through a constitutional amendment, but concerns about enforcement and judicial power remain. Hamilton reassured that the judiciary's role was designed to be limited. The judiciary's role was designed to have \"no influence over either the sword or the purse,\" as stated in The Federalist (number 78). Questions of standing and judicial authority have been debated during congressional consideration of balanced budget amendments, with opponents arguing that such an amendment could involve federal judges and the Supreme Court in the budget making process. Robert Bork warned that this could lead to numerous lawsuits and inconsistent results, delaying budget decisions by at least four years. Senator George Mitchell expressed concerns during a debate in 1982 about the potential for judicial intervention in Congress's budget-writing operations. Opponents argued that standing to bring suit could exist in various circumstances, citing the Supreme Court's standard for determining standing based on alleged injury-in-fact. The issue of standing to bring suit in cases related to Congress's budget-writing operations is complex and not easily predictable. While an inability to show standing may not limit the number of suits that could be brought, the question of what would be precluded from judicial review is uncertain. For example, the Origination Clause of the Constitution has traditionally been seen as an internal matter for Congress, but recent cases have shown that some claims related to it may be justiciable. Recent cases have narrowed the bounds of nonjusticiable matters, including those related to the Origination Clause. State governments' experiences show judicial involvement in budgeting can lead to remedies like tax increases or expenditure limits. Concerns arise over potential federal court actions shifting the balance of power among branches of government. Opponents argue against the benefits of such actions on the economy. Opponents of a balanced budget amendment argue that it could have harmful effects on the economy by forcing Congress to raise taxes or cut spending during a recession. This raises concerns about how the amendment would operate in practice, particularly regarding predictability. Former Senator Howard Metzenbaum highlights the high degree of inherent difficulties associated with such an amendment. Former Senator Howard Metzenbaum points out the uncertainty in budget projections, stating that achieving a balanced budget would rely on accurate economic predictions rather than just legislative efforts. Policy choices at the federal level could potentially circumvent a balanced budget requirement. The Congressional Budget Office warns that a balanced budget requirement could be evaded through various means like increased regulatory actions, use of loan guarantees, and activities by Government-Sponsored Enterprises. This could lead to increased federal spending despite the amendment. A federal balanced budget amendment would exempt debt issued or activities by entities other than the government. Concerns include additional burdens on state governments and potential compensatory spending increases if federal programs are cut. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act limits federal mandates on states without funding, but Congress can waive this. The federal government has shown interest in balanced budget requirements for over six decades, with the Senate Judiciary Committee conducting hearings and reporting joint resolutions on the matter. The House has also considered balanced budget amendments, but less frequently. The federal government has a long history of interest in balanced budget requirements, with the Senate Judiciary Committee conducting hearings and reporting joint resolutions. Various committees in Congress have also held hearings on balanced budget amendments on multiple occasions. Between 1981 and 1997, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved nine balanced budget proposals and reported them to the full Senate. Five of these measures were considered on the Senate floor in different Congresses. In the House, proposed constitutional amendments for a balanced federal budget advanced to floor consideration without committee support on four occasions. The House Judiciary Committee reported proposed balanced budget amendments for floor consideration in multiple Congresses, with the Senate approving a similar measure in the 97th Congress. A substitute proposal was considered in the House under a king-of-the-hill rule in 1982. During the 99th Congress, a substitute proposal for a balanced budget amendment was defeated 77-346 before the final vote. The effort for a balanced budget amendment ultimately failed, 236-187. Two proposed balanced budget amendments were reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but only one was debated extensively over eight days. During the 99th Congress, a substitute proposal for a balanced budget amendment was defeated 77-346 before the final vote. In 1990, a balanced budget amendment proposal led by Representative Charles Stenholm was considered but failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, 279-150. During the 99th Congress, a balanced budget constitutional amendment proposal gathered over 100 cosponsors. The House Budget Committee held six days of hearings on the subject in April and May 1992. A petition was filed to discharge the Rules Committee from further consideration of the resolution, which received the required signatures and was entered on the Discharge Calendar. A unanimous consent agreement was reached to allow the resolution to be considered on June 10, 1992. During the 99th Congress, a balanced budget constitutional amendment proposal gathered over 100 cosponsors. A petition was filed to discharge the Rules Committee from further consideration of the resolution, which received the required signatures and was entered on the Discharge Calendar. The resolution was considered on June 10, with modifications to increase general debate time on the proposed amendment to nine hours. Debate on the proposed amendment began on June 10, followed by consideration of substitutes on June 11. Representative Jon Kyl's substitute to limit expenditures to 19% of GNP and grant item veto authority to the President was defeated, 170-258. Representative Joe Barton's substitute to limit the rate of growth of federal taxes to the rate of growth of national income was also defeated, 200-227. Representative Richard Gephardt's substitute to exempt the Social Security trust fund was part of the discussion. During the 102nd Congress, a balanced budget constitutional amendment proposal faced challenges in both the House and Senate. The final substitute offered by Representative Charles Stenholm was agreed to but ultimately failed to pass. In the Senate, a proposal by Senator Don Nickles for a balanced budget amendment gained significance but did not result in passage. The Senate agreed to a balanced budget amendment with a requirement for the President to submit a balanced budget by June 5. The House and Senate reached final agreement on H.Con.Res. 287 on May 21, 1992, with a modified version of the Nickles amendment. The Senate Budget Committee held hearings on the balanced budget amendment on June 4 and 10, 1992. Senator Paul Simon deferred bringing the proposed balanced budget amendment to the Senate floor until the 103rd Congress. Senators Phil Gramm, Don Nickles, and John Seymour tried to keep the issue alive by offering amendments to unrelated bills. Senator Robert Kasten's tax limitation provision amendment was rejected, and Senator Robert Byrd proposed a statutory requirement for the President to submit a balanced budget proposal. In the 103rd Congress, a balanced budget constitutional amendment was a significant issue in both the House and Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported S.J.Res. 41 on October 21, 1993, and consideration began on February 22, 1994. Senator Simon modified the amendment on February 24. Senator Simon modified S.J.Res. 41 to limit judiciary authority in enforcing a balanced budget amendment. Senator Reid's amendment exempted Social Security and capital expenditures, allowing for suspension during economic recessions. The Senate voted on Reid's substitute (22-78) and the modified S.J.Res. 41 (63-37), both failing to pass. Proponents in the House planned to use the discharge procedure to bring the issue to the floor. On March 16, 1994, the House approved H.Res. 331 by a vote of 387-22, allowing for consideration of H.J.Res. 103 and substitute proposals under a king-of-the-hill rule. The House rejected multiple proposed substitutes for the Kyl bill, including one by Representative Wise and another by Representative Barton. The final substitute offered by Representative Stenholm was adopted after a re-vote, superseding the previous amendments. The House rejected proposed substitutes for the Kyl bill, including those by Wise and Barton. A final substitute by Stenholm, moving the effective date of H.J.Res. 103 to 2001, failed to pass with a necessary two-thirds majority. In the 104th Congress, a balanced budget constitutional amendment was introduced by Representative Joe Barton on January 4, 1995. The House adopted H.Con.Res. 17, which protects Social Security funds under a balanced budget amendment. H.Res. 44 allowed consideration of six substitutes for H.J.Res. 1, selected from 44 proposed amendments. After adopting H.Con.Res. 17 to protect Social Security funds, the House considered six substitutes for H.J.Res. 1 under H.Res. 44. The substitute offered by Representative Barton, requiring a three-fifths vote to increase tax revenues, was adopted 253-171. Another substitute by Representative Major Owens, waiving the Article when national unemployment exceeds 4%, was rejected 64-363. Representative Robert Wise's substitute, placing capital investments and Social Security transactions off budget, was also considered. The House considered several substitutes for H.J.Res. 1 under H.Res. 44, including ones that placed Social Security transactions off budget and required congressional action on a budget plan. Amendments by Representatives Conyers, Gephardt, and Bonior were rejected, with varying vote margins. The House approved the Schaefer substitute for H.J.Res. 1, requiring a majority vote to increase revenues. The resolution was then adopted by the House 300-132, marking the first proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment to be approved. Democratic Senators expressed concerns about passing the resolution in the Senate without a detailed deficit reduction plan. The Senate addressed issues raised during House consideration of a balanced budget amendment. Majority Leader Dole introduced S.J.Res. 1, which was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee reported S.J.Res. 1 without amendment on January 23. The Senate began consideration of H.J.Res. 1 on January 30 and debated the proposal for four days. The Senate debated a \"right-to-know\" amendment proposed by Senator Daschle on February 3, 6, and 7, which aimed to require a blueprint for deficit reduction before a constitutional amendment could take effect. The Senate voted to table the motion to incorporate the Daschle amendment into the resolution on February 8, effectively killing the proposal. Another major issue discussed was the treatment of Social Security under a balanced budget amendment. The Senate debated the treatment of Social Security under a balanced budget amendment, with Senator Reid offering an amendment to exclude Social Security receipts and outlays. The Reid amendment was debated and ultimately tabled by the Senate. Majority Leader Dole also introduced an amendment that established final language, which was agreed to. After disposing of the Reid amendment, the Senate considered and rejected several other amendments before voting on a motion entered by Majority Leader Dole. On February 16, the Senate failed to achieve cloture on a resolution with a vote of 57-42. However, they later agreed to limit further consideration and set a final vote for February 28. The Senate also approved an amendment by Senator Nunn, limiting judicial authority in interpreting the proposed constitutional amendment. The provision was passed with a vote of 92-8. The Senate recessed on February 28 and March 1 after finishing consideration of all amendments and motions. On February 28 and March 1, the Senate recessed without a final vote on the proposed constitutional amendment. On March 2, the Senate fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority, 65-35. Majority Leader Dole changed his vote to enter a motion to reconsider the vote later. On June 4, the Senate agreed to reconsider the vote, but the amendment failed again on June 5 and 6. On January 17, 1997, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the balanced budget amendment issue. Senator Orrin G. Hatch introduced S.J.Res. 1 on January 21, proposing a balanced budget amendment starting in FY2002. The Senate held hearings and deliberated on a proposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, with various amendments being rejected. Debate on the measure began on February 5, focusing on issues like the budgetary treatment of Social Security and waivers for national emergencies. During deliberation on the proposed balanced budget amendment, 15 amendments were considered but all were rejected, tabled, or withdrawn. A final vote was scheduled for March 4, where the measure was defeated by a vote of 66-34. A House companion measure, H.J.Res. 1, was also discussed in committee hearings. Introduced by Representative Earnest J. Istook with 133 cosponsors, H.J.Res. 1 was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and then to the Subcommittee on the Constitution. After a subcommittee hearing on March 6, 2003, a mark-up was held on May 1, 2003, and the measure was forwarded to the full committee by a 5-3 vote. However, on September 22, 2004, the full committee did not report the measure to the House. In January 2011, Representative Bob Goodlatte introduced a similar resolution, H.J.Res. 1, which underwent hearings and a mark-up in the Subcommittee on the Constitution. The committee voted to report the bill with an amendment by a 20-12 vote. H.J.Res. 1 includes provisions requiring three-fifths agreement for budget with outlays exceeding receipts or debt limit increase. House passed H.R. 2560, Cut, Cap, and Balance, not a balanced budget amendment but tied debt limit increase to balanced budget agreement. The Senate voted to table a measure for a balanced budget amendment on July 22, 2011. Instead, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted on August 2, 2011, which included provisions for a vote on a balanced budget amendment between September 20, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Title II includes expedited procedures for House and Senate consideration of a balanced budget amendment. On November 15, 2011, the House agreed to a special rule authorizing the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules for the consideration of a balanced budget amendment sponsored by Representative Bob Goodlatte. Unlike other proposed amendments, this amendment only requires a majority vote for a revenue increase and does not include a provision for creating a. The House failed to pass H.J.Res. 2, which required a three-fifths majority to increase the debt limit. The Senate considered S.J.Res. 10 and S.J.Res. 24, with provisions for a three-fifths majority to increase the debt limit. The Senate rejected S.J.Res. 10, which required a three-fifths majority to increase the debt limit, by a vote of 47 to 53. S.J.Res. 24, introduced by Senator Mark Udall, includes provisions for a three-fifths majority to allow outlays in excess of receipts but does not have requirements on debt limit or revenue increases. The Senate rejected S.J.Res. 24, a constitutional amendment proposal that includes provisions to limit Social Security benefits and income tax reductions for high earners. The measure was voted down 21 to 79. Article V of the Constitution allows for amendments to be proposed by Congress or by a convention called by two-thirds of the states. This method for proposing amendments has not been used before. A constitutional convention can propose amendments, but any amendment would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. Interest groups lobbied for a convention in the 1970s and 1980s to limit federal government power in budget deficits. Various groups, including the National Taxpayers Union and Citizens to Protect the Constitution, were active in these efforts. Opposition groups like the Committee to Preserve the Constitution have been active in opposing a constitutional convention, particularly in relation to a balanced budget amendment. Concerns include the potential scope of other amendments that could be proposed and ratified, as well as opposition to the balanced budget amendment itself. The Senate has passed constitutional convention procedures bills in 1971 and 1973, but they were not considered in the House. The Senate Judiciary Committee also reported a bill in 1985, but it was not further considered. The House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights held hearings on the issue in 1985. In 1983, 32 states had passed resolutions out of the required 34 for a constitutional convention. In 1983, 32 states had passed resolutions for a constitutional convention to propose a balanced budget amendment. By the end of the 100th Congress, two states had rescinded their applications, leading to uncertainty about the legal standing of rescissions. In the 100th Congress, Alabama and Florida rescinded their applications for a constitutional convention. Subsequently, other states like Nevada, Louisiana, Colorado, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, North Dakota, Wyoming, Arizona, and Georgia passed similar measures. An alternative to a constitutional amendment for regulating government spending is enacting a statute requiring a balanced budget, which proponents argue would be more flexible and quickly effective. Significant opposition to the statutory approach for regulating government spending has been voiced by critics who argue that it is not as effective as a constitutional amendment. They believe that a law can easily be circumvented or overturned by future Congresses, citing past attempts to mandate balanced budgets through statutes as evidence. The first example of such an approach was proposed by Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr. in 1978. The Byrd amendment in 1978 aimed to regulate government spending by limiting total budget outlays to not exceed receipts starting from fiscal year 1981. Despite being adopted by the Senate, the amendment lacked enforcement mechanisms and proved ineffective as FY1981 ended with a $79 billion deficit. Subsequent modifications shifted the focus from a specific commitment to a general goal of balanced budgets. Similar provisions were included in other legislation but were eventually superseded. The House considered a bill in 1990 to require the President to submit a balanced budget annually, but it did not pass as it lacked the necessary two-thirds vote for a constitutional amendment. The measure did not mandate Congress to adopt a balanced budget resolution or end the fiscal year in balance. The House considered a bill in 1990 to require the President and Congress to lay out specific plans to achieve a balanced budget, rather than just setting it as a general goal. Despite criticism, the bill passed with a vote of 282-144, but the Senate did not take further action. This measure was part of Congress's attempt to achieve a balanced budget, similar to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Control Act of 1985, also known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, established annual deficit reductions to achieve a balanced budget. It included a sequestration process for enforcement, following the Supreme Court striking down the original automatic mechanism. The Control Act of 1985, also known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, aimed to achieve a balanced budget through annual deficit reductions. However, it was deemed inadequate by Congress, leading to an amendment in 1987 that reinstated a modified sequestration process. This amendment was later replaced by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which shifted focus from specific deficit targets to limiting actions that would increase the deficit. The new act established deficit targets through FY1995, but did not require a balanced budget at that time. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established deficit targets through FY1995 but did not require a balanced budget. Enforcement provisions were extended in 1993 and 1997, with discussions on balanced budget amendments in Congress. Various interpretations of provisions have been debated, with some consensus among members but no determinative agreement. A balanced budget amendment would limit Congress's budgetary freedom, with various proposed measures aiming to achieve this goal in different ways. Interpretation of the amendments' language and enforcement would likely be subject to debate and potentially require statutory treatment or court interpretation due to the lack of extensive legislative history. Balanced budget proposals vary in how to achieve the goal, often requiring that total outlays do not exceed total receipts for a fiscal year. Some proposals allow for excess outlays with a three-fifths vote. Enforcement may be based on estimates, but actual balance at year-end is crucial. Another approach permits estimates for compliance measurement, such as requiring Congress to adopt a statement of receipts and outlays before a fiscal year. A balanced budget proposal may include a provision for Congress and the President to ensure that actual outlays do not exceed the outlays set forth in a statement of receipts and outlays before a fiscal year. Compliance could be measured using estimates for both outlays and receipts, allowing for projected outlays to not exceed projected receipts. This approach does not necessarily require a balanced budget at the end of the fiscal year. The proposal for a balanced budget includes a provision for Congress and the President to ensure that actual outlays do not exceed projected receipts. Some states with balanced budget requirements do not mandate a year-end balance, allowing deficits to be carried over if necessary. The reliability of estimates is crucial, especially if adherence to a balance standard based on actual outlays is required. The proposal for a balanced budget includes provisions for Congress and the President to ensure that actual outlays do not exceed projected receipts. There are incentives for both branches to skew estimates of receipts to favor spending cuts or higher spending, which could impact enforcement. Inaccurate estimates of outlays, particularly for entitlements, have led to the need for supplemental appropriations in recent years. The proposal for a balanced budget raises questions about its impact on mandatory spending, including veterans' benefits and agricultural subsidies. It questions if three-fifths support would be needed for appropriations and the release of funds, and how restrictions would affect entitlements. Some proposals may not truly prevent deficit spending. Budget amendments may not prohibit deficit spending as they could require a balanced budget based on expected revenues or outlays, leading to potential issues with optimistic economic forecasting. Waivers for balance requirements are allowed in certain circumstances like national emergencies or low economic growth. Some proposals aim to restrict Congress from exceeding anticipated revenues through a super-majority approval. The interpretation of these restrictions could allow executive departments to spend more than revenues if they have budget authority. However, implementing a super-majority requirement for excess outlays over receipts may pose challenges due to the lack of clarity on what constitutes a \"specific excess.\" The provision lacks clarity on how to identify the \"specific excess\" and how it would be applied in various scenarios, such as requiring a three-fifths majority for funding programs exceeding a certain amount or for releasing funds for mandatory spending programs. The ambiguity in budgetary legislation could give the majority party power to control funding for unpopular programs, potentially leading to their being unfunded or discontinued. Conversely, it could also allow the majority leadership to ensure deficit spending for popular programs, bypassing the balanced budget requirement. If unfunded programs reach their ceiling, they may require three-fifths support in each chamber. Questions arise about mandatory outlays and maintaining a balanced budget. The focus on presidential spending powers raises concerns about enforcement. The focus on presidential spending powers raises concerns about enforcement and the possibility of enhancing impoundment authority to ensure outlays do not exceed receipts. This would require considering the division of responsibility between the executive and legislative branches in the federal budget process. Measures for a balanced budget typically include the President submitting a proposed budget with total outlays not exceeding total receipts. The proposal aims to balance estimated outlays and receipts, potentially making the President's role in the budget process a constitutional requirement. Currently, the President's involvement is based on statute, but this change would formalize it in the Constitution. This could impact the budget-making process historically controlled by Congress, potentially allowing the President to have different estimates than Congress due to timing differences in budget submissions. The President's proposal would require balancing estimated outlays against receipts, potentially formalizing the President's role in the budget process. Differing estimates between Congress and the President could hinder achieving budgetary goals, especially regarding coverage exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Reduction Act. The difficulty in reaching agreement on exempting certain activities from sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act raises questions about the meaning of \"off-budget\" in a balanced budget proposal added to the Constitution. The inclusion of \"all receipts\" and \"all outlays\" in budget proposals could eliminate the option to create off-budget entities, impacting the budgetary status of entities like the Postal Service and Social Security. If a balanced budget amendment were to include all receipts and outlays, it could affect the budgetary status of entities like the Postal Service and Social Security. Various proposals have been made to address potential circumvention issues, such as exempting certain expenses or activities and implementing a capital budget to separate operating expenses from investments in long-term assets. The federal level proposals for a balanced budget amendment are typically inclusive, applying to all government receipts and outlays except for borrowing and debt repayment. State governments must balance their operating budget, but other fund groups may not need to balance annually. The Senate Judiciary Committee's 1993 report on S.J.Res. 41 clarified that \"total receipts\" and \"total outlays\" should include all money received by the Treasury, except for certain programs like the TVA's electric power program. This interpretation could potentially allow the government to create special authorities not covered by the balanced budget amendment. In 1995, public opposition to a balanced budget amendment focused on excluding Social Security Trust Funds from the requirement. Supporters argued that Social Security operates separately from the general fund, operates at a surplus, and should not be subject to potential benefit reductions from a deficit. They also highlighted that the accumulated surplus is held in government securities, making any expenditure require redemption of these securities. Opponents argue that exempting a large portion of federal transactions from a balanced budget amendment would weaken its effectiveness and could lead to circumvention. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) are not considered part of the federal government and their transactions are non-budgetary. These entities, like the Student Loan Marketing Association, influence credit allocation in the economy. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) like the Student Loan Marketing Association are not included in the federal budget totals. They receive special benefits from the government but are classified as private entities. Balanced budget amendments do not specifically address their budgetary treatment. Waivers for a balanced budget are common in cases of declared war or military emergencies. Some proposals suggest exemptions or waivers for the requirement of a balanced budget. The requirement for a balanced budget may be suspended for two consecutive quarters of less than one percent real economic growth, or during a national emergency. The definition and duration of a national emergency are not specified. Some proposals also aim to make it harder to increase the public debt by requiring a super majority vote. Some proposals aim to make it difficult to increase the public debt of the United States by requiring a super majority in each House to enact legislation. Different approaches include limiting increases in debt held by the public or the gross public debt. Some proposals even suggest running surpluses to pay down the debt. Some proposals aim to limit public debt by requiring a super majority to increase the debt held by the public. This includes debt borrowed from the public and debt held by the federal government. Intragovernmental debt includes trust funds. Debt held by the public is a financial claim on the federal government in the form of bonds and debt instruments. Intragovernmental debt held by trust funds does not involve borrowing from credit markets or represent a direct financial claim of the public on the government. Trust fund programs may entitle recipients to future benefits, but beneficiaries do not have a direct claim on the accumulated debt held by trust funds. Increases in trust fund holdings raise the reported gross public debt when receipts exceed payments. Excess trust fund receipts are invested in federal government debt instruments. Excess trust fund receipts are invested in federal government debt instruments, with approximately 33% of the gross public debt held by trust funds in 2010. The accumulation of interest on outstanding debt held by trust funds could require an increase in the gross public debt, impacting the budgetary status of Social Security. A balanced budget amendment may require a super-majority vote to allow the surplus held by a trust fund to increase. A balanced budget amendment could impact Social Security's ability to pay benefits by limiting the increase in publicly held federal debt. This could lead to separate statutory debt limits for intragovernmental debt and debt held by the public, similar to state experiences with different debt instruments. Constitutional limitations on debt have been less restrictive at the state level. State legislatures have used various financing techniques to comply with constitutional debt limitations, such as special fund financing and lease arrangements. If federal debt limits were imposed, the government may resort to similar methods. Proposals to limit federal taxing and spending include capping total outlays as a percentage of GDP or limiting spending growth. Support for these measures is based on the role of the federal government in the economy. Support for limiting federal taxing and spending is based on the belief that the government's role in the economy has grown too large. H.J.Res. 1 in the 112th Congress proposes capping outlays at 18% of the US economic output, with a two-thirds majority needed to increase it. The interpretation of limiting revenue increases is a significant question, as the Constitution's origination clause distinguishes between general revenue-raising bills and those for specific programs. The constitutional definition of \"revenue\" may differ from other uses, potentially limiting tax measures to funds for the general federal government, excluding specific programs. Not all government receipts are treated equally in the budget process, with some considered revenues and others as offsets to outlays. The phrase \"increasing revenue\" in proposals could have broad implications for legislation, potentially affecting measures that increase revenue through various means. The impact could extend to a significant portion of Congress's legislative agenda. Legislation stimulating economic activity and increasing revenues may be subject to a tax limitation provision. For example, reducing the tax rate on capital gains income could boost revenues in the short term. However, it is unclear if the provision would apply to measures like excise taxes on tobacco products, which aim to reduce revenues by inhibiting taxable activity. The interpretation of such provisions remains uncertain. The provision in question may exempt measures from tax limitations or lead to increased rates that contravene the provision. Typically, tax limitation provisions restrict revenue increases based on national income growth. Variations have been considered in Congress, with proponents arguing for preserving the current revenue ratio. Proponents argue that a provision to preserve the current ratio of federal revenues to the economy could be manipulated, as seen in the 1980 revision of national income definition. This could allow for revenue increases regardless of economic conditions, potentially requiring tax reductions if revenues grow faster than the economy. The late 1970s saw personal incomes increase faster than the economy due to inflation, leading to higher federal revenues from income taxes. Despite indexing for inflation, the progressive tax structure can still result in revenue growth outpacing the economy. A two-year lag in measuring national income and enacting fiscal policy could lead to counter-productive measures. One proposed solution is requiring a super-majority for revenue-increasing measures. Tax limitations could be passed by a super-majority of three-fifths or two-thirds of each House's total membership. This would allow tax increases beyond the rate of national income growth under specific circumstances. The \"Contract with America\" endorsed this approach in 1994. H.J.Res. 1 in the 112th Congress includes a provision for a two-thirds super majority. Some proposals suggest indirectly limiting taxes by restricting expenditures, which would deter revenue increases. The federal government historically did not operate with a sustained budget surplus, making it unlikely that a mandatory balanced budget would create an incentive for it. Expenditure limits could restrict taxation, with proposed limits around 18% to 20% of GDP. Repayment of debt principal would not provide a significant incentive for sustained surplus operation. The current level of federal expenditures exceeds the proposed limits of 18% to 20% of GDP, necessitating significant spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. Limitations on revenues or outlays could lead to a bias favoring tax expenditures, as they are often exempt from spending limitations. Restricting increases in receipts would hinder Congress's ability to eliminate tax expenditures and achieve budget balance. The Senate debated the issue of judicial review when considering a balanced budget amendment in the 103rd Congress. A provision was considered to limit the judiciary's power to order remedies, allowing only declaratory judgments or remedies specifically authorized by law for violations. This would leave the judiciary with the authority to interpret the amendment or implementing legislation. The Senate debated limiting the judiciary's power to order remedies for violations of a balanced budget amendment, proposing only declaratory judgments or remedies authorized by law. This would shift the balance of power among the federal government branches, with enforcement left to the elected branches unless courts are given specific authority. The effectiveness of this limitation would rely on parties respecting the judgment terms. Appendix B. Legislative History of the Balanced Budget Provision in 31 U.S.C. 1103 (formerly 31 U.S.C. 27) \"Byrd Amendment\" (named after Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr. (D-VA)) Passed Senate 58-28 (vote no. 270, July 31, 1978), as an amendment to a bill amending the Bretton Woods Agreement for the IMF. House adopted instructions to conferees on the bill, including this provision, by a vote of 286-91 (roll no. 778, September 14, 1978). Provision incorporated in final version during conference. Amended twice without separate votes. P.L. 95-435, 92 Stat. 1051, October 10, 1978. P.L. 96-389, 94 Stat. 1551, October 7, 1980. \"Section 7. Beginning with fiscal year 1981, total budget outlays of Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts.\" The Federal Government's budget outlays must not exceed its receipts, as reaffirmed by Congress in various legislative amendments.
