    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Majority Vote Act of 2004\". Congress finds that in some general elections, the majority of voters split their votes between similar candidates or dissimilar candidates, allowing a third candidate supported by a minority to win, thus denying the will of the majority. The current plurality winner system creates incentives for negative campaigning and violates the principle of majority rule. Instant runoff voting, used in various countries and party primaries, requires the winner to earn a majority of votes by allowing voters to rank candidates. This encourages positive campaigning and ensures the winner has majority support. Instant runoff voting is gaining interest and approval in various states like California, New Mexico, Vermont, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington for Presidential elections. Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, and the Grange support its implementation for statewide offices. The Speaker of the California Assembly has introduced a bill for instant runoff voting in elections to fill vacancies in Congress. This method requires voting equipment compatible with ranked ballots to consolidate two-round runoffs into one election, saving money and increasing voter turnout. The national voting equipment lacks compatibility with ranked ballots due to underinvestment. There are no Federal mandatory standards for voting equipment, and the current system is managed by 13,000 separate jurisdictions. National polls show support for a unitary voting system. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. REQUIRING USE OF INSTANT RUNOFF VOTING FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS FOR FEDERAL OFFICE.\" is about the requirement to use instant runoff voting for federal office general elections. Each State must conduct general elections for Federal office using an instant runoff voting system, ensuring compatibility with the technology. Definitions include \"Federal office\" and \"instant runoff voting system\" for candidate elections with ranked preferences. In an instant runoff voting system for Federal office elections, if no candidate receives a majority of votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated in each round. Voters rank candidates, and runoff counts are automatic. The term \"State\" includes various territories. Grants to states for administering instant runoff voting system. The Election Assistance Commission will provide grants to eligible States for administering an instant runoff voting system, covering costs of voting equipment and technology. The Commission will develop criteria for grant applications and oversight within 60 days of the Act's enactment, without requiring state matching funds. Eligibility for grants is open to all States. A State can receive a grant under the program by submitting an application to the Commission with required information and assurances. The Commission must approve or reject the application within 120 days of receiving it, based on specified criteria. Under this subsection, a State may not receive a grant if its election equipment is not compatible with instant runoff voting or if it lacks voter education on the system. The grant amount is capped based on the state's population and cannot exceed $12 per resident. Appropriations are authorized for the program. The program under this section is allocated $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and necessary funds for each following fiscal year. SEC. 5. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS: This Act does not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.\n\nSEC. 6. SEVERABILITY: If any part of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
