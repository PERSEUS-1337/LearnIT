Congress acknowledges the unique relationship between the US government and Indian tribes, along with the federal trust responsibility to Native Americans. Native Americans face severe housing conditions, including overcrowding, lack of solid waste management, unsafe water supply, and high rates of homelessness. The poverty rate among Native Americans is double that of the general population in the US. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 allows Indian tribes to determine rental and homebuyer payments. To fully recognize tribal self-determination, the Act should be amended to remove the mandatory 30 percent payment ceiling and replace it with a fair market rent ceiling to ensure participants do not pay more than the fair market rate for housing. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 should be amended to eliminate the 30-percent ceiling requirement, allowing Indian tribes to use resources more effectively for urgent housing needs. Additionally, the Act should be revised to provide Indian tribes with the opportunity to establish reasonable reserves for housing program operation and maintenance. The Act should be amended to allow Indian tribes to establish reserve accounts for housing program operation and to leverage funds with other sources. Members of Indian tribes are given preference for housing programs, and the Department of Agriculture is a significant funding source for housing for Indian tribes. The Housing Act of 1949 should be amended to clarify that giving preference to Indian tribes does not violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act should also be amended to include Indian tribes as eligible applicants for Youthbuild grants.

The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 is amended to define fair market rent for dwelling units.

Mandatory income recertification is not required for families in these units. SEC. 4. RESERVE ACCOUNTS. Section 203(b) of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 is amended to require recipients to maintain reserves for payment of housing-related obligations and expenses. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 is amended to require recipients to maintain reserves for housing-related obligations and expenses. Additionally, a new subsection is added to specify the effect of this requirement. SEC. 5. Amends the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act to restrict access to program income. SEC. 6. Adds a provision to the Housing Act of 1949 stating that giving preference to members of an Indian tribe for housing assistance does not violate civil rights laws. SEC. 7.
