    "content": "Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, enacted under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, aims to facilitate cooperation between U.S. and foreign courts in international insolvency proceedings. It clarifies the administration of main bankruptcy proceedings, ancillary proceedings, and requests to suspend or dismiss U.S. proceedings to avoid conflicts with foreign proceedings. These provisions were first introduced in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 and were later expanded in response to requests for greater multilateral cooperation. Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, enacted under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, implements the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency developed by UNCITRAL. It aims to facilitate cooperation between U.S. and foreign courts in international insolvency proceedings by addressing jurisdictional issues and promoting comity or reciprocity between courts. In cross-border insolvency proceedings, cooperation between courts, known as \"comity\" or \"reciprocity,\" allows for procedural or substantive assistance. Comity involves considering laws or decisions from another jurisdiction voluntarily, while reciprocity entails recognizing and enforcing laws or decisions from another jurisdiction. This cooperation grants foreign creditors or trustees the right to request insolvency declarations, enforce foreign court orders for asset turnover, and ensure asset preservation in the host jurisdiction until a final ruling. Procedural cooperation also includes communication and overseeing reorganization administration. In cross-border insolvency proceedings, cooperation between courts, known as \"comity\" or \"reciprocity,\" allows for procedural or substantive assistance. This cooperation involves updating other courts with new information and overseeing the administration of reorganization or liquidation plans. Foreign creditors and trustees may face obstacles with their claims being unrecognized or subordinated by the host court. International efforts have been made to facilitate handling concurrent bankruptcies in multiple jurisdictions. The U.S. did not enter into treaties for concurrent bankruptcies in multiple jurisdictions, opting for judicial discretion. High-profile cases in the mid-1970s led to reforms in 1978 regarding international insolvency. Three cases involving foreign banks declared insolvent abroad but with U.S. assets prompted the enactment of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 303-306 in 1978. The three foreign banks (Herstatt, IBB, or Finabank) had accounts with major U.S. banks to settle foreign exchange contracts. Confusion arose over whether they were considered banks or corporations under U.S. law, as their structure did not align with U.S. business forms. The central issue was determining if they were covered by the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. If covered, they could file for voluntary bankruptcy and certain claims made against their assets within four months prior to filing would be voidable preferences under U.S. law. The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 aimed to prevent preferential treatment of creditors by voiding transactions made within four months before a debtor filed for bankruptcy. The Act did not clearly specify coverage of foreign banks, leading to a debate on whether they were banking corporations or foreign corporations eligible for bankruptcy protection. U.S. banks claimed that foreign banks were banking corporations, making them ineligible for bankruptcy, while the foreign banks sought to void U.S. attachments on their accounts and transfer funds to their liquidators appointed by non-U.S. courts. The U.S. banks and foreign banks in the Herstatt case were in a legal battle over the treatment of their claims in bankruptcy. The courts' decisions would impact the distribution of assets, with U.S. banks seeking full satisfaction outside of bankruptcy and foreign banks pushing for pro rata distribution. The Second Circuit asserted the 1898 Act's coverage over foreign banks holding assets in the U.S. and emphasized comity in its decisions. In the Herstatt case, U.S. and foreign banks were in a legal battle over asset distribution in bankruptcy. The Second Circuit emphasized comity and reciprocity in international insolvency proceedings, as seen in cases like IBB and Finabank. Congress incorporated these principles into the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, ensuring protection for U.S. creditors in cross-border insolvency cases. The Second Circuit reversed the lower courts' dismissal of Finabank's chapter 11 petition, citing the incomplete filing due to Swiss banking laws. Finabank's intention to seek rehabilitation was questioned, but the failure to provide a complete list of creditors was deemed fatal. The Second Circuit reversed the dismissal of Finabank's chapter 11 petition due to incomplete filing. Options upon remand included administering assets in the U.S. through a Swiss proceeding or coordinating a full U.S. proceeding with a Swiss court. Congress clarified procedures for cross-border insolvency cases with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 focused on the role of the foreign representative in U.S. courts, granting them the ability to file petitions for involuntary bankruptcy, ancillary proceedings, and request suspension or dismissal of proceedings. Section 306 allowed for a limited appearance, while Section 303 addressed issues related to foreign banks being forced into bankruptcy in the U.S. without pending foreign proceedings. Before the enactment of \u00a7 304, a foreign representative had two choices when seeking relief involving assets in the United States: resort to litigation in state or federal nonbankruptcy courts or subject the debtor's estate to a full bankruptcy case. Section 304(c) outlined factors for the court to consider in granting relief, emphasizing economical and expeditious administration of the estate and just treatment of all claim holders. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code addresses the recognition of foreign bankruptcies and the role of foreign representatives in court. The Singer Company's reorganization in 1999-2001 highlighted the value of foreign representatives in chapter 11 proceedings. In 1999, Singer Company had 11 petitions for bankruptcy. Two of Singer's lawyers were appointed as foreign representatives to ensure equal treatment of all creditors. They prevented local creditors from seizing assets and negotiated a global agreement among creditors. Singer did not need to seek bankruptcy court relief for violations of the automatic stay. Automatic stay in bankruptcy immediately stops collection activities. International insolvency requires recognition and enforcement of automatic stay by courts in different countries. The 1978 Act provisions on cross-border insolvency were not fully effective due to territorial limitations on courts' jurisdiction. UNCITRAL's Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, enacted as chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code, aimed to improve multilateral cooperation. Despite successful use of protocols in coordinating multinational bankruptcies, uncertainties remained regarding foreign recognition of U.S. judgments and U.S. authority to enforce violations of the automatic stay. The curr_chunk discusses challenges with cross-border insolvency cases, specifically regarding the recognition of U.S. judgments in other countries and enforcement of the automatic stay. Issues arose in cases like Paolo Gucci, where assets in England and Korea were involved, highlighting the complexities of international bankruptcy proceedings. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of cross-border insolvency cases, particularly in Korea where valuable trademarks are attached to the estate. Litigation is ongoing in Korean courts, with the automatic stay not being recognized. Harmonizing bankruptcy laws globally or regionally is deemed difficult, with various initiatives like the ALI's Transnational Insolvency Project and the International Bar Association's Cross-Border Insolvency Concordat aiming to address these challenges. The need for comity in international insolvency was recognized by key parties involved in proceedings, leading to initiatives like the UNCITRAL's Model Law of Cross-Border Insolvency. UNCITRAL's work in this area was prompted by suggestions from practitioners at the UNCITRAL Congress in 1992. In 1994, a Colloquium on Cross-Border Insolvency was held by UNCITRAL and INSOL to promote cooperation between courts and recognition of insolvency proceedings. The Working Group on Insolvency, active from 1994 to 1997, aimed to enhance cooperation between courts, recognize foreign proceedings, and provide access to estate representatives. Emphasizing procedural harmonization over substantive law, they chose a model law for flexibility. Automatic stays were a challenging issue, showcasing the compromises made in the process. The Working Group on Insolvency compromised on automatic stays, agreeing that they should be imposed when a court recognizes a foreign main proceeding, but subject to local law exceptions. UNCITRAL approved the Model Law in 1997, and the UN General Assembly recommended members review their insolvency laws based on this model. UNCITRAL released a Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law in 2004, endorsed by the UN General Assembly for adoption. The US Senate Subcommittee also held a hearing on UNCITRAL's Model Law and bankruptcy code reform requests. The US adopted UNCITRAL's Model Law into its legislation through the BAPCPA, making it one of 11 countries with similar laws. Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code covers definitions, recognition of proceedings, creditor treatment, and cooperation. Amendments under the BAPCPA include recognizing foreign court interim proceedings, simplifying asset location definitions, and aligning terms with Chapters 7 and 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code aligns with Chapters 7 and 11, expanding the definition of \"foreign representative\" and linking Section 109 with the International Banking Act of 1978 for consistency. The application for recognition of a foreign proceeding under \u00a7 1515 is crucial for foreign representatives, as failure to file does not terminate rights but delays future action. Filing the application does not subject the applicant to additional U.S. jurisdiction. Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code expands the definition of \"foreign representative\" and requires the filing of an application for recognition of a foreign proceeding. The foreign representative must provide certification of the foreign court's commencement of the proceeding and appointment of the representative. The court may grant limited relief upon filing the petition, with public policy concerns being a potential factor in denying relief. Few courts have relied on public policy concerns to deny relief, with the exception being narrowly defined. Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code expands the definition of \"foreign representative\" and requires an application for recognition of a foreign proceeding. Orders granting recognition of the foreign proceeding may be subject to the public policy exception and require notice and a hearing. If the foreign proceeding is in the same country as the debtor's interests, it is recognized as the foreign main proceeding; otherwise, as a foreign nonmain proceeding. Recognition of a foreign main proceeding triggers protections for the debtor's assets under U.S. territorial jurisdiction. The foreign representative may operate the debtor's business and make transfers of interest within the U.S. jurisdiction. These provisions do not automatically apply to nonmain proceedings. Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the court may grant various forms of relief, subject to the public policy exception. The foreign representative can participate in the debtor's case under Title 11 and may be entrusted with the debtor's assets in the U.S. as long as creditor interests are protected. Foreign and domestic creditors have equal rights and claim priorities in a case against a debtor. When deciding on assistance to a foreign body, U.S. courts consider avoiding prejudice to U.S. claim holders. The courts in cases like Artimm, S.r.L. and Board of Directors of Multicanal, S.A. applied principles of chapter 15, ensuring protection of U.S. creditors' interests in the turnover of U.S. assets to foreign representatives. The court in Multicanal found that its authority to assist foreign representatives and protect all claim holders is clearer under Chapter 15 than under \u00a7 304. Multicanal's board of directors initiated an ancillary proceeding in the U.S. to enjoin U.S. lawsuits and dismiss an involuntary chapter 11 petition. One issue concerned Multicanal's offer to exchange securities purchased by U.S. investors, requiring a fairness hearing under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933. The court found that a foreign representative should be entitled to seek a fairness hearing in connection with an ancillary petition. The court acknowledged that U.S. securities law may hinder foreign restructuring but stated that a fairness hearing could address both U.S. securities law and bankruptcy law concerns. Chapter 15 mandates cooperation with foreign courts to handle cross-border insolvency cases effectively, including direct communications and coordination of administration. The coordination of concurrent cases in cross-border insolvency involves ensuring consistency in relief granted in U.S. and foreign proceedings. Recognition of a foreign main proceeding under chapter 15 allows for a U.S. case to be initiated against the debtor if assets are in the U.S. Relief in foreign nonmain proceedings must align with the main proceeding if no U.S. case is pending. Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code implements UNCITRAL's Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, focusing on the role of the foreign representative and procedural cooperation in various insolvency proceedings. It aims to promote comity and reciprocity to enhance the efficiency and equity of international insolvency proceedings."
