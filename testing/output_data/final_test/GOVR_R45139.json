    "content": "Unauthorized childhood arrivals, also known as Dreamers, are foreign nationals brought to the US as children by their parents. They are a subset of the unauthorized alien population and are viewed sympathetically by some for their lack of responsibility for their unlawful status. Legislative activity in response to the termination of the DACA policy has been ongoing since the 107th Congress. On September 5, 2017, the Trump Administration announced the termination of the DACA policy established by the Obama Administration in 2012. DACA granted deferred action to certain individuals without lawful immigration status who met specific requirements, including age and residency criteria, educational or military qualifications, and criminal background checks. Deferred action recipients were protected from deportation and could access certain benefits. The DACA policy provided protection against removal from the United States and work authorization. Initial grants were for two years and could be renewed. Under the Trump Administration's phase-out plan, DACA beneficiaries could submit renewal requests if their grant expired before March 5, 2018. DHS continues to process renewal requests despite the phase-out plan. USCIS approved 807,447 initial DACA requests by January 31, 2018. In January 2018, the White House proposed a legislative framework for immigration reform, including legal status for DACA recipients and other eligible immigrants. The Senate considered immigration proposals in February 2018, while the House had not addressed legislation on childhood arrivals in the 115th Congress. Previous measures aimed to grant lawful permanent residency to eligible childhood arrivals. Legislative proposals have been introduced to grant lawful permanent residency to unauthorized childhood arrivals, often referred to as the DREAM Act. Congressional action on this issue dates back to the early 2000s, with different bills introduced but not seeing further action. In recent years, legislative proposals for unauthorized childhood arrivals, known as the DREAM Act, have been introduced in Congress but have not been enacted. Various bills have been considered, including in the 109th, 110th, and 111th Congresses, but none have passed. The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with a DREAM Act title in the 109th Congress, but the House did not consider it. In the 110th Congress, there were unsuccessful efforts in the Senate to pass a comprehensive immigration reform proposal with a DREAM Act title and a stand-alone DREAM Act bill. In the 111th Congress, the House approved DREAM Act language as part of another bill, but the Senate rejected it. In the 113th Congress, the Senate passed an immigration reform bill with DREAM Act provisions (S. 744), but the House did not consider it. In the 115th Congress, various bills were introduced to provide immigration relief to unauthorized childhood arrivals, some offering a pathway to LPR status while others providing DACA-like temporary protection. In February 2018, the Senate discussed three proposals for unauthorized childhood arrivals, all including a pathway to LPR status for successful applicants with differing provisions. Legislation in the 115th Congress aims to provide temporary relief. Legislation in the 115th Congress proposes temporary protection and employment authorization for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals, including DACA recipients. One proposal offers a new status granting three years of protection from removal and work authorization, renewable in three-year increments. Another proposal provides temporary protection and employment authorization for a more limited three-year period, not limited to current DACA recipients. Eligibility requirements are similar to those for DACA. Legislation in the 115th Congress proposes temporary protection and employment authorization for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals, including DACA recipients. The proposal offers a new status granting three years of protection from removal and work authorization, renewable in three-year increments. Multiple bills have been introduced to establish special pathways to LPR status for unauthorized childhood arrivals, with eligibility requirements similar to DACA. These bills would grant lawful permanent resident status on a conditional basis to individuals who meet specific requirements, such as continuous presence in the U.S. since a specified date, initial entry before a certain age, educational or work activities, and background checks. Some bills in the 115th Congress propose new eligibility criteria for unauthorized childhood arrivals, different from DACA requirements. These bills may have varying cutoff dates for continuous presence and initial entry age, with additional criteria needed to transition to full lawful permanent resident status. The bills in the 115th Congress propose new eligibility criteria for unauthorized childhood arrivals, including education, military service, or work requirements for LPR pathways. They also vary in the length of pathways to LPR status and include provisions for residence requirements for naturalization. In the 115th Congress, bills propose new eligibility criteria for unauthorized childhood arrivals, including education, military service, or work requirements for LPR pathways. Some bills include provisions for residence requirements for naturalization. In February 2018, the Senate considered immigration proposals as floor amendments to an unrelated bill, with one amendment focusing on unauthorized childhood arrivals. In 1955, a proposed mechanism would have allowed certain unauthorized childhood arrivals to become lawful permanent residents through a two-stage process. Stage 1 required meeting specific criteria such as continuous presence in the US since December 31, 2013, initial entry before age 18, no inadmissibility under specified grounds, and educational attainment. Conditional permanent resident status would be valid for eight years and required background checks, a medical examination, and registration under the Military Selective Service Act. In stage 2, a conditional permanent resident would have to meet additional requirements to have the conditional basis of their status removed and become a full-fledged LPR. These requirements included acquiring a college degree, completing a postsecondary vocational program, serving in the uniformed services, or having valid employment for at least three years. Other requirements included satisfying English language and civics requirements for naturalization and passing security and law enforcement background checks. The Senate voted (52-47) not to invoke cloture on S.Amdt. 1955, which would have provided a two-stage pathway to LPR status for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals. The amendment included requirements such as acquiring a college degree, completing a vocational program, serving in the military, or having valid employment for at least three years to remove the conditional basis of their status. In stage 1, an alien would need to be a DACA recipient or meet specific requirements for conditional permanent resident status, including continuous presence in the US since June 15, 2012, initial entry before age 18, no inadmissibility or criminal ineligibilities, educational or military service requirements, a maximum age limit, and payment of federal taxes. All applicants would undergo background checks, a medical exam, and register under the Military Selective Service Act. Conditional permanent resident status under S.Amdt. 1958 would have been valid for seven years, subject to termination. To become a full-fledged LPR, a conditional resident would need to meet stage 2 requirements such as acquiring a college degree, serving in the military, or having valid employment for at least three years. Other requirements include English language and civics proficiency. Under S.Amdt. 1958, conditional permanent resident status would have been valid for seven years, with requirements including English language and civics proficiency, completion of background checks, payment of taxes, and demonstration of good moral character. The amendment would have allowed time in conditional status to count towards naturalization, but beneficiaries could not naturalize until 12 years after receiving conditional status, with a possible reduction of up to two years for DACA recipients. Additionally, the parents of beneficiaries would have been limited in obtaining LPR status in the United States. The Senate voted against invoking cloture on S.Amdt. 1958, which included provisions for unauthorized childhood arrivals in the SECURE and SUCCEED Act. The SUCCEED Act aimed to establish a two-stage process for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals to obtain LPR status, with requirements such as continuous presence in the U.S. since June 15, 2012, and initial entry before age 16. The Senate rejected S.Amdt. 1958, part of the SECURE and SUCCEED Act, which aimed to provide LPR status to certain unauthorized childhood arrivals meeting specific criteria. These criteria included continuous presence in the U.S. since June 15, 2012, initial entry before age 16, and meeting educational or military requirements based on age. Additional requirements included background checks, medical exams, tax obligations, and registration under the Military Selective Service Act. S.Amdt. 1959 proposed conditional temporary resident status for unauthorized childhood arrivals, with requirements such as acknowledging consequences for violating terms, valid for up to seven years or until age 18, eligible for employment and enlistment in the U.S. Armed Forces, and allowed travel outside the U.S. Extension for five years possible with additional requirements. S.Amdt. 1959 proposed conditional temporary resident status for unauthorized childhood arrivals, valid for up to seven years or until age 18, with the possibility of extension for five years if additional requirements were met, such as college attendance, military service, or employment. To obtain LPR status, further requirements included English language proficiency, background checks, tax payment, and good moral character demonstration. The Senate voted against S.Amdt. 1959, which proposed more restrictive provisions for obtaining lawful immigration status for family members of beneficiaries. The proposal would have required a seven-year wait after LPR status to apply for naturalization and restricted family members from gaining status based on a parental relationship. Various proposals in February 2018 aimed to establish a pathway to LPR status for eligible unauthorized childhood arrivals, with differences in eligible population, legalization process, and timeline. The Senate rejected a proposal for stricter provisions on family members' immigration status. Various proposals in February 2018 aimed to provide a pathway to legal permanent resident status for unauthorized childhood arrivals, with differences in eligibility, process, and timeline. It is uncertain if the 115th Congress will consider similar immigration measures or explore alternative approaches."
