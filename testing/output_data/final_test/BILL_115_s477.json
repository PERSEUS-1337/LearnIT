The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a national congenital heart disease cohort study, surveillance system, and awareness campaign. The Secretary is required to enhance research and surveillance infrastructure for congenital heart disease and implement a public outreach and education campaign. Grants may be awarded to eligible entities for carrying out these activities. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Congenital Heart Disease Surveillance System. This system aims to facilitate research and surveillance for congenital heart disease. Subsections (b) and (c) are modified to align with this purpose. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Congenital Heart Disease Cohort Study through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This study aims to improve understanding of congenital heart disease epidemiology across the lifespan, with a focus on research and surveillance activities. The National Congenital Heart Disease Cohort Study aims to investigate health care utilization, demographic factors, and outcome measures related to CHD. Permissible considerations include gathering data on diverse populations affected by CHD and addressing health disparities, including prenatal exposures. The National Congenital Heart Disease Cohort Study aims to investigate health care utilization, demographic factors, and outcome measures related to CHD. Data generated from the study will be made available for research purposes and to the public, with a focus on patient privacy and compliance with regulations. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 includes a section on Congenital Heart Disease Awareness Campaign, which aims to raise awareness, outreach, and education about CHD across all ages. The campaign emphasizes the prevalence of CHD, highlights it as a lifelong condition, and promotes the importance of specialized care for individuals with CHD. The section on Congenital Heart Disease Awareness Campaign allows for collaborations with other agencies, healthcare professionals, and patient advocacy organizations specializing in CHD. It also permits the use of various media platforms for distributing educational materials. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. The Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2017 amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of NIH to provide a report to Congress outlining ongoing research efforts and future plans for research on congenital heart disease."
