The Isla Vista community in Santa Barbara County has a population of around 15,000 residents living on approximately 1,200 acres of land near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus. It is one of the largest urban communities in California not governed as a city. Isla Vista, an unincorporated area near the University of California, Santa Barbara, faces challenges in local governance due to its transient student population and renter-oriented community. Its unincorporated status limits local participation in managing public services and obtaining needed public improvements. Isla Vista competes for attention and funding from county agencies that provide services throughout the whole county. The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District is the only local district providing limited services exclusively to Isla Vista, with stewardship of protected wetlands and coastline. Cityhood for Isla Vista has been denied for reasons like financial and political feasibility. In 2003, a community services district was recommended as the best governance option, but no action was taken at that time. Over the past year, Isla Vista has faced various challenges, including injuries, sexual assaults, riots, a mass murder, and homicides. A local coalition has been formed to explore self-governance options for the community, with significant local support for the community services district. The UC Santa Barbara Foundation Trustees formed a committee to analyze Isla Vista and recommend creating a Community Services District with various powers. This is in response to recent events in Isla Vista, including injuries, sexual assaults, riots, a mass murder, and homicides. The Isla Vista Community Services District may be established in accordance with specific provisions, with the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara required to file a resolution of application by January 5, 2016, to initiate a review and recommendation process by the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission. The Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission must review the resolution of application within 150 days and cannot disapprove it. The resolution is not subject to protest proceedings. The Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission must review the resolution of application within 150 days and cannot disapprove it, followed by ordering the formation of a district subject to a vote of registered voters. The commission will determine the appropriate rate of taxation for a utility user tax, applicable utilities to be taxed, and services the district will provide. The tax rate will range from 5 to 8 percent of the total cost of an individual's service charge. The utility user tax in the proposed district must be approved by voters before January 1, 2023, or the district will be dissolved. The Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission will oversee the elections for district approval, board candidates, and the utility user tax. The initial tax revenue will fund specific district services and powers. The district can finance municipal advisory councils, create a tenant mediation program, finance area planning commissions, exercise parking district powers, contract for additional police services, and operate community facilities. The district can acquire, construct, improve, and maintain sidewalks, lighting, gutters, and trees, as well as abate graffiti. The board of directors shall be composed of five members elected at large from within the district. The board of directors of the district consists of five members elected at large, with terms ranging from two to four years. Additionally, one member is appointed by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara for a two-year term, and another member is appointed by the Chancellor of the University of California, Santa Barbara for a four-year term. There is no limit on the number of terms an individual may serve on the board. The district's board of directors is elected at large with terms of two to four years. Candidates are qualified according to the Uniform District Election Law. The district's boundaries are contiguous with County Service Area No. 31 in Santa Barbara, excluding University of California-owned property.
