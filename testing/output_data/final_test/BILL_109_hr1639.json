    "content": "The Act titled \"Military Health Services Improvement Act of 2005\" is also known as the \"Military Health Services Improvement Act of 2005\". The Act includes findings related to military health services. Congress finds that over 160,000 US servicemembers are serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, with over 100,000 National Guard and reserve forces also engaged in the war on terrorism. Nearly one in six soldiers from Operation Iraqi Freedom suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, with over 900 evacuated due to mental health issues. The stigma surrounding mental health treatment remains a barrier to care, and untreated mental health illnesses are linked to severe social consequences. Mental health illnesses are associated with severe social issues like alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, familial disintegration, and homelessness. SEC. 3. PRE- AND POST-DEPLOYMENT SCREENING PROGRAM FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES. The Secretary of Defense must establish regulations for pre- and post-deployment mental health evaluations for members of the Armed Forces deploying to combat theaters. This includes in-person evaluations before deployment and within 30 days after returning from service or being injured in a combat theater. Additionally, a Mental Health Awareness Program must be implemented. The Secretary of Defense will implement a program to raise awareness about mental health issues for Armed Forces members and their families, reduce stigma associated with mental health care, and may partner with accredited institutions to carry out the program. The program will be available in foreign languages if needed. The Secretary will implement a mental health program within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Mental health services will not harm an individual's career. SEC. 4. MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS FOR DEPENDENTS. The Secretary of Defense must develop a program to increase awareness of mental health services and warning signs for dependents of Armed Forces members who served in combat theaters. This program aims to provide support for active duty, Reservists, and National Guard members' dependents. The Secretary of Defense will establish a toll-free number and website to help Armed Forces members and their dependents find treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and combat stress. Coordination with mental health professionals and availability of the program in foreign languages will be ensured. The program will be available in foreign languages to aid comprehension among those seeking help. Improved coordination between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will create a memorandum of understanding within 180 days to enhance the transition of mental health cases from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs. This memorandum will require the Department of Defense to report any post-traumatic stress disorder or other combat-related disorders in discharged members to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, disciplinary actions taken against members will also be reported. The Secretary of Defense will report any disciplinary measures taken against a member of the Armed Forces in a combat theater upon discharge. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the implementation of this section within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense will establish an information clearinghouse for combat stress treatment professionals within 180 days. Additionally, mental health services under TRICARE will be available for certain reserve members after deactivation. The Secretary of Defense will provide mental health services under TRICARE for eligible reserve members and their families for 24 months after service termination. Eligibility criteria include being called to active duty for over 30 days and serving 90 or more days in a combat zone. In this Act, a \"qualified mental health professional\" is defined as an accredited psychologist, psychiatrist, child psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker, or a student pursuing a post-graduate degree in mental health-related fields."
