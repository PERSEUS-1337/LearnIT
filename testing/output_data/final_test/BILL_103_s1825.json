    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tax Fairness for Main Street Business Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that out-of-State firms are not compelled to collect and remit State and local sales taxes, causing unfair competition for small businesses. State and local governments provide resources to out-of-State firms, but the lack of tax collection deprives them of needed revenue. The Supreme Court ruled in Quill v. North Dakota (1992) that State governments can impose tax obligations on out-of-State firms soliciting sales from residents. Congress can authorize States to require out-of-State firms to collect sales taxes, and the Federal Government has a duty to assist State and local governments in collecting these taxes. The authority for the collection of sales tax is granted by Congress to States for out-of-State firms soliciting sales from residents. States are authorized to require a person to collect and remit sales tax if the destination of the tangible personal property is in the State, and the person meets certain sales thresholds. The State must also collect and administer all local sales taxes imposed. States may require the collection and remittance of local sales taxes if they also require the collection of state sales taxes. Aggregation rules apply to treat certain entities as one for tax purposes. The destination of tangible personal property determines the jurisdiction for tax collection. SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES. Uniform Local Sales Taxes under this Act require local jurisdictions to impose sales taxes at the same rate and on identical transactions statewide. Taxes on sales by out-of-state persons must be collected and administered by the State. Border jurisdictions can adjust their tax rates without penalty. The Act allows for adjustments in local sales tax rates to match those of bordering states or exempt certain transactions. Nonuniform local sales taxes must be collected under specified options. The Act allows for adjustments in local sales tax rates to match those of bordering states or exempt certain transactions. A fee can be elected in lieu of nonuniform local sales taxes, with the rate determined based on total revenues collected in the State. The Act allows for adjustments in local sales tax rates to match those of bordering states or exempt certain transactions. A fee can be elected in lieu of nonuniform local sales taxes, with the rate determined based on total revenues collected in the State. Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent. Nonuniform local sales taxes are those that do not meet the requirements of the Act. States must distribute a portion of the amounts collected to local jurisdictions based on uniform local sales taxes and in-lieu fees. The Act allows for adjustments in local sales tax rates to match those of bordering states or exempt certain transactions. A fee can be elected in lieu of nonuniform local sales taxes, with the rate determined based on total revenues collected in the State. Amounts determined based on data for the most recently completed State fiscal year will be distributed to local jurisdictions in accordance with State timetables, not less frequently than every calendar quarter. The State shall distribute amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) as per State law. A transition rule applies if a State has a different method for distributing local sales taxes, delaying the application of this subsection until after the State's legislative session. Local sales taxes collected before this subsection applies will be distributed according to State law. SEC. 5. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS. A State cannot require individuals subject to this Act to file tax returns or remit tax receipts more frequently than once per calendar quarter. Initial returns and remittances must be made within 90 days of the first taxable transaction. Local taxes are also subject to these requirements. SEC. 6. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS. SEC. 6 of the Act prohibits a State from requiring out-of-state individuals to collect and remit sales tax if local individuals would be exempt under similar circumstances. SEC. 7 of the Act states that any person required to collect a State or local sales tax must comply with the relevant State laws, with limitations. It also prohibits States from licensing or regulating individuals, requiring qualifications for intrastate business, or imposing State taxes unrelated to tangible personal property sales. The Act does not preempt State or local jurisdiction powers, except as specified. SEC. 8 of the Act mandates that States must provide a toll-free telephone service for information on sales tax collection, including tax rates, deadlines, and forms. The service must be free and prominently displayed on all correspondence. It can be shared among multiple States. The Act defines terms such as compensating use tax, local sales tax, and person for taxation purposes. The term \"sales tax\" refers to a tax imposed on the sale, purchase, storage, consumption, distribution, or use of tangible personal property, measured by the sales price or value. The term \"State\" includes all states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. The term \"State\" includes all states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. The Act will become effective 180 days after its enactment and will not apply to any sales before this date."
