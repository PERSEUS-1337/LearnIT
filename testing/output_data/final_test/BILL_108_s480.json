    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2004\". Congress finds that the Federal Communications Commission has mandated closed captioning for television programming, with new programs required to be fully captioned starting in 2006. Approximately 28 million Americans, including 24,000 children born each year with hearing loss, rely on captioning services for participation in mainstream activities. According to a study by the National Council on Aging, a significant percentage of Americans over the age of 65, 70, and 75 are hearing impaired. The study also suggests a link between hearing loss and depression in older adults. Additionally, research shows that captions can improve reading performance for various groups, including remedial readers, young children, and illiterate adults. Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs training court reporters as realtime writers has significantly decreased, leading to program closures on many campuses. This decline affects 27,000,000 illiterate adults and 30,000,000 individuals for whom English is a second language. Authorization of grant program to promote training and job placement of realtime writers. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration will provide grants to eligible court reporting programs to train individuals as realtime writers for closed captioning of video programming. Eligible entities must meet educational and financial standards and be accredited by a recognized agency. The Department of Education will provide grants to eligible entities participating in student aid programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

The Department of Education will provide grants to eligible entities for realtime writer training. Grants will be for a two-year period with a maximum amount of $1,500,000. SEC. 4. APPLICATION.

An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must use the funds for recruitment, training, job placement, scholarships, curriculum development, distance learning, and job assistance for individuals, including those with disabilities, pursuing a career in realtime writing.
