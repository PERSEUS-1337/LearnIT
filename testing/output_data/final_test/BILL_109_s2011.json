    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tire-Derived Fuel Safety Act of 2005\". It pertains to the combustion of tire-derived fuel. The \"Tire-Derived Fuel Safety Act of 2005\" defines key terms like Administrator, eligible mill, emission, and tire-derived fuel. It sets requirements for approval by the Administrator for mills burning tire-derived fuel. The Administrator cannot issue a permit for burning tire-derived fuel at a major stationary source unless the source meets specific criteria and demonstrates compliance with required control equipment or process changes. The Administrator may approve an interim permit for burning tire-derived fuel at a major stationary source if the source meets emissions standards and demonstrates compliance with required control equipment or process changes. The Administrator will establish performance standards for fine particulates for certain pulp and paper mills, requiring the installation of specific emission reduction technologies and continuous emissions monitoring to ensure compliance. The Administrator will establish performance standards for fine particulates for pulp and paper mills, requiring reductions in emissions levels and specific technologies for compliance. The Administrator will establish performance standards for fine particulates for pulp and paper mills, requiring compliance within 18 months. Additionally, a study on the health effects of increased emissions from tire-derived fuel and a report on health effects on certain children will be conducted and submitted to Congress. The report to Congress will detail birth defects and childhood diseases, especially respiratory and immune system diseases, in children living near pulp and paper mills burning tire-derived fuel within a 20-mile radius."
