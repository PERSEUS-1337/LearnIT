Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish the National Clean Water Trust Fund in the Treasury, funded by fines and penalties from enforcement actions. The National Clean Water Trust Fund in the Treasury is established under Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, funded by fines and penalties from enforcement actions. The Fund is subject to investment by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, with excess amounts used for remedial projects. The National Clean Water Trust Fund, established under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, is funded by fines and penalties from enforcement actions. Amounts in the Fund are available for projects to restore waters of the United States from damage resulting from violations of the Act or discharge of pollutants, including soil and water conservation, wetland restoration, and other similar projects determined by the Administrator. The National Clean Water Trust Fund provides funding for projects in watersheds affected by violations of the Act. Priority is given to projects in watersheds where enforcement actions have resulted in fines being paid. The Administrator consults with states when selecting projects and considers the total amount deposited in the Treasury from enforcement actions for allocating funds to restore and recover damaged waters of the United States. The Administrator may implement projects directly or through grants to other entities. A report on implementation must be submitted to Congress every two years. SEC. 3. USE OF CIVIL PENALTIES FOR MITIGATION PROJECTS. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow courts to order civil penalties to be used for projects that enhance public health or the environment."
