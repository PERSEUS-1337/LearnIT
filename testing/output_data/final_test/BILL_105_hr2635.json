    "content": "The \"Human Rights Information Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The \"Human Rights Information Act\" states that US agencies have information on human rights violations in Guatemala and Honduras. Congress has requested information on these cases. The Guatemalan peace accords include the establishment of the Clarification Commission to investigate human rights violations in Guatemala. The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights in Honduras has been requesting US Government documentation on human rights violations since 1993. Victims and survivors, including US citizens, have also been requesting this information to know what happened. The United States should release information on human rights abuses in Central America to the public, as requested by human rights organizations, members of Congress, and the National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights in Honduras since 1993. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"human rights record\" refers to information on gross human rights violations post-1944 held by US agencies. The term \"agency\" includes various US government entities involved in foreign policy and intelligence. The Act governs declassification and disclosure of human rights records by agencies. Agencies must identify and review records on activities in Guatemala and Honduras post-1944 for public disclosure. The President must report to Congress on agency compliance. Grounds for postponement of public disclosure are outlined in Section 5. An agency can delay public disclosure of a human rights record if it poses a serious threat to national security, outweighing the public interest. This includes protecting intelligence agents, sources, and methods crucial to US operations. The public disclosure of a human rights record can be delayed if it would interfere with intelligence activities, military defense, or foreign relations, and if it could harm individuals who provided confidential information to the United States. The postponement of disclosing a human rights record may be justified if it would invade personal privacy or compromise confidentiality agreements with foreign governments or individuals. Additionally, the relationship between an individual and the US Government as an intelligence asset does not automatically warrant postponement of disclosure. The term \"intelligence asset\" refers to a covert agent as defined in the National Security Act of 1947. The United States agencies must disclose human rights records upon request from international entities or officials investigating human rights violations in Latin American or Caribbean countries. Declassification and public disclosure must follow set standards and procedures outlined in the Act. The Appeals Panel, established under Executive Order No. 12958, reviews agency determinations to postpone public disclosure of human rights records. The Panel directs disclosure unless there is clear evidence that the record is not a human rights record or qualifies for postponement under section 5. The Appeals Panel, established under Executive Order No. 12958, reviews agency decisions to postpone disclosure of human rights records. The Panel determines alternative forms of disclosure, including disclosing a segregable portion, a substitute record, or a summary of the information. The Appeals Panel, established under Executive Order No. 12958, reviews agency decisions on human rights record disclosure. Upon completion of its review, the Panel notifies the agency head and publishes its determination in the Federal Register within 14 days. It also notifies the President with a written justification for its determination. The Panel publishes guidelines on its policy and procedures in the Federal Register. The President has the authority to review Appeals Panel determinations on human rights record disclosure based on set standards within 30 days. The President must provide a written certification of the decision within that timeframe, including reasons for any postponement of disclosure. Upon receipt of the President's determination, the Appeals Panel will publish in the Federal Register any unclassified written certification, statement, and materials related to the postponement of disclosure of a human rights record. The Information Security Policy Advisory Council will report to Congress on declassifying human rights records in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Act does not limit the right to file requests or seek judicial review. Judicial review is allowed for final actions under the Act. Positions will be created as needed. SEC. 10. CREATION OF POSITIONS. 2 additional positions in the Appeals Panel will be filled by the President based on recommendations from various organizations."
