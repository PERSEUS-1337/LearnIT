    "content": "The United States maintains around 285 diplomatic facilities globally, with a history of attacks on these facilities and personnel. Notable incidents include the 2012 Benghazi attack where Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others were killed. Since 1977, 66 American diplomatic personnel have been killed by terrorists. Recent attacks on U.S. embassies have highlighted the challenges faced by diplomats in balancing security concerns with their mission outreach. The security of U.S. diplomatic facilities is a concern due to host nations sometimes failing to provide adequate security. U.S. facilities use a layered security approach, including armed Diplomatic Security agents and local security guards. Some question the deployment of personnel in high-threat environments. The Department of State has increased its capacity for security in high-risk areas like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. However, this focus may have strained its ability to provide security in other hardship posts. Funding for embassy security tends to fluctuate in response to major attacks, leading to challenges in resource allocation. The State Department received an influx of security-related resources in the 1980s after bombings in Beirut, followed by reduced funding in the 1990s. The Accountability Review Board highlighted the impact of decreased spending on embassy security. The report discusses authorities, regulations, and funding trends for embassy security. The curr_chunk discusses the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, outlining obligations for protecting diplomatic facilities. It emphasizes the inviolability of consular premises and the duty of the receiving State to prevent intrusion or damage. Article 40 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and Article 29 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations emphasize the inviolability of consular officers and diplomatic agents, stating that they should be treated with respect and protected from any attack on their person, freedom, or dignity. The premises of diplomatic missions are also protected under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, with Article 22 stating that they are inviolable and cannot be entered without consent. The receiving State must protect the premises of the mission and its property from intrusion or damage. The premises, furnishings, and means of transport of the mission are immune from search or requisition. The Secretary of State is responsible for the security of U.S. government employees and facilities overseas. The Secretary of State is responsible for the security of U.S. government employees and facilities overseas, including establishing policies and programs for diplomatic security. The Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security oversees tasks such as post security, emergency planning, local guard services, and counterterrorism planning abroad. The Diplomatic Security (DS) is responsible for developing and implementing security policies and programs to protect U.S. government personnel and facilities abroad. This includes coordinating counterterrorism planning, emergency action planning, threat analysis programs, and liaison with other federal agencies. The DS provides protection to personnel, information, and facilities at embassies, consulates, and domestic Department of State locations. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security, part of the Department of State, operates security programs at diplomatic missions worldwide. It has over 34,000 employees, with 90% being contractors. With around 2,000 special agents, nearly 800 are posted in regional security offices at over 250 posts globally. The workforce of DS more than doubled between 2000 and 2012. Special agents serving abroad are known as regional security officers (RSOs) and are responsible for managing security programs and emergency plans. Regional Security Officers (RSOs) are responsible for managing security programs, emergency contingency plans, and providing the first line of defense for U.S. personnel, facilities, and sensitive information. They work closely with various groups including Marine Security Guards, surveillance detection teams, and host government officials. Additionally, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security provides Mobile Security Teams for high-threat posts, offering training in protective tactics and emergency security support. Specially trained agents lead contractor-provided personal protection teams and guard services. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security provides specially trained agents to lead contractor-provided personal protection teams and guard services in conflict areas where host nations cannot provide adequate security. U.S. military assistance, such as combat-equipped Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Teams, can be provided in extreme situations. DS receives over 1,000 threats annually against U.S. interests overseas, with security postures varying based on local conditions. Regular security reviews are conducted, including physical security inspections every three years and before property acquisitions. All posts are required to review their security posture. In preparation for the 9/11/12 anniversary and following the Benghazi attack, diplomatic posts were ordered to review and enhance their security posture based on the Security Environment Threat List. This list addresses potential acts of international terrorism against U.S. diplomatic facilities and includes factors like the local security environment and host government support. The plan is required to be reviewed and updated regularly. The Security Environment Threat List (SETL) is used to assign threat levels to diplomatic posts based on factors like terrorism, political violence, and crime. Threat levels are categorized as Critical, High, Medium, or Low, dictating protective measures. Over 50% of posts were rated \"critical\" or \"high\" for terrorism in February 2012. The Department of State was reviewing threat ratings before the Benghazi attack. The State Department is reviewing threat ratings to better assess the balance between threat and vulnerability at diplomatic facilities overseas. Diplomatic Security (DS) is expanding security support to locations not originally accounted for in security standards, leading to the development of guidelines for recognizing critical diplomatic facilities in non-traditional settings. This may require innovative security solutions or waivers of existing standards. Diplomatic facilities typically rely on a combination of host nation-provided guard forces, physical perimeter security, and State Department measures. The State Department relies on a combination of host nation-provided guard forces, physical perimeter security, and State Department agents for security at diplomatic facilities. U.S. Marine Security Guards are posted at many facilities worldwide to prevent the compromise of classified information and equipment, with a secondary role of protecting U.S. citizens during crises. Marine Guard detachments were requested after the Benghazi attacks, but not all facilities have Marine Corps guards. After the Benghazi attack, the Department of State and Marine Corps renegotiated the memorandum of agreement, emphasizing the protection of personnel as a primary mission for Marine Corps Security Guards. Observers note that while State Department planners consider various physical threats, sustained mob violence poses a significant challenge for embassy security. Congressional scrutiny following the 1998 embassy bombings revealed that 80% of overseas facilities did not meet security standards. Following the 1998 embassy bombings, it was found that 80% of overseas facilities did not meet security standards. In response, the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 provided five years of funding at $900 million annually for security upgrades, including improved doors and windows, computer security enhancements, secure vehicles, and more. The Secretary of State was required to submit a prioritized list each year identifying diplomatic facilities in need of replacement or major security enhancements. The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 provided funding for security upgrades at overseas facilities, including requirements for emergency action plans and new facility construction standards. The State Department elevated the Office of Foreign Buildings Operations to the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations in response to the heightened security priority. The Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) oversees worldwide building programs for federal employees under the Chief of Mission. OBO, in collaboration with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, determines security priorities for U.S. diplomatic facilities globally. To expedite a $21 billion construction program post-1998 embassy bombings, the State Department introduced the Standard Embassy Design (SED) for new chanceries and consulates, featuring pre-engineered designs for small, medium, and large facilities with high fences and setbacks. The State Department introduced the Standard Embassy Design (SED) for new chanceries and consulates to expedite construction post-1998 embassy bombings. The SED provided plans for various buildings on the site, aiming to reduce costs and enhance quality. Critics argued that the highly secure facilities created an unwelcoming image of the United States and pushed facilities away from urban centers, making it difficult for diplomats to work and engage with local officials and publics. The State Department introduced the Standard Embassy Design (SED) to expedite construction post-1998 embassy bombings. Critics argued that the SED facilities constrained U.S. diplomatic activity and failed to uphold their representational role. In 2010, OBO introduced the Design Excellence initiative to improve the quality and civic value of diplomatic buildings, prioritizing security while moving away from uniformity. The Excellence program prioritizes security but emphasizes site-specific architectural features and environmental considerations. Designs for embassies and consulates in urban areas aim to blend with the local culture, using contextually appropriate materials. The new embassy compound in Mexico City is the first project under this approach, set for completion in 2019. The impact of the Benghazi attacks on the Design Excellence concept has been debated. The panel led by Grant Green criticized the Design Excellence approach for lacking security considerations and recommended a detailed review. Concerns included the absence of a business case, longer construction times leaving personnel vulnerable, and increased scrutiny by diplomatic security officials. The new approach to embassy design, known as Design Excellence, is facing criticism for potentially compromising security measures. Concerns have been raised about the increased scrutiny required by diplomatic security officials, potential challenges for transferring officials, and heightened security risks at smaller urban sites. Retired official William Miner has publicly opposed the initiative, warning that the focus on aesthetics may overshadow security and safety concerns. He specifically criticized the use of a non-standard glass curtain wall facade at the new U.S. embassy in London. Since 2000, the State Department's efforts have delivered 111 new diplomatic facilities, improving safety for over 30,300 U.S. government employees. However, there are concerns about sub-standard facilities at 110 posts that need to be replaced with more secure buildings. Measures are in place to protect U.S. personnel and citizens in deteriorating security environments or after major incidents. The State Department may recommend closure of a post for Americans in a foreign country depending on local conditions. An \"Authorized Departure\" allows non-essential staff and families to leave voluntarily, while an \"Ordered Departure\" is initiated in extraordinary circumstances when security is compromised. The State Department mandates the departure of non-emergency mission staff and employees in cases of compromised security. Departure assistance may be provided in exceptional cases, with a preference for commercial transportation options. Military involvement in evacuations is a last resort, with most evacuations utilizing commercial means and local infrastructure. The cost of evacuation assistance is required to be reimbursed by U.S. citizens, with emergency financial aid available for destitute evacuees. The Benghazi attack raised concerns about the risks faced by diplomatic posts in high-threat locations. Decision-making on embassy status is made by the President, while consulates are determined by the State Department's Under Secretary for Management. After the Benghazi attack, the State Department revised procedures for opening Critical Threat or High Risk High Threat Posts. The new regulations require multi-bureau planning cells to address security concerns before opening, and ensure proper resources once open. The Accountability Review Board process was recommended in 1985 to establish accountability in cases of terrorism or security-related attacks. The Accountability Review Board process was recommended in 1985 to establish accountability in cases of terrorism or security-related attacks, as codified by the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. It requires the Secretary of State to convene a Board after any security-related incident resulting in significant damage or casualties to US personnel or property. Exceptions are made for incidents not related to security or in certain locations. The Accountability Review Board process was established in 1985 to ensure accountability for security-related incidents. The Boards aim to review incidents, determine accountability, and improve security programs. Since 1986, nineteen Boards have been convened, including for the 1998 embassy bombings and the deaths of Defense Department personnel in Pakistan in 2010. Despite numerous attacks, only a few incidents have been subject to an ARB. The process requires a Board to be convened within 60 days of an incident. The Accountability Review Board process was established in 1985 to ensure accountability for security-related incidents. A Board must be convened within 60 days of an incident, with the Secretary of State publishing a decision specifying its membership, duration, purposes, and jurisdiction. The Secretary must inform the Senate and House of Representatives promptly once the Board is formed. The written findings of an ARB must include the extent to which the incident was security related. The Accountability Review Board process was established in 1985 to ensure accountability for security-related incidents. A Board must be convened within 60 days of an incident, with the Secretary of State publishing a decision specifying its membership, duration, purposes, and jurisdiction. The written findings of an ARB must include the extent to which the incident was security related. The recommendations of previous Boards have not been made public, other than the unclassified version of the Crowe ARB empanelled to study the 1998 Embassy attacks. The ARBs do not report directly to Congress, but executive branch officials are required to report the recommendations to improve security and efficiency to Congress. The Accountability Review Board process was established in 1985 to ensure accountability for security-related incidents. A Board must be convened within 60 days of an incident, with the Secretary of State publishing a decision specifying its membership, duration, purposes, and jurisdiction. Recommendations from the Board must be reported to Congress within 90 days. In case of a breach of duty by U.S. personnel, the federal agency must report to Congress within 30 days with details of the case and actions taken. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. personnel were killed in an attack in Benghazi, Libya. The attack on the U.S. Special Mission Compound in Benghazi, Libya in 2012 led to the destruction and abandonment of the facilities. Congressional inquiries have focused on the adequacy of resources provided for security in the increasingly threatening environment. A DS team was deployed to Benghazi in 2011 to establish a diplomatic presence after the closure of the Embassy in Tripoli due to security concerns. The DS team in Benghazi established a temporary location before moving personnel to a more secure villa compound, significantly enhancing security. Physical security upgrades funded and installed in 2012 included perimeter wall heightening, safety grills, barriers, steel gates, security cameras, lighting, and guard booths. The Benghazi facilities had fortifications, security cameras, guard booths, and an Internal Defense Notification System. However, the ARB found that certain security equipment was lacking. On the night of the attack, the compound was protected by unarmed local guards, a local militia, and armed DS agents. The security posture included locally hired unarmed guards from a British private security firm. The State Department facilities in Benghazi were protected by armed security contractors in high-threat locations, but Libyan political sensitivities prevented the use of armed private security guards. Instead, three members of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, a local militia, were present at the facilities on the night of the attack. They were trained by U.S. officials and paid $28 per day. The U.S. facilities in Benghazi had security personnel present during the attack, including five armed Diplomatic Security agents and a well-trained U.S. quick reaction security team stationed at an annex two kilometers away. The annex was reportedly a classified CIA installation with a security force of approximately 10 individuals who had previously shielded Ambassador Stevens. Members of this force responded directly to the September 11 attack. The Accountability Review Board, chaired by Thomas Pickering, was convened by Secretary of State Clinton to investigate the Benghazi attack. The Board's findings were published on December 18, focusing on the adequacy of security systems and procedures in Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board, chaired by Thomas Pickering, concluded that systemic failures in Washington, DC, led to security shortfalls at the Special Mission in Benghazi. Leadership failures in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs contributed to confusion over decision-making, resulting in insufficient priority given to security requests. Senior leadership decisions also left the Benghazi mission outside normal procedures for funding and executing security measures. The Accountability Review Board found systemic failures in Washington, DC led to security shortfalls at the Special Mission in Benghazi. The Board stated the compound was never formally notified to the Libyan government, leading to weak security. No breach of duty by any U.S. government employee was found, and security systems were implemented properly. U.S. intelligence did not provide specific warning of the attack, which was unanticipated in scale and intensity. There was no protest prior to the attack, and an inadequate number of Diplomatic Security staff were present in Benghazi on the day of the attack. The Accountability Review Board found systemic failures in Washington, DC led to security shortfalls at the Special Mission in Benghazi. The Libyan government response was deemed lacking, with concerns raised about the \"loyalties\" of the militia providing security. The report recommends Congress provide necessary resources to address security risks and meet mission imperatives, listing recommendations in six categories. The Accountability Review Board's key recommendations include reviewing the balance between risk and security for personnel in high-threat posts, reorganizing the DS Bureau for better security control, establishing minimum security standards for temporary facilities in high-risk environments, and collocating U.S. government agencies in such environments. The curr_chunk discusses various security measures such as restoring the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program, using Overseas Contingency Operation funds for security threats, expanding the Marine Security Guard Program, endorsing increased DS personnel for high-risk posts, providing equipment like fire safety and surveillance cameras, and enhancing training on crisis response. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of equipment such as fire safety and surveillance cameras, exploration of non-lethal deterrents, better identification of threat situations, and revising regulations for disciplinary action. The State Department's Office of the Inspector General issued a review on the Accountability Review Board process, highlighting the need for a single institutional nexus for assessing risks at high-threat posts. The report emphasizes the importance of implementing recommendations from the Benghazi ARB to enhance security measures at high-threat posts. The Secretary of State is responsible for protecting U.S. government employees and facilities overseas. The Benghazi attack prompted the department to review and improve security measures at all posts. The State Department ordered posts to review and enhance security posture. Interagency Security Assessment Teams were deployed to high-threat posts. A new Deputy Assistant Secretary for High Threat Posts was established. An accountability review board was convened to investigate the Benghazi attack. More information is available in CRS Report R43195. The State Department is actively involved in embassy security initiatives, with Congress appropriating funds for this purpose. The authorization to use funds for embassy security comes from the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 and subsequent legislation like the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2003. The State Department allocates funds for embassy security from appropriations for \"Worldwide Security Upgrades\" in the Department of State budget. The funding is distributed among five subaccounts, including Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and Diplomatic Security (DS). The Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) program within the Department of State provides security for overseas personnel and facilities. It includes a guard force for diplomatic missions and residences, as well as funding for security upgrades. Salaries and costs from various bureaus have been requested under WSP for the first time in FY2015 as part of a Security Realignment Initiative. The Capital Security Cost Sharing program combines funds from various agencies for embassy compound planning, design, and security activities. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security focuses on law enforcement, threat analysis, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism. The Bureau of Counterterrorism leads in counterterrorism diplomacy and response to terrorist incidents. The Diplomatic Security subaccount in the Border Security Program guards domestic consular facilities and investigates security issues related to visas and passports. The Diplomatic Security subaccount in the Border Security Program coordinates and investigates security issues related to U.S. visas and passports. Table 1 shows base funding available to overseas facilities and total security funding requested and enacted from FY2008 to FY2015, including supplemental and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for embassy security primarily in Iraq. Supplemental and OCO funds were temporary measures for war-related security in Iraq, while base funding covers diplomatic security activities worldwide. The FY2013 request for total security funding was $4.96 billion, with over half designated as OCO funding. FY2014 saw the peak year for State Department base security requests at $3.71 billion. Congress provided less than requested for total security funding every year except FY2009. Total security funding as a percentage of Administration of Foreign Affairs expenditures was highest in FY2014 at 40%. The Benghazi Accountability Review Board report in 2012 emphasized the need for Congress to provide necessary resources to the State Department for security risks and mission imperatives. It recommended restoring the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program to $2.2 billion in 2015 and making OCO funds available for security at high-risk posts. State work with Congress to make OCO funds available for security at high-risk posts and seek greater flexibility for OBO to use funds for security threats at temporary facilities in high-threat environments. Proposed funding increases for securing American personnel and embassies may face calls for offsetting cuts or co-locating overseas facilities. The Department of State plans to co-locate the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See within the U.S. Embassy to Italy compound in Rome to address security concerns and reduce leasing costs. The Department of State plans to relocate the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See within the U.S. Embassy to Italy compound in Rome for security reasons and cost savings. The move is expected to save $1.4 million annually and must remain independent from other U.S. missions in Rome. Concerns about diplomatic security funding under the Budget Control Act of 2011 are ongoing. The funding debate surrounding embassy security is complex due to uncertainties in funding timing and the challenge of meeting future security needs. The unpredictability of Congress passing funding bills and the responsibility of maintaining facilities in unstable democracies add to the difficulty. The U.S. government must consider security risks and costs when local governments lack the capability to ensure embassy security in unstable environments."
