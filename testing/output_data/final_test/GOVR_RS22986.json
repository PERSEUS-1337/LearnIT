    "content": "The law of water rights in Western states like Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming follows the prior appropriation doctrine, where water users acquire rights based on \"first in time, first in right.\" This system allows users to have defined water rights during times of scarcity, regardless of their location relative to the watercourse. In the prior appropriation system of water rights, users obtain permits from a state agency based on \"first in time, first in right.\" Senior water rights holders have priority over junior rights holders, leading to potential shortages for the latter during times of scarcity in the Colorado River Basin. The Colorado River Basin faces water disputes due to limited supply sought by various users. Junior rights holders, mainly for agriculture and municipal use, may be restricted by senior rights holders like oil companies. Questions arise about water rights administration, potential shortages, and options for claiming unused water rights. Water rights are typically obtained through a state permit system. Water rights seekers must file an application with the state administrative organization to establish the seniority of the water right. State law considers water as state property, but a water right is an individual's property right in the use of the state's water. Water rights can be absolute or conditional, depending on the state. Absolute rights are granted to users who have diverted water for beneficial use, while conditional rights allow users to maintain priority until the diversion is complete. In Utah, water rights become real property only when the application is perfected and filed with the state. Wyoming issues permits for water rights, which are not permanent until the process is complete. Oil companies in Colorado hold both absolute and conditional water rights in the Colorado River Basin, which could impact future water use and lead to challenges from junior rights holders. In some states like Colorado, senior water rights holders may seek to convert their conditional rights to absolute rights. Water rights can be altered based on changes in water use circumstances, including changing the point of diversion or purpose of use. Approval from the state office is required for any changes, considering factors like historical water levels and impacts on other users' rights. In Colorado, water rights can be transferred through the water rights transfer process, ensuring no harm to other users' rights. Utah and Wyoming also allow for the buying and selling of water rights with state approval. Senior rights holders risk losing their rights if not utilized, and conditional rights in Colorado require active use. In Colorado, water rights must be actively used to avoid loss. Rights can be considered abandoned after 10 years of non-use with intent to abandon. Utah allows for abandonment or forfeiture of water rights, with no time requirement for abandonment and a five-year period for forfeiture. Wyoming allows for voluntary abandonment, allegations of abandonment, or non-use for three years. State water laws govern the allocation of water within the state, but water resources often extend beyond state boundaries, leading to interstate water disputes. These disputes can be resolved through equitable apportionment in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Colorado River Basin is governed by the \"Law of the River,\" which includes a collection of laws and agreements to allocate water among seven states with varying needs. This system addresses disputes through court decisions, statutes, interstate compacts, and international treaties. The Law of the River governs the allocation of water in the Colorado River Basin among states, setting limits on water available for each state. Oil shale development is a controversial issue, with proposed regulations in 2008 to promote development. The 111th Congress may consider future direction for oil shale development. The 111th Congress may consider regulations or legislation for future agency actions regarding oil shale development."
