    "content": "U.S. interest in Oman is driven by its strategic location at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, its history of cooperation with the United States, and its support for the U.S. war on terrorism. Oman, a small oil and gas exporter, is not a member of OPEC and is looking to diversify its trade regime due to the potential exhaustion of its oil reserves in the next few decades. Oman is seeking to diversify its trade regime beyond oil and gas exports, aiming to broaden economic opportunities for its workforce. The United States is viewed as a key ally in this endeavor to address economic and social challenges. U.S.-Oman trade totaled $1 billion in 2005, accounting for 0.04% of all U.S. trade. Oman ranks 11th among the 20 MEFTA entities in trade with the U.S. and the U.S. ranks fourth in importance among Oman's trading partners. In 2005, the United States had a small trade surplus with Oman, with U.S. imports consisting mainly of oil, natural gas, and apparel, while U.S. exports included transport equipment, road vehicles, and machinery. Total U.S. foreign direct investment in Oman nearly doubled from $193 million in 2002 to $358 million in 2003. The largest investor in Oman is Royal Dutch Shell Oil, holding 34% of Petroleum Development and 30% of Oman Liquid Natural Gas. U.S. firms like Gorman Rupp and FMC have joint ventures with Omani companies, and Dow Chemical has a joint venture with Oman Oil Company to develop a petrochemical plant in Sohar. Total investment in listed Omani companies with foreign participation was $2.4 billion in September 2004, with $215 million being foreign investment. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed in September 2004, with $215 million in foreign investment. Foreign capital made up a small percentage of investments in finance, manufacturing, and insurances/services. The agreement includes new tariff schedules, market opening commitments, and protections for labor and the environment. The economic impact on the U.S. is expected to be positive but minimal due to low trade volume with Oman. Apparel workers may be negatively affected as imports from Oman decreased by 57% in 2005. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed in September 2004 with $215 million in foreign investment. The agreement includes new tariff schedules, market opening commitments, and protections for labor and the environment. Imports from Oman decreased by 57% in 2005 due to the expiration of the WTO Agreement on Clothing and Textiles. The U.S.-Oman FTA aims to restore competitiveness in Oman's apparel exports to the U.S. and provide duty-free access for various goods. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement provides immediate duty-free access for 100% of Oman's current exports of agricultural products to the United States. Tariffs on remaining eligible goods will be phased out within 10 years. Textile and apparel products are divided into three categories, with duties being eliminated immediately for category A products, reduced over five years for category B products, and reduced over 10 years for category C products. Most apparel must be assembled in an FTA party from inputs made in an FTA party. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement includes commitments to open markets in various sectors, protections for investors and intellectual property rights, enforcement measures for infringement, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement disciplines, customs procedures, anti-bribery commitments, and tools for enforcement. Oman provides market access across its entire services regime. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement enhances Oman's commitment to the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services by providing market access across various sectors including audiovisual, telecommunications, and healthcare. U.S. financial service suppliers have the right to establish subsidiaries in Oman and offer a full range of financial services. All forms of investment are protected under the agreement. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement protects all forms of investment, including enterprises, debt concessions, contracts, and intellectual property. U.S. investors have the right to establish, acquire, and operate investments in Oman on an equal footing with Omani and other countries' investors. U.S. phone companies can interconnect with a dominant carrier in Oman at nondiscriminatory rates, and firms can access key facilities for building physical networks. Both governments commit to nondiscriminatory treatment of digital products and no customs duties on electronically transmitted products. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement protects intellectual property rights, including copyrighted works and patents. Patent terms can be adjusted for delays, trademarks follow \"first-in-time, first-in-right\" principle, and governments must establish transparent trademark registration procedures. The FTA mandates criminalizing end-user piracy to deter piracy and counterfeiting. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement includes provisions for intellectual property rights protection, sanctions for IPR violations, nondiscriminatory bidding rights for U.S. suppliers, transparency in customs administration, and publication of trade laws and regulations for public comment. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement requires both governments to ensure fair review of administrative decisions, prohibit bribery, enforce labor laws, and establish penalties for violations. Dispute settlement provisions apply to all core obligations, including labor and environmental provisions. Maximum penalty for violations is $15 million per violation per year. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement sets a maximum penalty of $15 million per violation per year. If a party fails to pay, the other party can suspend tariff benefits. Both countries agree not to weaken labor laws to attract trade and investment, reaffirming their obligations to uphold ILO core labor standards. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement establishes penalties for violating environmental laws and prohibits weakening or reducing environmental regulations to attract trade. Each country must enforce its own environmental laws, with a maximum fine of $15 million per violation per year. Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Cooperation is signed to promote joint environmental projects and initiatives. Support for the agreement is strong in the business community. Support for the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement is broad in the business community, led by various organizations and trade advisory committees. Congressional support on the House side is driven by the Congressional Middle East Economic Partnership Caucus. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement has broad support from lawmakers and business community. The agreement aims to boost economic growth, trade, and job creation, while providing market access and legal framework for U.S. investors in Oman. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement aims to provide a secure legal framework for U.S. investors in Oman, enforce labor and environmental laws, and protect intellectual property. It is seen as a way to support market liberalization, economic growth, and democracy in the Middle East. The agreement is expected to strengthen U.S. relations in the region and pave the way for additional agreements. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement aims to provide a secure legal framework for U.S. investors in Oman, enforce labor and environmental laws, and protect intellectual property. Economic Freedom of the World, 2005, ranks Oman 17th out of 127 countries in terms of economic freedom. Oman passed a new labor law in 2003 extending protections to foreign workers in the private sector. Chuck Ditrich, National Foreign Trade Council vice president, urges patience in strengthening Omani labor laws, noting the country's traditional society transitioning to modernization. Oman recognizes the need for more explicit provisions for collective bargaining and has consulted with the ILO for assistance in complying with labor standards. Some trade advisory committees have criticized the U.S.-Oman FTA, particularly in the areas of environment, intergovernmental affairs, and labor. The Policy and Environment Committee found the U.S.-Oman FTA lacking in environmental provisions present in other agreements. The Intergovernmental Advisory Policy Committee supported trade liberalization but emphasized the importance of respecting state and local government authority. Labor groups criticized the agreement, expressing concerns for potential worker losses. Labor critics argue that the U.S.-Oman FTA fails to adequately protect workers in Oman and does little to level the playing field for U.S. workers. They point out weaknesses in the agreement and in Omani laws and enforcement that are not adequately addressed. Critics believe the FTA does not meet the requirements set out in the Trade Act of 2002 and is a step backward in terms of protections for Oman. The U.S.-Oman FTA is criticized for being a step backward in labor protections compared to the Generalized System of Preferences. Critics argue that only one out of three labor commitments is enforceable through dispute resolution, unlike the U.S.-Jordan FTA which enforces all commitments. Unequal treatment exists between labor and non-labor violations in terms of dispute resolution procedures. The U.S.-Oman FTA is criticized for its lack of enforceable labor protections, with only one labor violation subject to a $15 million cap per year under dispute resolution. Non-labor violations have no monetary cap. The AFL-CIO views the FTA as a regression from the Generalized System of Preferences program, which ties trade preferences to worker rights. In 2005, the AFL-CIO petitioned to remove Oman from GSP status due to inadequate worker rights. Critics argue that Oman lacks protections in certain areas, as it has only ratified conventions related to child labor and forced labor, but not those related to the right to organize, bargain collectively, and eliminate employment discrimination. Omani labor laws do not fully cover aspects of core labor standards, particularly the right to organize and bargain collectively. While workers can form representation committees, they are not allowed to discuss wages, hours, or conditions of employment. Only a small percentage of employees in the private sector are represented by these committees. The Omani labor law does not fully cover core labor standards like the right to strike and collective bargaining. The law prohibits forced labor, including that of children, and applies to both Omani women, foreign workers, and men. The 2003 labor law removed a prohibition on strikes and outlines dispute resolution procedures. Despite rare labor unrest, there were four reported strikes in 2005, with one closing the largest seaport for two days. Foreign workers, who make up a significant portion of the workforce, are also protected under the law. Foreign workers in Oman, comprising 80% of the private sector workforce, were sometimes subjected to forced labor. Employers withheld documents needed to change jobs, leading to potential deportation. Many workers were unaware of their rights to dispute resolution through the Labor Welfare Board, which could release them from contracts, provide compensation, and penalize guilty employers. Before the U.S.-Oman FTA and implementing legislation were submitted to Congress, preliminary hearings were held by House and Senate committees. The House approved the bill without amendment on a party-line vote, while the Senate adopted an amendment before passing the bill unanimously. The amendment addressed concerns about sweatshop conditions in Jordan. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) implementing legislation was approved by the Senate and House, with the bill signed into law as P.L. 109-283 on September 26, 2006. This followed concerns about sweatshop conditions in Jordan. A report by the National Labor Committee raised concerns about sweatshop conditions in Jordan's factories producing for export to the United States. The report documented involuntary servitude of foreign guest workers in clothing factories. The Senate Finance Committee responded to concerns about sweatshop conditions and involuntary servitude in clothing factories by unanimously adopting an amendment to prohibit products made in Oman with slave labor or human trafficking from benefiting from the U.S.-Oman FTA agreement. Committee Republicans and Democrats supported the amendment, which was passed during the mock markup process. The Senate Finance Committee unanimously adopted an amendment to prohibit products made in Oman with slave labor or human trafficking from benefiting from the U.S.-Oman FTA agreement. The Administration had concerns about the amendment, citing existing laws that already address forced labor issues. Senator Conrad argued that these laws may not apply to apparel produced under slave labor conditions in Oman. The Administration argued that the amendment to prohibit products made in Oman with slave labor may be unnecessary due to existing laws addressing forced labor issues. Oman has committed to enforcing its own labor laws prohibiting forced labor, as stated by the Omani Minister of Labor in an exchange of letters with House Democrats and the USTR. The Omani Minister made commitments in March and May regarding forced labor and child labor, promising to strengthen labor laws by October 31, 2006. On July 8, 2006, a Royal Decree was issued amending Omani labor law to align with ILO core labor standards, allowing for union formation and collective bargaining. The Royal Decree in Oman amended labor laws to align with ILO standards, allowing union formation and collective bargaining. Penalties are in place for those who interfere with union activities. Jordan's trade minister disputed a report on sweatshops, stating some were not in Jordan and others had been closed. Inspections are being conducted in the garment trade with international cooperation. The U.S. interagency committee approved the acquisition of contracts by Dubai Ports World from a British firm managing port facilities in various U.S. cities. Congress raised concerns about port security, leading to a 45-day review of operations. The House Appropriations Committee voted on a provision in the FY2006 supplemental funding bill for Iraq and Afghanistan war operations. The FY2006 supplemental funding bill included a provision that would have prevented DP World from operating in the U.S. DP World officials decided to divest U.S. port operations to an American owner. The Oman FTA provision regarding port activities drew attention, with debates on its implications for U.S. policy. The provision in Annex II of the U.S.-Oman FTA addresses transportation activities and outlines categories for U.S. measures. The United States reserves the right to adopt or maintain measures for certain activities related to investment, ownership, and operation of drill rigs, vessels, and fishing vessels. Excluded activities do not allow the U.S. to adopt or maintain measures, including vessel documentation, promotional programs, licensing, and citizenship requirements. The United States waives its right to adopt or maintain measures for vessel construction and repair unconditionally. For landside port activities, the US waives its rights on the condition of obtaining comparable market access from Oman. This includes various operations such as marine cargo handling, ship cleaning, stevedoring, and maritime surveyors. Some in Congress argue that certain activities, such as marine wrecking for scrap, should not be excluded from the U.S. government's right to adopt measures in the U.S.-Oman FTA due to potential security risks. Others believe this provision is necessary to ensure equal treatment of service suppliers and investors. The provision in the U.S.-Oman FTA allows Omani companies to contract with port owners for port activities in the United States. This provision is already included in other trade agreements. The U.S. Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection maintain security at U.S. ports, and the agreement does not affect their authority. Oman provides market access to U.S. service suppliers and investors, but there are no Omani companies currently involved in U.S. port activities. The USTR is not aware of any Omani companies currently involved in U.S. port operations or interested in future operations. The U.S.-Oman FTA allows Omani companies to contract with port owners in the U.S. If an Omani company shows interest in the future, the \"essential security\" exception could protect U.S. national security. The FTA allows the U.S. to deny benefits to an Omani enterprise with no substantial business activities in Oman seeking to invest in the U.S. It could also deny benefits if the enterprise's owners are nationals of countries under U.S. sanctions. The U.S.-Oman FTA includes an \"essential security\" exception that allows the U.S. government to block investments for national security reasons. This exception has been a part of all U.S. trade agreements since 1947. The United States interprets agreements like the U.S.-Oman FTA to allow for self-judging national security measures, preventing third-party dispute settlement. International tribunals are unlikely to review national security claims, and U.S. law authorizes the President to block foreign investments for security reasons. The Defense Production Act of 1950 amendment authorizes the President to block foreign investments threatening national security. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) monitors investments for security threats. Legal challenges by Oman could be difficult due to the broad national security exception. The national security exception in the U.S.-Oman FTA raises concerns about foreign ownership of sensitive U.S. port infrastructure, potentially challenging laws restricting foreign ownership. This provision grants rights to foreign companies in landside port operations, subject to comparable market access in Oman. Congress has expressed national security concerns regarding these port activities. The U.S.-Oman FTA raises concerns about foreign ownership of sensitive U.S. port infrastructure, particularly in landside port operations. Critics argue that the FTA expands U.S. commitments by including \"landside operations of ports,\" which could lead to disputes that can be brought to international tribunals. The U.S.-Oman FTA raises concerns about foreign ownership of sensitive U.S. port infrastructure, particularly in landside port operations. Government-to-government dispute resolution cases are heard in trade tribunals under procedures agreed to in Article 20 of the FTA. Investor-state enforcement is enumerated in Chapter 10, allowing investors/companies to privately initiate cases against the United States. The U.S.-Oman FTA allows for investor-state enforcement through trade tribunals, where foreign companies can seek monetary damages for denied future profits due to adverse U.S. actions. Tribunalists can overrule national security claims and order the U.S. government to compensate for lost profits. The \"essential security\" exception may not excuse government actions that interfere with investor rights, even if a CFIUS review finds no security threat. The U.S.-Oman FTA allows investor-state enforcement through trade tribunals, overriding national security claims. Oman's FTA could create jobs and promote openness in the Middle East. Without the FTA, Oman could have continued trading with the U.S. If the U.S.-Oman FTA had not been approved, Oman might have sought support from countries like China, Russia, or India to diversify its economy beyond oil production. There could have been implications on military cooperation, with Oman potentially imposing restrictions on U.S. use of military facilities and reducing cooperation on counterterrorism efforts."
