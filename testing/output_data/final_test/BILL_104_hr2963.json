    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep the Government Open Act of 1996\". Congress finds that there were multiple instances of lapses in appropriations for the Federal Government between fiscal year 1962 and fiscal year 1981. Despite these lapses, Federal employees continued to work and funds were obligated, with Congress later ratifying the obligations. In 1981, the Attorney General expressed that the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits the operation of the Federal Government during a lapse in appropriations, except for emergencies involving human life or property protection. Between 1982 and 1994, the longest lapse in appropriations was 3 days. In December 1995 and January 1996, there was a 3-week lapse in appropriations due to a disagreement between the President and Congress, resulting in unpaid and furloughed Federal employees. Congress later passed a continuing resolution to pay these employees. Congress passed a continuing resolution to pay 761,000 Federal employees for the period December 16 through January 5, costing taxpayers about $1 billion. Not paying employees during a lapse in appropriations creates financial hardships for them and for private firms that rely on federal business. Prohibiting the obligation of federal funds during a lapse in appropriations also impacts state and local governments and firms that receive federal funds. Prohibiting Federal employees from working during a lapse in appropriations creates hardships for citizens needing their services. SEC. 3. AMENDMENT OF THE ANTI-DEFICIENCY ACT. (a) Authority To Enter Into Contracts or Obligations.--Section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to allow the President to determine if an appropriation is likely to be made before the end of the fiscal year in an amount exceeding the contract or obligation.\n\n(b) Work and Payment of Employees.--Section 1342 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to allow officers or employees to continue providing services and be paid if the President determines that an appropriation is likely to be made before the end of the fiscal year exceeding the cost of the services. Appropriations are made to maintain the salary of officials and employees of the United States when funds are not available. These funds are not accessible after the enactment of an appropriations Act or joint resolution for the department or agency responsible for the salary. (C) Appropriations and funds cover all expenses for salaries of US officials and employees. (D) Expenditures are charged to the appropriate fund when the related bill becomes law. (E) \"Salary\" includes benefits and allowances for officials, employees, and Armed Forces members."
