    "content": "International capital flows have surged in the last decade, exceeding $6 trillion per day. This amount surpasses the total annual U.S. exports and imports. Foreign direct investment, totaling over $20 trillion globally in 2011, plays a significant role in these flows. U.S. firms account for about 20% of this investment. Preliminary data for 2012 shows a slowdown in foreign investment flows in and out of the United States, mirroring a global trend. Multinational corporations are also involved in various non-equity activities. Corporations engage in non-equity modes of investment (NEM) such as joint ventures, outsourcing, and franchising. NEM investments generated $2 trillion in sales in 2010, benefiting developing countries by integrating them into global value chains. Foreign direct investment serves as a crucial source of funds for capital formation in developing nations. Foreign investment is crucial for capital formation in developing countries, with the United States being the largest recipient and investor globally. However, this expansion often leads to cultural clashes and conflicts over the role of global corporations in their home countries. The shift towards considering a broader group of stakeholders in corporate decision-making is challenging due to the diverse range of issues involved in defining codes of conduct. These codes can be categorized into externally generated, corporate, and industry-specific codes, but reaching a common agreement on their composition and nature remains difficult. In the 106th Congress, there was a consideration of a measure (H.R. 4596) that would have mandated U.S. firms to adopt a Corporate Code of Conduct covering workers' rights and environmental issues. The Senate also approved the Convention on Child Labor in 1999, addressing various related issues. In December 2, 1999, the Convention on Child Labor was addressed by the 106th Congress, along with measures to protect children from abusive labor practices and advance women's rights in developing countries. Representative Maloney introduced legislation in the 111th and 112th Congress to promote international protection of women's rights. Public and private expectations of multinational corporations have evolved since the 1970s. Since the 1970s, public and private expectations of multinational corporate behavior have increased. This has led to the development of codes of conduct, with some voluntary codes becoming national legislation, such as the Sullivan Principles and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the United States. The Sullivan Principles initially aimed to pressure South Africa to improve conditions for black workers and were later adopted as law in 1986. The FCPA established legal standards and penalties following congressional hearings and actions against U.S. corporations. The United States and the European Union have implemented laws and directives to regulate the financial sector and prevent bribery. The United Nations emphasizes the importance of codes of conduct for multinational corporations to influence global business practices. Attempts to reach an agreement on international standards governing corporate business practices have faced challenges, leading to competition among countries for investment projects and differences in national policies. Developed economies support international rules promoting a level playing field, while developing economies see these efforts as a way for developed countries to hoard foreign investments. One approach to promote international rules on foreign investment is through negotiating legally binding agreements, such as the Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. This convention, supported by the United States and adopted by the OECD, focuses on issues related to bribing public officials and has been in force since February 15, 1999, with 40 countries in compliance. Since its entry into force on February 15, 1999, 40 countries, including the United States, have implemented national legislation in support of the Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials. However, a similar comprehensive agreement on foreign investment, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), failed to gain agreement due to divisive provisions and opposition from citizen and consumer groups concerned about its impact. Many countries have adopted bilateral investment treaties with codes of conduct instead of multilateral agreements. By the end of 2011, 174 countries had concluded 3,164 investment treaties and 2,833 bilateral investment treaties. Regional agreements are gaining economic significance, often accompanied by specific codes of conduct for investment projects or sectors. Some nations use multilateral treaties to promote codes of conduct for multinational firms, aiming for conformity in foreign investment treatment. These agreements are part of broader economic cooperation arrangements, like those of the European Community and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Legally non-binding arrangements also cover foreign investment, such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Principles of Corporate Governance. The OECD Guidelines provide voluntary recommendations on corporate citizenship, including human rights, environment, combating bribery, and taxation. The 2011 update included new recommendations on human rights and supply chain responsibility. The OECD also issued a statement on foreign investment, while the WTO supports common rules on international corporate investment. The ILO's Tripartite is also involved in promoting international labor standards. The International Labor Organization's Tripartite Declaration of Principles and the United Nations' 10 principles of the UN Global Compact provide guidance for firms to maximize their contribution to economic and social development while minimizing negative effects. The UN Global Compact covers human rights, labor standards, environment, and anti-corruption. Businesses should uphold human rights, freedom of association, elimination of forced labor, abolition of child labor, non-discrimination in employment, environmental responsibility, promotion of environmentally friendly techniques, and anti-corruption efforts. The WTO's Trade-Related Investment Measures agreement addresses investment measures that restrict trade. The WTO's Trade-Related Investment Measures agreement addresses investment measures that restrict trade, aiming to provide a framework for reducing restrictions on foreign investment. Efforts to develop a multilateral framework for transparent and stable cross-border investment have not yet succeeded, despite discussions at the Doha Declaration and the 2008-2009 financial crisis meetings of the Group of Twenty. At the G-20 meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico in June 2012, national leaders expressed concerns about rising protectionism and emphasized the importance of open markets and global value chains for economic growth and development. They tasked the WTO, OECD, and UNCTAD to monitor progress in maintaining open markets and report back semi-annually. The latest joint OECD-UNCTAD report on investment measures highlighted the importance of enhancing the participation of developing countries in value chains. Despite G-20 members honoring their pledge not to introduce restrictive measures, the report warned of pressures from high unemployment and weak economic recovery leading governments to potentially discriminate against foreign investors. Firms are increasingly adopting codes of conduct for reasons such as risk management and industry-specific standards. Industry-specific corporate codes are prevalent among large multinational corporations and developed countries. A recent OECD study found that these codes are highly specific, addressing company, project, or location idiosyncrasies. The most common codes focus on environment and labor issues, with many U.S. manufacturers and retailers in the apparel industry prohibiting child, sweatshop, or prison labor. Various industries, including footwear, personal care, and electronics, have adopted corporate codes of conduct. Multinational corporations generally support standardizing rules of corporate behavior across countries and industries. Multinational corporations adopt corporate codes of conduct to standardize rules of behavior across countries and industries. They seek national treatment in investment agreements but are concerned about applying standards globally. Some argue that allowing foreign groups to complain to U.S. regulatory bodies could harm U.S. firms' reputations worldwide. Industry-specific codes cover a wide range of issues and are prevalent among large multinational corporations and developed countries. Industry-specific codes of conduct cover various areas such as labor and environmental issues, with commitments to provide a reasonable working environment, prevent discrimination, and comply with laws on child labor and compensation. Concerns over child and sweatshop labor have led to actions by groups like the Workers' Rights Coalition, pressuring companies like Nike and Reebok to investigate allegations of poor labor conditions. The stakeholders argue that corporations have responsibilities beyond maximizing profits for stockholders, advocating for a broader social contract reflecting changing societal values. The size and scope of these responsibilities vary based on the firm's size, industry, and international operations, encompassing issues like workers' rights and environmental concerns. Stakeholders in different countries may have conflicting priorities, such as job security and environmental issues in developed countries versus local job creation and technology transfers in developing countries. Corporate codes of conduct are generally supported, but the complexity of international investments makes negotiating legally binding agreements challenging. This presents Congress with competing interests between economic efficiency and social justice. The complexity of international investments makes negotiating legally binding agreements challenging, with a mismatch between those benefiting from market efficiency and those bearing the costs. A broad coalition of social groups increasingly views equity and market efficiency as key factors in promoting positive net benefits to consumers and the economy. Consumer and labor groups are concerned about the negative impact of global economic activity and are advocating for labor and environmental provisions in free trade agreements to protect domestic jobs. There is disagreement on how Congress should proceed, as measures supported in the United States are often opposed abroad. The recent economic slowdown has heightened concerns about economic well-being, leading to calls for more restrictive measures on imports and foreign investment."
