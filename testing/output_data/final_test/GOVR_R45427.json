Cryptocurrencies are digital money validated by a decentralized network instead of a centralized intermediary. Since 2009, cryptocurrencies have gained popularity and are now used in various financial transactions and products, such as ICOs and derivatives. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity since 2009 and are now used in financial transactions like ICOs and derivatives. Some central banks are considering issuing cryptocurrencies. Media coverage varies on whether cryptocurrencies are the future of monetary systems or just a passing trend. It is important to understand that cryptocurrencies are alternative electronic payment systems. This report assesses how well cryptocurrencies function in this role, highlighting benefits, challenges, risks, and policy issues. The report discusses the characteristics of money, traditional and electronic money systems, and the features of cryptocurrencies. It examines the benefits, challenges, risks, and policy issues related to cryptocurrencies as alternative electronic payment systems. The impact of cryptocurrencies on monetary policy is also analyzed. In a barter system, exchanges require a double coincidence of wants, making transactions inefficient. Money, a mutually recognized representation of value, allows for more efficient satisfaction of wants. Money can be in the form of gold, paper currency, or digital entries in an electronic ledger. Money serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. For something to be considered money, it must be tradable, have value, act as a good measurement system, and retain its value over time. While society could potentially decide that potatoes are money due to their intrinsic value, their limited tradability and impracticality for daily transactions make them less suitable as a form of currency. Potatoes as a form of currency present challenges due to their varying sizes, freshness, and inability to be divided without losing value. In contrast, gold and dollar bills are more practical as they are easily tradable, uniform in value, and can be divided into smaller units. Gold is inert and dollar bills can be well-preserved, making them effective units of account and store of value. Money has been in existence throughout history, but how it gains value and is exchanged has evolved over time. This section explores three monetary systems with varying levels of government and bank involvement. Early forms of money were often precious metals like copper, silver, and gold, valued for their intrinsic qualities and scarcity. These metals were malleable, chemically inert, and easy to divide, making them efficient for economic transactions. Sand, which can be made into aesthetically pleasing glass, also had potential as a form of money. Money has evolved from precious metals like copper, silver, and gold to fiat money, which has no intrinsic value but is declared as money by government decree. Government mints used to validate coins with precious metals, while fiat money derives its value from government authority. This type of money is mandated for economic activities like paying taxes. Modern monies, like the U.S. dollar, are fiat money declared as legal tender by the government for economic activities such as paying taxes. The government controls the money supply to maintain value and prevent counterfeiting through criminal punishment. This ensures that parties are obligated to accept the currency to settle debts, giving it value in the economy. In the United States, the value of the dollar is maintained by the Federal Reserve through monetary policy. Congress mandated this in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977. Over $14 trillion circulates in the economy to support over $20 trillion worth of new production annually, with inflation staying below 3%. The Federal Reserve in the United States maintains the value of the dollar through monetary policy. It oversees electronic payment systems for interbank transfers and acts as an intermediary between banks. Banks have evolved to provide alternatives to physical currency exchange, which can be prone to theft or loss. Banks have historically offered secure services for transferring money between parties who are not physically near each other. This is done through accurate ledger keeping, allowing money to be stored as numerical data instead of physical currency. Payment systems work by recording individuals' access to money and making appropriate additions and reductions upon instruction. The modern payment system relies on accurate ledger keeping and electronic instructions for transferring money. Trust in banks is essential to prevent loss or theft of funds, with mechanisms such as market incentives and government regulations ensuring reliability and security. Banks ensure security and accuracy in handling customers' money through laws and regulations. Electronic payments face challenges like double spending, where a digital file can be duplicated, causing trust issues between parties. In electronic transfers of money, the issue of double spending is resolved by trusted intermediaries like private banks or government central banks. These intermediaries maintain private ledgers of accounts and validate transactions to ensure the payer has sufficient funds for the payment. Electronic payments involve the transfer of funds between a payee's and a purchaser's account. Trusted intermediaries like banks ensure the integrity and security of these transactions through vast electronic networks and data protection measures. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in connecting banks and regulating these intermediaries. Intermediaries in electronic transactions are regulated to ensure safety, profitability, and consumer protection. They recoup costs through fees charged directly or for related services. Acts like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Fair Credit Billing Act provide consumer protections for unauthorized transfers and billing errors. Electronic payment systems require access to bank accounts or retail payment services, which may be costly or inconvenient for some individuals, leading to underbanked or unbanked populations. Personal information is needed for transactions, generating significant data that could be accessed by banks, law enforcement, or malicious actors. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin offer an alternative to traditional electronic payment systems. Transactions are validated by a network of computers instead of a single third-party intermediary. Users have pseudonymous accounts with public keys and private keys for security. Transactions involve transferring cryptocurrency between accounts. Cryptocurrency transactions involve transferring cryptocurrency from one account to another by unlocking and locking it with private keys. Users create wallets with third-party exchanges to access the system, similar to authorizing payments on websites. Blockchain technology is used to validate ledger changes and prevent manipulation. Some companies offer user-friendly applications for transacting in cryptocurrencies. Before any transaction is entered into the ledger, a network member must validate it by solving a computational decryption. Digital signatures secure each transaction and the ledger, ensuring visibility of any changes. Cryptocurrency platforms allow parties to exchange value without trusting each other, relying on cryptographic protocols to prevent fraud. Users are incentivized to validate transactions by receiving newly created units of the currency. Cryptocurrency platforms incentivize users to validate transactions by awarding them newly created units of the currency. The rate at which new units are created is limited by platform protocols to create scarcity and retain value. Users can also acquire cryptocurrency on exchanges using official government-backed currencies or other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency ledgers using blockchain technology are considered secure, but hackers have exploited vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrency. Analyzing data on cryptocurrency usage is challenging due to decentralized nature and lack of authoritative sources. The recent proliferation of cryptocurrency poses challenges for industry-wide analysis. With almost 1,890 cryptocurrencies in circulation valued at $220 billion, a comprehensive quantitative analysis is not feasible. This report focuses on Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, to examine trends in prices, circulation value, and transactions. The surge in cryptocurrency value in 2017 sparked public interest in alternative payment systems. The price of Bitcoin surged from $993 at the beginning of 2017 to $19,650 in December 2017, a 1,880% increase. However, it then declined by 65% to $6,905 in less than two months. As of October 7, 2018, the price was $6,570 with approximately 17.3 million Bitcoins in circulation, totaling about $113.6 billion. The volatility in cryptocurrency prices suggests their function as investments rather than as money. The price volatility of cryptocurrencies indicates they may not function well as a unit of account or store of value. However, the number of Bitcoin transactions can be an indicator of its use as money, with an average of 208,000 transactions per day globally in 2018. The Automated Clearing House processed 59 million transactions per day in 2017, while Visa's systems processed over 300 million transactions daily. Cryptocurrencies' use in payment systems is limited compared to traditional systems, but their potential benefits may lead to widespread adoption in the future. Skeptics doubt cryptocurrencies can overcome adoption challenges. Cryptocurrencies offer potential benefits to the public and the economic system by providing a decentralized payment system through the internet, aiming to reduce the need for intermediaries like government central banks and private financial institutions. Cryptocurrency proponents believe that a decentralized payment system operated through the internet can be more cost-effective than traditional payment systems, especially for international money transfers. They argue that cryptocurrencies can avoid the additional costs associated with intermediaries in cross-border transactions, as they are not backed by government-fiat currencies. However, quantifying the costs of traditional payment systems and how much is passed on to consumers remains challenging. Certain costs of traditional payment systems, such as high fees charged by intermediaries, have raised policymakers' concerns. For example, Congress included the \"Durbin Amendment\" in the Dodd-Frank Act to limit debit card swipe fees. Studies also highlight fees associated with traditional bank accounts for unbanked and underbanked populations. Cryptocurrencies are seen as a potential solution to high fees associated with traditional bank accounts for unbanked and underbanked populations. They offer an alternative payment system that could reduce costs through competition or eliminate the need to pay fees altogether, especially for individuals who mistrust government and financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies may see more adoption in countries with higher mistrust of existing systems compared to those with high trust. Concerns about traditional financial institutions going bankrupt or misleading customers can drive this mistrust. Individuals seeking privacy or control over their personal data may choose to use cryptocurrency instead of traditional electronic payment systems. Some may also mistrust a government's ability to maintain the value of fiat currency. Hackers have stolen personal information from financial institutions, raising concerns about data protection. Cryptocurrencies offer a stable value alternative to fiat currency, especially for individuals concerned about potential hyperinflation. Trust in decentralized networks with cryptographic protocols may be preferred over government institutions. The success of cryptocurrencies depends on widespread adoption as a form of money, as network effects play a crucial role in their value. Cryptocurrencies rely on network effects for value and adoption. Challenges to widespread use include limited acceptance for payments. Only a small number of businesses and individuals currently use or accept cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are not widely accepted for payments due to various reasons such as lack of legal tender status, trust issues in decentralized networks, and high price volatility. This limits their use as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Cryptocurrencies face challenges in being widely accepted for payments due to factors like price volatility and scalability issues. Bitcoin experienced a significant value drop in 2018, raising concerns about its role as a store of value. The scalability of cryptocurrency systems remains uncertain, with current technologies unable to handle the transaction volume needed for global adoption. In the \"The Price and Usage of Cryptocurrency\" section, Bitcoin processes a small fraction of daily financial transactions, with most transactions handled by established payment systems. Bitcoin's processing speed is slower compared to electronic payment methods like credit cards, with blocks of transactions published every 10 minutes. The slow processing speed is due to the large computational resources required for mining transactions. The increasing number of miners in cryptocurrency transactions led to higher energy consumption. However, as cryptocurrency prices decreased, fewer miners are participating in mining operations. The energy needed for running and cooling computers in mining is substantial, comparable to a small country like Ireland. The high energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, comparable to a small country like Ireland, raises questions about the efficiency of cryptocurrencies. This could lead to negative externalities and irreversible transactions with pseudonymous identities. Trust is required in remote transactions, as goods or services may not be validated upon delivery. When conducting remote transactions with cryptocurrencies, trust is essential as there is a risk of non-delivery of goods or services. This risk can deter parties from using cryptocurrencies in transactions, hindering their role as a medium of exchange. Trusted intermediaries have historically been used to mitigate similar risks in cash transactions sent to distant recipients. Cryptocurrency escrow services hold buyer's cryptocurrency until delivery is confirmed, allowing parties to exchange goods and services without trusting each other. However, this reintroduces the need for a trusted third-party intermediary, hindering widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as payment systems. New procedures and intermediaries are needed to displace traditional intermediaries in cryptocurrency transactions. New procedures and intermediaries in cryptocurrency transactions must establish trust and efficiency among the public. Policymakers face challenges in adapting existing financial laws to address risks posed by cryptocurrencies, including potential criminal use and lack of consumer protections. Criminals and terrorists prefer cash transactions over cryptocurrencies. Criminals and terrorists prefer cash transactions due to anonymity, avoiding financial institutions. Concerns exist that cryptocurrency transactions could also be used for illegal activities, as seen with Bitcoin on Silk Road. Cryptocurrency transactions can be used for illegal activities, but law enforcement can track criminal finances through the public ledger of accounts and transactions. Law enforcement can link pseudonyms on cryptocurrency platforms to real-life identities by analyzing transaction patterns. Cryptocurrency transactions can be traced by law enforcement to link pseudonyms on platforms to real-life identities. Government regulations can subject cryptocurrency exchanges to scrutiny for suspicious activity, with FinCEN providing guidance on virtual currency use. Virtual currency issuers are considered money services businesses subject to federal regulation, requiring registration, reporting of suspicious transactions, and anti-money laundering compliance. State laws also impose registration and anti-money laundering requirements. Bills in the 115th Congress aim to investigate criminal use of cryptocurrencies and enhance government agencies' response, such as H.R. 2433 passing the House on September 12, 2017. H.R. 2433, 5036, and 6069 passed the House to address the threat of individuals using cryptocurrencies for terrorism. These bills establish task forces, reward systems for information leading to convictions, and programs to detect illicit use of digital currencies. The Government Accountability Office conducted a study on virtual currencies and online marketplaces used for sex and drug trafficking. H.R. 6411, passed in September 2018, would amend FinCEN's powers to include coordination on emerging technologies for anti-money laundering. The IRS treats virtual currencies as property, requiring taxes on gains. IRS sought information on Coinbase customers for capital gains from cryptocurrencies. The lack of clarity surrounding the reporting of capital gains from cryptocurrencies on tax returns has raised concerns about potential tax evasion. An analysis estimated a $25 billion U.S. tax liability on cryptocurrency gains in 2017, despite few filings including reported gains. This ambiguity could allow individuals to hide income from tax authorities by using cryptocurrency's decentralized and pseudonymous nature to evade detection. The IRS has recently started collecting customer information from cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent tax evasion. Moving money or assets to avoid traditional financial institutions may also be to evade financial sanctions, as seen with Venezuela, Iran, and Russia. There is no specific regulation targeting consumer use of cryptocurrencies for this purpose. While there is no specific regulation targeting consumer use of cryptocurrencies, various consumer protection laws and regulatory authorities at federal and state levels apply to cryptocurrencies. The adequacy of these regulations in protecting consumers and the debate over whether they are overly burdensome are ongoing topics. Concerns also exist regarding the level of information and protection provided to investors in cryptocurrency instruments like initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency derivatives contracts. The use of cryptocurrencies as investment vehicles is different from their use as money and is not covered in this report. No specific federal consumer protection law targets cryptocurrencies, but they are subject to generally applicable consumer protection laws. For example, the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce. The FTC and CFPB have enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive practices in the cryptocurrency industry. While the CFPB has not actively regulated the industry, it is accepting complaints and may enforce consumer financial laws when necessary. The FTC and CFPB enforce consumer financial laws in the cryptocurrency industry. States also have laws against deceptive practices, with state regulators having enforcement authority over cryptocurrency businesses. Cryptocurrency exchanges must comply with state money transmission laws and licensing requirements. Money transmitters, including exchanges, need state licenses and must adhere to regulatory regimes. Consumers in the cryptocurrency industry may face risks due to their unfamiliarity with how cryptocurrencies work. They could be charged excessive fees, deceived about the true value of cryptocurrencies, or face the possibility of loss due to irreversibility of transactions. This lack of knowledge could leave consumers vulnerable to scams and theft. The irreversibility of transfers in cryptocurrency transactions may leave consumers without recourse, as certain laws and regulations that protect consumers in traditional financial transactions do not currently apply to cryptocurrencies. For example, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 requires disclosures about fees, error correction, and limits on consumer liability, but these protections do not seem to extend to cryptocurrency transactions. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) protections do not apply to cryptocurrency transactions due to the lack of involvement of financial institutions. State laws and consumer protections for cryptocurrency transactions vary, potentially leaving consumers inadequately protected. Policy options may include extending certain electronic fund transfer protections to cryptocurrency users and granting federal agencies more regulatory authority over cryptocurrency businesses. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that state-by-state regulation is burdensome. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that state regulations for exchanges are overly burdensome and not suited to the industry's unique risks. They believe requirements like holding minimum assets are unnecessary and hinder the growth of the cryptocurrency exchange sector in the United States. Supporters of cryptocurrencies argue that reducing regulatory burdens on exchanges in the United States is crucial for the development of cryptocurrency systems and platforms. Some suggest enacting federal laws to preempt state-level requirements. The Federal Reserve in the US has the authority to conduct monetary policy, similar to central banks in other countries. Experts speculate that widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could impact the traditional financial system. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could affect the ability of central banks like the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy. Some suggest central banks issuing their own digital currencies. Central banks regulate the money in circulation in an economy. If cryptocurrencies become prevalent, it could have implications on government-controlled fiat money. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could limit central banks' control over inflation, leading to the need for larger adjustments to fiat currency. This could also result in destabilizing effects on global economies using the same cryptocurrency, potentially undermining price stability and exacerbating economic conditions in different countries. The adoption of cryptocurrencies could limit central banks' control over inflation, potentially destabilizing global economies. Multiple currencies in an economy add complexity to exchanges, requiring constant monitoring of currency values. This was seen in the United States before the Civil War when banks issued their own currencies. The United States had a system before the Civil War where banks issued their own currencies, leading to inefficiencies and the establishment of a uniform currency. Governments, except Venezuela, have not been directly involved in creating cryptocurrencies to eliminate the need for government control. However, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies poses risks and challenges, leading some to suggest central banks could issue their own digital currencies for efficiency. Central banks are considering creating their own digital currencies (CBDCs) for payment system efficiencies. The form and features of CBDCs are uncertain, with some questioning the need for cryptography. Despite speculation, central banks are exploring the benefits and issues of CBDCs' introduction. The possibility of CBDCs' introduction raises questions about their benefits, challenges, and impacts on monetary policy. Proponents argue that CBDCs could provide efficiency gains over traditional systems by allowing individuals to hold accounts directly at the central bank, increasing systemic stability. Commercial banks may need to offer interest to compete with safe deposits at the central bank. Deposits made directly with the central bank may require commercial banks to offer competitive interest rates and security. Critics argue that there is no compelling need for CBDCs as existing electronic payment systems are trusted. They fear that CBDCs could reduce bank lending and expand central banks' role. Consumers may shift deposits to central bank digital money, potentially reducing private bank lending. Private banks may need to reduce lending, prompting central banks to consider supporting lending markets to maintain credit availability. Critics of CBDCs argue that these currencies could lead to less systemic stability by enabling runs on private banks. They also debate whether CBDCs would enhance central banks' ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. The zero lower bound limits central banks' ability to transmit negative interest rates to the economy. Critics argue that central banks taking on a direct role in private financial markets is inappropriate. If CBDCs displace cash and private bank deposits, central banks would need to increase asset holdings and support lending markets. The future role and value of cryptocurrencies are uncertain, with proponents believing they will provide economic efficiency, privacy, and independence, while skeptics doubt their ability to effectively function as money. Policymakers may face issues related to cryptocurrencies, including concerns about crime facilitation and consumer protection. Concerns exist regarding cryptocurrency's alleged facilitation of crime, consumer protections, industry regulation, and its impact on monetary policy."
