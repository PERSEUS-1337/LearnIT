    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"The Espionage Statutes Modernization Act of 2010\". The statutory framework for espionage statutes, starting from the Espionage Act of 1917, was established when intelligence was primarily in tangible form. Since then, there have been significant technological advancements in intelligence gathering and communication methods. The espionage statutes do not fully consider modern classification levels for national security information. The framework was originally for classic espionage cases, but now unauthorized disclosures by government personnel can harm national security regardless of intent. Federal whistleblower protection statutes and regulations are appropriate mechanisms for reporting unlawful and improper conduct. Congress can deter unauthorized disclosures of classified information by enacting laws to improve espionage statutes and promoting whistleblower protection for government personnel. To prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information, laws should punish Government personnel who violate nondisclosure agreements, regardless of intent to harm the United States or aid a foreign power.
