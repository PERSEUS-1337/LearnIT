    "content": "President Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez of the Broad Front coalition began his second term in office in 2015, marking the third consecutive term for the coalition in power. The Broad Front holds majorities in both houses of the Uruguayan General Assembly, with Vice President Ra\u00fal Sendic providing a crucial vote in the Senate. The coalition has maintained market-oriented economic policies while expanding social welfare programs and implementing labor reforms. The Broad Front coalition in Uruguay, under President Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, has implemented labor reforms and social policy changes, leading to economic growth and improvements in living standards. They have also advanced LGBT rights, legalized abortion, and regulated the cannabis market. Uruguay has seen significant economic growth and improvements in living standards under the Broad Front coalition. The country's GDP has grown by an average of 4.9% per year since 2005, with per capita GDP nearly tripling. The poverty rate has also fallen dramatically, leading to Uruguay being classified as a \"high-income\" country by the World Bank. The poverty rate in Uruguay has significantly decreased from 39.9% to 9.7% between 2004 and 2015. Despite this improvement, nearly 22% of Afro-Uruguayans still live below the poverty line. President V\u00e1zquez aimed to enhance education and social care systems but has been occupied with the country's slowing economy, with growth dropping to less than 1% in 2015 and expected to be 0.1% in 2016. The economy in Uruguay is expected to slow down in 2016 with 0.1% growth, mainly due to external factors like declining international prices for agricultural exports and economic recessions in trading partner countries. This has led to growing fiscal deficits, increased unemployment, and rising inflation above the Central Bank's target range. The Uruguayan economy is facing challenges with rising inflation above the Central Bank's target range of 3%-7%. Factors contributing to this include the depreciation of the Uruguayan peso and indexing wages to the cost of living. The V\u00e1zquez Administration is taking steps to address these issues by reducing the fiscal deficit, stabilizing public debt levels, and implementing fiscal reforms. Additionally, efforts are being made to control wage growth and boost economic growth through public-private partnerships investing $12 billion over four years in various sectors. The V\u00e1zquez Administration plans to invest $12 billion over four years in transportation, communications, energy, and port infrastructure, which has caused tension within the Broad Front. Some oppose the government's efforts to reduce expenditures, increase taxes, and limit wage adjustments, citing concerns about private-sector involvement in public works. V\u00e1zquez argues these policies are necessary to maintain credit rating, attract foreign investment, and control inflation, but opponents, including the PIT-CNT trade union, have pushed back with a general strike for higher wages. The largest general strike in Uruguay since the return to democracy aims for higher wages and a reversal of austerity policies. Discontent with the V\u00e1zquez Administration's economic management has led to a drop in approval ratings. Despite strong criminal justice institutions, perceptions of insecurity have risen along with crime rates. Uruguay saw a 5% increase in robberies and an 8% increase in homicides in 2015. Crime rates, although low by Latin American standards, are a top concern for Uruguayans. The government has responded by increasing police patrols in high-crime areas, investing in social development programs for at-risk youth, and incorporating new technologies into policing practices. Uruguayan officials believe that the country's cannabis legalization initiative will improve security conditions by reducing drug trafficking and addressing the negative impacts of drug use. The law allows citizens to grow and purchase limited amounts of marijuana, with a new government agency regulating the entire production chain. Uruguay decriminalized drug possession for personal use in 1974 and implemented marijuana legalization laws, but faces challenges in finalizing sales to registered users at licensed dispensaries due to low pharmacy participation and concerns about security and image. Despite challenges and opposition from about 60% of Uruguayans, sales of state-regulated marijuana are expected to start by the end of 2016. The government may struggle to meet initial demand and some users may still turn to the black market to avoid purchase limits. Concerns about confidentiality may also deter registration, with 40% of frequent marijuana users in Montevideo stating they are unlikely to register. Some Uruguayans are hesitant to register for the state-regulated marijuana sales due to concerns about confidentiality, philosophical opposition, and skepticism about the benefits. The impact of legalization on drug traffickers will depend on the government's ability to bring users into the regulated market. Opponents fear increased drug consumption, while proponents believe legal sales can help treat problematic users and prevent exposure to more dangerous drugs like \"pasta base.\" In 2014, 9.3% of Uruguayans reported using marijuana, up from 8.3% in 2011. Legalization may not have influenced this increase as consumption had been rising since 2001. Cocaine use decreased to 1.6% in 2014 from 1.9% in 2011. U.S.-Uruguayan relations have strengthened in recent years, despite initial concerns. Trade and investment ties between the two countries have grown closer over the past decade. Over the past decade, the United States and Uruguay have strengthened trade and investment ties, with President V\u00e1zquez expressing a desire to continue building relations. A Trade and Investment Framework Agreement was signed in 2007, focusing on trade facilitation, food safety, intellectual property rights, and government procurement. Although a free trade agreement was initially considered, it was not pursued due to internal pressures. President V\u00e1zquez of Uruguay faced internal and external pressure to pursue a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) instead of a free trade agreement. He has prioritized improving access to international markets, including negotiations for agreements with Mercosur, the European Union, China, and potentially the United States. However, the majority of the Broad Front remains opposed to a free trade agreement with the U.S., which is focusing on regional agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Uruguay's trade relations with the United States have seen fluctuations, with bilateral trade declining by 13% between 2013 and 2015 due to the slowing Uruguayan economy. Despite this, total U.S.-Uruguayan merchandise trade nearly doubled from $994 million to $1.9 billion in 2015. Top U.S. exports to Uruguay include machinery, cosmetics, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical products. In 2015, medical equipment and pharmaceutical products were top U.S. exports to Uruguay, while beef, leather, wood, medical equipment, and dairy products were top U.S. imports from Uruguay. The United States accounted for 8% of Uruguay's total trade and was its fourth-largest trading partner. Uruguay benefited from the Generalized System of Preferences program, but its eligibility ended in 2017 due to being classified as \"high income\" by the World Bank. Uruguay's duty-free imports to the United States under the GSP program were valued at $87 million in 2015, accounting for 14% of U.S. imports from Uruguay. Foreign direct investment between the two countries has increased significantly since signing a bilateral investment treaty in 2005. The U.S. foreign direct investment in Uruguay rose from $609 million in 2005 to $1.6 billion in 2015, while Uruguayan investment in the U.S. increased from $88 million to $391 million during the same period. Uruguay's government recognizes the importance of foreign investment in economic development and maintains a favorable investment climate. Uruguay's strategic location and special import regimes make it a key distribution center for U.S. goods in the region. With 120 U.S.-owned companies operating in Uruguay, the country serves as a test market for American products. Uruguay actively promotes stability, democracy, and human rights globally, often mediating in international disputes. In 2015, Luis Almagro from Uruguay was elected as Secretary General of the Organization of American States. Uruguay is an important U.S. partner in global efforts, including security cooperation and support for closing Guantanamo Bay. Uruguay also secured a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council for promoting human rights and international humanitarian law. Uruguay, as a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has actively promoted human rights and international humanitarian law. They successfully passed Resolution 2286 condemning attacks on medical facilities and humanitarian personnel in conflict zones. Uruguay advocates for greater transparency in Security Council practices and addressing root causes of conflict. The country is a significant contributor to U.N. peacekeeping missions, with over 45,000 Uruguayans serving under the U.N. flag since 1952. Currently, Uruguay has around 1,500 military troops, police, and advisers deployed to five missions. Uruguay has nearly 1,500 military troops, police, and advisers deployed to five countries, including missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. The country has a National Peace Operations Training Institute and receives assistance from the U.S. to strengthen its peacekeeping capabilities. U.S. assistance has been used to provide training and equipment for Uruguay's peacekeeping missions, including communications gear, vehicles, night-vision devices, aviation equipment, and patrol boots. International Military Education and Training (IMET) aid focuses on strengthening Uruguay's peacekeeping, disaster response, and national defense capabilities. IMET appropriations for Uruguay have ranged from $427,000 in FY2013 to an estimated $500,000 in FY2016. The Obama Administration requested $500,000 in IMET aid for Uruguay in FY2017 to enhance the professionalization of the Uruguayan Armed Forces and promote military-to-military ties. In December 2014, Uruguay accepted six men from Guantanamo Bay, cleared for transfer by the Guantanamo Review Task Force in 2010. Then-President Mujica granted them refugee status to support Obama's efforts to close the facility, referring to it as a \"human disgrace.\" The former Guantanamo Bay detainees granted refugee status in Uruguay struggled to integrate into society. They demanded compensation from the U.S. government for their long detention without charges. After a protest, they reached an agreement with the Uruguayan government for additional support in exchange for language and job training. The former Guantanamo Bay detainees in Uruguay faced challenges integrating into society, leading to dissatisfaction among Uruguayans and causing some Latin American governments to reconsider accepting more detainees. While some have started new lives in Uruguay, Jihad Ahmed Mujstafa Diyab, a Syrian citizen, protested the slow reunification with his family and demanded to be transferred to Turkey or another Middle Eastern nation. He disappeared from Uruguay in June 2016 and resurfaced in Venezuela two months later. In June 2016, former Guantanamo Bay detainee Jihad Ahmed Mujstafa Diyab disappeared from Uruguay and reappeared in Venezuela, attempting to travel to Turkey. He was returned to Uruguay in August 2016, where he launched a hunger strike. After ending the strike in October 2016, Diyab received permission to travel to another country. Some Members of Congress criticized the transfer of detainees to Uruguay, citing concerns about their ties to terrorism and Uruguay's ability to monitor them. The former detainees' protest outside the U.S. embassy and Diyab's temporary disappearance from Uruguay raised concerns about the lack of restrictions on their movement. Some Members questioned if the detainee transfers followed U.S. law, which required steps to mitigate the risk of transferred individuals engaging in activities threatening the U.S. Uruguay is said to be taking steps to mitigate this risk, but details have not been publicly disclosed. Uruguay's peaceful and democratic tradition has been highlighted by scholars. Uruguay's exceptionalism in South America, with a peaceful and democratic tradition, social safety net, and high standard of living, faded in the 20th century due to economic stagnation leading to authoritarian rule. After dictatorship and economic crisis, Uruguay now stands out for its strong democratic institutions and prosperous society under the center-left Broad Front coalition, facing challenges from deteriorating economic conditions. The deteriorating economic conditions and fatigue with Broad Front governance have eroded popular support for the coalition in Uruguay. President V\u00e1zquez's ability to enact policy changes may be limited, leading to potential disenchantment among the coalition's base. The Broad Front's chances of winning the 2019 elections depend on economic recovery and opposition parties' willingness to unite. U.S-Uruguayan relations are expected to remain strong, with a focus on commercial cooperation and bilateral agreements. Uruguay's potential entry into the Visa Waiver Program for visa-free travel with the U.S. and the possibility of a bilateral or regional free trade agreement. Cooperation on international affairs, including peacekeeping efforts and collaboration in multilateral institutions, is expected to continue. Uruguay is also likely to pursue closer ties with Mercosur, the European Union, and China."
