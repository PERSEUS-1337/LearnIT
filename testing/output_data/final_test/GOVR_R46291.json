    "content": "The United States has a significant employment-based immigrant backlog, mainly comprised of Indian nationals, with almost 1 million lawfully present foreign workers waiting for green cards. This backlog is due to the annual number of sponsored foreign workers exceeding the statutory allocation of 140,000 green cards. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets numerical limits on green cards for different categories, with a 7% per-country cap to prevent monopolization. Backlogs are common for countries with high numbers of prospective immigrants, but most face short wait times for green cards. The combination of numerical limits and the 7% per-country ceiling has led to long waits for employment-based green cards, especially for nationals from India, China, and the Philippines. The backlog has created significant hardships for prospective immigrants, with many facing waits of decades or even lifetimes to receive a green card. Employment-based immigrants without LPR status face job restrictions and potential exploitation. Backlogged workers in the US struggle with limited travel, work opportunities for spouses, and children aging out of legal status. The backlog also impacts families if the primary applicant passes away. This backlog poses a competitive disadvantage for US employers seeking highly skilled workers. The backlog of employment-based immigrants in the US can hinder the attraction of highly skilled workers compared to other countries. Many foreign-born graduates in STEM fields are opting to migrate to other countries due to long wait times for permanent residence. Some Members of Congress have proposed solutions to address the backlog, including changing numerical limits or restructuring the immigration system. Legislative proposals, such as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, aim to eliminate the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigration. This would benefit Indian nationals who face longer wait times under the current system. Supporters argue that the current per-country ceiling unfairly discriminates against foreign workers. The current per-country ceiling for employment-based immigration is argued to unfairly discriminate against foreign workers based on their country of origin. Supporters of removing the ceiling believe it would benefit Indian and Chinese nationals, particularly in the information technology sector, but opponents argue it could disadvantage immigrants from other countries and industries. Removing the per-country ceiling for employment-based green cards is a contentious issue. Supporters believe it would benefit Indian and Chinese nationals in the IT sector, while opponents argue it could disadvantage immigrants from other countries and industries. If the ceiling is eliminated, Indian and Chinese nationals may initially receive most green cards, but eventually, country of origin would no longer affect the allocation. The report analyzes the impact of removing the per-country ceiling on the employment-based immigrant backlog using S. 386 as a case study. It discusses key provisions affecting the backlog, presents results from a CRS analysis on how the backlog would change over the next decade, and explores potential legislative options. The United States grants LPR status to about 1 million foreign nationals annually. The INA establishes eligibility criteria and numerical limits for LPR status, including for employment-based immigrants. There are five preference categories for employment-based immigrants, each with specific criteria and annual green card allocations. In FY2018, employment-based LPRs accounted for a significant portion of green cards issued. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets limits on green cards for employment-based immigrants, with each country capped at 7% of admissions. Unused green cards can roll down to the next preference category, and the per-country ceiling may be exceeded if the number of available green cards surpasses the applicants. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets limits on green cards for employment-based immigrants, with each country capped at 7% of admissions. If the number of available green cards exceeds the applicants, the per-country ceiling does not apply for the remainder of green cards. Unused family-based preference immigrant green cards can be used for employment-based green cards in the next fiscal year, allowing individuals from certain countries to receive more green cards than the limits suggest. For example, in FY2019, Indian nationals received more green cards than the numerical limits for each employment-based category would imply. The INA distinguishes between principal prospective immigrants who meet the qualifications of the employment-based preference category. Derivative beneficiaries, such as spouses and minor children, are included in employment-based green card petitions. They share the same status and consideration order as principals. Most employment-based immigrants require U.S. employers to petition for them. Prospective immigrants can apply for LPR status based on their residence location. Individuals in the United States can adjust status from temporary to LPR status through employment-based immigration, involving multiple steps and federal agencies. The Department of Labor provides labor certification for preference category 2 and 3 immigrants, while USCIS processes and adjudicates petitions. USCIS assigns a priority date to determine place in the backlog, and approved petitions are sent to the National Visa Center for visa allocation. The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (S. 386) focuses on employment-based immigrant preference categories, accounting for 86% of total green cards available annually. EB4 and EB5 categories are excluded from S. 386 provisions and the debate over per-country ceilings. Introduced in Congress since 2011, the bill aims to address the backlog for immigrants waiting for their priority date to become current. In the 116th Congress, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (S. 386) was introduced in the House as H.R. 1044 and in the Senate as S. 386. The bill aims to eliminate the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants, raise the ceiling for family-based preference category immigrants, and allow a three-year transition period for phasing out the employment-based per-country ceiling. The bill S. 386 aims to eliminate the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants, creating a first-come, first-served system. It includes provisions to address concerns, such as a Hold Harmless provision and allocating slots for derivative and principal immigrants applying from overseas within the EB2 and EB3 categories. The bill S. 386 aims to eliminate the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants, creating a first-come, first-served system. It includes provisions to address concerns, such as a Hold Harmless provision and allocating slots for derivative and principal immigrants applying from overseas within the EB2 and EB3 categories. Within the EB3 category, up to 4,400 slots would be allocated for Schedule A occupations. The analysis projects the impact of S. 386 on the employment-based backlog over 10 years, assuming the bill is passed in FY2020 and its provisions take effect in FY2021. The analysis projects the impact of S. 386 on the employment-based backlog over 10 years from FY2021 through FY2030. It estimates the number of new prospective immigrants added to the backlog each year and the number of backlogged approved petition holders receiving green cards. The projections are categorized for India, China, the Philippines (EB3 only), and the rest of the world. The annual additions to the backlog are based on FY2018 USCIS data, while reductions are based on green card issuances. The analysis of S. 386 projects the impact on the employment-based backlog over 10 years from FY2021 through FY2030. It estimates green card issuances in the EB1, EB2, and EB3 categories under the new provisions, including the 5.75% set-aside and Schedule A petitioners. Hold Harmless and Transition Year provisions affect issuances for FY2021, FY2022, and FY2023. The set-asides expire in six to nine years. The analysis projects the impact on the employment-based backlog over 10 years, including green card issuances in the EB1, EB2, and EB3 categories. The analysis includes dependent family members of principal immigrants and presents the projected change in the current EB1 backlog after 10 years. The analysis projects the impact on the employment-based backlog over 10 years, including green card issuances in the EB1, EB2, and EB3 categories. Total annual EB1 green cards issued and new beneficiaries entering the EB1 queue are assumed to remain the same. The backlog is projected to more than double from 119,732 in FY2020 to 268,246 in FY2030 under both scenarios. S. 386 would alter how the backlog grows by country of origin, with Indian nationals experiencing a 21% increase instead of 118% under current law, and Chinese nationals facing a 115% increase instead of 215%. Under S. 386, the backlog for Indian nationals in the EB1 category would decrease from eight years to three years, while Chinese nationals would see a decrease from five years to three years. RoW nationals would benefit from the Hold Harmless provisions and see their backlog disappear after one year. However, in FY2030, RoW nationals would face projected wait times of seven years for a green card under S. 386. Under S. 386, wait times for Indian and Chinese nationals in the EB1 category would decrease to three years. RoW nationals would benefit from the Hold Harmless provisions, but in FY2030, they would face a projected seven-year wait for a green card. The number of foreign workers waiting for LPR status would significantly increase if the per-country ceiling is eliminated. Eliminating the per-country ceiling under S. 386 would change the employment-based system to a first-come, first-served basis. Table 2 shows projected changes in the EB2 backlog after 10 years and wait times for green cards. The current EB2 backlog is dominated by Indian nationals, with Chinese nationals making up the rest. Chinese nationals make up 9% of the EB2 backlog, with no backlog for other countries. The total backlog is projected to more than double by FY2030. S. 386 would impact the backlog growth by country, with Indian nationals seeing a 77% increase and Chinese nationals a 217% increase. Other countries would also experience significant changes in FY2030. In FY2030, RoW nationals would face a backlog nine times its current size (278,333), with green card wait times increasing for all groups compared to FY2020. Under current law, the backlog of 568,414 Indian nationals would require an estimated 195 years to disappear, which would more than double by FY2030. Under S. 386, the wait time for newly approved EB2 petition holders would shrink to 17 years, increasing to 37 years by FY2030. The potential enactment of S. 386 would significantly reduce green card wait times for Indian and Chinese nationals at the expense of nationals from other countries, leading to a substantial increase in EB2 backlog and wait times for RoW nationals. This would create a new backlog for RoW countries by FY2030, projected to be nine times larger than under current conditions. The backlog for EB3 green cards is dominated by Indian nationals, with 81% of the total queue, followed by Chinese nationals at 12% and Filipino nationals at 7%. S. 386 would impact the backlog growth differently for each country, with Indian nationals projected to see an 8% decrease in their backlog compared to a 79% increase under current law. Chinese nationals would see little change, while Filipino nationals are not mentioned in terms of backlog changes. Under the bill's provisions, there would be no change in the backlog for Chinese nationals, a 25% increase for Filipino nationals, and a significant increase for RoW nationals in FY2030. The wait time for Indian beneficiaries in the EB3 backlog would decrease to seven years, while Chinese nationals would wait seven years. Filipino and RoW nationals would not see changes in wait times until FY2030, where RoW nationals would wait an estimated 11 years. The analysis projects the impact of eliminating the per-country ceiling on employment-based green card wait times. S. 386 would benefit Indian and Chinese nationals in the EB1, EB2, and EB3 categories with shorter waiting times compared to current law. The bill would not increase the total number of green cards but phase out the per-country ceiling over three years. The bill S. 386 would eliminate EB1, EB2, and EB3 backlogs in 3, 17, and 7 years, respectively, with equal wait times regardless of country of origin. Foreign nationals with approved petitions could expect to wait 7, 37, and 11 years in FY2030. Maintaining the per-country ceiling would increase wait times for Indian and Chinese nationals over 10 years. The analysis projects that the EB1, EB2, and EB3 backlogs would significantly increase by FY2030, regardless of S. 386 enactment, due to the current number of new beneficiaries each year. The total backlog for all three employment-based categories is estimated to reach 2,195,795 individuals by FY2030. The analysis predicts a significant increase in EB1, EB2, and EB3 backlogs by FY2030, reaching 2,195,795 individuals. The flow of newly approved employment-based immigrant petitions and green card issuances by country of origin remains constant over 10 years, subject to change based on future numbers. The analysis assumes a conservative estimate of new beneficiaries entering the system at FY2018 levels, despite a consistent upward trend in approved I-140 petitions. Green card issuances are fixed by statute, exceeding 262,000 in FY2018. The number of employment-based immigrants sponsored by U.S. employers far exceeds the available LPR slots. Removing the per-country ceiling would reduce wait times for Indian and Chinese nationals initially but at the expense of others. Wait times would eventually equalize among all nationals, which may be seen as more equitable by some but less equitable by others. S. 386 aims to address the employment-based immigration backlog by proposing to remove the 7% per-country cap. Congress could consider various options such as maintaining the current law, increasing the number of LPRs, or reducing the number of prospective immigrants in the pipeline. These options are not mutually exclusive and can be combined with others. Supporters of the per-country ceiling argue that it diversifies the skilled worker pool by preventing monopolization of green cards by nationals from a few countries. The current law's 7% threshold allows immigrants from various countries to obtain LPR status quickly, benefiting U.S. employers. However, the per-country ceiling can limit certain industries while benefiting others, especially with a large number of Indian nationals in the employment-based backlog. Indian nationals in the employment-based backlog face significant delays in receiving green cards, with some waiting for decades or even centuries. There is a call to remove the per-country ceiling to address the long wait times, which are estimated to increase further by FY2030. This issue raises concerns about the fairness of the employment-based immigration system. Opponents argue that the per-country ceiling should not be removed as it currently serves its intended purpose, pointing to the concentration of Indian and Chinese nationals in the U.S. information technology sector. Suggestions to address the backlog include increasing the number of employment-based green cards by altering numerical limits or exempting accompanying family members. Supporters propose increasing employment-based immigrants to alleviate backlogs and attract skilled workers for U.S. economic growth. Opponents argue against this citing lack of evidence for labor shortages in technology sectors. The green card backlog harms U.S. workers by forcing them to compete with foreign workers for jobs. Legislation to increase green cards may face resistance from the Trump Administration and some Members of Congress. The primary pathway to acquire an employment-based green card is through the H-1B visa program. The H-1B visa program has seen expanded limits, with 188,123 individuals receiving or renewing visas in FY2019. Only H-1B and L visa holders are considered \"intending immigrants\" under the INA, allowing them to renew their status indefinitely while waiting to adjust to LPR status. Reducing skilled migration could shorten wait times and decrease the backlog, but arguments against it highlight the impact on economic growth. Arguments against reducing skilled migration emphasize the impacts on economic growth in certain industrial sectors. Recent legislative proposals aim to reform the employment-based immigration system, including shifting to a merit-based system and allowing states to determine their temporary worker needs. These proposals go beyond the current discussion on numerical and per-country limits. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines five employment-based preference categories with specific eligibility requirements and numerical limits. The analysis projects the backlog under current law and S. 386, including individuals waiting for green cards. Data from USCIS was used for the analysis. The analysis relies on USCIS data to estimate the number of people with approved I-140 petitions in employment-based categories. The data is broken down by country and year of priority date. Newly approved petitions for FY2018 are also considered, with a focus on India and China. The analysis does not include derivative immigrant family members. S. 386 includes provisions for derivative multipliers and Hold Harmless issuances to prevent additional wait times in the backlog for approved petition holders. It also reserves a percentage of green cards for overseas petitioners. Most employment-based immigrants in the backlog already reside in the U.S. and can be notified by DOS when a visa number becomes available. Some prospective immigrants in the United States can adjust status to LPR when a visa number is available. However, backlogged immigrants abroad may face career advancement challenges. S. 386 reserves green cards for Schedule A occupations like nurses and therapists. The bill S. 386 reserves green cards for Schedule A occupations like nurses and therapists, with a set-aside for 9,064 immigrants including principal and derivative immigrants. Issuances are projected to start in Year 2 of the analysis. The bill S. 386 transitions from a 7% per-country ceiling to its elimination in the first three years. Green card allocations are prioritized for Hold Harmless, Overseas Petition, and Schedule A categories over Transition Year provisions. Backlogged employment-based petition holders receive green cards in the analysis. In FY2018, USCIS approved 22,799 EB1, 66,904 EB2, and 34,964 EB3 petitions, leading to new additions to the EB1, EB2, and EB3 backlogs. The elimination of the backlog depends on processing backlogged petitions within annual green card limits and prioritizing based on the oldest petitions from each country. The estimated increase in the EB1, EB2, and EB3 backlogs each year is projected to be 16,502, 93,768, and 31,986 petitions, respectively. This will result in an estimated EB1 backlog of 268,260, EB2 backlog of 1,471,360, and EB3 backlog of 287,874 individuals by the start of FY2030. The estimated EB3 backlog is projected to increase by 287,874 individuals over nine years, resulting in a backlog of 456,191 at the start of FY2030. The provisions of S. 386 allocate annual green card issuances, impacting the total backlog regardless of enactment."
