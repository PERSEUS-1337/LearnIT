    "content": "The \"Veterans Equal Treatment Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) formula, established by the Department of Veterans Affairs, has led to inequitable allocation of medical care funds across the 22 national service regions. This has resulted in disparities in care at veterans hospitals in different regions, forcing veterans to compete for services. The VERA formula has led to disparities in medical care funding for veterans across different regions, forcing them to compete for services. A new funding formula is needed to ensure all veterans have access to the quality care they deserve. The VERA formula has caused disparities in medical care funding for veterans, leading to competition for services. A revision to the funding allocation formula for the Department of Veterans Affairs is necessary to ensure all veterans have access to quality care. The Vera Formula for funding allocation in the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system will be terminated, and a new formula will be developed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for more equitable distribution of funds to national service regions. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a new funding formula for Medical Care that ensures no VISN receives less funding than the previous year. The formula will consider factors such as veteran population changes, age demographics, and healthcare facility conditions. The Department of Veterans Affairs will implement a new funding allocation formula for medical care facilities in each VISN. If a replacement formula is not implemented by a specified date, the previous formula will continue to be used until a new one is in place. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations for Replacement Allocation Formula and Additional Authorization of Appropriations for Medical Care in fiscal year 2004 for the Department of Veterans Affairs. $10,000,000 is allocated for the development of a replacement funding allocation formula, and $100,000,000 for \"Medical Care\" to be distributed based on need to Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). The funding allocation for VISNs in fiscal year 2004 prioritizes those with the greatest reduction in funding from 1997, followed by those with overall funding decreases. Any remaining funds are then divided equally among the remaining VISNs before a new formula is implemented."
