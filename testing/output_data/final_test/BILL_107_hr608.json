    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that the oxygenate requirement in the RFG program has reduced emissions of pollutants. MTBE, a chosen oxygenate, has contaminated water sources nationwide and is a probable carcinogen. Ethanol is a safer alternative that can achieve the same emission reductions. The RFG program requires an oxygenate to be added to gasoline, with ethanol being a safer alternative to MTBE. Ethanol industry is rapidly expanding, with the capacity to produce enough ethanol to replace MTBE by 2004. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that replacing MTBE with ethanol will increase demand for corn, create new jobs, and improve the trade balance. Ethanol is an energy efficient fuel, providing more energy than production requires. The net energy gain potential of ethanol can exceed 150 percent with advanced technologies. Ethanol enhances automobile performance and is approved by all vehicle manufacturers. Replacing MTBE with ethanol maintains emissions reductions without water contamination issues. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required gasoline in the RFG program to contain 1.5 percent oxygenate by weight, which was not Congress's original intent. Lifting the regulatory requirement for oxygenates in gasoline would provide flexibility for refiners and improve gasoline performance. However, a limit on aromatics is necessary to protect public health, and a prohibition on increased emissions is needed to safeguard air quality. The use of MTBE as a fuel additive is addressed in Section 3. The Clean Air Act will ban the use of MTBE as a fuel additive, with regulations to be amended promptly by the EPA. The ban will take effect three years after the enactment of the Act, and labeling requirements will be in place during this period. The EPA will require gasoline sellers to label fuel dispensing systems with a notice that the gasoline contains MTBE. SEC. 4. EXISTING MTBE WATER CONTAMINATION. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to prioritize groundwater areas contaminated by MTBE. EPA will develop cleanup guidelines for MTBE contamination. The Administrator will develop technical guidelines to assist States in investigating and cleaning up MTBE contamination in groundwater. SEC. 5. Allowing for oxygen averaging within the RFG program by amending the Clean Air Act to insert \"an average of\" before \"2.0 percent\". Regulation establishing a per-gallon minimum oxygen content invalidated. SEC. 6. Anti-backsliding measures implemented. (a) Ozone Forming Potential.--The Clean Air Act is amended to ensure that the ozone forming potential of emissions during the high ozone season from baseline vehicles using reformulated gasoline does not exceed the potential from vehicles using compliant gasoline from 2000. (b) Aromatic Hydrocarbon Content.--Amendment to the Clean Air Act regarding aromatic hydrocarbon content. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a new subparagraph stating that the aromatic hydrocarbon content of gasoline should not exceed the average content of reformulated gasoline sold in covered areas in 2000. The Clean Air Act is amended to limit the aromatic hydrocarbon content of gasoline. The Secretary of Energy and the EPA Administrator will evaluate oxygenate alternatives to MTBE and promote the transition to renewable ethanol."
