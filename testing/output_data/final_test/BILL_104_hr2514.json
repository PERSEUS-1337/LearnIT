The tax code is amended to make the research credit permanent and introduce a credit for expenses related to collaborative research consortia. Qualified research consortia expenses include wages paid to employees for services performed in qualified collaborative research. A qualified collaborative research consortium is defined as an organization where at least 15 unrelated taxpayers contribute to qualified research. The tax code amendment introduces a credit for expenses related to collaborative research consortia. Qualified collaborative research involves public interest research with results made available to the public on a nondiscriminatory basis, supervised by a qualified research consortium. The tax code allows for a reduction in eligible research expenses for amounts spent on ineligible research by consortia. This reduction prevents a double benefit for the taxpayer. The tax code amendment applies to research expenses incurred after specific dates. The credit amendment applies after June 30, 1995, while payments to consortia apply after the enactment of the Act."
