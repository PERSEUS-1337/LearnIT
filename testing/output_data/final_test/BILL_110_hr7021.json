    "content": "The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2008\" is cited in Section 1 as the short title. Section 2 introduces an exclusion for wrongfully incarcerated individuals in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2008\" excludes civil damages, restitution, or monetary awards for wrongfully incarcerated individuals. It also allows the first $50,000 of income for qualified wrongfully incarcerated individuals in a taxable year after December 31, 2007. The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2008\" provides tax relief for qualified wrongfully incarcerated individuals for up to 15 taxable years after their release. If the individual served less than 15 years in prison, the number of years served is substituted in the calculation. The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2008\" offers tax relief for wrongfully incarcerated individuals convicted of a covered offense, served part of a related sentence, and received clemency. If convicted of a subsequent offense punishable by over a year in prison during the benefit period, the exclusion terminates for that year and beyond. The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2008\" provides tax relief for individuals who were wrongfully incarcerated for a covered offense, including those who were pardoned, had their convictions reversed, or found not guilty at a new trial. The term \"covered offense\" includes any criminal offense under Federal or State law arising from the same course of conduct. The term 'qualified wrongfully incarcerated individual' refers to someone who, apart from the covered offense, has never been convicted of a crime punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment. The Secretary may impose reporting requirements, including a statement confirming no subsequent convictions. The table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item after section 139B. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act. A new section is added to allow a refundable credit for employment taxes paid by wrongfully incarcerated individuals. In the case of a qualified wrongfully incarcerated individual, a credit against taxes imposed for the taxable year is allowed, including 50 percent of self-employment taxes and taxes on wages received. There are limitations on the total amount of income considered and a cap of $50,000. The credit under subsection (a) for a qualified wrongfully incarcerated individual is limited to the taxable year within the qualified benefit period. If the individual is convicted of a crime punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment during this period, the credit does not apply for that year and subsequent years. The term 'qualified wrongfully incarcerated individual' is defined under section 139C(d) for reporting requirements, see section 139C(e). Conforming amendments include changes to title 31, United States Code, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments regarding employment taxes for wrongfully incarcerated individuals and overpayments of tax will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
