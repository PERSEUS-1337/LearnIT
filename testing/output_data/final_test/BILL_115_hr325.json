    "content": "The \"Adult Day Center Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) can result in disability and affect younger adults. MS is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as numbness, paralysis, and loss of vision. It is a leading cause of disability in young adults. Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive neurological disease with primary symptoms including tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and impaired balance. Other symptoms may include cognitive changes and urinary problems. Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological condition with symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and impaired balance. It affects 500,000 to 1,500,000 people, with 5 to 10 percent diagnosed before age 60. Traumatic brain injury, caused by head trauma, can disrupt brain function and lead to disabilities in up to 90,000 people annually. Family caregivers, mainly women, provide significant support to individuals with disabilities, offering around $470 billion in unpaid services annually. The caregiver support ratio is expected to decrease from 7 to 1 in 2010 to 3 to 1 in 2050, indicating a potential shortage of caregivers in the future. In 2050, the majority of family caregivers are caring for individuals aged 18 to 74, while 47 percent are caring for those 75 or older. Adult day programs provide various services for seniors, people with disabilities, and younger adults with chronic diseases, including medical care, rehabilitation therapies, nutrition therapy, and social interaction. These programs are especially beneficial for individuals living with neurological diseases like MS, Parkinson's disease, and TBI, as well as their family caregivers. Adult day programs offer benefits for individuals with neurological diseases and their caregivers, including improvements in functional status, social support, and reductions in fatigue, depression, and pain. These programs also reduce medical costs and nursing home admissions, allowing individuals to receive services while living at home. However, there are limited adult day programs focused on younger adult populations in the United States. Adult day programs for neurological diseases may not cater to younger adults with chronic conditions, lacking appropriate services for their age or disability status. Establishment of adult day programs for neurological diseases may not cater to younger adults with chronic conditions, lacking appropriate services for their age or disability status. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will conduct a survey of existing adult day programs that provide care to individuals with neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease within 90 days of this section's enactment. The survey will identify successful programs and their funding sources. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will conduct a survey of existing adult day programs serving young adults with neurological diseases to develop best practices for establishing successful programs. This includes guidelines and recommendations for services such as rehabilitation therapy, psychosocial support, and social interaction. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will conduct a survey of adult day programs to evaluate the outcomes and success of the services provided. A summary report on the survey results will be made publicly available within 180 days. Additionally, a grant program will be established within 90 days after the report is produced. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will establish a grant program for adult day programs serving younger individuals with neurological diseases within 90 days of producing a report on best practices. Eligible entities must demonstrate understanding of the special needs of this population. The grant program for adult day programs serving younger individuals with neurological diseases requires entities to understand the functional abilities, potential complications, and issues faced by family caregivers. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will not award a grant if the amount exceeds the limit. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will award grants under the program within 90 days of its establishment, ensuring diverse geographic representation among recipients. Grants will not exceed 40% of the entity's operating budget, including in-kind contributions. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will award grants to a minimum of 5 entities in the first fiscal year, 10 entities in the second year, 12 entities in the third year, and 15 entities in the fourth year. A report on the grant program will be produced annually. The grant program under this section will provide funding to adult day programs for individuals with neurological diseases. The report will include details on the funded programs, Federal funding awarded, expected outcomes, performance goals, and indicators to monitor progress in meeting the needs of individuals and family caregivers. The Act defines an \"adult day program\" as a service that offers care and support to individuals with neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's. It aims to maintain or improve functional abilities and prevent complications. Plans for enhancing oversight and management of the grant program are also discussed. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of supporting individuals with neurological diseases to prevent complications, promote alternatives to nursing homes, reduce strain on family caregivers, focus on the needs of younger adults, and address the needs of veterans. It also defines a \"family caregiver\" as someone who provides unpaid assistance to a family member with special needs.
