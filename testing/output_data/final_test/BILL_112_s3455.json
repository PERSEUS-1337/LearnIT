SEC. 3. Development of performance measures and standards for customer service provided by agencies. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will develop performance measures and standards for agencies to provide high-quality customer service and improve service delivery, including specific milestones, performance targets, and response times for telephone calls and electronic mail. The standards for high-quality customer service include performance measures for telephone calls, electronic mail, mail, benefit processing, and payments. Agencies must collect customer feedback on service quality and report it annually. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will track agency achievements in meeting customer service standards. The customer service performance measures and standards developed under subsection (a) are included in each update on agency performance required under section 1116 of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS. The head of each agency must designate a service improvement officer responsible for implementing customer service standards and agency requirements, including guidelines for call wait times and response times. The head of each agency, through the service improvement officer, must establish guidelines for customer service standards, including target response times for correspondence and processing benefits. Customer service contact information should be published. The agency must have guidelines and customer service contact information available on its website. SEC. 5. SERVICE IMPROVEMENT UNIT PILOT. The Deputy Director of Management will establish a pilot program called the Service Improvement Unit Pilot Program to assist agencies not meeting customer service standards. Agency heads will detail employees with expertise in change management, process improvement, and IT innovation to work on the program. The Office of Management and Budget will collaborate with agencies to improve service delivery and develop solutions. To improve service delivery, agencies will evaluate efforts, develop a plan within existing resources, monitor implementation, and submit monthly progress reports to the Office of Management and Budget. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will report on the progress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will submit a report to Congress on the pilot program's accomplishments, outcomes, and recommendations for achieving customer service standards. The authority to carry out the pilot program will terminate 2 years after the Act's enactment. Performance appraisal systems must include compliance with customer service standards developed under the Act. Retirement reporting requirements are also outlined. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must submit monthly reports evaluating retirement information from agencies to Congress and the Comptroller General. The reports include pending retirement benefit applications and their duration. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is required to establish a timetable for the completion of the retirement systems modernization project, including data elements for adjudication, and the date for Federal payroll entities to transmit personnel data electronically. The Office of Personnel Management must also provide detailed progress reports on the modernization project in each budget request submitted to Congress. The President's budget is submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 8. NO INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES.
