    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Wireless Spectrum Use Act\". The Congress finds that competent management of the electromagnetic radio spectrum includes ensuring availability for private wireless entities to achieve efficiencies in their use of this public resource through customized communication systems and shared spectrum without causing interference. The shared use of private wireless systems in the United States contributes to spectrum efficiency, economic welfare, and competitiveness in international commerce. Federal Communications Commission policies have increased spectrum availability for commercial mobile use. The FCC has increased spectrum availability for commercial mobile radio services, while spectrum for private mobile radio systems has decreased. Spectrum auctions are used to select competing applications for licenses when other means fail to prevent mutual exclusivity. Private wireless systems avoid this issue through cooperative, multiple uses. The FCC does not use auctions to allocate private wireless spectrum, as there is no mutual exclusivity among applications. Private wireless systems are used for internal communications to improve safety and productivity, and some payment may be required for new spectrum assignments. The FCC can develop a payment mechanism for new private wireless spectrum assignments. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include definitions for \"private wireless system\" and \"private wireless provider\" as infrastructure owned and operated for internal wireless communication needs of specific entities. The amendment to Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 defines customer premises equipment used for internal communications needs of specific entities, excluding commercial mobile services, public safety services, and public switched networks. SEC. 338. ALLOCATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF SPECTRUM FOR PRIVATE WIRELESS USES. The Private Wireless Spectrum Use Act requires the Commission to allocate at least 12 megahertz of spectrum for private wireless licensees on a shared-use basis between 150 and 2,000 megahertz. 50 percent of the reallocated spectrum must be reserved for private wireless systems, with the remaining available for private wireless providers for specific purposes. The Private Wireless Spectrum Use Act mandates the Commission to allocate 12 megahertz of spectrum for private wireless licensees between 150 and 2,000 megahertz. 50 percent of the spectrum is reserved for private wireless systems, with the rest available for providers for specific purposes. Within 180 days, the Commission must issue an order reallocating spectrum and issue licenses promptly.

Within 180 days, the Commission must issue an order reallocating spectrum and issue licenses promptly. SEC. 5. REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM ALLOCATED FOR PRIVATE WIRELESS SYSTEM USE. Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include provisions for spectrum efficiency in shared spectrum. The Commission is required to devise a payment schedule for private wireless systems and providers to use reallocated spectrum, promoting efficient frequency use. The Commission must adopt a payment schedule for private wireless systems to use reallocated spectrum, considering public interest and without relying on Federal revenues. The Commission must establish a payment schedule for private wireless systems to use reallocated spectrum based on public interest, bandwidth, coverage area, geographic location, and frequency-sharing. SEC. 6. SPECTRUM SHARING\n\nAmends Section 309(j)(6) of the Communications Act of 1934 to prevent the Commission from creating mutual exclusivity where it does not already exist.\n\nSEC. 7. CONFORMING AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. The Communications Act of 1934 is being amended to address private mobile service, application of spectrum-use payment schedule to new licenses, and exemption from competitive bidding. The Communications Act of 1934 is being amended to address private mobile service, application of spectrum-use payment schedule to new licenses, and exemption from competitive bidding. Additionally, a technical amendment is made to section 271(c)(1)(A) regarding private wireless systems for business or industry use."
