    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transportation and Regional Infrastructure Project Bonds Act of 2013\" or \"TRIP Bonds Act\". Congress finds that the national transportation network is vital for the economy, infrastructure construction requires various skills, and investing in transportation infrastructure is beneficial. Investing in transportation infrastructure creates long-term capital assets for the Nation, generates jobs, and stimulates economic activity. Every billion dollars in transportation investment can create up to 30,000 jobs and yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits. The cost to maintain and improve the Nation's critical transportation infrastructure exceeds current estimates. The Act aims to provide financing for additional transportation infrastructure capital investments as the cost to maintain and improve critical transportation infrastructure exceeds current estimates. SEC. 3. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF TRIP BONDS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section regarding TRIP BONDS. TRIP bond defined as bond issued for qualified projects by State infrastructure bank, in registered form, with 30-year term, meeting specific requirements. The State infrastructure bank certifies State contribution requirement for qualified projects, including transportation infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and transit systems. Flood damage risk reduction projects are also included. The completed Report of the Chief of Engineers allows a State to provide funds for a flood damage risk reduction project with issued bonds. The applicable credit rate is determined based on market yield, and there is a limitation on the amount of bonds designated. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by any State infrastructure bank is limited based on the TRIP bond limitation amount allocated for each calendar year, starting from $5,000,000,000 in 2014 and increasing to $10,000,000,000 in 2016 onwards. The TRIP bond limitation amount is allocated to states, with each state receiving 2 percent of the total amount. Any unused allocation by a state at the end of the year is returned and reallocated among participating states. Unused issuance limitation can be carried over to the following year if not fully utilized. The TRIP bond limitation amount is allocated to states, with each state receiving 2 percent of the total amount. Any excess amount of TRIP bonds issued can be carried forward to succeeding years until used. Special rules apply to expenditures, requiring at least 100 percent of project proceeds to be spent on qualified projects within a 5-year period. The TRIP bond limitation requires a binding commitment with a third party to spend at least 10 percent of the proceeds within 12 months or commence construction on qualified projects. Due diligence is needed to complete the projects and spend the proceeds. The State infrastructure bank must redeem nonqualified bonds if less than 100 percent of project proceeds are spent within 5 years of issuance. If a TRIP bond ceases to comply, the bank must pay the US an amount equal to the sum of the bond. The State infrastructure bank must redeem nonqualified bonds if less than 100 percent of project proceeds are spent within 5 years of issuance. If a TRIP bond ceases to comply, the bank must pay the US an amount equal to the sum of the bond, including credits and interest. Amounts from bond sales are held in a TRIP Bonds Trust Account by each State infrastructure bank. The State infrastructure bank holds proceeds from bond sales in a TRIP Bonds Trust Account. Funds can only be used for qualified projects, interest payments, and bond redemption. Upon redemption of all TRIP bonds, any remaining amounts are dealt with accordingly.

State contribution requirements must be met by obtaining commitments for annual installments to repay the principal of the bonds. State contributions for TRIP bonds must not come from federal funds, including transfers from the Highway Trust Fund. TRIP bond proceeds can be used to meet State matching contribution requirements under other Federal laws. Utilization of updated construction technology is required for qualified projects. The qualified project must utilize updated construction technologies. State infrastructure bank is defined as a bank established under section 610 of title 23, United States Code, including joint ventures among State infrastructure banks. State infrastructure banks are authorized to make direct grants to qualified projects using TRIP bonds. Funds from the Highway Trust Fund cannot be used for credits under this section.
