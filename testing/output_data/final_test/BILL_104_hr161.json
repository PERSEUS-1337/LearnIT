    "content": "The \"Workfare Incentive Act\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. Section 403 of the Social Security Act is amended to allow the Secretary to reduce funding for states operating certain welfare assistance programs. If a state is found to be operating such programs, their funding may be cut by 50 percent for the administration of aid to families with dependent children. The Secretary can reduce state funding for welfare programs by 50% for administrative expenses if certain criteria are met. This reduction does not apply to offices outside the specified local governments. The State can reduce payments to State offices administering welfare programs by 50% of the Federal share of administrative expenses if a State operates a general welfare assistance program for able-bodied individuals without dependents. This reduction does not apply to offices outside specified local governments. The participation rate requirements for workfare programs under the welfare assistance program are outlined in paragraph (4). The program must meet specific participation rates based on the years of operation, with an increase of 2 percent each succeeding year. The participation rate for workfare programs in the welfare assistance program must meet specific requirements. For 1995, programs with participation rates below 10 percent in 1994 must have a 10 percent rate, while those between 10 and 50 percent in 1994 must add 2 percent to their 1994 rate. In subsequent years, programs must increase their participation rate by 2 percent from the previous year, not exceeding 50 percent. The participation rate for workfare programs in welfare assistance is defined as the percentage of able-bodied individuals participating in a workfare program. The Secretary is required to review State and local participation rates within 5 years and submit recommendations to Congress. The amendment made by section 2 applies to calendar quarters starting on or after July 1, 1995, with exceptions for States needing legislation to comply. States with 2-year legislative sessions are given flexibility in meeting the requirements."
