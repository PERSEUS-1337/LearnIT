    "content": "The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is a capped entitlement to states under Title XX of the Social Security Act, created in 1981. It provides funds to states for social policy goals like promoting self-sufficiency and supporting community-based care. Annual appropriations have funded SSBG at $1.7 billion since FY2002, but appropriations have been subject to sequestration since FY2013. In FY2013, SSBG appropriations were subject to sequestration, with temporary funding provided through December 9, 2016. States can transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants to SSBG. Supplemental appropriations have been given for natural disasters in FY2006, FY2008, and FY2013. In FY2013, health reform legislation amended Title XX of the Social Security Act to include a subtitle on elder justice. The SSBG is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and federal law establishes five broad goals for the program. The SSBG, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has five broad goals for social services funded by states. States have discretion in spending SSBG funds to support these goals, which include economic self-support, self-sufficiency, preventing neglect and abuse, reducing institutional care, and securing appropriate care. The SSBG, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has broad goals for social services funded by states. Examples of social services related to these goals include child care, protective services, adult day care, transportation, family planning, employment services, and services for special needs populations. State spending is not limited to these services but is guided by uniform definitions for reporting purposes. SSBG funds can be used for a variety of activities, including administration, planning, evaluation, and training. States can transfer up to 10% of their allotments to block grants for health activities and low-income home energy assistance. However, funds cannot be used for land purchase, construction, major capital improvements, or cash payments for subsistence or room and board. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds can be used for various activities, excluding certain services such as payment of wages, most medical care, social services for institutional residents, and child care that does not meet state or local standards. Prohibitions also include services related to assisted suicide. However, under extraordinary circumstances, HHS can waive two of these prohibitions. The law allows HHS to waive certain prohibitions for the use of the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). States have discretion to set their own eligibility criteria for SSBG participants, except for an income limit of 200% of poverty for recipients of TANF-funded services transferred to SSBG. Welfare reform in 1996 replaced AFDC with TANF, allowing states to transfer a portion of their TANF allotments to SSBG. The amount that states could transfer into SSBG was reduced to 4.25% of their annual TANF allotments under the Transportation Equity Act of 1998. The provision allowing states to transfer a portion of their TANF allotments to SSBG was reduced to 4.25% under the Transportation Equity Act of 1998. However, this was superseded by the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act, maintaining the 10% transfer authority. The transfer authority remained at 10% from FY2001 to FY2016, despite some confusion about the Deficit Reduction Act reinstating it permanently. In FY2010, the Social Security Act capped states' authority to transfer TANF funds to the SSBG at 4.25%, but this was later increased to 10% by the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Congress has maintained the 10% transfer ceiling through appropriations legislation. States transferred approximately $1 billion annually from FY1998-FY2015, with 38 states transferring $1.2 billion in FY2015 alone. Transferred funds can only be used for children and families. President Obama signed H.R. 5325 into law on September 29, 2016, which funds the SSBG at $1.7 billion through December 9, 2016, with a 6.9% reduction due to sequestration. Funds can be used for children and families below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, including vouchers for families not eligible for cash assistance. The FY2017 continuing resolution maintains authorities and conditions on appropriations from FY2016, including the provision allowing states to transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants to the SSBG. Both the House and Senate appropriations committees approved bills with $1.7 billion for the SSBG before the passage of the continuing resolution. The FY2017 President's budget proposed $1.7 billion in basic funding for the SSBG, with a provision to reserve funds for research and a pilot project for low-income families to access diapers. It also included a legislative proposal to ensure SSBG funds for child care meet health and safety standards. Additionally, funding was proposed for an Upward Mobility Project to combine funds from existing block grants. The Upward Mobility Project aims to combine funds from existing block grants to provide new competitive grant funds for project implementation and community planning. The President's budget requested $300 million for FY2017 and $1.5 billion over five years for these grants. The project was first proposed in the FY2016 budget and was included in H.R. 5325, signed into law by President Obama in 2016. In 2016, the House and Senate considered legislation in response to the Obama Administration's request for supplemental appropriations to address the Zika virus. The House passed a measure with no funding for SSBG, while the Senate passed a measure providing $75 million for health services in territories with Zika cases. A conference report filed in the House proposed $95 million for health services in states, territories, or tribal lands with Zika cases. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) appropriated $1.7 billion for the SSBG, but funds were subject to sequestration in FY2016, resulting in a 6.8% reduction in funding. The provision for health plans in areas with Zika virus transmission was scrutinized for potentially limiting funds for other entities offering family planning and women's health services. Ultimately, the final Zika package did not include supplemental funds for the SSBG. The sequester reduced SSBG funding by 6.8% in FY2016 to $1.584 billion. States could transfer up to 10% of TANF block grants to SSBG. Temporary funding for SSBG was provided by short-term continuing resolutions before FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act was enacted. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2016 LHHS bill with $1.700 billion for the SSBG. The committee recommended eliminating funding for the SSBG, calling it duplicative and lacking evidence of effectiveness. The Obama Administration's FY2016 President's budget requested $1.7 billion for the SSBG, with a proposal to reserve $8.5 million for research and evaluation activities. A new Upward Mobility Project was also proposed, allowing funds from multiple block grants to be combined for community projects. Additionally, $300 million was requested for new competitive grants, totaling $1.5 billion over five years. The SSBG funding levels have varied over the years, with a high of $2.8 billion annually from FY1991-FY1995. Congress reduced funding to $2.38 billion in FY1996, and set the annual entitlement ceiling at $2.38 billion from 1997-2002. The ceiling was supposed to return to $2.8 billion in FY2003. In FY1997, Congress allocated $2.5 billion for the SSBG, exceeding the established ceiling. In FY1998, President Clinton requested $2.38 billion for the SSBG, but Congress approved $2.299 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee cited funding from other federal programs, while the House expressed concerns about the effectiveness of SSBG-funded activities. The Transportation Equity Act in 1998 permanently reduced the SSBG entitlement ceiling to $1.7 billion starting in FY2001. Despite this, the actual appropriation levels have sometimes exceeded the ceiling. The SSBG funding level for FY2001 exceeded the $1.7 billion ceiling by $25 million. A provision limited states' ability to transfer TANF funds to the SSBG, but an override in annual appropriations allowed states to transfer up to 10%. Supplemental appropriations were provided in FY2006, FY2008, and FY2013. SSBG funds are allocated based on each state's population size. SSBG funds are allocated to states based on their population size. States have discretion in distributing SSBG funds within their borders. States must submit a pre-expenditure report before receiving funds, outlining their intended use. States outline their plans for SSBG funds in pre-expenditure reports, detailing the services to be supported and the individuals to be served. They must also report on actual expenditures in 29 service categories using a standard post-expenditure reporting form. HHS regulations require states to use a uniform set of service category definitions for reporting. HHS requested states to submit pre-expenditure estimates using the same reporting form required for post-expenditure reports to analyze SSBG fund spending accuracy. Additionally, a new performance measure will compare spending plans with actual spending. HHS requested states to submit pre- and post-expenditure reports in Excel to support a new performance measure comparing spending plans with actual spending. States were asked to differentiate between estimated spending from SSBG allocation and projected TANF transfers in their reports. National SSBG expenditures for FY2014 are shown in Table 3, separating funds from the annual SSBG allocation and TANF block grant transfers. In FY2014, the largest expenditures for services under the SSBG were for foster care services for children (16%), protective services for children (12%), child care (11%), and special services for the disabled (10%). Several bills in the 109th and 110th Congress proposed changes to the SSBG, with some seeking to increase funding. Bills in the 111th Congress aimed to establish new programs to address elder abuse under Title XX of the Social Security Act. The health care reform legislation in March 2010 included provisions amending Title XX of the SSA, including one on elder justice. There have been proposals in recent Congresses to reduce or eliminate funding for the SSBG, with bills introduced in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses. The House passed the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012 (H.R. 5652) in the 112th Congress, which included a provision to repeal the SSBG. However, the Senate did not take up the measure before the end of the Congress. Budget reconciliation is an optional process used by Congress to align spending, revenue, and debt-limit laws with fiscal priorities. The House Ways and Means Committee marked up legislation on April 18, 2012, to meet deficit reduction targets, including a provision to repeal the SSBG. The House Budget Committee compiled this legislation into the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012, criticizing the SSBG as duplicative and lacking accountability. The House Budget Committee recommended eliminating the SSBG due to concerns about its impact on vulnerable individuals, despite dissenting views from critics like the NCSL. President Obama signed legislation related to this on March 23, 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed by President Obama on March 23, 2010, amended the SSBG's authorizing legislation, Title XX of the SSA. The changes created new programs for elder justice, the health care workforce, and environmental health hazards, but did not substantively amend the provisions governing the SSBG itself. The law re-titled Title XX as Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice, and divided it into two subtitles. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended Title XX of the SSA, creating new programs for elder justice, health care workforce, and environmental health hazards. Subtitle A retained SSBG provisions, while Subtitle B focused on elder justice, establishing various programs and grant opportunities. The law also established two new sections within Subtitle A for workforce demonstration projects and early detection of medical conditions related to environmental health hazards. The health reform law established new programs for elder justice, health care workforce, and environmental health hazards within the SSBG subtitle of Title XX. Funding for these programs was provided separately in the health reform law and is not subject to the SSBG allocation formula. Additionally, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 reserved roughly $500 million for the SSBG in response to Hurricane Sandy. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 allocated $500 million for the SSBG to address expenses from Hurricane Sandy, including social, health, and mental health services, as well as facility repairs. States had three years to spend the funds, and five states received allocations based on FEMA data. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported allocations for Hurricane Sandy relief funds to five states: Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Additional resources were released by HHS, including revised expenditure deadlines and requests for disaster relief from the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration requested $500 million in supplemental funding for the SSBG to support states affected by Hurricane Sandy. The Senate approved this request in a disaster supplemental package, but the House did not take any action on the bill. Additionally, in FY2008, $600 million in supplemental funds for the SSBG were provided for major disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The 2008 supplemental funding for major disasters, including hurricanes and floods, allowed states to use SSBG funds for social and health services and facility repairs. HHS distributed funds based on demonstrated need and objective criteria. HHS outlined criteria in Information Memorandum Transmittal No. 02-2009, FY2008 SSBG Supplemental Appropriation of Disaster Assistance Funds Awarded in FY2009, issued on January 6, 2009, to allocate funds to states for qualifying major disasters occurring between January 1, 2008, and September 30, 2008. Criteria included triggering FEMA Individual Assistance authorizations and automatic qualification for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The FEMA Individual Assistance program provides money or direct assistance to individuals, families, and businesses in an affected area whose property has been damaged or destroyed and whose losses are not covered by insurance. HHS used Individual Assistance data as a proxy for \"demonstrated need\" to allocate funds to states for qualifying disasters in 2008. Twenty-one states, including Puerto Rico, were eligible to receive assistance. The HHS methodology allocated $600 million in supplemental funds to 21 states affected by disasters in 2008. Three-fourths of the funds were reserved for states directly affected by major disasters, while one-fourth was dedicated to states with ongoing needs from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Funds were allocated based on FEMA registrants for Individual Assistance and state populations according to 2007 data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Table B-2 displays the allocation of SSBG funds to each state. States were given until September 30, 2011, to spend the funds from FY2009, with most states spending 87% of the $600 million before the extended deadline. Six states had not fully utilized their funds by the original deadline. The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act included $550 million in supplemental SSBG funding for expenses related to the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. Six states spent all allotted funds, two states spent none, and the remaining states spent varying amounts. The funds could be used for health services and facility repairs. The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $550 million in supplemental SSBG funding for expenses related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Funds were distributed based on factors like the number of FEMA registrants and poverty levels in each state. Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama received the majority of the funding. An FY2007 supplemental appropriations act extended the availability of the funds until FY2009. States were given until September 30, 2009, to spend $550 million in supplemental SSBG funds allocated for expenses related to hurricanes. Approximately $28.7 million (5%) remained unspent, with the majority used for various services including education, counseling, and health-related services. Unused funds were to revert to the U.S. Treasury."
