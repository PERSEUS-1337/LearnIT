    "content": "The Act titled the \"Derek M. Hodge Virgin Islands Improvement Act of 2011\" allows tax-free distributions from retirement plan assets invested under a Virgin Islands investment program. This amendment adds a new section, SEC. 409B, to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Derek M. Hodge Virgin Islands Improvement Act of 2011\" allows tax-free distributions from retirement plan assets invested in the Virgin Islands Investment Program for at least 30 years. The designated amount will be treated as a designated Roth account or Roth IRA after 10 years, with no inclusion in gross income. Qualified retirement savings include elective deferrals under an applicable retirement plan. The Virgin Islands Investment Program allows tax-free distributions from retirement plan assets invested for at least 30 years. The program must meet specific requirements, including a maximum amount accepted for management of $50,000,000,000 and fees charged by investment managers not exceeding customary fees. The Virgin Islands Investment Program imposes an annual tax on retirement savings managed outside the program, regardless of account balance or Roth designation. The tax is 1.5% for the first 10 years and 1% thereafter. The program must meet specific requirements to qualify. The Virgin Islands Investment Program requires the Governor to choose investment managers. Separate accounts must be established for each type of retirement savings, with separate recordkeeping. Revenues from a 1% annual tax collected for the first 20 years. The funds collected for the benefit of the Virgin Islands must be distributed in a manner similar to the rum excise tax. Payments can be made for infrastructure development plans approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The term 'qualified infrastructure development plan' refers to a plan for improving the infrastructure of the Virgin Islands, approved by a committee and the Governor. The committee consists of 5 members appointed by the Governor for either three or five-year terms. The Virgin Islands legislature appoints 2 members to a committee for 3 and 5-year terms, while the Secretary of the Interior appoints 1 member for a 5-year term. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Revenues from designated assets are collected for the United States and the Virgin Islands during the first 20 years. After the first 10 years, designated assets managed by the Virgin Islands Investment Program will be collected by the United States Treasury. One-third of the proceeds will go to the Virgin Islands for the first 10 years, and half for the next 10 years. After 20 years, the entire 1 percent tax collected will be kept by the United States Treasury. Investors are not allowed to withdraw from the account for a minimum holding period. Investors in the Virgin Islands Investment Program must hold their funds for a minimum of ten years to maintain tax advantages. Withdrawing before the 10-year mark results in forfeiting tax benefits and being subject to Federal income tax. After the 10-year period but before 30 years, early withdrawal incurs a 1 percent tax for each remaining year. The terms 'elective deferrals' and 'applicable retirement plan' are defined by section 402A. The term 'Virgin Islands' refers to the United States Virgin Islands. The term 'Secretary of the Interior' refers to the Secretary of the Interior or their designee. Sec. 409B addresses the treatment of distributions from retirement plan assets invested under a Virgin Islands investment program. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
