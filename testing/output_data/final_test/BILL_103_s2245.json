    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Medicare and Medicaid Third Party Liability Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Congress finds that tobacco-related illnesses cost Federal Government health care programs billions of dollars, with projections of significant future costs to the medicare trust funds. Recent discoveries reveal that the tobacco industry has long been aware of the health risks associated with their products. The tobacco industry has known for years that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive and has tried to conceal this information. It is possible to manufacture cigarettes that are less dangerous. Over 36% of Medicare recipients are former smokers, 20% are current smokers. About 43% of Medicaid recipients smoke, compared to 26% of the general public. Medicare recipients are at higher risk of tobacco-related illnesses due to longer smoking history. The purpose of this Act is to allow American taxpayers to recoup billions of dollars in Federal Government health care funds spent on tobacco-related illnesses and diseases. Legal scholars and courts agree that statistical evidence can prove causation in tobacco-related cases. Cigarettes are deemed unreasonably dangerous due to the addictiveness of nicotine and lack of societal benefits. SEC. 3. CLASS ACTION TO RECOVER COSTS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS OF TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESSES AND DISEASES. The Attorney General of the United States may seek recovery for payments made under Federal Government health care programs for recipients with tobacco-related illnesses from tobacco product manufacturers. Recovery actions must be initiated within 5 years of the payment. The term \"applicable Federal Government health care program\" includes Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health care program, and other similar Federal health care programs. In class action lawsuits, recipients do not need to be notified and cannot become parties to the action. If the number of recipients is too large to join or identify each claim, the Attorney General is not required to do so. In class action lawsuits, the Attorney General can seek recovery based on payments made to a whole group of recipients without identifying each individual. The Federal Rules of Evidence will be applied in cases regarding causation and damages, allowing the use of statistical analysis or epidemiological evidence. If a third party is liable for tobacco product-related issues, the Attorney General can proceed under a market share theory. The Attorney General can seek recovery in class action lawsuits based on payments made to a group without identifying individuals. Recovery amounts will be distributed to the United States, with each State agency receiving a proportionate share based on payments made for the claim under the Social Security Act. The recovered amounts from class action lawsuits will be distributed to the United States, with a portion repaid to trust funds under the Social Security Act and the remainder deposited as miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury."
