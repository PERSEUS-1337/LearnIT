    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Dependent Hospital Relief Act of 1995\" establishes separate applicable percentage increases for Medicare dependent hospitals and other hospitals by the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission. The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission develops separate applicable percentage increases for Medicare dependent hospitals and other hospitals to equalize Medicare margins. The Commission ensures that the average annual Medicare margins of Medicare dependent hospitals providing inpatient services to beneficiaries are comparable to other hospitals, maintaining budget neutrality to avoid impacting aggregate payments under the Social Security Act. The Commission reports on applicable percentage increases for Medicare dependent hospitals and recommends methods to ensure equal access and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. The Commission annually reviews Medicare margins in Medicare dependent hospitals to develop recommended methods for ensuring equal access and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions for \"medicare beneficiary,\" \"medicare dependent hospital,\" and \"medicare margin\" are provided.

The term \"subsection (d) hospital\" is defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act."
