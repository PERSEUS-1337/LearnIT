    "content": "Daniel Ortega, a leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), led the overthrow of the Somoza family dictatorship in 1979. The Sandinistas implemented radical social policies, leading to a war with US-backed contras resulting in 30,000 deaths. Ortega's presidency from 1985-1990 saw improvements in education and healthcare but was marred by corruption and authoritarianism. He lost the 1990 election and subsequent ones in 1996 and 2001, but due to Nicaraguan law, he still held a seat in government. Since losing the 1990 election, Daniel Ortega has served as an opposition leader in the National Assembly. He later won the presidency in 2006, leading Nicaragua towards democratic institutions and economic development. Challenges persist, with poverty and corruption still prevalent. Notably, former President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n was prosecuted for embezzling public funds during his term. Former President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n was sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and money-laundering. Despite this, he continues to control the Liberal party and his supporters have sought his release. Alem\u00e1n was released in March 2007 under broad terms after Ortega took office, following political tensions between Bola\u00f1os, the Sandinista party, and Alem\u00e1n's allies. A power-sharing pact between Alem\u00e1n and Ortega in 1998 has shaped national politics, making it difficult for other parties to participate. In 2004, a power-sharing pact between former President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n and Daniel Ortega's parties made governing difficult for President Bola\u00f1os. The pact included demands for Alem\u00e1n's release and led to constitutional amendments transferring presidential powers to the legislature, which were ruled illegal by the Central American Court of Justice. President Bola\u00f1os invoked the OAS Inter-American Democratic Charter, and high-level delegations were sent to negotiate a solution. In October 2005, negotiations reduced tensions and allowed President Bola\u00f1os to complete his term. Ortega broke the power-sharing pact with the PLC, leading to legislative reforms in 2006. The focus then shifted to the 2006 national elections, with the FSLN and PLC still controlling many state institutions. The FSLN and PLC control many state institutions, including the electoral authority, raising concerns about electoral manipulation. Ortega's victory was facilitated by changes in electoral law, a strong political machine, and a divided opposition. The threshold for winning the presidency was lowered to 40% of valid votes or 35% plus 5% more than the second-place candidate, leading to a runoff if not met. Ortega's victory in the election was aided by a lower threshold for winning in the first round, allowing him to secure 37.9% of the vote and avoid a runoff. Critics argue that Ortega's party, FSLN, became a platform for his personal ambitions, with loyalists firmly entrenched in key positions. In the 2006 Nicaraguan presidential election, Ortega won with 37.9% of the vote, avoiding a runoff. Despite polls showing 60% of voters wouldn't vote for him, the divided opposition allowed Ortega to secure victory. Montealegre, a Harvard-educated banker, gained 28.3% of the vote and formed the ALN party after splitting from the PLC. He was seen as the U.S.-favored candidate and secured a seat in the legislature. In the 2006 Nicaraguan presidential election, Montealegre, the U.S.-favored candidate, secured second place in the election and gained a seat in the legislature. The PLC came in third place with candidate Jos\u00e9 Rizo, while Edmundo Jarqu\u00edn, representing the center-left Sandinista Renewal Movement (MRS), placed fourth. Jarqu\u00edn, along with his running mate Carlos Mejia Godoy, were former Sandinistas who left the FSLN in opposition to Ortega. Ed\u00e9n Pastora, leading the Alternative for Change (AC) party, received less than half a percent of the vote. In the 2006 Nicaraguan elections, the FSLN won 38 seats, the PLC 25, the ALN 22, and the MRS 5 in the National Assembly. The U.S. provided $15.3 million for the elections, with critics accusing U.S. and Venezuelan officials of influencing the outcome. U.S. Ambassador Trivelli faced criticism for his remarks on Ortega and Rizo, leading to increased support for Ortega. Accusations of interference in the elections were also made against a figure from the Iran-Contra scandal. Oliver North, a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, was accused of interfering in the Nicaraguan elections by supporting Rizo's candidacy. Despite criticism from Ambassador Trivelli, North publicly distanced himself, stating he spoke as a private citizen. Critics noted North's contradictory stance in backing a candidate aligned with Ortega's party. Additionally, accusations were made that Ch\u00e1vez indirectly supported Ortega's campaign through favorable agreements for oil and fertilizer supply. The oil company signed an agreement to supply oil at preferential rates to the Nicaraguan Association of Municipalities, rather than the government. Regional elections in Nicaragua faced issues such as voter identification errors and lack of voter education. Observers stressed the importance of transparency in both regional and national elections. Concerns were raised about potential disenfranchisement of Nicaraguans. Concerns were raised over potential disenfranchisement of Nicaraguans in the November elections, with a high rate of errors on voter registry lists. The FSLN and PLC controlled many state institutions, including the electoral authority, leading to calls for addressing pre-election problems. International and domestic observation groups urged the government to rectify issues such as voter identification errors and difficulties in obtaining voter ID cards. The OAS found 200,000 citizens without voter ID cards before the elections, urging the government to issue them. International observers concluded that irregularities did not affect the outcome, stating the election was peaceful and orderly. FSLN leader Daniel Ortega became President in 2007, transitioning from a Marxist revolutionary to a peace-preaching Catholic. Ortega won the election with less than 40% of the vote, despite opposition concerns about forced conscription and food shortages. His government's policy plans remain unclear, with a mix of populist and pragmatic rhetoric. Ortega's cabinet includes members from the Sandinista party. Ortega's cabinet appointments include Sandinista loyalists and supporters of a free market economy. He has close ties with Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who advocates a leftist, populist alliance in the Americas to counter U.S. influence. Venezuela is providing Nicaragua with energy assistance and promising development aid. Ortega's Vice President Jaime Morales has resumed talks with the IMF for a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility plan emphasizing social priorities. The previous legislature, led by Ortega as opposition leader of the FSLN, planned to transfer executive powers to the legislature in February 2007. The new legislature voted to postpone this transfer until January 2008. Montealegre, now head of the opposition, supported the delay to prevent FSLN and PLC from gaining control. The ALN wants to ban presidential reelection, while the FSLN supports unlimited reelection. The Ortega Administration proposed creating \"people's councils\" and giving the President direct control of the police. The National Assembly approved a bill proposed by the Ortega Administration to create \"people's councils\" and give the President direct control of the police. Critics were concerned about the councils resembling defense committees from the 1980s Sandinista government. The new councils will have a consulting role with less power. Ortega gained more control over the police, but not as much as he wanted. In March 2007, former President Alem\u00e1n was released from parole conditions, leading to speculation about his ties to Ortega and potential presidential ambitions. Former President Alem\u00e1n expressed his desire to run for president again. The Administration faced criticism for reducing funding to Latin America, particularly Nicaragua, by 40% in 2008. Despite the decrease in aid, the Administration highlighted support for debt forgiveness and significant aid through the Millennium Challenge Account. Analysts questioned the use of MCA funds in place of traditional aid from USAID. The Administration emphasized 2008 as a critical year for Nicaragua in its Congressional Budget Justification. In FY2008, the Administration plans to significantly reduce programs in Nicaragua, including those promoting good governance, economic growth, and education related to CAFTA-DR. Aid under some programs would increase, but overall funding would be cut. In FY2008, the Administration plans to significantly reduce programs in Nicaragua, including those promoting good governance, economic growth, and education related to CAFTA-DR. Aid under some programs would increase, but overall funding would be cut from $18.6 million to $11.7 million. Peace and security programs would increase to $2.2 million, including efforts to reduce the threat of excess weapons and improve civilian control over the military. Humanitarian assistance for disaster preparedness would increase to $200,000. Nicaragua's debt to the U.S. was $20.5 million as of December 31, 2005, with $389.7 million forgiven between 1990 and August 2006. The Inter-American Development Bank approved $984 million in debt relief for Nicaragua in March 2007, supported by the Bush Administration. Nicaragua is the second poorest nation in the hemisphere, with widespread and acute poverty and little improvement in social indicators since 1993. According to a recent World Bank report, poverty in Nicaragua has not improved significantly since 1993, with over two-thirds of the rural population still living in poverty. The unemployment rate is around 12%, with 35% underemployed. The Bush Administration signed a $175 million agreement in 2005 to promote rural development in Nicaragua, focusing on regions like Le\u00f3n and Chinandega. The Millennium Challenge Account projects aim to reduce poverty by improving transportation, access to markets, wages, profits, and property rights. Ortega has not yet revealed his government's policies to address poverty. Ortega has not disclosed his government's policies to address poverty, but he suggested the US should provide $300 million to support former \"contras.\" The US aims to strengthen democracy in Nicaragua through structural reforms, combating corruption, and promoting the rule of law. President Ortega concentrated political power with a bill passed in January 2007. The legislature passed a bill concentrating political power in the executive branch and delaying constitutional changes. A commission will review the package and new reform proposals. The FSLN may propose unlimited presidential re-elections. Concerns about human rights abuses have been raised by U.S. officials. Human rights abuses in Nicaragua included harsh prison conditions, corruption in government entities, violence against women and children, harassment of journalists, widespread child labor, and violation of worker rights. The National Assembly passed a law in 2006 making abortion illegal, even in cases of saving a woman's life or rape/incest pregnancies, drawing criticism from international organizations. The National Assembly in Nicaragua passed a law in 2006 making abortion illegal, drawing criticism from international organizations. The Sandinistas supported the penalization of abortion, seen as an effort to garner Catholic votes for Ortega. Human rights activists asked the Supreme Court to declare the law unconstitutional. The U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) was approved in 2005 and went into effect in 2006, aiming to promote economic growth and increase exports to the United States. In 2005, Nicaraguan exports to the United States were $275 million, increasing by almost 40 percent in the second quarter of 2006 after CAFTA-DR tariff reductions. U.S. imports to Nicaragua totaled $522 million and are expected to rise under the pact. President Ortega pledged to honor the CAFTA-DR agreement. Immigration is a contentious issue in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations, with debates over toughening immigration laws and demands for guest-worker programs and reforms. The 2000 U.S. census reported about 220,000 Nicaraguans living in the United States, with an estimated 21,000 being unauthorized. In late February 2006, the Department of Homeland Security extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 4,000 eligible Nicaraguans living in the United States until July 5, 2007. President Bush supported new legislation to give legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants through temporary worker programs. Resolution of property claims by U.S. citizens has been contentious in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations since the Sandinista regime expropriated property in the 1980s. Nicaragua passed a law creating a new Property Institute that could lead to the dismissal of property claim lawsuits. The new Property Institute law in Nicaragua could dismiss property claim lawsuits from Sandinista-era expropriations. The Bush Administration suspended military assistance to Nicaragua in 2005 but resumed after an agreement to destroy anti-aircraft missiles. A bill to authorize the missiles' destruction was passed in July 2006, with opposition from Sandinista legislators. Nicaragua and the United States are involved in regional security efforts, including discussions on reducing military strength in Central America. Efforts have been made to improve civilian control over defense policy, with USAID programs focusing on reducing the threat of excess weapons. Nicaragua serves as a key transshipment point for drugs from South America. Nicaragua is a key transshipment point for drugs from South America, primarily to the United States and Canada. Trafficking has shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, where most drug trafficking now occurs. The Nicaraguan government is making efforts to combat drug abuse and trafficking, despite challenges with the judicial system. The Ortega Administration has pledged to participate in counternarcotics efforts and has called for increased cooperation from the United States."
