    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bovine Growth Hormone Milk Labeling and Residue Test Act\". The Congress finds that synthetic recombinant bovine growth hormone (synthetic BGH) is the first genetically engineered food product in widespread use, with residues found in milk from injected cows. Increased levels of bovine insulin-like growth factor in this milk raise concerns about human ingestion safety, requiring further studies. The use of synthetic BGH injections in cows leads to health issues such as increased mastitis and antibiotic use, posing a risk of antibiotics entering the milk supply. Consumers are concerned about hormones, antibiotics, and animal welfare in their food. According to the Office of Management and Budget, synthetic BGH use will increase Federal budget costs by over $500 million in the next 5 years and decrease dairy farm income by $1.3 billion. The European Community and Canada have moratoriums on synthetic BGH, while Australia and New Zealand have refused to approve it. Consumers have the right to know if their milk contains synthetic BGH. States and companies are taking steps in response. Both States and companies are labeling products with synthetic BGH, leading to confusion and lawsuits. A common label is needed for consumers to easily identify milk with synthetic BGH. A synthetic BGH residue test is necessary to validate label claims and ensure truthfulness. Scientific organizations support the need for such testing. A synthetic BGH residue test is being developed with support from scientific organizations. Preliminary research has been completed, and claims suggest a successful test has been created in a lab. The development of a synthetic BGH residue test is supported by scientific organizations, with claims of a successful lab-created test. Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require labeling of milk and milk products derived from cows injected with synthetic BGH for human consumption. The Secretary shall issue regulations requiring persons involved in the distribution and injection of synthetic BGH into cows to maintain records containing specific information such as quantity, source, and date of acquisition of the hormone. The Secretary will issue regulations for the sale, distribution, and administration of synthetic BGH, including requirements for record-keeping on hormone acquisition and usage. The term 'synthetic BGH' refers to substances like bovine somatotropin, bST, BST, bGH, or BGH. The term 'cow' means a bovine animal, and synthetic BGH refers to growth hormones produced through recombinant DNA techniques. SEC. 4. RESIDUE TEST. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a synthetic BGH residue test to detect residues in milk from cows injected with the hormone and ensure compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The test will be made available to public health and agricultural agencies at low cost. The term \"cow\" refers to a bovine animal. A growth hormone produced through recombinant DNA techniques is intended for use in bovine animals."
