    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"75th Anniversary of the End of World War II Commemorative Coin Act\". Congress finds that the United States entered World War II after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, joined the Allied cause against Axis powers, mobilized 16 million citizens for the war effort, and eventually achieved total dominance over its enemies, with 405,399 American lives lost. The World War II conflict led to the transformation of the home front into a military powerhouse, known as the \"Arsenal of Democracy,\" with increased opportunities for minorities and women. The war ended on September 2, 1945, with the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan, resulting in a total victory for the United States and the Allies. Allied victory in World War II established the United States as the leader of the \"free world,\" promoting democratic principles and resisting tyranny. The war empowered marginalized groups like women and African Americans to seek equal rights, leading to the growth of the civil rights movement. This generation of citizens contributed to the development of a more perfect union with freedom, justice, and equality for all. The urgent need to honor the passing generation of US citizens who fought in World War II is critical as the 75th anniversary of the end of US involvement in the war approaches from May 8, 2020, to September 2, 2020. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\" is a condensed summary of the section discussing the specifications of a coin related to honoring the passing generation of US citizens who fought in World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half dollar clad coins in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, with specific weight, diameter, and composition requirements for each type of coin. The coins minted to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II will weigh 11.34 grams, have a diameter of 1.205 inches, and be minted to the specifications for half dollar coins. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of coins minted to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II will follow specifications for half dollar coins. The coins minted under this Act will symbolize the sacrifices made during World War II, with inscriptions of value, year, and patriotic words. The design will feature the World War II Victory Medal awarded to US military personnel. The Secretary will select the design after consultation. The design for the coins minted under this Act, symbolizing World War II sacrifices, will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with The National WWII Museum and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens of Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, at a designated U.S. Mint facility. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act will include surcharges ranging from $5 to $50 per coin. Surcharges received will be paid to The National WWII Museum Inc. for educational purposes. The Comptroller General of the United States will audit the museum's expenditures related to these funds. The Act allows for surcharges on coin sales, with limits on the number of commemorative coin programs issued annually to avoid exceeding set limitations. The Secretary may provide guidance for implementation. SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. The Secretary will ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not cost the US Government. No funds will be disbursed until the total cost of designing and issuing all authorized coins is recovered by the US Treasury."
