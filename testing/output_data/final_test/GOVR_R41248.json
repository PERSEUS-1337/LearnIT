    "content": "President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court in 2010. Kagan, a former dean at Harvard Law School and current Solicitor General, lacks judicial experience but has expressed her legal views through various documents. As dean, she supported the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights in a Supreme Court case. The Harvard Law School (HLS) submitted an amicus brief in a Supreme Court case regarding military recruiters' access to college campuses. The brief was one of 28 filed, with 14 in support of FAIR, 12 on behalf of the petitioners, and 2 expressing views without taking sides. The Harvard Law School submitted an amicus brief in a Supreme Court case challenging the constitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, which requires colleges receiving federal funds to allow military recruiters equal access to students. HLS, like other institutions, had a nondiscrimination policy that conflicted with the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. The Solomon Amendment requires colleges to allow military recruiters access to campuses or risk losing federal funds. This policy was challenged in the Supreme Court case Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. due to conflicts with nondiscrimination policies like Harvard Law School's. Harvard Law School's nondiscrimination policy conflicted with the Solomon Amendment, which requires colleges to grant military recruiters equal access to campuses or risk losing federal funds. This led to military recruiters using a student veterans' group for recruitment activities until 2002 when the Department of Defense threatened enforcement action. During her tenure as dean, Kagan reluctantly exempted the military from Harvard Law School's anti-discrimination policy to allow recruitment via the Office of Career Services. Despite briefly reinstating a ban in 2005, she ultimately relented under threat of losing federal funds. This exemption remains in effect today due to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Solomon Amendment. In a 2005 letter, Kagan expressed her personal views on various issues. During her tenure as dean, Kagan reluctantly exempted the military from Harvard Law School's anti-discrimination policy to allow recruitment via the Office of Career Services. In a 2005 letter, Kagan expressed her personal views on nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, condemning the military's DADT policy, and emphasizing equal opportunity for all persons. During her time as dean, Kagan allowed military recruitment at Harvard Law School despite her personal views on nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation. HLS filed an amicus brief in support of FAIR, arguing the Solomon Amendment dispute should be resolved on statutory grounds, not constitutional ones. The brief highlighted the statutory text of the amendment, which ensures equal access for military recruiters on campus. The amicus brief argued that Harvard Law School and other schools with similar nondiscrimination policies were in compliance with the Solomon Amendment because they provided equal access to military recruiters, as required by the statute. Military recruiters were not singled out for disfavored treatment and were subject to the same terms and conditions as other employers. The amicus brief reviewed the legislative history of the Solomon Amendment, arguing that it was not intended to target neutral practices but policies specifically anti-military. It criticized the government's characterization of the law as requiring equal opportunity for military recruiters, stating that the government was seeking special treatment for the military. The amici argued against the government's interpretation of the Solomon Amendment, stating that it should only apply to policies that single out military recruiters for unfavorable treatment, not evenhanded policies. They contended that schools had not violated the law by applying nondiscrimination policies equally to all employers, similar to other requirements for on-campus recruiting. The Court rejected the statutory argument in HLS's amicus brief and upheld the constitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, which requires equal access for military recruiters on campuses. The Court upheld the constitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, which mandates equal access for military recruiters on campuses, regardless of the recruiting policy in place. The statute requires that military recruiters be granted the same access as other recruiters, and the federal government can condition university funding on compliance with this law. The Court reversed a previous decision that deemed the Solomon Amendment unconstitutional, stating that it did not violate the First Amendment rights of law schools. The requirement for law schools to facilitate military recruiters' access was considered acceptable. The Court found that accommodating military recruiters on campus does not violate law schools' First Amendment rights as it does not compel speech or endorse military policies. This decision distinguished the doctrine of \"expressive association\" and allowed schools to express opposition to military policies in other ways. The Court rejected FAIR's constitutional challenge to the Solomon Amendment, stating that accommodating military recruiters on campus does not violate law schools' First Amendment rights. Recruiters are considered outsiders with limited purpose and not members of the school's expressive association. Congress has broad powers over military manpower matters, including requiring campus access for recruiters, which the Court deemed deserving of deference. Many law schools barred military recruiters due to DOD's DADT policy. Kagan supported institutions challenging the Solomon Amendment, submitting an amicus brief for a decision on statutory grounds. The Court disagreed, and when FAIR lost, schools complied with the ruling. Kagan's participation in the brief does not necessarily reflect her judicial philosophy. The amicus brief submitted by Kagan on the Solomon Amendment issue does not necessarily reflect her judicial views on this matter or related issues."
