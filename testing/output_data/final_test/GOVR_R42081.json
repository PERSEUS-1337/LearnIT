    "content": "The Occupy Wall Street demonstrations that began in September 2011 reflect various viewpoints and agendas, with a common concern being the wealth and power disparity between the \"1%\" and the \"99%\". Protestors believe the 1% have too much wealth and influence, leading to conflicts with the economic well-being of the rest of the country. This critique highlights the excessive consumption of resources by the financial industry, suggesting that resources could be better utilized in the production of goods and services. The criticism of the financial sector includes concerns about income inequality, excessive risk-taking, and the destabilization of the financial system. This critique is outside the mainstream of economics. One strain of American political thought has included sweeping attacks on high finance, portraying it as morally corrupt and detrimental to the real economy, labor, and democracy. Recent economic research highlights aspects of financial activity that may not be beneficial. The report serves as a reminder of historical debates shaping congressional oversight of financial institutions and markets, with major political parties often divided on economic and financial regulation. The clash of economic views in American political thought has historically been between Thomas Jefferson's agrarian vision and Alexander Hamilton's modernization projects. Jefferson warned against national banking and paper money, fearing they would lead to gambling and moral decay, while Hamilton argued they would contribute to economic growth. Hamilton argued that banks contribute to national wealth by promoting industrious and commercial enterprise, despite the criticism of overtrading. Andrew Jackson vetoed the rechartering of the Bank of the United States in 1832 due to his belief that it granted unjust monopoly powers, enabling the few to oppress the many. During the Gilded Age, Andrew Carnegie's \"Gospel of Wealth\" clashed with criticisms of financiers like J.P. Morgan for their anti-democratic control over the economy and exploitation of hardworking individuals. During the Gilded Age, Theodore Roosevelt criticized the exploitation of hardworking individuals by wealthy Americans, distinguishing between finance and enterprise. He aimed to reduce the power of trusts and monopolies, continuing the trust-busting policies of Presidents Taft and Wilson. Wilson continued Roosevelt's trust-busting policies, emphasizing the need to prevent interlocking control of financial and nonfinancial corporations to promote independent industrial management and bring new energy into business enterprises. The young men coming on will greatly enrich the business activities of the country. Presidents Coolidge and Hoover had a positive view of Wall Street, with Coolidge praising its power and development in 1925. Even during financial turmoil in 1929, Hoover saw Wall Street as a source of stability. Hoover viewed Wall Street as crucial for stability, especially in times of economic turmoil. Bankers play a key role in shaping economic psychology and providing constructive solutions. Franklin Roosevelt, however, took a different stance during the Depression, opposing the financial sector. During the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt opposed the financial sector, blaming them for causing hard times. He criticized high officials of banks and corporations for unethical practices and reckless speculation. After World War II, financial markets enjoyed prosperity, but the crisis of 2007-2009 brought back concerns about Wall Street's impact on the economy. The crisis of 2007-2009 reignited concerns about economic fairness and the social utility of the financial sector's output. Congressional oversight typically focuses on specific issues rather than evaluating the industry as a whole. The consensus is that financial intermediation is essential for wealth creation, with larger and more sophisticated financial systems leading to lower borrowing costs and increased flexibility for firms. The idea of diminishing social returns to scale in financial services is rarely discussed in the literature. Some in the economics field are rethinking the relationship between the financial system and economic growth post the recent financial crisis. The financial system's growth relative to the economy is a topic of political critique, with finance steadily increasing as a percentage of GDP over the past 60 years. There is no agreed-upon method to determine the optimal size of the financial sector. Financial industry profits have grown, with profits outpacing output growth since the early 1980s. The financial system's growth relative to the economy has raised concerns about excessive intermediation costs. Research shows that a developed financial system can boost economic growth, but when credit to the private sector exceeds 110% of GDP, it may hinder growth. In 2006, the United States was one of eight countries with credit to the private sector above the 110% threshold identified by researchers. Countries above this threshold suffered the most during the recent financial crisis. Arcand et al. suggest that a large financial system can hinder economic growth due to increased macroeconomic volatility and the absorption of talented individuals who could contribute more in the nonfinancial sector. In the decades before the financial crisis, economist James Tobin expressed concerns about resources being diverted to the financial sector, attracting workers with high pay. Data shows a rise in financial sector employment and compensation from 1949 to the early 1980s. Since 1980, financial sector employment has remained steady, but compensation has continued to increase. The focus of controversy is on top earners in the sector, with evidence showing significant wealth accumulation through financial investments and real estate. For example, the 2010 bonus pool for securities industry employees in New York City alone was $20.8 billion, and the top 25 hedge fund managers earned $22.7 billion in the same year. In 2004, Wall Street individuals comprised a larger fraction of the very highest end of the income distribution than nonfinancial CEOs and top executives. Nine times as many Wall Street individuals earned over $100 million compared to public company CEOs. The top 25 hedge fund managers earned more than all 500 S&P CEOs combined. U.S. income gains over the past few decades have favored the top earners. Recent studies have shown that U.S. income gains have mostly benefited the wealthiest, with the top 1% experiencing a 275% increase in after-tax incomes between 1979 and 2007. The traditional view that income inequality spurs economic growth is being challenged, with some suggesting that excessive inequality can actually slow down growth. There is no new consensus on this issue, but ongoing economic research continues to explore the relationship between income inequality and economic growth. Recent economic research has questioned the traditional view that income inequality spurs economic growth. There is growing acceptance that the increasing concentration of income and wealth in the top 1% may have negative macroeconomic consequences. Concerns also exist regarding Wall Street pay creating perverse incentives for traders to adopt risky strategies for short-term gains. This shift away from traditional bank-centered financial intermediation to market-based systems has introduced management layers with potentially misaligned incentives. Managers had incentives to hide tail risks and engage in herding to boost their compensation, creating misaligned incentives with investors. This behavior could lead to high returns on investment but with severe consequences when risks materialize. Rajan highlighted that hidden tail risks and herding behavior could fuel asset bubbles and lead to system-wide disruptions. Financial innovation also contributes to systemic instability by creating complex and hard-to-value securities. Investors' demand for traditional securities prompts intermediaries to create new, cheaper instruments until new information reveals underlying risks. Investors may seek to dispose of new securities at fire sale prices and return to traditional securities when new information reveals previously unrecognized risks. This \"rush for the exits\" can lead to system-wide panic, especially with high leverage. Research by Reinhart and Rogoff shows that financial instability leading to a crisis results in severe recessions with deep asset market price drops, declines in output and employment, and a sharp rise in government debt. After a financial crisis, government debt tends to increase due to declines in revenues rather than crisis containment measures. When government debt surpasses 90% of GDP, growth rates typically decline. Critiques of Wall Street bankers post-2007-2009 crisis are in line with popular sentiment. The presidential statements in this report align with post-crisis literature, highlighting concerns about the financial sector's dominance in the economy and the shift towards trading paper assets. The experience of the crisis has influenced public perception of the financial sector, leading to anti-Wall Street demonstrations. Congress is examining whether the crisis was a temporary event or exposed systemic flaws. The economic research is inconclusive on whether the crisis was a temporary episode or revealed systemic flaws in the financial system. Nobel Prize-winning Economist Robert Solow suggests that trading strategies focused on small pricing anomalies may not significantly benefit the real economy. This raises concerns about the instability, size, and complexity of the poorly regulated financial system. The financial system is not only too big and complex but also absorbs talent and resources that could be utilized more effectively elsewhere."
