    "content": "The \"Emergency Warning Act of 2003\" may be cited as such. The Congress recognizes the importance of effective public warnings in saving lives, preventing economic losses, and empowering citizens to take appropriate actions during natural hazards, technological accidents, and acts of terrorism. The National Weather Service is the official voice for issuing warnings during life-threatening weather situations, while the Department of Transportation is responsible for issuing warnings related to transportation hazards. The Department of Transportation is responsible for protecting the public from transportation hazards, including hazardous materials and pipeline transport. They also provide training for first responders and coordinate the restoration of transportation systems after emergencies. Other federal agencies like the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency gather and disseminate information related to transportation safety. The National Telecommunications Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission have expertise in new technologies for communicating threats to the public. Metropolitan and State authorities, along with federal agencies, are responsible for providing emergency warnings. The current warning mechanisms often fail due to a patchwork system. National procedures, standards, and systems for public warnings, including technology protocols, are crucial for improving the effectiveness of warning mechanisms. This will help provide necessary information and reach all at-risk individuals, especially those in isolated areas, ultimately saving lives, reducing injuries, and minimizing the costs of disasters and terrorist acts for the American people. The purpose of this Act is to establish a national all-hazard warning system to alert Americans to risks from natural disasters, man-made disasters, and acts of terrorism, including chemical and biological threats. The Act aims to establish national standards for public warnings within a year of enactment, involving various federal agencies, state and local governments, private sector, media, and academia. The development of an Emergency Warning Network will include benchmarks for assessing current systems. The Act aims to establish national standards for public warnings within a year of enactment, involving various federal agencies, state and local governments, private sector, media, and academia. It includes developing benchmarks for assessing current all-hazard warning capabilities and conducting research on improving effectiveness. Specifications for a national backbone for collecting and disseminating warnings will be developed. The Act requires the use of various communication technologies for public warnings, including traditional telephones, wireless technology, and the Internet. It also involves working with the Federal Communications Commission for alerts on TVs and radios, educating the public on all-hazard warnings, and engaging in necessary activities to fulfill the Act's purpose. The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for implementing terminology, protocols, and terrorism warnings. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with developing universal all-hazard warning standards and issuing warnings for terrorism and public safety threats through a public warning system. This involves collaboration with various government agencies, private sector entities, media, and academia. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security are required to coordinate with the Director of Central Intelligence to ensure that the procedures established under this Act do not harm intelligence sources. They must also submit joint reports to Congress on the status of public warning capability every 6 months and may utilize advisory committees for their responsibilities. SEC. 5.
