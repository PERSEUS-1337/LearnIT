The purpose is to protect the public interest by defining a cash sale as one without credit extension. The Packers and Stockyards Improvement Act of 1996 amendment defines a cash sale as one without credit extension. A trust under the Act includes assets like accounts receivable, proceeds from livestock sales, dealer inventory, and livestock if payment is not received in full. The Packers and Stockyards Improvement Act of 1996 defines a cash sale as one without credit extension. It states that accounts receivable, proceeds from livestock sales, dealer inventory, and livestock must be held in trust by the dealer or market agency for the seller until full payment is received. There is an exemption if the total cash sales made in the preceding 12 months do not exceed $250,000. If an instrument of payment is dishonored in a cash sale as defined by the Packers and Stockyards Improvement Act of 1996, the seller will lose the benefit of trust unless written notice is given within a specified timeframe. The trust established under paragraph (1) does not affect the rights of a bona fide third-party purchaser of the livestock. District courts of the United States have jurisdiction in civil actions to enforce payment of the trust amount and prevent dissipation of the trust. SEC. 3. REPORTS TO SECRETARY. Amends the Packers and Stockyards Act to require reporting of livestock and livestock product quantities and prices to the Secretary. SEC. 4. INCLUSION OF FORMULA-PRICED CATTLE IN DEFINITION OF CAPTIVE SUPPLY.
