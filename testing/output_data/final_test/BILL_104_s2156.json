    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996\". The Congress recognizes the authority of State governments to govern based on the needs and desires of the people. Federal laws should be limited to powers delegated by the Constitution, as intended by the framers. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the United States to the States or the people. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the United States to the States or the people, and the courts should strictly construe Federal laws interfering with State powers with a presumption in favor of State authority. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION. On or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted by Congress must include a declaration stating the Constitutional authority, the Federal Government's superiority in governing over States, and the intention to preempt State or local laws if necessary. The Congress must make specific factual findings to support the declarations in the statute enacted on or after January 1, 1997, regarding the Federal Government's superiority in governing over States and the preemption of State or local laws if necessary. SEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER. In General, any bill, joint resolution, or amendment must include a declaration of Congressional intent as required under section 3. Rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives applies to this section, superseding other rules only to the extent of inconsistency. The rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives applies to any bill, joint resolution, or amendment in the same manner as any rule of the Senate or House of Representatives. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON STATUTORY PREEMPTION. The Congressional Research Service must prepare and publish a report within 90 days after each Congress adjourns sine die, detailing the extent of Federal statutory preemption of State and local government powers. The report includes a list of preempting Federal statutes, summaries of legislation, court cases on preemption issues, and other relevant information determined by the Director of the Congressional Research Service. The report on Federal statutory preemption of State and local government powers must be sent to the President and relevant committees in Congress. SEC. 6. EXECUTIVE PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW. Amends Chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code by adding a new section on preemption of state law. The text prohibits executive agencies from preempting state laws unless authorized by statute and in cases of direct conflict with federal power. Any preemption must be narrowly tailored and clearly defined. Regulations must explicitly describe the scope of preemption. When an agency proposes to preempt State law, affected States must be given notice and an opportunity for input. The notice must be sent to State officials and a list of preemptive regulations must be included in the Federal Register. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to participation in rulemaking by State and local government officials. Rules and regulations must explicitly state any preemption of State or local laws. Executive departments must review regulations that preempt State or local powers. Executive departments and agencies must publish a plan in the Federal Register for reviewing rules to determine if they should continue unchanged, be altered, or repealed to minimize impact on State or local government powers. The review must be conducted within 10 years for new rules and within 3 years for existing rules. Any Federal rule or regulation promulgated after January 1, 1997, inconsistent with this section shall not bind any State or local government or preempt their laws. SEC. 7. CONSTRUCTION. No statute or rule enacted after this Act shall preempt any State or local government law unless explicitly stated or in direct conflict. Ambiguities in the Act or any other law shall favor preserving States' authority. Invalid provisions can be severed. If a provision of the Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest of the Act or its application to other situations. SEC. 8. APPROPRIATION BY STATE LEGISLATURES: State funds received under Federal law must be appropriated by the State legislature in accordance with the required terms and conditions."
