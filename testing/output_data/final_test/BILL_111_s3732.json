Congress finds that American college graduates major in engineering at a lower rate compared to European and Asian students. US students perform well in fourth grade but lag behind in math and science by 12th grade. Admissions to engineering schools require a strong background in math, science, English, social studies, and humanities. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, engineering employment is expected to grow by 11 percent from 2008 to 2018, with engineers earning high starting salaries. Engineers should possess creativity, analytical skills, and good communication abilities. Project-based learning in high school helps students develop the necessary skills for success in engineering. Participants in FIRST Robotics are more likely to attend college full-time, major in a science or engineering field, and specifically major in engineering compared to nonparticipants. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key terms such as \"eligible entity,\" \"local educational agency,\" \"poverty line,\" and \"secondary school\" are defined according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education, and \"STEM\" stands for science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The Innovative Inspiration School Grant Program is established. The Innovation Inspiration grant program aims to support non-traditional STEM education methods, student participation in robotics competitions, foster innovation in STEM careers, and encourage collaboration among students. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to promote STEM in secondary schools, support student participation in robotics competitions, and broaden access to STEM careers. Grants are awarded for up to 5 years in an amount sufficient to achieve the program's goals. Each eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary detailing how they will carry out robotics or STEM competitions, establish programs for students in grades 9-12, and recruit mentors. The application must detail plans to recruit mentors, support teachers, engage underrepresented groups, secure partners, ensure financial sustainability, and evaluate project results. The grant project involves comparing participating students to non-participants and evaluating graduation rates, college-going rates, STEM class enrollment, and mentor partnerships. The Secretary gives preference to grant applications addressing the needs of rural or urban schools, low-performing schools, or schools serving a significant number of children from low-income families. Grant funds can be used for STEM education and career activities. The grant funds can be used for STEM education and career activities, purchase of parts for robotics or STEM competitions, teacher incentives, support and expenses for participation in robotics or STEM competitions, additional materials and support, and evaluation. The evaluation described in subsection (c)(2)(H) must be carried out. Grant funds for robotics or STEM competitions can only support participation in nonprofit competitions. Each eligible entity receiving a grant can use up to 2 percent for administrative costs. A matching requirement of securing 50 percent of the grant from non-Federal sources is necessary. The Secretary may waive the matching requirement for an eligible entity facing financial hardship. Grant funds must supplement, not supplant, other funds. The Secretary shall establish a communications and outreach program using appropriated funds. The Secretary will establish a communications and outreach program to publicize non-traditional teaching methods in STEM and the grant program application process. An evaluation program will also be set up to assess the effectiveness of the grant program by comparing student outcomes. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this Act. The Secretary will allocate necessary funds for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Limitations include using not more than 1 percent for communications and outreach, and not more than 1 percent for evaluation programs."
