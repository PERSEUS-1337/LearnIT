    "content": "The \"Real Access to College Education Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. It introduces a deduction for qualified post-secondary educational expenses under section 224 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Real Access to College Education Act of 2007\" introduces a deduction for qualified post-secondary educational expenses. The deduction allows individuals to deduct expenses paid for themselves and their spouse, limited to $13,150 per year based on income. The deduction for qualified post-secondary educational expenses is based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income, which is calculated as a ratio of the excess over $55,000 ($110,000 for joint returns) to $10,000 ($20,000 for joint returns). The term 'income' refers to the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, excluding amounts under specific sections. Qualified post-secondary educational expenses include tuition, room and board costs for eligible students attending an eligible educational institution, subject to certain limitations. Inflation adjustment for taxable years after 2007 increases dollar amounts in subsection (b) by cost-of-living adjustment. Rules similar to section 25A apply for this section. In subsection (b), dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000. A new deduction for post-secondary education costs is added to section 62(a) of the tax code. The table of sections is amended to reflect these changes. \"Section 224 introduces deductions for post-secondary education costs, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2006.\""
