    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fiscal Discipline, Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act.\" It includes reforms for the consideration of appropriations bills in the Senate. The \"Fiscal Discipline, Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act\" amends Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate to restrict the inclusion of new legislation or unauthorized appropriations in general appropriation bills. Unauthorized appropriations are not allowed in any amendments related to general appropriation bills. If a point of order is sustained, the unauthorized provisions are removed from the bill or amendment. The \"Fiscal Discipline, Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act\" amends Senate rules to remove unauthorized appropriations from general appropriation bills or amendments if a point of order is sustained. The total amounts appropriated are modified accordingly. The Senate amendment sustains unauthorized appropriations by striking them from the amendment, modifying total amounts appropriated accordingly, and proceeding to consider the amendment as modified. If a point of order against a House amendment is sustained, an amendment is deemed adopted that removes new or general legislation and unauthorized appropriations, adjusting total amounts if necessary. The Senate amendment sustains unauthorized appropriations by striking them from the amendment, modifying total amounts appropriated accordingly, and proceeding to consider the amendment as modified. A point of order under subparagraph (a) may be waived only by a motion agreed to by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn. The Presiding Officer's ruling on a point of order can be upheld unless three-fifths of Senators vote otherwise. A Senator can raise a point of order on multiple provisions in a bill, and the Presiding Officer can strike down some or all of them. Only the provisions ruled against will be removed. Before the Presiding Officer rules on a point of order, any Senator can move to waive it, which can be amended. After the ruling, any Senator can appeal it. The terms 'new or general legislation', 'new matter', and 'unauthorized appropriation' are defined in this context. The term 'unauthorized appropriation' refers to a 'congressionally directed spending item' that is not specifically authorized by law or exceeds the authorized amount. An unauthorized appropriation is not specifically authorized if it is restricted or directed to an identifiable person, program, project, entity, or jurisdiction in a way that applies only to a single entity, unless clearly identified in a law or Treaty stipulation. The conference report on a general appropriation bill cannot include new or general legislation, unauthorized appropriations, new matter, or nongermane matter. If a point of order is sustained, the offending items will be struck from the report and necessary adjustments to total appropriations will be made. When all other points of order have been addressed, the Senate will consider whether to recede from its amendment to the House bill or its disagreement with the House amendment. If the Senate agrees to the amendment, the bill and Senate amendment will be returned to the House. The Senate amendment will be returned to the House for its concurrence. A point of order under subparagraph (a) may be waived by a three-fifths vote of Senators. An appeal from the ruling of the Presiding Officer on a point of order requires a three-fifths vote to overturn. It is permissible for a Senator to raise a single point of order. A Senator can raise a point of order on provisions in a conference report. The Presiding Officer can sustain the point of order on some or all provisions. Only the provisions upheld by the Presiding Officer will be stricken. Senators can move to waive the point of order before a ruling is made. The motion to waive is amendable and subject to Senate rules. The Senate allows Senators to appeal the Presiding Officer's ruling on a point of order regarding provisions in a conference report. Amendments are permitted before a ruling is made. Conference reports must be searchable online according to an amendment to the Standing Rules of the Senate. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to require recipients of Federal funds to report payments made to lobbyists for lobbying activities related to the funds received."
