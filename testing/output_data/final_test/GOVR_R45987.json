    "content": "This report provides background on Department of Defense's legacy Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, reviews previous EHR modernization efforts, and describes DOD's process to acquire and implement a new EHR system known as MHS Genesis. Congress faces potential issues with oversight, governance, and monitoring of the program's cost and effectiveness. The report briefly mentions EHR modernization efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), as well as DOD's Joint Operational Medical Information System (JOMIS). DOD has developed and sustained electronic systems to document healthcare services for servicemembers, retirees, and their families. They are implementing a new EHR system called MHS Genesis, which will be integrated with other EHR systems used by the VA, USCG, and civilian healthcare providers. The Military Health System administers the TRICARE program, offering healthcare services to over 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide through DOD hospitals, clinics, and participating civilian providers. Providers in the Military Health System, including TRICARE providers, offer clinical services at 723 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide. Health care services are documented in various components of the DOD health record, such as the service treatment record (STR), nonservice treatment record (NSTR), and occupational health civilian employee treatment record (OHTR). DOD maintains multiple legacy EHR systems for providers to input, share, and archive necessary documentation. DOD has utilized electronic medical information systems since 1968 to automate and share patient data across its MTFs. Between 1976 and 1984, DOD invested $222 million in various health-care computer systems. Over the next three decades, DOD continued to invest in and implement electronic medical information systems for healthcare providers. DOD has invested in electronic medical information systems since 1968 to automate and share patient data across its MTFs. Efforts to increase interoperability with the VA's EHR systems began in 1998. MHS Genesis aims to replace legacy EHR systems like CHCS, which primarily functions as the outpatient component of the EHR. In March 1988, DOD awarded SAIC a contract to design, develop, deploy, and maintain CHCS, an integrated health care data system with a life-cycle cost of $2.8 billion. CHCS was facility-specific and accessing data across servers was time-consuming. In 1997, DOD began planning for CHCS II, a comprehensive, lifelong health care record system for servicemembers and beneficiaries. The program known as CHCS II, later renamed AHLTA, was intended to replace CHCS with deployment planned for 1999 but faced delays due to performance issues and changing requirements. The revised implementation plan set AHLTA deployment from July 2003 to September 2007. The GAO reported in 2010 that DOD's AHLTA life-cycle cost estimate through 2017 would be $3.8 billion. Essentris, a component of the current EHR, has been used in military hospitals since 1987, allowing providers to document clinical care. In 2009, DOD selected CliniComp to deploy Essentris at all military hospitals, completed in June 2011. DOD maintains a contract with CliniComp and LOUi Consulting Group for support and updates. CDS is DOD's electronic dental record system, allowing providers to document clinical information and perform administrative functions. The DOD implemented CDS as the electronic dental record system in Army, Navy, and Air Force dental clinics. A $30 million contract was awarded to Harris Corporation for sustaining CDS. Paper medical records are also part of DOD's health record, requiring scanning and archiving in HAIMS. The National Archives and Records Administration receives paper medical records, while other documents are disposed of locally. DOD legacy systems like RMS, HAIMS, and Medical Readiness Tracking Systems store and track administrative and clinical data. HAIMS incorporates health care data into a servicemember's official service treatment record accessible to the VA. Military departments use electronic systems like TMIP-J to document medical and dental readiness requirements. After Operation Desert Storm in 1991, concerns about interoperability between DOD and VA health record systems grew. Committees highlighted the need to standardize record-keeping, improve health data sharing, and develop a comprehensive medical system. This led to the development of electronic systems like TMIP-J, JLV, and ABACUS for health care documentation, patient movement, and debt collection. Between 1998 and 2009, DOD and VA established methods for exchanging patient health information, including the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE), Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE), and Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CHDR). These systems enable real-time, two-way data transmissions and comprehensive medical record sharing for servicemembers. In 2006, CHDR enables real-time, two-way data transmissions of pharmacy and drug allergy information to add to the patient's medical record. VLER, initiated in 2009, allows health information exchange between DOD, VA, and civilian providers. Congress mandated DOD and VA to establish interoperable EHR systems for data sharing across departments in 2008. The FY2008 NDAA directed the DOD and VA to develop electronic health record systems for interoperability and exchange of health care information. An interagency program office was established for rapid implementation of EHR systems by September 30, 2009, complying with interoperability standards. The FY2008 NDAA directed the DOD and VA to develop interoperable electronic health record systems. An interagency program office (IPO) was established to oversee this effort, with the Deputy Secretary of Defense delegating oversight authority to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The IPO Director and Deputy Director were appointed by the SECDEF and SECVA respectively. Congress mandated a joint report by DOD and VA on actions taken to achieve EMR interoperability. The IPO, under the direction of the SECDEF, established a mutual definition of interoperability as the ability of users to interpret shared information. They identified six areas of interoperability capabilities to meet Congress's requirements, including expanding Essentris implementation, demonstrating Partnership Gateways, enhancing sharing of social history, scanning medical documents into the DOD EHR, and providing health assessment data to the VA. In 2010, DOD and VA reported to Congress that all requirements for \"full\" interoperability were met. They continued to work on integrating their EHR systems through various initiatives. Three strategy options were considered for EHR modernization: develop a new joint EHR, upgrade existing legacy systems, or pursue separate solutions with data interoperability. In March 2011, SECDEF and SECVA agreed to develop an integrated electronic health record (iEHR) to replace existing systems. The iEHR initiative, planned to replace legacy systems, was overseen by the IPO and set to start by 2017. However, in 2013, DOD and VA decided to abandon the iEHR due to significant cost estimates and pursued other efforts to improve data interoperability. Congress expressed its concerns about this change in strategy. In 2013, Congress criticized DOD and VA for failing to implement seamless electronic sharing of medical data. A new deadline was set for both departments to deploy an interoperable EHR by December 31, 2016. DOD conducted a 30-day review of the iEHR program to determine the best approach in response to Congress's mandate. DOD conducted a 30-day review of the iEHR program to determine the best approach for EHR modernization. Two options were identified: adopting VistA or acquiring a commercial EHR system. The Secretary of Defense directed a full and open competition for EHR modernization capabilities. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment is responsible for milestone decision authority and health records interoperability. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD[P&R]) is the lead coordinator for DOD health care interactions with the VA. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD[HA]) is responsible for the functional capabilities of the EHR. MHS Genesis is a designated Defense Business System (DBS) requiring decision reviews and milestones. The Defense Healthcare Management Systems Modernization Program Management Office (DHMSM PMO) oversaw EHR requirements development and acquisition strategy from June 2013 to June 2014. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) established working groups to develop requirements for a new EHR, aligning with DOD's principles. Approximately 60 capabilities were identified, and draft RFPs were published for contractor review and feedback. DHMSM PMO oversaw the process from June 2013 to June 2014. Between June 2014 and August 2014, DOD leaders certified acquisition milestones, allowing the solicitation process to proceed. The official solicitation for proposals was issued on August 25, 2014, with the period concluding on October 9, 2014. The source selection process took place in October. The source selection process for the MHS Genesis contract took place from October 2014 to July 2015. DOD received five proposals from partnered vendors including Allscripts, Computer Sciences Corporation, IBM, Epic Systems, Cerner, Leidos, Accenture Federal, PricewaterhouseCoopers, General Dynamics, DSS, Inc., MedSphere, and InterSystems. DOD experts reviewed and applied evaluation criteria to each proposal, leading to the award of the contract to Leidos Partnership for Defense Health on July 29, 2015. The contract for MHS Genesis was awarded to Leidos Partnership for Defense Health to replace legacy EHR systems with a COTS system. The initial award ceiling was $4.3 billion, later increased to over $5.5 billion to incorporate the US Coast Guard and establish a common EHR baseline with the VA. Leidos leads LPDH with core partners Accenture Federal Services and Cerner. Leidos Partnership for Defense Health (LPDH) was awarded a contract worth over $5.5 billion to unify and increase accessibility of integrated healthcare delivery for DoD beneficiaries and MHS personnel globally. The partnership includes core partners Accenture Federal Services, Cerner, and Henry Schein One, along with over 34 businesses through sub-contracts. The contract aims to enable standardized workflows, integrated healthcare delivery, and secure electronic exchange of medical data between DoD and external partners. The Leidos Partnership for Defense Health (LPDH) was awarded a $5.5 billion contract to improve healthcare delivery for DoD beneficiaries and MHS personnel globally. The contract includes over 95 specific capability requirements for MHS Genesis across four concepts of operations. The Secretary of Defense is ultimately accountable for MHS Genesis, with various DOD entities overseeing its implementation and sustainment. PEO DHMS, established in 2013, aims to transform healthcare delivery through MHS Genesis. It oversees three PMOs for modernizing DOD's EHR system and ensuring interoperability with the VA. DHMSM PMO deploys MHS Genesis, IPO implements health data standards, and JOMIS PMO develops and sustains the system. The Defense Health Management Systems (DHMS) Program Management Office (PMO) develops, deploys, and sustains MHS Genesis and other integrated operational medicine information systems for deployed forces. The DHA, established in 2013, manages the TRICARE program, executes appropriations for the Defense Health Program, coordinates management of multi-service health care markets, and supports DOD's medical mission. DHA is designated to administer and manage all MTFs and leads MHS Genesis requirements development in coordination with military service medical departments. The military medical departments, led by Surgeon Generals, organize, train, and equip medical personnel, maintain readiness, and provide healthcare in MTFs. The Army Medical Command, Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, and Air Force Medical Service offer expertise and support to the DHMSM PMO. The SSG and CSB oversee health-related acquisition programs within PEO DHMS, chaired by the USD(A&S) for updates on acquisitions. The CSB, chaired by the USD(A&S), oversees DHMS acquisition programs and ensures adherence to DOD's EHR guiding principles. The ESB, led by the DHA's Chief Health Informatics Officer, considers changes to standardized processes for MHS Genesis. The OCHIO represents the \"voice of the customer\" to PEO DHMS. The OCHIO serves as the liaison between end-users and PEO DHMS, gathering input and recommendations from the ESB. It manages change, early adoption, workflow standardization, and configuration changes for MHS Genesis. DOD is implementing MHS Genesis in phases, starting with IOC sites in 2017 and planning deployment to over 600 facilities in 23 waves. The goal is full operational capability at all MTFs. DOD aims for full operational capability of MHS Genesis at all MTFs by the end of 2024. Pre-deployment activities included systems engineering, integration, and testing. Initial requirements involved contractor site visits, gap analyses, infrastructure development, interoperability testing, and delivering various plans to the government. The DOD conducted pre-deployment activities for MHS Genesis, including delivering various plans to the government and testing in approved labs. The DOD Inspector General found that the system requirements and acquisition strategy were properly approved and documented. The DOD Inspector General raised concerns about the execution schedule of the MHS Genesis program, recommending a schedule analysis to ensure achievement of Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by December 2016. The PEO DHMS expressed confidence in meeting the deadline and selected MTFs in the Pacific Northwest as IOC sites. Fairchild Air Force Base was the first site to transition to MHS Genesis on February 9, 2017 for observation and evaluation before full deployment. The DOD used various evaluation methods to assess the success of MHS Genesis at the IOC sites, including HIMSS EMRAM and DOD IOT&E. These assessments informed PEO DHMS's decision on further deployments. EMRAM tools measure adoption of EMR systems in healthcare organizations, with scores ranging from Stage 0 to Stage 7. The DOD assessed the adoption of EMR systems at IOC sites using EMRAM tools, with scores ranging from Stage 0 to Stage 7. After transitioning to MHS Genesis, the IOC sites showed increased EMRAM scores, with Fairchild Air Force Base scoring 6.13 on the O-EMRAM. The IOC sites scored higher than the national average for EMRAM and O-EMRAM compared to U.S. civilian hospitals. Reports on EMRAM scoring trends at the end of 2017 show that 66.7% of U.S. hospitals reached Stage 5 or Stage 6. DOD policy requires DBS programs to undergo an IOT&E for effectiveness. JITC conducted IOT&E at IOC sites between September and December 2017, except for MAMC, which was postponed to 2018. Initial cybersecurity testing and interoperability evaluations were conducted at each site. The JITC conducted cybersecurity testing, evaluated interoperability data, observed MTF staff using MHS Genesis, and administered user surveys. DOT&E reviewed the findings and assessed MHS Genesis capabilities, interfaces, usability, and effectiveness. The report concluded that MHS Genesis was not operationally effective or suitable, lacking functionality for patient care tasks. The report found that users only successfully performed 56 percent of patient care tasks in MHS Genesis. The system was deemed not operationally suitable due to poor usability, insufficient training, and inadequate help desk support. Cybersecurity testing is ongoing, and recommendations were made to delay further deployment until deficiencies are corrected. Additional recommendations included fixing incident reports, improving training and documentation, and increasing Adoption Coaches. The report recommended increasing Adoption Coaches on site until users are comfortable with new processes, completing cybersecurity testing, improving interoperability, monitoring reliability, and conducting operational testing at MAMC and the next fielding site. On November 30, 2018, DOT&E issued a final IOT&E report incorporating results from delayed testing at MAMC. The final IOT&E report on MHS Genesis highlighted ongoing issues with incident reports, staff training, change management, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Despite these findings, the DOD Chief Information Officer issued a conditional Authorization to Operate for 12 months. PEO DHMS concurred with DOT&E's recommendation for a follow-on operational test and evaluation at the next fielding to evaluate corrective actions and revised training. DOD has documented numerous issues requiring mitigation strategies prior to deploying the first wave of MHS Genesis. Users encountering system inconsistencies, technical errors, or clinical inaccuracies must submit a \"trouble ticket\" to a global service center. The Global Service Center (GSC) reviews and assigns technical trouble tickets for resolution to LDPH or its sub-contractors. DHMSM PMO or DHA handle trouble tickets related to functional capabilities. In April 2018, 1,000 out of 7,000 trouble tickets were resolved, with 3,607 open tickets remaining in December 2018. As of October 14, 2019, there were 3,238 open trouble tickets from the IOC sites. As of October 14, 2019, PEO DHMS estimated 3,238 open trouble tickets from the IOC sites and 787 open trouble tickets from the first wave sites remained for resolution. MHS Genesis users at IOC sites expressed concerns about the lengthy and opaque issue resolution process, including delays in ticket resolution and lack of notification about implemented solutions. Unlike legacy systems, MHS Genesis requires DHA-led working groups and DHMSM PMO approval for technical or functional changes before implementation. Users reported inadequate initial training provided by LPDH before the implementation of MHS Genesis. Training focused on navigating modules and features, lacking in clinical or administrative workflows. Different user roles had varying course curricula, leading to a lack of comprehensive understanding before system go-live. Users reported inadequate initial training provided by LPDH before the implementation of MHS Genesis, lacking in clinical or administrative workflows. They were not trained on accessing modules outside of primary care settings, leading to the development of local work-around tools to track military medical and dental readiness requirements. Dental data in MHS Genesis was not available for data-mining in legacy systems, requiring manual maintenance of dental readiness reports at each IOC site. The Department of Defense (DOD) reviewed dental data in Dentrix and CDS systems, noting lessons learned and improvements during MHS Genesis deployment. The first wave started in September 2019, with 18-month phases including pre-deployment planning, deployment activities, and post go-live activities. Waves will continue every three months at designated MTFs until 2024. Congress has been monitoring DOD's efforts to modernize its EHR systems since the mid-1980s. Currently, 12 congressional committees oversee the EHR modernization efforts in DOD, VA, and USCG. These committees include the House Appropriations Committee, House Armed Services Committee, House Committee on Oversight and Reform, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House Veterans Affairs Committee, Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs established the Subcommittee on Technology Modernization to oversee the EHR Modernization program at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congressional oversight hearings on DOD's EHR modernization effort have not been held since the initial deployment of MHS Genesis. A coordinated oversight strategy may be necessary due to the complexity and size of DOD's EHR modernization effort, as well as parallel efforts by the USCG and VA. The Subcommittee on Technology Modernization oversees the EHR Modernization program at the Department of Veterans Affairs. DOD and VA officials testified before the subcommittee in June 2019. A joint statement by former SECDEF James Mattis and current SECVA Robert Wilkie outlined a commitment to implementing a single, integrated EHR system for sharing health data. DOD announced plans to re-charter the IPO into the \"Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM)\" program office for oversight on EHR modernization efforts. The DOD announced the creation of the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) program office to oversee the implementation of a single EHR system across DOD, VA, and USCG sites. Congress may review the need for additional authorities, funding, or changes to current law to sustain the FEHRM program office. This initiative is considered the largest EHR undertaking in the country, aiming to achieve economies of scale and standardization across federal departments. The DOD and VA aim to achieve economies of scale and standardization through the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) program. Congress may need to assess the acquisition challenges and limited competition in procuring and sustaining the MHS Genesis and VA's new EHR system. The DOD awarded a sole source contract modification to LPDH for additional requirements in the MHS Genesis procurement, citing potential redundancies and inefficiencies. The estimated value of the additional requirements was over $1.2 billion. DOD plans for competitive follow-on contracts to sustain the EHR solution in the future, but Cerner declined their request. Cerner declined DOD's request to negotiate intellectual property rights for MHS Genesis, potentially limiting future EHR vendor options for sustainment contracts. The visit to various medical facilities aimed to review milestones, achievements, and challenges of MHS Genesis implementation. Focus groups were conducted at each site with different staff members to understand the implementation and improvement processes. During site visits, CRS conducted focus groups with various staff members to discuss challenges and mitigation strategies related to MHS Genesis implementation. Themes and responses were documented regarding impact on force readiness, access to care, quality of care, cost of care, and patient experience. Additionally, a deployment schedule and a joint commitment statement between DOD and VA were provided. During a congressional staff delegation visit to DOD facilities in Washington State, analysts from CRS reviewed milestones, achievements, and challenges of MHS Genesis implementation. Focus groups were conducted at Madigan Army Medical Center with various staff members to understand the implementation and improvement processes. During the congressional staff delegation visit to DOD facilities in Washington State, CRS conducted focus groups at different medical facilities to gather feedback on MHS Genesis implementation challenges and mitigation strategies. The focus groups included health care providers, nurses, enlisted personnel, and patient administration representatives. CRS provided questions for discussion and documented responses regarding challenges faced, local mitigation efforts, and the impact on force readiness, access to care, quality of care, and cost. The challenges faced during the implementation of MHS Genesis have impacted force readiness, access to care, quality of care, cost of care, and patient experience."
