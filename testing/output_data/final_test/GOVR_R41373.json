    "content": "The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the President to notify Congress of proposed rescissions, which must be approved within 45 days of continuous session. Enhanced rescission, introduced in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President in the rescission process. The enhanced rescission framework gives the President the authority to permanently cancel spending reductions unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission allows for congressional consideration and an up-or-down vote on the President's proposals, with approval from both houses required to make the rescission permanent. The expedited rescission approach allows for prompt approval of the President's spending cuts by Congress through fast-track procedures, encouraging an up-or-down vote on the proposal. This method has garnered support for transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other approaches. In recent years, bills like the Legislative Line Item Veto Act have been passed in the House, showing ongoing interest in expedited rescission. Carper and 21 other cosponsors introduced S. 102, the Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2011, which allows the President to propose spending cuts within 45 days of a bill becoming law. Congressman Van Hollen introduced a similar bill, H.R. 1043, with slight differences. These measures aim to expedite the process for considering rescission requests from the President. President Obama endorsed proposals for reforming the budget process, including an expedited process for considering rescission requests in his FY2012 budget submission to Congress. The proposal provides the President with limited powers to work with Congress to eliminate unnecessary funding. The Senate Subcommittee held a hearing on enhancing the President's authority to eliminate wasteful spending and reduce the budget deficit. Witnesses discussed possible issues for Congress regarding expedited rescission authority, emphasizing modest budgetary savings but potential help in deficit reduction efforts. Senator Carper and witnesses discussed the potential benefits of expedited rescission authority for the President in reducing the budget deficit. They agreed that while it is not a cure-all, it could be a useful tool to increase congressional accountability and deter unnecessary spending. There was consensus that this authority would not face the same constitutional issues as the Line Item Veto Act. Senator Carl Levin disagreed with the assessment that expedited rescission authority for the President would not enhance executive power. He argued that it would give the President more power to advance rescission proposals, especially in the Senate. Levin believed that the procedural restrictions in S. 102, such as mandating an up-or-down vote on a rescission package without amendments or motions to table, would unfairly advantage the Administration's proposals. The Congressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act was reintroduced in the 111th Congress, with Senators Feingold and McCain cosponsoring S. 524 in the Senate. In the 111th Congress, various bills were introduced related to budget enforcement and wasteful spending. Senator Gregg and Senator Lieberman introduced S. 640, similar to a bill from the 109th Congress. Senator Carper introduced S. 907, the \"Budget Enforcement Legislative Tool Act of 2009.\" Hearings were held on bills S. 524, S. 640, and S. 907 in different Senate subcommittees. The Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on the legality and efficacy of Line-Item Veto Proposals on May 25, 2010. President Obama transmitted a draft bill for expedited rescission procedures to Congress on May 24, 2010. The proposal would allow the President to submit rescissions for reducing discretionary appropriations within 45 days of signing a bill into law. The measures in the bill provide for expedited procedures in Congress for certain proposed rescissions from the President. H.R. 5454 and S. 3474 were introduced in response to the Administration's proposal. Hearings in the Senate showed varying levels of support for expedited rescission proposals. The House Budget Committee held a hearing on the \"Administration's Expedited Rescission Proposal\" with the Acting Deputy Director of OMB as the sole witness. Members had differing opinions on the expedited rescission bills, with some opposing the approach and others supporting it. The proposal received a mixed response from lawmakers, with some concerned about preserving Congress's spending powers. The OMB witness expressed optimism about bipartisan support for the Administration's proposal on expedited rescission. Representative Spratt, a longtime supporter of the approach, raised concerns during the Budget Committee hearing, including the length of the executive branch review period. Dr. Liebman highlighted OMB's worries about a potential omnibus bill passing in mid-December and the time constraints for the President's budget submission to Congress in early February. The OMB expressed optimism for bipartisan support on expedited rescission. Representative Spratt raised concerns about the executive branch review period and expressed pleasure with cosponsors of H.R. 5454. Other bills in the 111th Congress also proposed expedited rescission procedures. In the 111th Congress, various budget process reforms were proposed, including expedited rescission measures. Several bills were introduced but none received further action. The Obama Administration's bill, introduced in the 112th Congress, also included modifications affecting the deadline for special rescission messages by the President. The President can propose rescinding funding in appropriations acts by submitting a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available to executive agencies. Proposed bills aim to expedite the process by amending the Impoundment Control Act. S. 524 would have made extensive amendments to the Impoundment Control Act by replacing and eliminating certain sections in Title X. S. 524 proposed amendments to the Impoundment Control Act, including sections for message transmission and review of rescission actions. Deletion of key sections may have reduced transparency in the rescission process. S. 640 would have retained certain parts and added expedited rescission procedures. S. 524 proposed amendments to the Impoundment Control Act, including message transmission and review of rescission actions. S. 640 would have added expedited rescission procedures, while S. 907 and S. 3474 would have provided new expedited rescission authority in addition to existing provisions. The bills differed in the scope of new authority granted to the President. The proposed rescission of congressional earmarks and cancellation of tax benefits were outlined in S. 907 and S. 640, granting the President authority to rescind discretionary budget authority and certain limited tax benefits. The new expedited rescission authority in S. 640 covered discretionary budget authority, tax benefits, and new items of direct spending. The proposed deadlines for the President to submit special rescission or cancellation messages varied significantly among different measures. S. 907 allowed 3 days, S. 524 allowed 30 days, S. 3474 allowed 45 days, and S. 640 allowed one year. H.R. 1043 and S. 102 differed in deadlines, with H.R. 1043 retaining the original 30-day deadline and S. 102 proposing a 45-day deadline. Limits on the number of special messages permitted by the President also varied, with S. 524 allowing one special message per regular act and two for an omnibus budget reconciliation or appropriation measure, while S. 102 allowed one special message per regular act. The proposed deadlines for the President to submit special rescission or cancellation messages varied significantly among different measures. S. 907 allowed 3 days, S. 524 allowed 30 days, S. 3474 allowed 45 days, and S. 640 allowed one year. H.R. 1043 and S. 102 differed in deadlines, with H.R. 1043 retaining the original 30-day deadline and S. 102 proposing a 45-day deadline. Limits on the number of special messages permitted by the President also varied, with S. 524 allowing one special message per regular act and two for an omnibus budget reconciliation or appropriation measure, while S. 102 allowed one special message per regular act. Some provisions were unique to one measure, as depicted in Table 1. For example, only S. 524 contained a sense of the Congress provision regarding abuse of the proposed cancellation authority by the President or other executive branch official. The proposed cancellation authority by the President or other executive branch official vis-a-vis a Member of Congress paralleled language in the House-passed version of expedited rescission in the 109th Congress. Provisions in various bills stipulated that any amounts rescinded or cancelled would be dedicated to reducing the deficit or increasing a surplus. H.R. 1043 specified that funds rescinded under parts B or C would revert back to the original fund. All bills mandated expedited procedures for rescission. The bills mandated expedited procedures for rescission for deficit reduction. The Administration bill (S. 102 / H.R. 1043) had three differences from other fast-track procedures, including omitting rescissions not eligible for fast-track, and allowing Members to raise points of order during floor consideration. The House and Senate introduced bills for expedited procedures for rescission for deficit reduction. The bills included innovations such as allowing points of order to be raised against rescissions containing impermissible matter. The President's authority to withhold funds proposed for rescission was addressed in the measures, with varying time limits for withholding. The bills introduced for expedited rescission procedures for deficit reduction included innovations like allowing points of order against impermissible rescissions. The President's authority to withhold funds proposed for rescission was addressed with varying time limits, with S. 907 requiring funds to be released the day after defeat of the approval measure. The bills introduced expedited rescission procedures with sunset provisions. Authority in S. 640 would expire in 2010, S. 907 in 2012, and S. 524 in 2014. The expedited rescission authority in the 112th Congress bills would continue until 2014. Considerations include budgetary savings and effects on legislative and executive branches. Central issue is the impact on federal budget process and deficit reduction. The potential impact of the new device on the federal budget process and deficit reduction is relatively small compared to the line item veto. President Reagan would have eliminated $1.540 billion in appropriations, programs, and loan assets in FY1988 with the item veto authority. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1998. President Clinton issued 82 cancellations under the LIVA in FY1997. President Clinton's cancellations under the Line Item Veto Act (LIVA) in FY1998 amounted to about $355 million out of a total budget of $1.7 trillion. The Supreme Court overturned the LIVA in June 1998, leaving 43 of the original 82 cancellations in effect. The net budgetary effect for FY1998 was $325 million, with total savings estimated over a five-year period. President Clinton's cancellations under the Line Item Veto Act in FY1998 totaled $355 million out of a $1.7 trillion budget. The Supreme Court overturned the LIVA in June 1998, leaving 43 cancellations in effect. The net budgetary effect for FY1998 was $325 million, with total savings estimated over a five-year period to be less than $600 million. From FY1974-FY2008, Presidents proposed around 1200 rescissions totaling over $76 billion, with Congress approving roughly a third ($25 billion). Supporters of expedited rescission bills acknowledge that it would not be a cure-all for deficit reduction. Representative Spratt supports the \"Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act\" and expedited rescission as a tool for fiscal discipline. Citizens Against Government Waste emphasizes the need to limit entitlement growth. Expedited rescission focuses on discretionary spending and should not be delayed. The potential impact of expedited rescission authority for the President includes a \"deterrent effect\" to discourage unnecessary spending. Representative Paul Ryan and OMB's Acting Deputy Director, Jeffrey Liebman, highlight the power of embarrassment and transparency in deterring policymakers from enacting such spending. Liebman stated that the existence of expedited rescission procedures may prevent unnecessary spending in the first place. The line item veto is seen as a powerful tool for fiscal discipline, with evidence suggesting it can save money, especially during economic stress. For example, in Missouri during FY2007, Governor Nixon used the veto 50 times, impacting the budget by about $105 million on a revenue base of $8 billion. Governors believe the mere threat of the veto is effective in preventing wasteful spending. The line item veto is a powerful tool for fiscal discipline, used more in good economic times when the governor opposes underlying policies or during hard fiscal times to eliminate low priority items. Earmark disclosure has led to decreased Member-only earmarks since FY2008, with both the House and Senate establishing transparency procedures in 2007. The impact of earmark disclosure depends on the scope of the deterrent effect. The availability of expedited rescission authority to the President might encourage lawmakers to add more specified projects than is ordinarily the case. Instead of Congress placing needed constraints on projects and earmarks, lawmakers could shift more of that task to the President, by anticipating that some of the less justified congressional add-ons would be included in a rescission package that might be approved by Congress under the expedited procedures. Some are skeptical about potential budgetary savings from expedited rescission procedures, as the process would become part of House and Senate rules. Concerns arise about the implementation of expedited rescission procedures and whether the intended outcome of an up or down vote on eligible rescission requests from the President will actually occur. Chamber rules carry over from one Congress to the next, but some rules may need approval by each Congress to continue. Rules of the House and Senate are enforced by Members through motions, although they lack the force of law. The chamber rules, although not legally binding, have a significant impact on congressional deliberations. The congressional budget resolution, based on these rules, plays a central role in the budget process by establishing priorities and parameters for budgetary actions. Despite missed deadlines, Congress has adopted a budget resolution in almost every year since 1974. The potential savings from expedited rescission procedures depend on the coverage granted to the President. The Administration bill would apply to new spending and obligation limits, excluding entitlement law. Some suggest expanding the President's authority to cover entitlement spending and limited tax benefits. Discretionary spending for FY2011 is $1.5 trillion, while mandatory programs total $2.1 trillion. The 10 largest tax benefits for FY2011 are projected at $642.7 billion. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 applied to new items of direct spending and targeted tax benefits with 100 or fewer beneficiaries. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4890 narrowed the definition of a targeted tax benefit to a revenue-losing measure affecting a single beneficiary. Supporters suggested treating targeted tax benefits comparably to earmarks in appropriations. In 2006, critics argued that the new definition of targeted tax benefits was too narrow and would not lead to many cancellations. The Acting Deputy Director of OMB stated in a House hearing in June 2010 that bringing entitlement spending under the Administration bill would be challenging due to the complex nature of these provisions. Dr. Liebman mentioned that subjecting limited tax benefits to expedited rescission would be even more difficult due to interactions with other parts of the revenue code. Revisiting the definitions in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 for \"new item of direct spending\" and \"targeted tax benefits\" could be considered for an expedited rescission measure. In 2006, critics argued that the new definition of targeted tax benefits was too narrow and would not lead to many cancellations.

Revisiting the definitions in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 for \"new item of direct spending\" and \"targeted tax benefits\" could be considered for an expedited rescission measure. Some have suggested that expedited rescission authority could potentially increase spending under certain circumstances, as an Administration might agree not to include particular programs in a rescission package subject to expedited procedures if a Member of Congress agreed to support a spending program initiated by the President. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act violated the Presentment Clause in the Constitution. Witnesses in the 111th Congress agreed that proposed expedited rescission measures would avoid similar constitutional issues. Todd Tatelman testified that these proposals would be consistent with Article I, \u00a77 and not susceptible to the same constitutional analysis as the Line Item Veto Act. Mr. Tatelman stated that expedited rescission measures, such as S. 102, appear to avoid constitutional issues similar to the Line Item Veto Act. However, there are still concerns about binding future congresses and potential violations of the separation of powers doctrine. In a Senate Subcommittee hearing, Chairman Feingold emphasized the importance of creating constitutional budget tools. The Administration's expedited rescission proposal in the FY2012 budget was deemed different from the Line Item Veto Act, as it allows Congress to change its rules for considering rescission packages. Concerns were raised about the measure's constitutionality and its potential impact on the separation of powers doctrine. The judiciary is not meant to protect legislative interests, lawmakers must defend the Constitution. Senator Levin expressed concerns about S. 102 potentially ceding Congress's power to the President. Some worry about the impact of granting special rescission authority. Some suggest that granting special rescission authority to the President may prioritize the President's spending over Congress's priorities, as seen in state studies favoring executive over legislative priorities. Testimony at congressional hearings, such as in 1995, indicated that the item veto may not save much but could give preference to presidential spending. In summary, the item veto authority has been used by Presidents to advance their own spending priorities over those of the legislatures. Despite some instances of Congress reasserting its priorities, the rescission process has often been utilized by Presidents to direct resources towards their own agendas. President George H.W. Bush submitted numerous rescission requests in anticipation of the upcoming elections, targeting Democratic-controlled Congress with accusations of prioritizing \"pork\" projects over reducing the budget deficit. Over $7.9 billion in rescissions were requested in the first four months of 1992, with a focus on cutting over $7 billion from Defense Department programs, including weapons projects and budget additions by Congress. In response to President Bush's rescission requests, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees devised alternative packages, accepting some cuts and rejecting others. A $8.2 billion package of rescissions was signed into law on June 4, 1992 (P.L. 102-298), with only about $1.7 billion coming from programs the Administration wanted to rescind. The law approved less than $2.1 billion of the President's requests but added over $6 billion in congressionally initiated cuts. President Clinton sought to cancel 38 projects in the military construction bill, estimating that this would save $290 million over a five-year period. He identified three criteria that guided the selections: the Defense Department concluded that the projects were not a priority at the time, they did not make an immediate contribution to the military service, and they would not have been built in FY1998 in any event. President Clinton sought to cancel 38 military construction projects to save $290 million over five years. The Senate and House disapproved the cancellations, leading to a veto by President Clinton that was overridden by a strong bipartisan majority. Critics argue that spending priorities should be established through the regular legislative process. Expedited rescission allows the President to change federal spending priorities by compiling a list of projects to be rescinded, shifting power from Congress to the executive branch. Senator Levin also expressed concerns about this authority favoring presidential spending preferences over congressional funding priorities. Congress has initiated numerous rescission actions totaling billions of dollars from FY1974-FY2008, despite the availability of special rescission bills under the ICA. The issue of needing objective criteria for reviewing enacted appropriations measures for rescission packages was discussed during a 2010 House Budget Committee hearing. Some Members questioned the implication that the executive branch knows how to spend federal money better than Congress, highlighting the debate over \"unnecessary spending\" and the difference between presidential and congressional earmarks. At a 2010 House Budget Committee hearing, Members discussed the need for statutory guidelines to reduce subjectivity in determining \"unnecessary\" spending. The OMB spokesman acknowledged concerns and promised to consider remedies. Some Members suggested submitting rescission requests under the Impoundment Control Act framework to signal the need to reduce spending. Data shows that Congress approved 39% of presidential rescission proposals and 33% of the total budget authority in requested rescissions. Dr. Liebman from OMB decided to focus on spending cuts and terminations in the President's FY2011 budget submission instead of submitting a rescission package under the ICA authority. OMB's position suggested that current procedures for rescission requests are often ignored. The issue of spending priorities and separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches was also discussed. The expedited rescission measures in the 111th and 112th Congresses were deemed constitutionally sound, but concerns remained about political separation of powers. Bipartisan support and opposition existed, with lawmakers divided over Congress' 'power of the purse' versus addressing the budget deficit. Appropriations committee leaders were vocal critics, aiming to protect Congress' spending authority from potential executive branch encroachment. House Appropriations Chairman Jerry Lewis and ranking member Representative David Obey were vocal critics of granting the President expanded rescission authority, expressing concerns about shifting power to the White House and potential errors in transferring authority from the legislative branch. Lewis testified that the expedited rescission proposal could be a serious error, while Obey emphasized Congress's role in addressing spending and government issues. In a debate, Representative David Obey argued that Congress's power of the purse is crucial and should not be diminished by granting the President expanded rescission authority. Senator Robert Byrd opposed expedited rescission in the Senate, warning against weakening the legislative body's ability to oversee spending. The expedited rescission measure faced opposition in the Senate in 2006, with concerns raised about Congress' constitutional power of the purse. Advocates of the measure emphasized that it would not diminish Congress' role in federal spending decisions. Senator Feingold supported a line-item veto in 2010, stating it could help solve budgetary problems while respecting Congress' central role. The Obama Administration also supported the measure during a Senate hearing in 2010. The Obama Administration's proposal in 2010 aimed to provide the President with limited powers to eliminate unnecessary spending, including earmarks, while preserving the constitutional balance of power between the President and Congress. The proposal allowed Congress to change its rules for considering rescission packages proposed by the President through fast-track procedures. The Obama Administration's proposal in 2010 aimed to give the President limited powers to cut unnecessary spending without expanding veto authority. An article in the New York Times highlighted Peter Orszag's role in shifting decision-making power from Congress to the White House, signaling a change in the balance of power between branches of government. Orszag supported the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Some opponents argue that expedited rescission measures would weaken Congress and make it more subservient to presidential power. The introduction of such bills could signal a lack of trust in Congress as a fiscal guardian, boosting the President's stature at Congress's expense. If Congress approves a President's rescission package, it could suggest that the President has more influence over fiscal matters. The President's rescission package could lead to a shift of power from Congress to the executive branch, potentially changing behavior in unpredictable ways. Congressional approval of the package may indicate the President's influence over fiscal matters. Consideration of rescission proposals could decrease Congressional leaders' control over the legislative process by prioritizing the President's requests. GAO testimony in 2009 raised logistical concerns about fixed time frames for voting on rescission bills, noting that it could limit congressional review and cede control to the President. Senator Levin highlighted potential scheduling and procedural issues with the three-day period for committee consideration of a President's rescission package in S. 102. Advocates of expedited rescission highlighted existing fast-track provisions as not threatening congressional prerogatives. Dr. Liebman from OMB suggested that Congress could change its rules to prevent abuse of expedited rescission authority by the President. OMB's analysis in May 2010 stated that there is no absolute guarantee of a floor for spending cuts. The draft in May of 2010 highlighted the lack of a guaranteed floor vote on the President's rescission package. Sunset provisions in prior expedited rescission measures would safeguard congressional prerogatives by setting a deadline for action. The newly granted expedited rescission authority would expire without congressional extension. Despite notable attention in the 111th Congress, expedited rescission proposals did not progress further. The Obama Administration has endorsed expedited rescission procedures in the budget for FY2012 and urged Congress to enact the proposal. It is uncertain if the Administration will actively promote the measure in the 112th Congress or if it will be reported favorably from committee. The expedited rescission measure was discussed in the 112th Congress, with Senator Carper suggesting it could be offered as an amendment to important bills. The impact of providing the President with expedited rescission authority on reducing unnecessary spending and the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches in the budget process remains uncertain."
