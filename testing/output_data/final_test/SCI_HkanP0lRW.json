    "content": "The high dimensionality of hyperspectral imaging presents challenges in scope, size, and processing requirements. Using deep learning techniques, a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 dataset was examined to classify cells grown in different conditions and generate a mask segmenting the cells. A data-driven feature selection method reduced input features by 90% with minimal accuracy loss. Hyperspectral imaging allows high-content views of pigments and proteins in individual cells within larger populations, advancing in speed and ease of use. The advancement in technology has made it practical to use high-throughput screening and understand cell responses to environmental changes by identifying cells based on their fluorescence emission. Deep learning algorithms are now being used to classify individual cyanobacterial cells using hyperspectral imaging. Deep learning methods are being used to classify individual cells based on hyperspectral fluorescence emission signatures. This technique can help identify useful spectral wavelengths for classification and customize sensors for specific applications. This work demonstrates the suitability of deep learning methods for real-time image analysis and high-throughput screening of cyanobacterial cells. The method can be extended to other cell populations or complex tissues. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown in different conditions for imaging studies. Imaging studies were conducted on cyanobacterial cells using hyperspectral confocal fluorescence microscopy. The cells were placed on an agar-coated slide, coverslipped, and sealed with nail polish before imaging. Spectra from each pixel were acquired using a custom microscope with laser excitation. Preprocessing steps were performed to correct for detector spikes and generate cell masks. To identify pigments related to nitrogen response, multivariate curve resolution analysis was done on hyperspectral images. Image classification was performed on individual pixels and whole images, using training data from the 24hr timepoint. Traces and masks were divided into pixels for dataset creation, resulting in 44k 512-dimensional vectors per trace. The dataset contains 44k 512-dimensional vectors per trace with ground truth masks for background, N+ cells, and N- cells. Random undersampling was done to create a balanced dataset for training, validation, and testing. Data augmentation techniques were used to generate 9,000 48x48 pixel chips for cell masking and classification. About 90% of the chips contained non-trivial masks, with a portion reserved for validation. Additional chips were created from the 48hr dataset for testing. Pixels from experimental images were classified into Background (BG), Cell Grown in Nitrogen Containing Culture (N + ), or Cell Grown in Nitrogen Deplete Culture (N -) using a densely connected neural network with hyperparameter optimization. A comparative baseline was also performed using random forests. The network guided an iterative sparse feature sampling algorithm. The approach involves a data-driven sparse feature sampling algorithm that analyzes synaptic weights of a neural network. It includes four steps and a parameter \u03c4 for re-training. The initial classifier neural network is trained on all input features \u2126 0, with adjustments for a shrinking input size and using an adadelta optimizer. The algorithm computes \u03b3(x j ) = |w i | to determine feature 'worthiness' and removes the dimension with the minimum \u03b3(x j ) to form \u2126 k+1 for validation accuracy evaluation without retraining. The approach involves using neural networks for cell masking and classification tasks. A convolutional neural network is utilized for generating image masks highlighting different cell types. The network architecture includes downsampling and upsampling layers with 3x3 filters and rectified linear activation functions. Mean squared error is used as the loss function, and training is done with an adadelta optimizer. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using the hyperas package. The study utilized a convolutional neural network for cell masking and classification tasks. Training was done on an Nvidia DGX-1 node with dual 20-core Intel Xeon CPUs and eight Nvidia Tesla P-100 GPUs. The task involved classifying pixels into Background, N + , or N - categories. Per-pixel classification was chosen to increase training samples and simplify network architecture, allowing for spectral analysis without spatial information interference. The study used a convolutional neural network for cell masking and classification tasks, achieving 98.9% accuracy. Errors mainly occurred in misclassifying BG-labeled pixels, possibly due to expert-generated ground truth masks excluding some cells. Error between N + and N - pixels could be due to algorithm error. The study utilized a feed-forward neural network for cell classification tasks, with a focus on interpreting layer one weights for pruning. Hyperspectral imaging offers the advantage of sampling various wavelengths but comes with time and resource costs. Reducing the spectral frequencies could still allow for effective classification in applications. The study aimed to identify a reduced set of spectral frequencies for application purposes using a neural network approach. By down-selecting spectral features, they were able to achieve effective classification with fewer input dimensions, showing that around 90% of the sampled frequencies were not necessary for classification. The study found that around 90% of sampled frequencies were not necessary for effective classification using a neural network approach. Removing less important dimensions did not significantly impact performance, but removing more influential input channels required retraining the network. The pruning procedure showed a structured pattern in which frequencies were removed first, indicating the importance of certain frequencies for classification performance. The features pruned and the order in which they were pruned varied due to parameter sensitivity and training process variability. The study found that around 90% of frequencies were not necessary for classification using neural networks. Pruning showed a structured pattern in removing less important dimensions. Deep convolutional networks were effective in classifying and masking cells, with an average L1-error of 0.041 over a 100-image test set. In this study, deep artificial neural networks were used for rapid classification of biological data from hyperspectral imaging. The approach allowed for smooth and detailed cell outlines by producing non-integer values. The results showed that both pixel-based and whole image-based classification were highly effective, indicating the suitability of deep neural network approaches for hyperspectral imaging analysis in complex domains like biological tissue. The study also identified a unique sampling reduction technique using neural networks to determine necessary sensors or wavelengths for classification. The study utilized deep artificial neural networks for rapid classification of biological data from hyperspectral imaging, showing effectiveness in both pixel-based and whole image-based classification. The approach also introduced a unique sampling reduction technique to determine necessary sensors or wavelengths for classification, differentiating from traditional dimensionality reduction methods like PCA and LLE. Our approach focuses on directly classifying pixels or whole regions (cells) using deep neural networks for hyperspectral data. We aim to leverage the data's dimensionality structure efficiently and expect generalizability to other datasets. Further refinement of our convolutional neural network can lead to effective sub-cellular segmentation, with the goal of informing experimental results using neural network algorithms."
