    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Land Freedom Act of 2015\". Congress finds that as of the date of enactment of this Act, 113,000,000 acres of onshore Federal land are open for oil and natural gas development, while approximately 166,000,000 acres are off-limits. Despite the recent oil and gas boom, the number of leased Federal land for exploration has decreased by 24% since 2008. In 2013, only 36,000,000 acres were leased, compared to 131,000,000 acres in 1984, which harms economic growth and Federal revenues. In 2013, it took 197 days to process applications for permits to drill on Federal land; States have sufficient regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"available Federal land\" refers to Federal land within a State that is not held by the US for a federally recognized Indian tribe, not part of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, or a congressionally designated wilderness area. \"State\" includes a State and the District of Columbia. \"State leasing, permitting, and regulatory program\" refers to a program established under State law. A State leasing, permitting, and regulatory program is a program established under State law to regulate energy exploration and development on State land. State control of energy development and production on federal land is mandated by Section 4. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory programs allow states to transfer responsibility for energy development from the Federal Government. States can lease, permit, and regulate oil, natural gas, and other energy forms on federal land within the state upon submission of a declaration. The State's actions to lease, permit, or regulate energy exploration and development are not considered Federal actions under certain laws. Any lease or permit issued by a State under section 4 must collect royalties or revenues equivalent to what would have been collected by the Federal Government. Revenues from State leases on Federal land will be deposited in the same Federal account. States can still charge processing fees for lease or permit applications."
