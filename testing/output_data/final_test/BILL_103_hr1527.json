The Congress finds that external factors like hunger, homelessness, and substance abuse impact a child's academic success. Access to health and social services can help families support their child's education. Schools can play a key role in identifying and addressing student and family needs to improve educational outcomes and meet national goals. The purpose of this part is to provide better access to social, health, and education services for elementary and secondary school students and their families to ensure children's success in school and improve educational outcomes. The Secretary of Education can grant funds to local educational agencies for model programs in schools serving at least 30% of families in poverty. Schools in partnership with community-based organizations can also qualify if the agency handles fiscal administration. In carrying out the program, funds are used to provide coordinated social, health, and education services to students and families, including hiring a coordinator, minor building renovations, and equipment purchases. Programs tailored to community needs may include nutrition, health care, housing assistance, drug and alcohol services, education and training, and energy assistance. The program provides coordinated social, health, and education services to students and families, including nutrition, health care, housing assistance, drug and alcohol services, education and training programs, energy assistance, and other social services. Services may be delivered in school facilities or outreach centers. The Federal share of funding decreases over the years, with the possibility of receiving assistance from other funding sources. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain requirements. The Secretary has the authority to waive the requirement for obtaining funds from sources other than those made available under the program if a local educational agency demonstrates inability to participate and negotiates the remaining cost with the Secretary. \"SEC. 1496. APPLICATIONS.\" The Secretary notifies eligible schools about grant availability. Local educational agencies must submit applications with required information. Applications must include assurances, needs assessment, and community support documentation. The application for grants must include documentation of community support, new services description, coordination of existing services, integration of on and off-campus projects, and a plan for service continuation after Federal funds end. The Secretary considers factors like community coordination, geographic distribution, and program model ability when awarding grants to local educational agencies. Grants are initially for a 4-year period, with a possible renewal for an additional 2 years. Reporting requirements are outlined in Section 1498. The local educational agencies receiving assistance must submit annual reports to the Secretary detailing their activities. The Secretary must also report to Congress annually on the projects funded under this part. Authorization of appropriations is set at $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for subsequent years to support the projects."
