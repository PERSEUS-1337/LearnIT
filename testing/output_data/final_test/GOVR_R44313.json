    "content": "Since 2006, \"Building Partnership Capacity\" (BPC) has become a central pillar of U.S. national security and foreign policy. It was introduced after the 9/11 attacks when traditional security assistance tools were deemed inadequate for the new strategic landscape. BPC encompasses various programs aimed at strengthening foreign security institutions in weak states for the benefit of U.S. national security. Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) is a key element of U.S. national security strategy, involving activities like training and equipping foreign security forces in fragile states. The effectiveness of BPC in achieving U.S. strategic objectives is a topic of growing Congressional interest. The effectiveness of Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) in achieving U.S. strategic objectives is being questioned due to recent events in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Congressional interest in BPC programs is also driven by the need for fiscal oversight and the ambiguity surrounding DOD's efforts in building partner capacity in fragile states. Despite Congress authorizing over $100 billion for high-profile BPC missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria since 2001, DOD's spending on BPC and related programs remains unclear. DOD continues to execute BPC missions globally, with some components augmenting force structure for better mission conduct. However, the lack of clarity in identifying BPC expenditures creates challenges in determining cost-effectiveness and achieving U.S. strategic objectives. The lack of clarity in DOD's spending on BPC and related programs creates oversight challenges for Congress in assessing the effectiveness of these programs. This report aims to define BPC and explore its evolution in national strategy documents, as well as evaluate its effectiveness in achieving U.S. strategic objectives. The report explores whether BPC has been effective in achieving U.S. strategic objectives since World War II. It raises questions for Congress to consider, highlighting the need for further analysis and critical thinking about BPC programs. The report examines the challenges in defining \"Building Partner Capacity\" (BPC) and determining DOD's spending on related activities. Further analysis is needed to understand the effectiveness of BPC in achieving U.S. strategic objectives since World War II. Increased emphasis on cooperation on security matters with other countries has led to a rise in cooperative security activities within the DOD. These activities are spread across the DOD enterprise, making it challenging to track their budget allocation. The complexity of BPC activities has made it difficult to assess their effectiveness. To understand BPC effectiveness, this report takes a basic analytic approach by identifying strategic goals the U.S. aimed to achieve since World War II through building partner capacity. These goals include victory in war, managing regional security challenges, conflict mitigation, and enhancing coalition participation. The report examines case studies on building partner capacity (BPC) for various strategic goals, including conflict mitigation and alliance building. BPC efforts have been most effective in building interpersonal and institutional linkages and alliances, with examples like South Korea, Poland, and Japan. The effectiveness of BPC as a war exit strategy has been the least successful based on the research findings. The case studies explored by CRS shed light on evaluating BPC activities. The key question is why BPC does or does not work, with debates on execution issues and strategic perspectives. The research suggests that neither explanation fully captures the effectiveness of BPC, as various factors beyond US control play a role. Congress may consider specific criteria when assessing the likelihood of BPC success. Congress may want to consider specific criteria when evaluating the effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC). Successful BPC efforts often involve assistance to legitimate and effective governance institutions, while ineffective efforts occur in conflict zones or countries with weak governance. Corruption in partner countries can hinder BPC effectiveness, and having a willing and capable partner is crucial. Alignment of interests between the US and partner countries is also important for BPC success. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) success relies on recipients being politically legitimate to articulate their interests and execute strategies. Unintended consequences of BPC programs can create strategic challenges, as seen in U.S. partnership activities in Central and Eastern Europe post-Cold War. Accepting U.S. assistance implies a strategic alignment with the United States, with long-term responsibilities and calculations by partner countries. The term \"Building Partner Capacity\" (BPC) encompasses a wide range of activities and programs by the Department of Defense (DOD), leading to challenges in analyzing their effectiveness. This term has been used broadly to cover DOD's engagements with various non-DOD actors, some of which may not directly enhance a partner's military and civilian institutions. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) is a term that encompasses a variety of activities aimed at enhancing the security capabilities of partners in less capable states. It involves establishing personal relationships between military leaders, conducting bilateral and multilateral military exercises, and other collaborative efforts. BPC is seen as crucial for advancing U.S. national security interests. The text chunk discusses various activities related to building partner capacity, including multilateral exercises, military planning, training foreign military officers, equipping foreign forces, and preparing security forces for multilateral operations. The term \"Building Partner Capacity\" emerged in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review after the 9/11 attacks, expanding DOD's security cooperation tools. This involves embedding advisors in foreign military and security ministries in various countries, with plans to send advisors to more nations. The goal is to maintain a long-term, low-visibility presence in areas where U.S. forces do not traditionally operate and to build and leverage partner capacity for complex operations worldwide. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) is a critical strategy post-9/11, involving embedding advisors in foreign military and security ministries to build and leverage partner capacity for complex operations. Surrogates are essential for achieving goals, with BPC becoming a primary means for securing US interests and a national security objective. The collapse of fragile states into conflict zones could create areas for terrorist attacks, making it crucial to build governance and security capacity in other countries. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) is crucial for enhancing governance and security capacity in other countries, especially in the current global security environment where threats are likely to come from fractured or failing states. The effectiveness and credibility of the United States depend on the capabilities of local partners. BPC has become associated with DOD's efforts to strengthen cooperation with weak or unstable international partners. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) is essential for enhancing governance and security in other countries, focusing on counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and state weakness threats. BPC includes Security Force Assistance (SFA) operations and improving partners' peacekeeping and counterterrorism capabilities, especially in fragile states. The U.S. government widened its aperture in discussing how to build partner capacity, using BPC as a state-building tool for weaker states to prevent conflicts. This approach aims to reduce risk to U.S. forces and extend security to unreachable areas, achieving strategic objectives at a lower cost without direct military involvement. Recent DOD strategy documents suggest an expansion of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) efforts, linking them to counterterrorism and alliance building. These efforts aim to enhance partners' capabilities, deter aggression, and defeat extremists. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) has evolved from a post-9/11 counterterrorism strategy to a key means for the US to achieve national security objectives. Scholars view BPC as a grand strategy of \"sponsorship,\" emphasizing strategic patience and collaboration with partners for mutual goals. Within the DOD, BPC is associated with security cooperation and assistance programs administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) administers and provides guidance for DOD security assistance and cooperation programs to achieve strategic objectives with international partners. It includes interactions with foreign defense establishments and security assistance programs that promote U.S. security interests. Security cooperation and security assistance activities aim to develop allied military capabilities, provide access to host nations, and support national policies. Security assistance involves programs authorized by Title 22 of the U.S. Code to provide defense articles, training, and services to achieve strategic objectives with international partners. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) administers security assistance programs for weakened states to manage security challenges. DSCA allocates resources based on Congress-provided authorities, which are a mix of DOD, State Department, and joint management programs. After the 9/11 attacks, the number of security assistance programs increased, with 17 out of 31 programs created post-9/11. This indicates a shift in the United States government's approach to security cooperation, with a greater emphasis on the Department of Defense's role in addressing security challenges. The Department of Defense has integrated Building Partner Capacity (BPC) across a wide range of its operations and activities, utilizing various funding sources. Most BPC programs are funded by sources like operations and maintenance funds, rather than DSCA-earmarked funds. The Department of Defense utilizes various funding sources for Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs, such as operations and maintenance funds. DSCA oversees only a subset of DOD's BPC activities, leading to financial oversight challenges. BPC is also influencing force structure, like the U.S. Army's initiative to build \"Regionally Aligned\" forces. The U.S. Army is planning to increase its security cooperation budget by 25% and may create new \"Train, Advise and Assist\" units to enhance its ability to support Combatant Commanders. Funding for these initiatives will come from various sources including Title 22 funds, Combatant Commander Funds, joint exercise funds, and special authorities like the Global Security Contingency Fund. The Department of Defense (DOD) is restructuring its force to better handle Building Partner Capacity (BPC) tasks. DOD's approach to BPC involves various missions like fixing security institutions, creating security partners, and enhancing allies' defense capabilities. The 2006 BPC execution roadmap prioritizes interagency planning and operations over cooperation with international partners, recognizing the need for collaboration to address complex challenges. The Department of Defense is restructuring its force to handle Building Partner Capacity (BPC) tasks, emphasizing collaboration with allies and partners. Congress and DOD have differing views on BPC, with Congress presenting it as a narrower concept in legislation. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act gave the President limited authority to direct DOD in supporting foreign countries' military forces for counterterrorist or military operations. Figure 2 illustrates the difference in definitions between Congress and DOD regarding BPC. The Department of Defense is restructuring its force to handle Building Partner Capacity (BPC) tasks, emphasizing collaboration with allies and partners. Congress views BPC as a narrow set of programs managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, while DOD sees it as broader, infused across its activities and operations. The Department of Defense is restructuring its force to handle Building Partner Capacity (BPC) tasks, emphasizing collaboration with allies and partners. DOD does not capture the level of granularity necessary to identify the full scope of expenditure on BPC programs, making it nearly impossible to determine how much money is actually spent on BPC activities. The term BPC is used to represent a variety of different programs and activities, adding to the ambiguity surrounding BPC and compounding the oversight challenge. The Obama Administration attempted to bring coherence to security cooperation and Building Partner Capacity (BPC) efforts through Presidential Policy Directive 23 (PPD 23) in 2013. Views on the effectiveness of the \"patchwork\" system of security cooperation authorities are mixed, with some arguing that overlaps and gaps create challenges while others see flexibility in organizing tailored activities. The Obama Administration issued Presidential Policy Directive 23 (PPD 23) in 2013 to enhance U.S. security assistance and cooperation efforts. However, the effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) remains untested, with evaluations focusing on program execution and challenges in the security cooperation enterprise. Arguments for or against BPC strategies are often anecdotal and lack systematic analysis. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in country B lack systematic analysis to determine their strategic-level effects due to data limitations, lack of assessments, and long time horizons. Program managers often lack longevity to assess program efficacy, leading to challenges in monitoring and evaluating effectiveness. The effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in country B is hindered by a lack of systematic analysis and understanding of strategic objectives. The Department of Defense (DOD) views BPC as a broad strategy encompassing various activities beyond traditional foreign assistance programs, making it challenging to assess effectiveness. The effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in country B is hindered by a lack of systematic analysis and understanding of strategic objectives. BPC programs are long-term activities with strategic-level shifts that can impact their overall effectiveness. Rationales for BPC programs are often conflated, making it difficult to determine which goals are more important. The effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in country B is hindered by a lack of systematic analysis and understanding of strategic objectives. It is important to determine whether BPC has been an effective way to achieve strategic goals, considering the significant resources invested in these programs. The United States developed a list of objectives for Building Partner Capacity activities, including victory in war, managing security challenges, conflict mitigation, and alliance building. 20 case studies were selected to assess the impact of BPC efforts on achieving strategic goals since World War II. While it's challenging to attribute failures or successes solely to BPC, overall trends can indicate whether BPC contributed meaningfully to U.S. strategic objectives. The report analyzes case studies to determine if Building Partner Capacity (BPC) contributed to achieving U.S. strategic objectives. It assesses different rationales like war termination and proxy warfare, evaluating if objectives were met. The U.S. has invested in training partner militaries to reduce its involvement in conflicts, transitioning security responsibility to partners. The United States has sought to transition security responsibility to partner countries to enable American forces to withdraw. This strategy involves building durable security institutions to maintain security after military coalition members depart. Large-scale capacity building missions have been conducted in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan post-9/11 to facilitate U.S. withdrawal from conflict zones. After World War II, the United States began military support in Southeast Asia to prevent communist takeover. The Military Assistance Advisory Group-Indochina (MAAG) was established to assist French and Vietnamese forces. When France withdrew in 1954, the U.S. took over training and equipping the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The MAAG grew in size and scope, becoming a significant U.S. military advisory effort in the region. The MAAG in South Vietnam, led by a three-star general, focused on military capacity building with over $2 billion in aid. Initially successful, the ARVN struggled with guerilla tactics, leading the U.S. to shift to a limited partnership strategy in 1961. The United States and ARVN engaged in a \"Strategic Hamlet\" program in 1962 to pacify the local population, but it failed due to over-expansion, coercion, mismanagement, and dishonesty. The American expectation was for the government of Vietnam to reform itself to address local concerns fueling the insurgency. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, the United States shifted its focus from BPC efforts to deploying more forces against North Vietnam. A division of labor emerged where the US handled offensive operations while Vietnamese forces focused on pacification. However, the South Vietnamese government did not undergo necessary reforms, leading to a counterinsurgency campaign that alienated the population. Despite military calls for escalation, the Tet Offensive marked a turning point. After the Tet Offensive and the election of President Nixon, calls to escalate the war increased. In 1969, the U.S. shifted to \"Vietnamization,\" transferring security responsibility to South Vietnamese forces to withdraw American troops by 1973. President Nixon emphasized this strategy in a speech on November 3, 1969. The primary mission was to enable South Vietnamese forces to take over security responsibilities. A plan was adopted for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops and their replacement by South Vietnamese forces. However, Saigon fell to North Vietnam in 1975 despite efforts of Vietnamization. Former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird believed Vietnamization aimed to withdraw U.S. forces honorably while equipping South Vietnamese forces, but time constraints and neglect of South Vietnam's combat capabilities hindered the process. The Vietnamization strategy aimed to enable South Vietnamese forces to take over security responsibilities, but it ultimately failed due to systemic problems in South Vietnam and the rapid transition timeline. This led to the inability to create a government capable of repelling the North Vietnamese after U.S. forces withdrew. In response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States launched an offensive in Afghanistan to eradicate the Al Qaeda terrorist group and depose the Taliban-run government. The international community met in Bonn to establish an interim government for Afghanistan under the United Nations. The Bonn Agreement outlined support for the new Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, including providing security for Kabul. The focus was on establishing an Afghan-led security presence to avoid a long-term occupation. The initial plan was to reform the security sector by integrating existing militias into legitimate government institutions. In 2003, the decision was made to build a new Afghan National Army from scratch with a target end-strength of 70,000. NATO took over commanding the International Security Assistance Force in the same year. By 2008, the Afghan National Army's end-strength was increased to 122,000 despite issues with attrition and overstretch. The Taliban regrouped and launched annual \"spring offensives\" to challenge the Afghan government's legitimacy in Kabul. The Afghan National Army was considered a legitimate institution, but the Afghan National Police faced challenges in providing security. In 2008, the police were found to have significant shortcomings. After President Obama's inauguration, a strategic review focused on disrupting and defeating al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2010, NATO Allies, ISAF partners, and the Afghan government agreed to transition security responsibility to Afghan forces by 2014. The goal was to disrupt and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, while increasing the size of Afghan security forces for eventual self-reliance. President Obama emphasized training Afghan forces to take the lead in securing their country. In early 2011, following a joint Afghan and NATO/ISAF assessment, transition to Afghan forces assuming full security responsibility by the end of 2014. ISAF mission ended on December 31, 2014, and NATO-led Resolute Support Mission began on January 1, 2015, focusing on training and advising Afghan forces. U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan is approximately. The overall U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan is approximately 9,800, with some assigned to Resolute Support and the remainder to Operation Freedom's Sentinel. The end-strength goals for the Afghan National Police, Army, and Air Force are 157,000, 195,000, and 7,800 respectively. The U.S. has appropriated over $686 billion for combat operations and $65 billion for Afghan Security Forces since 2001. On August 26, 2015, Musa Qala, a key district in Afghanistan, was mentioned. On August 26, 2015, Musa Qala, a key district in Helmand Province, fell to the Taliban, highlighting increasing instability in Afghanistan. The Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction reported a rise in conflict-related violence and record-high levels of civilian casualties. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has also spread into Afghanistan, according to DoD and RS officials. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has expanded into Afghanistan, with the group described as 'nascent and relatively small.' The Department of Defense (DOD) acknowledges significant challenges to the Afghan National Police (ANP) effectiveness, including force protection, command and control, training, maintenance, medical care, force management, personnel attrition, and corruption. President Obama adjusted his strategy to retain 9,800 troops in Afghanistan until late 2016 and then 5,500 troops thereafter, at an estimated cost of $15 billion. The presence of 5,500 troops in Afghanistan is expected to cost around $15 billion per year, which is $5 billion more than the previous projection for a smaller Kabul-based force. The success of training and equipping Afghan Security Forces is uncertain, with a historical reminder of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the abrupt fall of the Moscow-sponsored government in 1992. The U.S. initially focused on Iraq after the campaign in Afghanistan began, with an assumption that the regime of Saddam Hussein could be quickly removed, leading to a transition period overseen by a U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). During the transition, an interim U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) would set conditions for a stable, democratic, and free Iraq with the help of Iraqi Security Forces. Training and equipping of new Iraqi Security Forces began in late 2003 to transition security and governance responsibility to Iraqis. President Bush outlined three objectives for the strategy in Iraq: destroying terrorists, enlisting support for a free Iraq, and helping Iraqis take responsibility for their defense and future. The Coalition Provisional Authority was tasked with reconstituting Iraqi Security Forces, including training civil defense forces, Iraqi police, facilities protection service, border guards, and a new Iraqi army. Efforts to execute the training program were somewhat fragmented due to a lack of resources and ambitious training objectives. The goal was to train and field 27 Iraqi battalions in one year. Efforts to create an Iraqi police force were hindered by limited resources, leading military commanders to establish their own training programs. President Bush streamlined the training of Iraqi security forces in 2004, but violence continued to escalate. In November 2005, the White House issued a \"National Strategy for Victory in Iraq,\" focusing on defeating terrorists, developing Iraqi security forces, and supporting the Iraqi government. Building Iraqi security institutions was always a key component of the exit strategy, but opinions differed on its priority. In early 2007, Congress mandated the creation of the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, which concluded that Iraqi Armed Forces are increasingly effective, but the police are improving at a slower rate. The Iraqi Security Forces will still rely on the Coalition for key support. The Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq concluded that Iraqi Armed Forces are improving but still rely on the Coalition for support. The ISF showed progress by 2009, allowing the US to begin its withdrawal from Iraq by 2010. The United States completed its withdrawal from Iraq in December 2011 after training and equipping Iraqi Security Forces. Despite spending $815 billion on combat operations, violence increased post-withdrawal, with a resurgence of Al Qaeda in Iraq. Syria's unrest also contributed to the region's instability. In early 2014, Iraqi Security Forces failed to repel the Islamic State due to poor leadership, declining morale, broken equipment, and lack of training since the US departure in 2011. The collapse of Iraq's army in cities like Mosul and Tikrit was attributed to divisions abandoning their posts and fleeing when confronted by ISIS fighters. The United States initiated Operation Inherent Resolve in August 2014 to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Despite ongoing efforts, assessments of the campaign's progress are mixed. Previous capacity-building efforts in Iraq have not produced security institutions capable of managing local security challenges. U.S. attempts to build partner capacity for withdrawal from engagements have not been successful in some cases. The United States' military campaigns in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan have faced challenges in securing the respective countries in the long term. Scholars and practitioners question whether aligning host nation and U.S. goals is the root cause of these challenges. Building the security capability of states is seen as a strategic rationale to prevent terrorist groups and hostile forces from launching attacks. The need to prevent terrorist attacks and stabilize regions to avoid humanitarian crises and U.S. military intervention is emphasized in national security strategies. Military engagements are seen as a way to mitigate state fragility and resolve armed conflicts, aligning with the goal of creating permanent crisis response capabilities. Military-to-military engagements are part of risk-mitigation strategies to empower local governments in managing security challenges with minimal U.S. involvement. These programs aim to allocate security burdens among concerned countries, focusing on preventive measures to strengthen partners' security capabilities. The African Union (AU) was established in 2002 as a regional grouping of African countries. The African Union (AU) was established in 2002 as a regional grouping of African countries. Despite funding and capacity shortfalls, the AU routinely gets involved in armed conflicts and political crises. The United States has committed over $1 billion since 2009 to develop African peacekeeping capacity and has trained and equipped a quarter-million African troops and police for service in UN and AU peacekeeping operations. The United States has allocated significant resources to build the African Union's capacity for peacekeeping operations, including training and equipment worth $70 million for African peacekeepers. East Africa, particularly Somalia, has faced instability and conflict for over 30 years. In East Africa, Somalia has been plagued by instability and conflict for over 30 years. After the ousting of Somali dictator Mohamed Said Barre in 1991, power struggles among clans and warlords ensued. The United States deployed troops to Somalia in 1992 under the United Nations, but withdrew after a U.S. Black Hawk helicopter was shot down. Despite efforts to establish a federal government, Somalia remained unstable. The Union of Islamic Courts, including militant group al-Shabaab linked to al Qaeda, gained control in Mogadishu in 2006. In mid-2006, al-Shabaab took control of central Somalia, leading to Ethiopian military intervention with U.S. support in December 2006. The African Union launched AMISOM in January 2007, getting involved in a brutal civil war supporting the Transitional Federal Government against al-Shabaab and the UIC insurgency. The conflict resulted in escalating violence and a massive wave of displacement in Mogadishu. In 2007, 400,000 people fled Mogadishu due to escalating violence. AMISOM and al-Shabaab engaged in bloody battles in Mogadishu from 2009-2010. Al-Shabaab carried out terrorist attacks in Uganda in 2010. By 2015, al-Shabaab seemed to be in retreat, with U.S. strikes targeting key figures. AMISOM had 22,126 uniformed personnel in 2015. The current Force Headquarters staff of 81 oversees a military component with troops from Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The United States has allocated over $800 million in logistics, equipment, and training for AMISOM troop contributors since 2007, along with almost $300 million for Somali Forces and over $500 million to the UN Support Offices for AMISOM. Additionally, the US has a small contingent of military personnel, including Special Operations Forces. The White House views U.S. efforts to build the capacity of the African Union and AMISOM as a success, despite challenges in rebuilding the Somali state and the continued threat of al-Shabaab. Some analysts are concerned about al-Shabaab potentially aligning with the Islamic State, while U.S. support for Ethiopian interventions in Somalia may have worsened local tensions. AMISOM faced challenges with coordination among troop-contributing countries and personnel shortages despite U.S. assistance. Troop contributors are not fully reimbursed for equipment. The African Union's capabilities are criticized for various shortcomings despite U.S. assistance. Troop contributors have varying professional standards and limited interoperability. Many member states are hesitant to participate in AU missions. The Malian government has received U.S. support for counterterrorism efforts since 2002. The United States has been supporting Mali's counterterrorism efforts since 2002, in response to terrorist threats from radical Islamists. This led to the launch of the Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) and later the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). In 2011, a separatist rebellion by the Tuareg community worsened military and political tensions, culminating in a military coup in March 2012 led by Captain Amadou Sanogo, who had received U.S. military training. In 2012, Captain Amadou Sanogo led a military coup in Mali, citing the government's failure to address the Tuareg situation. This led to Islamist extremist groups like AQIM taking advantage of the chaos to gain control of northern Mali. In 2013, France intervened to dislodge AQIM, and U.S. security assistance was suspended but later resumed with a focus on security programs. The Obama Administration has restarted some programs in Mali, focusing on security sector reform. In 2015, a peace accord was reached between northern separatist rebel groups and the government, but underlying issues persist. Islamic extremist groups have launched attacks in Mali, including the 2015 Radisson Blu hotel attack. Al Murabitoun and AQIM claimed responsibility for the assault. Despite efforts to train and equip Malian forces to counter terrorism, questions remain about their preparedness. The United States and its European allies established programs like the Partnership for Peace to strengthen ties with Central and Eastern European countries. President Clinton also announced the Warsaw Initiative to provide bilateral assistance to PfP partners. The Partnership for Peace program provides bilateral assistance to PfP partners through exercises, conferences, and Foreign Military Financing. NATO's PfP program has expanded to include strategic-level dialogue with non-NATO members. The Warsaw Initiative, on the other hand, has contracted as members graduate from the program. Currently, the Warsaw Initiative comprises 16 developing countries. The Warsaw Initiative includes 16 developing countries in the Euro-Atlantic region, focusing on enhancing partner capacity, advancing democratic reform, and increasing interoperability with U.S./NATO. It aims to support partner integration with NATO and aspirant accession to NATO. The program resulted in the accession of 12 former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO, enabling U.S. forces to pivot to other challenges. Experts argue that European allies have not adequately replaced departing U.S. forces with necessary defense capabilities, leading to a decline in defense spending and NATO's military capabilities. There are concerns about Europe's ability to handle security challenges in its southern and eastern regions. Additionally, Pakistan has become a key ally in U.S.-led efforts against Islamist militancy after facing sanctions for nuclear proliferation and a military coup. Pakistan became a key ally in U.S.-led efforts to combat Islamist militancy and extremism after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The United States aimed to build the capability of Pakistani security forces to address the threat posed by terrorist groups without direct involvement. In 2006, both countries affirmed their bilateral strategic partnership and outlined steps to strengthen their relationship. The United States and Pakistan announced steps to strengthen their defense relationship, including increasing collaboration in defense training, joint exercises, procurement, technology transfers, and peacekeeping. They also agreed to work together to maintain peace and security in South Asia and beyond, and cooperate in international institutions. In 2009, President Obama announced a recalibration of U.S. strategy toward Pakistan, focusing military assistance on tools, training, and support to root out terrorists. U.S. goals for Pakistan evolved over time, with Congress appropriating over $18 billion in foreign assistance from FY2002-FY2015, including $7.6 billion in security-related aid. Congress also allocated billions for Coalition Support Funds to reimburse Pakistan for supporting U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. The \"coalition support funds\" (CSF) have provided roughly $13 billion to Pakistan since 2001, accounting for half of U.S. financial transfers. These funds support Pakistani army operations, maintain troops in northwest Pakistan, and compensate for coalition use of Pakistani airfields and seaports. Additionally, the U.S. has established funds to enhance Pakistani Security Forces' capabilities, such as the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capabilities Fund (PCCF) and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund, administered by the DOD, aimed to support Pakistan's security forces in conducting counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in contested areas along the border with Afghanistan. These programs were removed from the Assistance budget in FY2013, but the Department intends to reimburse Pakistan for military operations in FY2015 to support U.S. operations in the region. Pakistan has been an ally in Operation Enduring Freedom since 2001 and will continue to play a key role in future operations against violent extremists. Pakistan incurs expenses for counterinsurgency operations, observation posts along the Afghanistan border, maritime interdiction operations, and combat air patrols. Despite notable accomplishments in humanitarian relief, U.S. assistance to Pakistan since 2001 has not achieved its central goal. Mullah Omar, the Afghan Taliban leader, lived in Quetta, Pakistan, with the \"Quetta Shura\" group of Taliban leaders. Efforts to encourage Pakistan to combat terrorist groups have been slow as the government prioritizes other preparations. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan raised doubts about continued aid from the US. Despite efforts to build Pakistan as a stable ally against terrorism, US assistance has evolved to focus on bilateral cooperation in national security priorities. Despite significant U.S. expenditure to build Pakistan's security capabilities, the central goals of the effort have not been met. Applying the same approach to manage regional security challenges has been problematic based on four case studies. In the most successful case, U.S. support to the former Warsaw Pact, NATO allies failed to invest in defense capabilities after the U.S. withdrew forces. Support to the African Union, AMISOM, Pakistan, and Mali has not necessarily increased partners' capability or willingness to manage regional security challenges in a way that benefits U.S. national security interests. During the Cold War and post-Soviet era, the United States supported allies in conflicts to advance national interests, such as countering narcotics. Military aid was provided to favored parties to secure advantageous post-war outcomes. The Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II led to the formation of the Hukbalahap Rebellion. The Huks initially targeted Japanese forces and later turned against the Philippine ruling class. Fueled by grievances, the Huks became more communist and started an insurgency against the corrupt post-war Philippine government. The government in the Philippines siphoned off aid and supplies from the United States, hindering assistance to the population. The government's forces conducted a brutal anti-Huk campaign, mistreating the locals. The United States grew concerned as the rebellion escalated, reminiscent of the situation in Chiang Kai-shek's China before the Communist takeover. The Truman Administration wanted to address the geopolitical situation in the Philippines. The Truman Administration used the Philippines as a model of successful decolonization for Europeans, but direct intervention was not feasible. President Quirino requested military aid for an anti-Huk campaign, leading the US to condition support on reforms to make the government more accountable. This included incorporating the constabulary into the armed forces and replacing the Chief of Defense with Ramon Magsaysay. In the 1950s, the United States provided $243 million in assistance to Philippine security forces, leading to reforms that weakened the Huk rebellion. Ferdinand Marcos later became president and turned the country into a dictatorship. Despite this, U.S.-Philippine relations remained close due to military ties and U.S. bases in the Philippines. In 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan to support the Afghan government against escalating chaos. The Soviet Union deployed troops to Afghanistan in response to escalating chaos, leading to a full-scale war against Soviet occupation. The United States initiated a covert aid program in 1980, working with countries like China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan to provide deniable support to anti-Communist forces in Afghanistan. The program, limited to $80 million, involved obtaining Soviet-made weapons from the black market and funneling them through Pakistan. In 1984, the U.S. program to assist anti-communist forces in Afghanistan increased significantly with funding levels reaching $600 million per year. The anti-communist insurgency grew in strength despite Soviet military pressure. A United Nations-brokered accord was signed in 1988 with the U.S. and Soviet Union as guarantors. The U.S. and USSR acted as guarantors to an agreement in Afghanistan in 1988, excluding Afghan insurgents from negotiations. The Soviet Union withdrew by February 1989, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance. This withdrawal eventually led to a civil war and the rise of the Taliban, creating a space for al-Qaeda to plan the 9/11 attacks. Colombia has been embroiled in a prolonged internal conflict for over fifty years. Colombia has been in a prolonged internal conflict for over fifty years, with armed groups like FARC and ELN funding themselves through narcotics trafficking. By the late 1990s, Colombia dominated the global cocaine trade, and heroin from Colombian-grown poppies became the main source in the eastern United States. Concerns arose in Congress and the Clinton Administration about Colombia becoming a failed state due to illegal actors' reliance on the drug trade and the weakening of Colombian security forces. Plan Colombia was announced by Colombian President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana in 1999 as a six-year strategy to end the country's internal conflict, combat drug trafficking, and promote democracy and development. The plan aimed to reduce narcotics production by 50% through eradication efforts, alternative development programs, strengthening security forces, judiciary, and fighting corruption. The Plan Colombia, announced in 1999, aimed to combat drug trafficking, strengthen security forces, judiciary, and fight corruption. The initial cost was $7.5 billion, with Colombia paying $4 billion and seeking international donations. The U.S. contributed $1.27 billion, including training new counternarcotics army battalions, providing helicopters, and supporting drug interdiction, eradication capabilities, economic development, boosting government capacity, and the peace process. U.S. personnel were prohibited from directly participating in combat missions. After the initial Plan Colombia announcement in 1999, the U.S. contributed $1.27 billion to combat drug trafficking and strengthen security forces in Colombia. U.S. personnel were prohibited from direct combat missions, emphasizing Colombian ownership. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress granted flexibility to address counterterrorism and counternarcotics issues together. Nearly $10 billion was appropriated between FY2000 and FY2015 for assistance, leading to a successful partnership between the U.S. and Colombia. Ambassador William Brownfield praised the efforts as a successful nation-building exercise. The Colombian Armed Forces are collaborating with other nations in Central and South America to address counternarcotics challenges. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos shook hands with FARC leader Timochenko in 2015 to announce peace talks and disarmament plans. Despite progress, the final peace accord has not been signed, and Colombia remains a major cocaine producer. The US has supported Colombia through Plan Colombia, contributing $1.27 billion initially and nearly $10 billion between FY2000 and FY2015 for assistance. Ambassador William Brownfield praised the partnership as a successful nation-building exercise. Based on selected cases, U.S. military assistance in Colombia, the Philippines, and Afghanistan helped partners win conflicts and promote stability. However, in Afghanistan, the inability to sustain gains led to conflict and instability exploited by Al Qaeda. This highlights the importance of careful management in long-term political and military support efforts. The United States utilized military assistance in conflict zones like Colombia, the Philippines, and Afghanistan to promote stability. However, long-term effects of such assistance can sometimes be counterproductive to U.S. interests. For example, after the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, the U.S. aimed to prevent further hostilities in the Balkans by establishing a Federation Army from conflicting factions. James Pardew was appointed as U.S. Special Representative for Military Stabilization in the Balkans in December 1995. James Pardew was appointed as U.S. Special Representative for Military Stabilization in the Balkans to coordinate a train and equip effort for the Federation Army. The Bosnia Train and Equip Program aimed to establish a balance of power between Federation and Bosnian Serb forces to prevent fighting post NATO withdrawal. The program, carried out by MPRI, had a U.S. contribution of about $100 million. The Bosnia Train and Equip Program, with a U.S. contribution of $100 million, involved the distribution of military equipment and training by MPRI for the Bosnian Federation. Approximately 200 retired U.S. military personnel ran the program to downplay direct U.S. military involvement. Training focused on leader development to establish a combat training center. The program ended in 2002. The Bosnia Train and Equip Program, funded by the U.S. with $100 million, successfully trained and equipped the armed forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO standards. The program, which ended in 2002, aimed to enhance stability in Bosnia and the region by addressing military imbalances. Other donor countries included Brunei, Egypt, Germany, Jordan, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. The security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has greatly improved since the end of the Bosnian war in 1995, with voluntary reductions of armed forces. There is a need for reform and restructuring to meet NATO's Partnership for Peace conditions. Egypt and Israel's military capabilities post-1978 Camp David Accords are more complex. The 1978 Camp David Accords and 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt exemplified using BPC to prevent conflict. However, changes in threats to the US in the Middle East since 1978 complicate assessing the strategic effects of US military aid. The distinction between BPC in DOD and security cooperation in the State Department adds to potential confusion. This case study aligns with the 2014 QDR's definition of BPC as \"Building security globally.\" Since the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty, the United States has provided military aid to Egypt and Israel to promote regional stability and strengthen bilateral relations. This aid has included joint programs and exercises to enhance institutional closeness. U.S. military aid has helped Israel become one of the most technologically advanced militaries in the world, maintaining its \"qualitative military edge\" over neighboring countries. Egypt receives significant military aid from the U.S. but the military-to-military relationship has received less emphasis in recent years. The last significant U.S.-Egyptian joint military operation was in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm. The U.S. military seeks partners for irregular warfare capabilities, but analysts view the Egyptian armed forces as more focused on interstate rather than asymmetric warfare. The U.S. has provided Israel with significant military aid, including FMF grants and jointly developed missile defense programs. U.S. military aid to Israel follows a model of military sales to developed countries. It is unclear how this aid would prevent conflict between Israel and Egypt since 1979, especially with the changing political environment in the Middle East. Unrest in the Arab world since 2011 has impacted the Israel-Egypt security dynamic. The Israel-Egypt security dynamic has been influenced by leadership changes in Egypt. Israel is relieved by Egypt's efforts to counter militants in the Sinai Peninsula and reduce smuggling into Gaza. However, challenges remain in Egypt's overall control of the Sinai, reflecting a broader trend of central governments struggling with extremist activity in peripheral areas. Heightened extremist activity in peripheral areas, with reported collaboration across the Sinai-Gaza border, has led to discussions on adjusting U.S. policy for Egypt, Israel, and the Multinational Force of Observers in Sinai. The U.S. is restructuring Egypt's military assistance to focus more on counterterrorism in the Sinai, with less emphasis on larger weapons platforms. Other factors affecting future efforts with Egypt and Israel include Egypt's domestic issues and its increasing reliance on Gulf Arab states. Egypt's political and economic challenges, reliance on Gulf Arab states, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and regional developments involving various international actors like Russia and Iran impact the effectiveness of U.S. military aid in conflict prevention. Factors outside U.S. control, such as the role of other parties in potential conflicts, play a crucial role in conflict mitigation. Bosnia serves as a successful example of conflict prevention, highlighting the importance of constructive engagement from all parties involved. The strategic situation in Egypt and Israel has been affected by various conflicts and changes, including the Iranian Revolution, Palestinian Intifada, Arab Spring, and the election of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. U.S. military aid to Egypt has evolved since the Camp David Accords, focusing on regional and domestic security. The IDF uses U.S. military aid for deterrence, while Egypt has modernized its armed forces through military cooperation. After Anwar Sadat's death in 1978, the U.S.-Egypt relationship evolved, potentially leading to the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in post-Mubarak elections. This shift may have altered the U.S. strategic rationale of conflict prevention expressed in the post-Camp David Accords. The United States has successfully achieved conflict prevention goals following Camp David by engaging in military campaigns with coalition partners. This approach, demonstrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, helps alleviate the burden on U.S. forces and builds international political legitimacy. However, many interested nations require external investments for training, equipping, and logistics. By compensating for partners' capabilities, the U.S. can enhance their operational effectiveness and overall military capability. The Lyndon Johnson Administration initiated the \"many flags\" initiative in 1964 to build a broad international coalition to repel communist forces in Vietnam. Initially focusing on non-combat support, the mission eventually grew to include combat-related support for South Vietnam, with over 69,000 non-U.S. troops from countries like the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Australia, and Thailand by 1969. The Johnson Administration considered using financial and military incentives to increase allied participation in the coalition during the Vietnam War. Seoul requested significant financial rewards to send one of its divisions to Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, the Johnson Administration considered using financial and military incentives to increase allied participation. In 2003, an ad hoc coalition was formed to oust Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, with initial forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland. The coalition expanded to 39 nations, each contributing capabilities based on their comparative advantage. Contributions included explosive ordinance disposal from Armenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, and Moldova, and civilian-military cooperation from El Salvador and the Republic of Korea. The coalition forces in Iraq had strategic implications beyond the theater of operations, strengthening alliances and promoting international cooperation. Georgia's troop deployment created ties with Western allies, while other Eastern European nations also made significant contributions. Multinational operations improved interoperability but posed logistical challenges due to the high cost of expeditionary military capabilities. The Department of Defense gained approval for funding in FY2002 to enable nations to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. By April 2007, the US spent $1.5 billion to support troops from 20 countries with sustainment services. As violence escalated in Iraq, coalition partners began withdrawing their troops. President Bush authorized a \"surge\" of forces in 2007 for stability. By the end of 2007, 15 nations had pulled out their troops from Iraq. After initiating operations in Iraq in 2003, the United States decided to maintain its counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan while NATO expanded its operations across the country. The US facilitated the deployment of combat forces from allied countries and provided medical support and helicopters for resupply operations in southern Afghanistan. The coalition in southern Afghanistan grew to 52 nations at its peak, with the United States investing in increasing ISAF's combat presence. However, most coalition partners were not willing to take on the same operational risk. Many nations placed restrictions on the use of their forces, limiting the ability of theater commanders. BPC to generate participation in U.S.-led military coalitions appears effective, but coalition participation does not guarantee equal military risk. Different nations had varying political priorities and strategic approaches, making it challenging to synchronize civilian and military activities in Afghanistan. The Department of Defense engages in activities to strengthen partnerships and promote collaboration on counterterrorism. Building linkages and partnerships is emphasized due to the military's experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, highlighting the need for soldiers to operate in unfamiliar cultural contexts. The need for soldiers to operate in unfamiliar cultural contexts and understand local dynamics has been underscored by experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. Former Chief of the Army Staff emphasized the importance of cultural awareness in all Army units, not just select ones like Special Forces or Civil Affairs. Strengthening institutional and interpersonal linkages is crucial for prosecuting coalition warfare effectively. Strengthening institutional and interpersonal linkages between U.S. military personnel and their counterparts in other nations can bolster interoperability. Programs like DOD's regional centers, multinational exercises, and the International Military Education and Training Program (IMET) support this goal. The U.S. Army's plan for regionally aligned forces aims to enhance cooperation with different regions globally. The shift in Asian security dynamics post-Cold War led to the need for innovative support for United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). The Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS) was established in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1994 with a budget of $3 million annually to support USPACOM with regional solutions to security challenges. It is one of five DOD regional centers aimed at building international security networks and engaging partner nations to advance U.S. national objectives. According to RAND Corporation, regional centers like APCSS are critical tools for exposing partner nation leaders to U.S. values and policies. Regional centers like APCSS play a crucial role in exposing partner nation leaders to U.S. values, governance, and policies, shaping strategic thinking, nurturing relationships, and providing neutral venues for conflict resolution. They also help build partner capacity by imparting national security analysis skills and improving partner nation institutions. The regional centers, such as APCSS, play a vital role in enhancing partner nation institutions and promoting whole-of-government solutions to security issues. They offer executive development courses lasting 1 to 10 weeks, inviting participants from governments in the center's area of responsibility and U.S. officials with regional responsibilities. Congress allocated $55,223,000 for these initiatives. The APCSS, funded by Congress, has trained over 8,500 individuals from 100 countries in its workshops. Its alumni network of 9,500 includes 266 in senior government positions. The FY2016 budget includes a \"Fellows Program\" for participants to implement initiatives in their home countries, such as earthquake preparedness projects. The APCSS has trained individuals from 100 countries, including a Fellows Program for implementing initiatives like earthquake preparedness projects. A U.S. project focused on gender inclusion has gained support within U.S. Pacific Command. The effectiveness of regional centers in a dynamic security environment is challenging to measure due to the difficulty in developing appropriate metrics. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, established in 1976, provides training in U.S. Department of Defense schools to military students from allied nations. Participants learn about democratic values, human rights, and civilian control of the military. The program aims to influence future leaders. The IMET program aims to influence future leaders from allied nations by providing training in U.S. Department of Defense schools. Participants must speak English and train to U.S. standards. The program seeks to professionalize foreign armed forces, strengthen regional relationships, and enhance self-defense capabilities of U.S. friends and allies. The Secretary of State determines participation, while the Department of Defense executes the program with strategic-level goals to train future leaders and create a better understanding. The IMET program aims to train future leaders from allied nations, enhance understanding of the United States, build rapport between military forces, and improve interoperability for Joint Operations. IMET funds have been used to train individuals, with increased vetting to prevent aid to human rights abusers. Overall, IMET is viewed favorably and increased scrutiny has helped prevent past issues. The IMET program aims to train future leaders from allied nations, enhance understanding of the United States, and improve military-to-military relations. It has been effective in building institutional and interpersonal linkages, providing the US with foreign policy opportunities. The Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs have been effective in creating informal linkages between U.S. and partner nation personnel, leading to key positions within national security architectures. These programs provide the United States with more avenues of interaction with other governments, although other variables also play a role in bilateral relationships. While promoting institutional and interpersonal connectivity, these programs may not always result in closer bilateral relations. Creating additional mechanisms for interaction does not guarantee a higher degree of relationship closeness. The United States engages with foreign security institutions to shape stable, likeminded partners and allies. This military engagement aims to increase partners with similar political and military objectives to manage security challenges. Cooperation may extend beyond military issues, potentially spilling over to non-military areas. During the Cold War, the United States implemented programs to enhance military and governance capabilities in NATO and Asia to counter the threat from the USSR. The Marshall Plan and mutual defense treaties were used to strengthen military capabilities and establish stable allies. An example is the U.S. support for Greece in the Greek civil war to prevent communist forces from prevailing. President Truman announced the \"Truman Doctrine\" in 1947 to provide urgent support to Greece and Turkey to prevent the rise of left-leaning regimes and maintain stability in the Near and Middle East. The Greek state was threatened by armed Communist groups, prompting UN investigation into border violations. The Greek government is struggling to cope with armed Communist groups, and the Greek army needs supplies and equipment to restore authority. The United States passed an act in 1947 to provide assistance to Greece and Turkey, authorizing aid in the form of military advisors and the transfer of articles and services. The American Mission for Aid to Greece (AMAG) oversaw the U.S. effort authorized under P.L. 80-75, with the United States Army Group-Greece transferring over $171 million of military aid to Greece from March to December 1947. This aid included hospitals, trucks, rifles, and aircraft, with the Army also assisting in organizing new militia units within the Greek National Army. The U.S. military trained Greek National Armed Forces and led them against insurgents. The Joint United States Military Advisory and Planning Group-Greece oversaw the advisory effort, with U.S. advisors increasing from less than 50 to over 200 by early 1948. Their tasks included monitoring military operations, formulating plans, advising on Greek Military use, providing operational advice, and ensuring aid effectiveness. The U.S. advisors took active leadership of Greek National Army units in battle during the Greek Civil War. Their efforts improved combat efficiency and contributed to the nationalist victory over the communists. However, long-term outcomes included a lack of institutionalized improvements in combat leadership and increased political activity within the GNA, leading to a coup d'etat in 1967. The U.S. advisors improved Greek combat leadership during the Greek Civil War, leading to victory by August 1949. This, along with communist commitment to conventional operations and U.S. material support, resulted in the attrition of communist forces. The Washington Treaty of 1949 established NATO, with countries signing economic and security agreements with the U.S. based on the concept of collective defense. Greece and Turkey joined NATO in 1952, committing to collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The U.S. recognized their dedication to security and believed their accession would strengthen the collective defense system. Developing stable, pro-Western security institutions in Greece created a strong NATO ally against the Soviet Union. The Truman Administration also focused on building partner militaries, such as in South Korea, to counter Soviet influence in the region. The division of the Korean Peninsula led to the creation of the Republic of Korea in 1948, with the US supporting Syngman Rhee as the leader in the south. In 1948, the United States supported Syngman Rhee as the leader of the Republic of Korea, while implementing a UN-agreed withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet military forces from the peninsula. An agreement was signed with the Republic of Korea for the organization and training of the Security Forces, leading to the establishment of the Korea Military Advisory Group (KMAG) in 1949 to train the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA). The Korea Military Advisory Group (KMAG) was established in 1949 to train the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) in the use of light weapons and artillery. After the North Korean invasion in 1950, KMAG grew to a wartime strength of 1,308 men and provided advisors to the ROKA down to battalion level. KMAG improved ROK Army organization, established training programs, and raised the quality of leadership through military schools. Progress was also made in tying ROKA logistical support with the country's economy. During the Korean War, the ROK Army showed significant improvement under the guidance of KMAG advisors. Despite initial obstacles, the ROK Army became 50 percent combat effective at the start of the war. Over time, the ROK Army continued to enhance its capabilities and played a crucial role in defending the country. The Truman Administration viewed the success of the ROK Army as a test of the United Nations' ability to influence international security. KMAG's efforts in training and improving the ROK Army were instrumental in its development. The United Nations internationalized the military effort in support of South Korea under a UN aegis by going to the Security Council in June 1950. With the Soviets absent, the Security Council passed a resolution condemning the North Korean attack and demanding a withdrawal. Forces from 15 nations were sent to the peninsula to stop the communist advance, with the strength of South Korean forces and government critical in maintaining the military coalition. This also strengthened the initial U.S. vision for the United Nations as an alliance to prevent state conflicts. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and Warsaw Initiative aimed to build former Warsaw Pact countries into stable NATO allies. This resulted in the accession of 12 nations into NATO. The Euro-Atlantic partnership programs like PfP and the Warsaw Initiative have integrated 12 former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO. However, Russia views these programs as destabilizing to European security and challenges the expansion of NATO. Ukraine and Georgia aspire to become full NATO members through PfP participation, seeking access to collective defense provisions. The extent of U.S. and NATO support during conflicts with Russia remains uncertain for these partners. The Euro-Atlantic partnership programs like PfP and the Warsaw Initiative have integrated former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO, causing concerns for Russia. Greece, South Korea, and the former Warsaw Pact show that BPC can aid in alliance building, with geopolitics playing a crucial role. Assistance from the Soviet Union to armed groups opposed by the US in Greece and South Korea incentivized unified approaches, strengthening NATO and U.N. organizations. Successive U.S. administrations have emphasized the importance of building partner capacity to spread stability in fragile states, using security cooperation and assistance. This strategy has been successful in integrating former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO, with the international community playing a significant role in the transition. The partners involved were politically recognized, making it easier to translate assistance into durable institutions. The United States prioritizes building security capability in weak states to prevent threats like terrorism and narco-trafficking. This approach aims to empower countries to manage their own security and reduce the need for U.S. intervention in potential conflicts. The United States focuses on building security capability in weak states to prevent threats like terrorism and narco-trafficking, aiming to empower countries to manage their own security and reduce the need for direct U.S. intervention. Congress lacks a solid foundation to evaluate the effectiveness of current BPC efforts, leading CRS to analyze strategic rationales for BPC programs and their effectiveness in achieving stated objectives. The CRS study analyzed the effectiveness of BPC efforts in achieving aims such as war termination and managing regional security challenges. Efforts based on building capable local forces for war termination were found to be resource-intensive and often not durable in the long term. Cases examined included Vietnam, Iraq, and ongoing efforts in Afghanistan. In managing regional security challenges, the United States aimed to build the capacity of other nations. The United States has faced challenges in building the capacity of other states to manage security issues independently. Examples include mixed results in security assistance to Pakistan for counter-terrorism, debates on U.S. support to AMISOM in Somalia, and NATO allies' failure to invest in defense capabilities in Europe. The United States trained and equipped proxies in conflicts to build post-war advantages with minimal involvement. Assistance to Colombia, the Philippines, and Afghanistan succeeded in the short term but failed to produce long-term allies. Conflict mitigation efforts involved strengthening local security forces post-conflict. The train and equip effort in Bosnia was successful in creating a balance of power. The strategic situation in the region changed after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, affecting conflict mitigation efforts in Egypt and Israel. The US military aid to Egypt has evolved since the Camp David Accords, potentially altering the rationale for conflict prevention. The US military aid to Egypt has evolved post-Camp David Accords, potentially influencing conflict prevention efforts and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood's influence in Egyptian politics. Enhancing military coalition participation through training and equipment has increased international involvement but also placed operational burdens on US forces. Building interpersonal and institutional linkages through programs like the DOD's regional centers and International Military Education and Training program has been perceived positively and requires minimal investment compared to other efforts to expand military coalition participation. Alliance building efforts post-World War II, such as in Greece and South Korea, were successful in transitioning countries into stable allies of the United States. The Soviet Union's opposition in these cases incentivized partner nations to align with the US. These efforts also contributed to the development of the United Nations and NATO, creating significant multilateral stakes in their success. Additionally, post-Cold War desires to strengthen the NATO-led European security architecture further drove alliance building efforts. The report analyzes the effectiveness of U.S. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in achieving stated objectives. The study suggests that BPC efforts may be linked to overall strategic objectives, but are not the sole reason for success or failure in foreign policy. The study evaluates the effectiveness of U.S. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in achieving national goals. There is debate on why some BPC efforts have been ineffective, with two main schools of thought: blaming execution issues or believing BPC will never work strategically. The study suggests that neither explanation fully captures the effectiveness of BPC programs, as they have shown mixed results in achieving intended strategic effects. The CRS study aimed to assess the effectiveness of U.S. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs in achieving strategic objectives. Despite challenges in execution, it remains unclear whether failures were due to BPC being an inappropriate approach or if success was hindered by execution issues. Consistency within DOD, the interagency, and international partners is highlighted as crucial for BPC effectiveness. Building Partner Capacity (BPC) efforts must be implemented consistently over longer time frames to show significant results. Success depends on factors outside of U.S. control, such as alignment of interests, legitimacy of governance institutions, and active participation of partner nations. Legitimate governance is crucial for the outcomes of BPC programs, but further research is needed to understand the variations in results. Successful BPC efforts require partners with political cohesion and capability for legitimate governance. Fragile or war-torn states often struggle with BPC effectiveness, but exceptions like the Philippines and Colombia show that significant reforms can lead to improved governance and reduced opposition support. Further research is needed to understand the role of legitimate governance in BPC effectiveness. Building partner capacity programs do not always result in meaningful strategic partnerships for the United States. In cases where alliances were formed, there was significant alignment between U.S. and partner interests, allowing the U.S. to deepen its connections with partners. The role of legitimate governance in facilitating BPC effectiveness remains unclear and requires further research. The international political context can impact the effectiveness of partner capacity programs for alliance building. BPC efforts may lead to unintended consequences and strategic challenges for the United States due to undefined partner roles and obligations. Partners may have different perspectives on U.S. assistance, making it a political statement internally. The United States engages in building partner capacity programs, which can have long-term implications. There is a need to clarify the purpose, roles, and effectiveness of these programs. Congress may need to scrutinize the current state of partner capacity programs. Congress may need to scrutinize the strategic context and effectiveness of partner capacity programs, including BPC and security cooperation activities. It is important to assess the conditions for success and understand DOD's spending on these programs. Congress should evaluate the effectiveness and strategic alignment of partner capacity programs, including BPC and security cooperation activities. It is crucial to assess the resources allocated to these programs and their long-term risks and unintended consequences. The effectiveness and strategic alignment of partner capacity programs, including BPC and security cooperation activities, need to be evaluated by Congress. It is important to assess resources, risks, and unintended consequences over time. The effectiveness and strategic alignment of partner capacity programs, including BPC and security cooperation activities, need to be evaluated by Congress. Questions arise about the selection criteria for partners, their legitimacy, and the management of diverging interests in the complex international security environment. Prioritizing BPC relative to other missions in the face of shrinking fiscal resources for DOD programs is a key consideration. The study aimed to understand the effectiveness of DOD's Building Partner Capacity programs in advancing U.S. strategic objectives. The results varied depending on the strategic rationale, raising more questions than answers. Further analysis is needed to clarify the conceptual underpinnings of BPC efforts and determine when it is appropriate for achieving U.S. strategic goals."
