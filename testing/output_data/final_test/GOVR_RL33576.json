    "content": "The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 (P.L. 110-5) was enacted into law on February 15, 2007, providing an estimated $144.4 billion in discretionary appropriations for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education activities. Actual FY2007 appropriations were not specified, and details will be available later. The Senate proposed $142.9 billion in discretionary funds for FY2007 L-HHS-ED activities. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $142.4 billion in discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED programs in FY2007, while the President's budget request was for $138.3 billion. The legislative status of FY2007 L-HHS-ED appropriations is summarized in Table 1. Data on appropriations are based on the House Committee on Appropriations' table, with Senate amounts based on S.Rept. 109-287. All data are subject to additional budgetary scorekeeping. The FY2007 data in this report reflect the provisions of H.R. 5647 and S. 3708 as reported by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Actual FY2007 appropriations were not specified by P.L. 110-5. FY2006 data in this report are post-rescission and account for a 1% cut required by P.L. 109-148. The FY2006 amounts in this report include funding from various supplemental appropriations, such as relief for the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and pandemic influenza preparedness. However, the data does not yet include supplemental appropriations enacted through P.L. 109-234 for the same purposes. The report discusses the President's proposal for FY2007 appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs and compares it to FY2006 amounts. It tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to discretionary programs, excluding mandatory programs like Medicare and Social Security. The L-HHS-ED bill is a significant appropriations bill that provides discretionary funds for federal departments and agencies, including the Social Security Administration. It is one of the largest sources of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs. The bill is controversial due to various related issues such as restrictions on federal funds for abortion, stem cell research, and human cloning. The Department of Defense (DOD) bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs, accounting for $399.2 billion (47.3%) of the estimated $843.3 billion total for all federal discretionary budget authority in FY2006. The L-HHS-ED bill accounted for $141.8 billion (16.8%) in the same year. This section summarizes major funding changes proposed for L-HHS-ED and related issues such as 302(b) allocations, advance appropriations, and earmarks for specific projects. Later sections provide details on individual L-HHS-ED departments and agencies. Table 2 summarizes the L-HHS-ED appropriations for FY2007, including both discretionary and mandatory appropriations. The curr_chunk discusses L-HHS-ED appropriations for FY2006 and FY2007, including discretionary program levels, current year appropriations, and advance appropriations. Program level appropriations encompass total discretionary funds in a bill, while current year appropriations cover discretionary funds for the current year and prior years. Advance appropriations are funds for future years. The curr_chunk discusses program level appropriations, current year appropriations, and advance appropriations for L-HHS-ED funding. Advance appropriations are funds for future years that are not available until after the fiscal year they are enacted. Scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations. Two summary measures, program level appropriations, and current year appropriations, are frequently used to track budget authority enacted in various years. The President's FY2007 budget request for L-HHS-ED was submitted to Congress shortly after the FY2006 appropriations were signed into law. Congressional consideration of appropriations requests focuses on proposed funding changes, with a highlight on changes of at least $100 million in discretionary budget authority for FY2007 compared to FY2006. The impact of a $100 million change varies depending on the size of the program being funded. The FY2007 budget request for L-HHS-ED included a $138.3 billion discretionary appropriations, which was $9.0 billion less than FY2006. The Department of Labor saw decreases in funding for job training programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, including cuts to WIA Adult Training, WIA Youth Training, WIA Dislocated Worker Assistance, and Unemployment Compensation. In FY2007, the Department of Labor requested $11.0 billion in discretionary appropriations, a 6.0% decrease from FY2006. The Department of Health and Human Services proposed an increase of $181 million for Community Health Centers but decreases for Health Professions programs, Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education, and Buildings and Facilities at the CDC. Additionally, a $118 million initiative for Fraud and Abuse Control at CMS was proposed, along with a decrease of $379 million for LIHEAP and the elimination of $550 million funding for SSBG discretionary activities. In FY2007, the Department of Health and Human Services requested $61.8 billion in discretionary appropriations, a 7.3% decrease from FY2006. The request included an increase of $1.1 billion for Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs, with initiatives such as $1.5 billion for High School Reform. Additionally, there was a proposal to eliminate Educational Technology State Grants and Safe and Drug-Free Schools State Grants, while requesting a $100 million increase for Special Education Part B Grants to States program. The FY2007 budget proposed significant cuts to education programs, including the elimination of the Perkins Vocational Education program and reductions in funding for Pell Grants, TRIO programs, and GEAR UP program. Additionally, there was a decrease in funding for education programs related to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. The Department of Education requested $54.3 billion in discretionary appropriations, a 5.7% decrease from the previous year. The budget also proposed eliminating two-year advance appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In FY2007, a $400 million advance appropriation was requested for SSI, with an additional $114 million for SSA Administrative Expenses. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5647 for FY2007 L-HHS-ED appropriations, with a delay in consideration due to issues like increasing the minimum wage. The House bill would provide $142.4 billion for L-HHS-ED programs in FY2007. The House bill for FY2007 L-HHS-ED appropriations includes discretionary appropriations of $142.4 billion. It differs from the President's request, with increased funding for DOL's WIA programs. Overall, the House bill would provide $11.5 billion in discretionary funds for DOL. The House bill for FY2006 provides $11.7 billion in funding for HHS, with increased funding for various programs including Health Professions, CHGME, Preventive Health, NIH, AHRQ, LIHEAP, and CSBG. Overall, the House bill would allocate $63.7 billion in funds. The House bill for FY2006 would provide $63.7 billion in discretionary funds for HHS, with $449 million allocated for various programs. For ED, ESEA programs would be funded at $22.8 billion, with funding for President's education initiatives like School Improvement Grants and Teacher Quality State Grants. Pell Grants would receive $13.0 billion, and TRIO programs would receive $828 million. Perkins Vocational Education and Safe and Drug-Free Schools State Grants would also receive funding. The House bill for FY2006 would provide $56.1 billion in discretionary funds for ED, with $828 million allocated for TRIO programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2007 L-HHS-ED appropriations as S. 3708, with consideration by the full Senate pending. Unlike the House bill, the Senate version does not amend minimum wage provisions. The Senate bill for FY2007 L-HHS-ED programs provides $142.9 billion in discretionary appropriations, differing from the House bill. It includes $11.6 billion for DOL programs, $0.1 billion more than the House, and $0.6 billion more than the request. The bill does not include a $325 million rescission of funds for WIA and related programs. The Senate bill for FY2007 L-HHS-ED programs provides $64.2 billion in discretionary appropriations for HHS programs, $116 million more for ESEA programs in aggregate, $100 million less for the School Improvement Grants Initiative, $160 million more for Teacher Quality State Grants, $150 million less for IDEA Part B Grants to States, and $402 million less for Pell Grants. The Pell Grant maximum award would not be increased. The Senate bill for FY2007 L-HHS-ED programs would provide $55.8 billion in discretionary appropriations for ED programs, $11.3 billion for related agencies, and $400 million for the CPB for FY2009. This is $1.8 billion less than ED funding in FY2006 and $0.1 billion less than funding for related agencies in FY2006. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 (P.L. 110-5) provides FY2007 appropriations for L-HHS-ED activities, allowing agencies flexibility to adjust funding levels. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and major agencies must report on FY2007 amounts within specific timelines. Prior to P.L. 110-5, continuing resolutions were necessary due to delayed appropriations. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 (P.L. 110-5) provided FY2007 appropriations for L-HHS-ED activities, with funding levels set at the \"current rate\" under FY2006 conditions. Limited funding actions were authorized to continue projects and activities, with new initiatives prohibited. Special restrictions were in place for programs with high spend-out rates to avoid impinging on final FY2007 funding decisions. Entitlements and mandatory activities were allowed obligations for payments due during the resolutions. House-reported or Senate-reported FY2007 L-HHS-ED appropriations were excluded from the funding calculation under the continuing resolution because the bills were not passed by October 1, 2006. The 1st Continuing Resolution, P.L. 109-289, provided temporary appropriations from October 1, 2006, through November 17, 2006. The 2nd Continuing Resolution, P.L. 109-369, extended the provisions of P.L. 109-289. Resolution, P.L. 109-369 extended provisions through December 8, 2006, and P.L. 109-383 extended them through February 15, 2007. Table 3 shows top-funded programs in FY2006, totaling $89.3 billion. Total L-HHS-ED discretionary funding was $147.3 billion in FY2006. Discretionary funding totaled $147.3 billion in FY2006. Despite a reduction in funds for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness in FY2007, these nine programs still make up at least 60% of the discretionary appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs. An across-the-board rescission required a 1% cut from most FY2006 discretionary appropriations, reducing total federal spending by approximately $8.5 billion. The across-the-board rescission in FY2006 required a 1% cut from most discretionary appropriations, reducing total federal spending by approximately $8.5 billion. Congress specified the process for the calculation of these reductions, with OMB responsible for determining the actual amounts for individual accounts. In the budget process, Congress establishes 302(a) allocations to determine spending totals for each committee. The House and Senate have not reached an agreement on the FY2007 budget resolution yet. The House resolution set a discretionary budget allocation of $872.8 billion. The House resolution established a 302(a) discretionary budget allocation of $872.8 billion for the Senate Committee on Appropriations, matching the House amount. The 302(a) discretionary allocation for FY2006 was $843.0 billion. In the second stage of the annual congressional budget process, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations separately establish the 302(b) allocations. The 302(b) allocations determine the discretionary budget authority for each appropriations bill, ensuring it does not exceed the 302(a) total. Adjustments can be made as bills progress, with allocations for FY2007 shown in Table 4. Advance appropriations delay funds from one fiscal year to the next. Advance appropriations delay funds from one fiscal year to the next, providing long-term budget information to recipients for better planning. They avoid current year allocation ceilings but must be counted in the year they become available for obligation, using up part of future allocation ceilings. In FY2002, the President's budget proposed eliminating advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs, including L-HHS-ED programs. Congress rejected the proposal, and advance appropriations have generally been provided at $19.3 billion, accounting for 13.7% of the L-HHS-ED current year discretionary total in FY2006. For FY2007, the President requested $18.9 billion in advance appropriations for L-HHS-ED. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills include both mandatory and discretionary funds, with advance appropriations totaling $19.3 billion for FY2007. Mandatory funding levels can be modified through changes in authorizing legislation. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills typically use reconciliation legislation to make changes in discretionary budget authority, not annual appropriations bills. Discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED have increased from $127.2 billion in FY2002 to an estimated $147.2 billion in FY2006, a 15.7% increase. Adjusted for inflation, the funds have grown from $139.9 billion in FY2002 to $147.2 billion in FY2006, a 5.2% increase. L-HHS-ED discretionary funds as a percent of total federal discretionary funds decreased from 17.3% in FY2002 to an estimated 14.9% in FY2006. Discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED increased from $127.2 billion in FY2002 to an estimated $147.2 billion in FY2006, a 15.7% increase. Earmarking of funds for specific projects in appropriations bills has become a contentious issue for Congress and the Administration, extending to L-HHS-ED projects. Earmarks designate specific amounts for specific recipients, bypassing the usual competitive distribution of awards by federal agencies. In recent years, there has been a debate over congressional earmarks in appropriations, particularly in L-HHS-ED programs. Earmarks in L-HHS-ED appropriations have generally increased over the past decade, but a significant change occurred in FY2006 when virtually all earmarks were eliminated. In FY2005, there were over 3,000 earmarks totaling nearly $1.2 billion, compared to only eight earmarks for $28.5 million in FY2006. This shift marked a departure from the previous practice of earmarking funds for specific projects, bypassing competitive distribution by federal agencies. The FY2006 discretionary appropriations for the Department of Labor (DOL) were $11.7 billion. The House bill would provide $11.5 billion, and the Senate bill would provide $11.6 billion. Mandatory DOL programs included in the L-HHS-ED bill were funded at $3.1 billion in FY2006. The President's FY2007 budget request for DOL proposed changes in funding for various activities, including a decrease in funding for WIA programs. WIA Adult Training would be reduced by $152 million, WIA Youth Training by $100 million, and WIA Dislocated Worker Assistance programs by $483 million in FY2007. In FY2007, the House bill proposed changes in funding for DOL programs. State grants would decrease by $315 million, while Unemployment Compensation would increase by $142 million. WIA programs would receive $5.0 billion, with Adult Training getting $854 million and Dislocated Worker Assistance receiving $1.5 billion. The House bill for FY2007 proposed a rescission of $325 million for WIA and other programs under the TES account. An amendment by Representative Steny Hoyer was approved to increase the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour by January 1, 2009. The Senate bill differs from the House bill by at least $100 million for several DOL programs, with no rescission of prior-year appropriations for WIA or TES activities. The Senate bill for FY2007 did not include a rescission of $325 million for WIA and other programs under the TES account, unlike the House bill. Unemployment Compensation would be funded at $2.55 billion, $103 million less than the House amount, and the minimum wage provisions would not be modified. The Department of Labor's FY2006 discretionary appropriations were $66.7 billion, with a budget request of $61.8 billion for FY2007. The House bill proposed $63.7 billion, while the Senate bill proposed $64.2 billion. Mandatory HHS programs in FY2006 were funded at $411.6 billion, including Medicaid Grants to States, Payments to Medicare Trust Funds, Foster Care, Adoption, Family Support Payments, and the Social Services Block Grant. The President's FY2007 budget request for HHS proposed increased support for community health centers and a fraud control initiative for Medicare and Medicaid. Funding reductions were proposed for health resources, disease control, substance abuse prevention, programs for children and families, and services for the aging. Discretionary spending changes of at least $100 million were requested for various HHS programs, including a $181 million increase for Community Health Centers and a $136 million decrease for Health Professions programs other than nursing. Funding cuts proposed in the President's FY2007 budget for HHS include reductions in nursing, Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education, Buildings and Facilities at CDC, LIHEAP, SSBG, and CSBG. Additionally, a Fraud and Abuse Control initiative at CMS would be funded, and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness was also addressed. In FY2006, $630 million would be eliminated from Pandemic Influenza Preparedness funding. The House bill for HHS programs includes increases in funding for Health Professions, CHGME, Health Care-Related Facilities, Preventive Health Block Grant, and NIH. In FY2006, funding for various HHS programs would be adjusted. The National Institutes of Health would receive $28.25 billion, $100 million less than requested. LIHEAP would receive $2.1 billion, $329 million more than requested. An additional $1.0 billion was made available to LIHEAP. The CSBG would be funded at $449 million. The CHGME would be funded at $200 million, $100 million less than the House amount. The CDC Infectious Diseases would be funded at $1.71 billion, $116 million less than the House amount. The CDC Infectious Diseases program would be funded at $1.71 billion, $116 million less than the House amount. The NIH would receive $28.55 billion, $301 million more than the House amount. The CSBG would receive $630 million, $181 million less than the House amount. Restrictions on federal funds for abortions, known as the \"Hyde Amendments,\" apply to L-HHS-ED appropriations. The Hyde Amendments restrict federal funding for abortions in L-HHS-ED appropriations. Funding for abortions was initially limited to cases where the life of the mother was endangered, but was later expanded to include cases of rape or incest. The provisions were extended in FY1998 to prohibit federal funds from being used to buy managed care packages that include abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Additional provisions were added in FY1999 to ensure restrictions apply to all trust fund programs and to prevent Medicare + Choice plans from requiring abortion services. No changes were made from FY2000 to FY2004, but in FY2005, a new restriction was added. The FY2006 L-HHS-ED appropriations included the \"Weldon Amendment\" and Hyde restrictions to prevent discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. President Bush allowed federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells limited to existing stem cell lines, which have potential medical benefits. The NIH developed a registry of 78 embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research, but only 22 are currently available. Scientists are concerned about the quality and availability of these stem cell lines, and some believe new lines, possibly from cloned embryos, are needed. The use of stem cells raises ethical issues due to the destruction of embryos. This issue may be revisited during annual appropriations considerations. The annual appropriations for L-HHS-ED funds have included a prohibition on using NIH funds for creating or destroying human embryos for research since FY1996. This restriction, introduced by Representative Jay Dickey, has remained largely unchanged and was continued in the FY2006 appropriations. The current provision can be found in \u00a7509 of P.L. 109-149. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33540 on Stem Cell Research and CRS Report RL31358 on Human Cloning. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on topics such as human cloning, abortion legislation, AIDS funding, stem cell research, child care grants, and federal research funding. The authors of these reports are listed as well. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on various CRS reports related to programs and funding in the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the National Institutes of Health, and the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program. It also includes a link to the HHS website for budget information and an appropriations table for HHS offices and major programs. The appropriations details for HHS offices and major programs are shown in Table 10. The FY2006 discretionary appropriations for the Department of Education were $57.6 billion, with a budget request of $54.3 billion for FY2007. The House bill proposed $56.1 billion, and the Senate bill proposed $55.8 billion. A mandatory ED program included in the FY2007 bill was the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants program funded at $2.7 billion in FY2006. Additionally, a one-time appropriation of $4.3 billion in FY2006 was allocated for Pell Grants shortfall elimination. Federal support for education has been a priority, with increased funding for programs and ten new education programs proposed under the FY2007 budget request. The President's FY2007 budget request proposed changes for education programs, including increasing funding for some programs and proposing new initiatives. However, funding for 42 existing programs would be eliminated, leading to a reduction in total discretionary funding for ED programs. Key proposals included increasing Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs by $1.1 billion, introducing five K-12 education initiatives, and making changes to Educational Technology State Grants. The FY2007 budget proposal includes the elimination of several education programs, such as Educational Technology State Grants and Safe and Drug-Free Schools State Grants. Funding for Special Education Part B Grants would increase by $100 million, while Perkins Vocational Education program would be terminated. Pell Grants program would see a reduction of $385 million, and the one-time appropriation to eliminate the Pell Grants shortfall would not be repeated. The FY2007 budget proposal includes significant changes to education funding. Repayments to revolving funds for higher education institutions would create a negative appropriation of $664 million. Student Aid Administrative Costs would increase by $615 million in response to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. TRIO programs would be reduced by $448 million, GEAR UP program would be eliminated, and Hurricane Recovery programs would see funding changes. The FY2007 budget proposal for education includes changes in funding. The House bill differs from the President's budget request, with ESEA programs receiving $22.8 billion, $1.6 billion less than requested. School Improvement Grants would get $200 million, while other initiatives like Math Now and High School Reform would not receive funding. Teacher Quality State Grants would receive $2.6 billion, $300 million less than requested. Safe and Drug-Free Schools State Grants would receive $310 million, a decrease from the previous year. State Grants would receive $310 million, a decrease from the $347 million provided in FY2006; Perkins Vocational Education would receive $1.3 billion, the same as in FY2006; Pell Grants would receive $13.0 billion, $349 million more than requested; Pell Grant maximum award would be increased by $100 to $4,150; Perkins Loan Assets would not be recalled; TRIO programs would receive $828 million, $448 million more than requested; GEAR UP would receive $303 million; ESEA programs in aggregate would receive $23.0 billion, $116 million more than the House amount of $22.8 billion. The School Improvement Grants Initiative would be funded at $100 million, Teacher Quality State Grants at $2.7 billion, Innovative Education Block Grant would receive no funds, Educational Technology State Grants at $272 million, and IDEA Part B Grants to States at $10.6 billion. Pell Grants would receive $13.0 billion with a maximum award of $4,150. In FY2007, Pell Grants would receive $12.6 billion, with a maximum award of $4,050 under the Senate bill and $4,150 under the House bill. There has been ongoing debate about the funding levels compared to authorization levels since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001. Some argue that authorized funding levels for education programs are necessary for new requirements, while others see them as just maximum amounts. Past trends show programs are often funded below authorized levels. The ESEA programs, including Title I Grants, 21CCLC, Education Block Grant, School Choice, and FIE, had an authorized amount of $28.9 billion for FY2007, with a requested appropriation of $15.6 billion. The House bill proposed $14.3 billion, and the Senate bill proposed $14.2 billion for these programs. The IDEA Part B Grants to States program authorized state payments up to 40% of the national average per-pupil expenditure for children with disabilities ages 3-21. Congress addressed authorization ceilings in 2004 with P.L. 108-446, specifying amounts for FY2005 through FY2011. Appropriations have never reached the authorized levels, with significant gaps between authorized and appropriated amounts in FY2006 and FY2007. The Senate bill would provide $10.6 billion for FY2007, with some viewing the differences in funding as shortfalls. Most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year, with funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year in some L-HHS-ED programs. Education formula grant programs receive appropriations that are available for obligation to states on July 1 of the same year and remain available for 15 months until the end of the following fiscal year. This forward funding approach allows school officials to plan budgets in advance. Pell Grants for undergraduates, however, face uncertainty in predicting individual student program costs. The FY2007 appropriations primarily support Pell Grants for the 2007-2008 academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, Pell Grant funds are available for obligation for two fiscal years. Advance appropriations delay availability of funds until July 1, 2007, instead of October 1, 2006. If the forward funding date is postponed to October 1, 2007, the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance. The FY2007 appropriations primarily support Pell Grants for the 2007-2008 academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, Pell Grant funds are available for obligation for two fiscal years. Advance appropriations delay availability of funds until July 1, 2007, instead of October 1, 2006. If the forward funding date is postponed to October 1, 2007, the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance. The FY2007 budget request for Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs for the Education for the Disadvantaged was $12.7 billion, including forward funding and advance appropriations. The impact of these changes in funding provisions is minimal at the program or service level. The three-month delay in availability of funds for school expenditures causes a technical difference in budget scorekeeping. Forward funding is included in the current fiscal year's allocation, while advance appropriations are counted in the following year. This shift allows for a one-time change in scoring discretionary appropriations. For more details, refer to CRS Report RS20441 and CRS Report RL32867. The 109th Congress has proposed reauthorization for various education programs, including Adult Education and Literacy, Campus-Based Student Financial Aid Programs, Education for the Disadvantaged, Education-Related Hurricane Relief, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, K-12 Education Implementation, K-12 Education Programs, and The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act: Reauthorization and Appropriations, Student Loans and FY2006 Budget Reconciliation, 21st Century Community Learning Centers: Background and Funding, Advance Appropriations, Forward Funding, and Advance Funding details appropriations for ED offices and major programs. FY2006 discretionary appropriations were $11.4 billion, with a $11.2 billion budget request for FY2007. House bill proposes $11.0 billion, Senate bill proposes $11.3 billion for related agencies. The Senate bill would provide $11.3 billion for related agencies, including funding for the Supplemental Security Income program. The President's FY2007 budget proposed discretionary spending changes for various agencies, but did not request funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in FY2009. The CPB has been funded at $400 million for FY2008, $400 million for FY2007, and $396 million for FY2006. Additionally, the Supplemental Security Income discretionary activities would be increased by $271 million. The House bill differs from the President's budget request by at least $100 million for one program in the related agencies of the L-HHS-ED bill. The Senate bill differs from the House bill by at least $100 million for several programs administered by the related agencies. The CPB would receive $400 million in advance appropriations for FY2009. SSA Administrative Expenses would be funded at $6.2 billion, $158 million less than the House amount. The House provided $6.4 billion in FY2006, with a request for $6.5 billion. Various reports and agencies are mentioned, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Committee. Some related agencies may not have FY2007 budget information available. The curr_chunk provides a list of government agencies and their respective websites, along with budget details for L-HHS-ED related agencies. It also includes terminology and web resources for reference. The curr_chunk discusses the federal budget process, including advance appropriation, scorekeeping, and different types of appropriations. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments for specified purposes. Annual appropriations are provided in appropriations acts, while most permanent appropriations are in substantive law. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur financial obligations through appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. It also includes subsidy costs for direct loans and loan guarantees. The budget resolution sets forth the congressional budget for at least five fiscal years, including various budget totals and functional allocations. Discretionary spending is provided in annual appropriations acts, while entitlement authority represents a legally binding obligation for payments to eligible recipients. Entitlement authority is a legally binding obligation funded by annual or permanent appropriations acts. Forward funding provides budget authority that becomes available after the fiscal year's start and remains into the next year. Mandatory spending includes budget authority from laws other than appropriations, entitlement authority, and the Food Stamp program. Rescission cancels previously enacted budget authority, while scorekeeping tracks congressional budgetary actions. Supplemental appropriations provide funds in addition to regular appropriations. Websites for budget and appropriations information can be found at various House and Senate committee sites, as well as the Congressional Budget Office, Congressional Research Service, Government Accountability Office, Government Printing Office, and Office of Management & Budget. The budget authority for federal programs in FY2006 was estimated at $2,757.8 billion. Budget authority for all federal programs in FY2006 was estimated at $2,757.8 billion. L-HHS-ED departments and related agencies had a budget authority of $1,413.8 billion, accounting for 51.3% of the federal total. The L-HHS-ED appropriations subcommittees had control over $147.2 billion in discretionary funds, while the remaining $1,266.6 billion was allocated to entitlements and other mandatory programs. The L-HHS-ED agency receives appropriations for mandatory activities annually, covering entitlements and obligations. Federal administrative costs for these programs are subject to discretionary appropriations. Major programs include Supplemental Security Income, Black Lung Disability payments, Foster Care, Social Services Block Grant, Vocational Rehabilitation, Medicare, and Medicaid. Other appropriations bills make up a small portion of agency funding. The Corporation for National and Community Service, FDA, Indian Health Service, CDC, NIH, and other HHS programs receive funding from various appropriations bills outside of the L-HHS-ED bill. The L-HHS-ED agency receives $801.6 billion in funds outside of the annual appropriations process, provided through trust funds and mandatory authorities. Programs funded include Unemployment Compensation, Medicare, TANF, Student Loans, and Social Security benefits, with funding levels modified through authorization statutes rather than appropriations committees."
