    "content": "The \"Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2016\" allows for expanded eligibility for the use of Form S-3 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This revision permits securities to be registered under certain conditions, such as a minimum aggregate market value of common equity or having a class of common equity securities listed on a national securities exchange. TITLE II--MICRO-OFFERING SAFE HARBOR\n\nSEC. 201. EXEMPTIONS FOR MICRO-OFFERINGS. Section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 is amended to include transactions meeting the requirements of subsection (f), which involves the sale of securities by an issuer to purchasers with a pre-existing relationship with key individuals of the issuer. The Securities Act of 1933 is amended to allow exemptions for transactions where the issuer sells securities to no more than 35 purchasers within a 12-month period, with the total amount not exceeding $500,000. This exemption is not available if there is disqualification. The Securities Act of 1933 allows exemptions for transactions involving the sale of securities to a limited number of purchasers within a specified period and amount. However, this exemption is not available if any person described in subparagraph (B) would trigger disqualification under section 230.506(d) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations. Persons described in subparagraph (B) include the issuer, any predecessor or affiliated issuer, directors, executive officers, and beneficial owners of 20 percent or more. Beneficial owners of 20 percent or more of the issuer's outstanding voting equity securities, promoters connected with the issuer, investment managers of pooled investment funds, persons receiving remuneration for solicitation, and general partners or managing members of investment managers or solicitors are all included in the list of persons described in subparagraph (B) for disqualification under section 230.506(d) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations. The Securities Act of 1933 is amended to include exemptions under state regulations for certain individuals involved in investment management or solicitation. TITLE III--PRIVATE PLACEMENT IMPROVEMENT\n\nSEC. 301. REVISIONS TO SEC REGULATION D. The Securities and Exchange Commission will revise Regulation D within 45 days of the enactment of the Act. The revision will require issuers to file a single notice of sales for each new offering of securities under Rule 506 of Regulation D, no earlier than 15 days after the first sale. The Commission will make Form D filing information available to state securities commissions. Exemptions under Rule 506 of Regulation D will not be conditioned on filing Form D. Issuers are not required to submit general solicitation materials for Rule 506(c) offerings unless requested by the Commission under specific sections of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission will revise Rule 501(a) of Regulation D to include knowledgeable employees of private funds as accredited investors for Rule 506 offerings. The House of Representatives passed the document on September 8, 2016, attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
