    "content": "The \"Consumer Freedom Protection Act\" is the short title of this Act. Any amendments or repeals made by this Act will be considered as amendments or repeals to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless specified otherwise. The Congress acknowledges the limited authorization of health claims for dietary supplements by the FDA since 1990, despite extensive scientific research on nutrients' effects on health. This lack of authorization is seen as a violation of first amendment rights and hinders informed consumer choice in the marketplace. The Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly denied health claims that would inform consumers about the link between nutrients and diseases, hindering the dissemination of truthful information. The FDA has failed to fully implement the first amendment mandate in Pearson v. Shalala, continuing to suppress health claims instead of authorizing them. SEC. 3. FOOD AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENT CLAIMS. Conforming Amendments to Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) include inserting references to \"dietary supplement\" in various paragraphs related to food labeling and claims. This includes specifying that claims related to diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing diseases or health conditions are included in the characterization of a relationship between a product and health benefits. In amendments to Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343), references to \"dietary supplement\" are added in various paragraphs related to food labeling and claims. This includes changes to specify the inclusion of claims related to diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing diseases or health conditions in the characterization of a product's health benefits. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 100 days of receiving a claim for a dietary supplement, unless there is no scientific evidence supporting the claim or it is deemed misleading. If no decision is made within 100 days, the claim is automatically authorized. The final decision denying the claim results in the claim being deemed authorized with a disclaimer. If the claimant objects to the denial, they can petition for a review with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction and venue for certain purposes related to the United States Constitution. If the Court declares the Secretary's denial invalid, the Secretary must pay the claimant's costs and fees within 60 days. Additionally, health claims based on government statements are subject to specific regulations under Section 403 of the U.S. Code. The FDA regulations require that health claims based on government statements must either be verbatim quotations with proper citation or nonmisleading paraphrases with citation to a scientific body of the United States Government. The FDA regulations require health claims based on government statements to be verbatim quotations or nonmisleading paraphrases with proper citation. The Secretary may require a disclaimer for claims that lack conclusive evidence or have conflicting evidence. The Secretary must authorize claims within 100 days of submission, or they are considered authorized. Nutrient content claims based on government statements must be verbatim quotations with proper citation. The Secretary must authorize claims within 100 days of submission, or they are considered authorized. Nutrient content claims based on government statements must be verbatim quotations with proper citation, including author, publication title, date, and page number. The Secretary may require disclaimers for nutrient content claims based on government statements to avoid misleading connotations. A published statement by a scientific body of the United States is defined as any statement in a document published by a US Government entity. SEC. 4. STATEMENTS OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT. Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by striking the last sentence of paragraph (r)(6). SEC. 5. WITHDRAWAL OF ORDERS AND RULES; AUTHORIZATION OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS. The health claims referenced in Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 650 (D.C. Cir. 1999) are approved with a disclaimer. Interim rules on health claims based on authoritative statements published in June 1998 are null and void. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will revoke interim rules on health claims, declaring them null and void. Orders denying health claims issued by the FDA before the effective date of this Act are also null and void, to be reevaluated according to the new provisions."
