    "content": "Naturalization is the process through which immigrants become U.S. citizens by meeting requirements outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. It is a voluntary act seen as a milestone in immigrants' assimilation and integration into American society. United States citizenship is viewed as a unique bond based on civic ideals and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Naturalization requirements for U.S. citizenship include residence, good moral character, English proficiency, and knowledge of U.S. civics. Benefits of naturalization include voting rights, security from deportation, job access, and passport privileges. Despite advantages, many eligible lawful permanent residents have not naturalized. Congress is considering reforms to U.S. immigration laws that could impact naturalization policy. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act includes provisions to grant legal status to unauthorized aliens, increase the number of LPRs admitted, and ease naturalization requirements. These changes would expand the number of immigrants eligible to naturalize. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act and other bills propose changes to immigration laws affecting naturalization policy. These changes would impact admission levels, naturalization criteria, and the number of immigrants eligible to become U.S. citizens. The report reviews naturalization rights and obligations, the process, recent trends, and policy issues. The focus is on the naturalization of lawful permanent residents. U.S. citizens have exclusive rights such as voting in elections, sponsoring family members for permanent residence, and accessing various benefits. They also have privileges like diplomatic protection abroad and eligibility for certain jobs and elective offices. U.S. citizens can sponsor certain relatives for permanent residence without numerical limits, allowing them to immigrate immediately. In contrast, LPRs must sponsor relatives within limited family preference categories, requiring a wait for a visa. Naturalization provides access to public benefits restricted to citizens or requiring 5-7 years of LPR status. Citizenship is permanent, relieving continuous residency requirements for LPRs. Naturalization allows foreign-born individuals to become U.S. citizens, granting them the right to vote, participate in jury duty, and run for elective office. It symbolizes a commitment to the new country and offers economic benefits. Congress has introduced legislation to facilitate naturalization and discourage dual citizenship. Naturalization grants foreign-born individuals U.S. citizenship, providing economic benefits such as significant wage gains. To qualify, LPRs must meet age, residency, moral character, language, and knowledge requirements. USCIS reviews naturalization petitions for eligibility, including security checks and interviews. To become a naturalized citizen, LPRs must undergo various checks, interviews, and exams. They must prove lawful entry, reside in the US for at least five years, with half of that time physically present, and live in the state where they apply for at least three months. Denied applicants can request a hearing. Upon approval, they must take an oath of allegiance and renounce allegiance to any foreign state. The period of continuous residence required for naturalization can be interrupted by an absence of over a year, unless the alien is employed abroad by certain entities. Certain classes of LPRs have exemptions or shorter residency periods. Spouses of American citizens have a residency requirement of three years and a physical presence requirement of one and a half years. Other special classes may have modified residency requirements. Petitioners must demonstrate good character to be eligible for naturalization. To be eligible for naturalization, petitioners must show good moral character during the statutory period. Certain crimes and immoral acts can prevent naturalization, including aggravated felonies like murder, rape, and fraud exceeding $10,000 in losses. USCIS examiners may consider additional factors. The USCIS naturalization examiner may assess good moral character beyond what is specified in the INA, considering factors like failure to pay child support and adultery. The INA prohibits naturalization of those opposed to government law, favoring totalitarian forms of governance, or deserters from the Armed Forces. Applicants must demonstrate English proficiency, but waivers are available for older individuals with long-term residency. Naturalization applicants must pass a civics test in their native language if the language requirement is waived. Special consideration is given to aliens over 65 years old who have lived in the US for at least 20 years. Waivers are available for those with disabilities. LPRs in the military receive expedited processing. Applicants file Form N-400 with a $680 fee, have fingerprints recorded, and attend interviews testing English and civics knowledge. During the naturalization interview, applicants are tested on their English ability and civics knowledge. They can choose to take a standardized civics test or be quizzed by the INS examiner. Successful applicants become American citizens after taking the Oath of Allegiance in a naturalization ceremony. LPRs need to bring USCIS documents, including their green card, to the ceremony. USCIS issues a naturalization certificate after the Oath is taken. The INA specifies three ways for a child to obtain U.S. citizenship through parents, depending on birth location and residence. A child born in the U.S. automatically acquires citizenship, while a child born overseas and residing in the U.S. can acquire citizenship if certain criteria are met. A child born outside the United States can acquire U.S. citizenship if a U.S. citizen parent applies on their behalf. The parent must meet certain criteria, including residing in the U.S. for a specified period of time. The INA provides provisions for foreign-born military personnel to apply for naturalization, with exemptions from residence and physical presence requirements. Peacetime service requires at least one year of service, while wartime service also exempts from residency requirements. Applicants must be lawful permanent residents. Since 2002, noncitizens serving honorably in the U.S. armed forces on or after September 11, 2001 may file immediately for citizenship. Military naturalization applicants are exempt from USCIS naturalization fees and may have their time abroad counted as residence and physical presence in the United States. Spouses of U.S. armed forces personnel stationed overseas who apply for naturalization may complete the process abroad. Since August 2009, the Naturalization at Basic Training Program allows enlistees to naturalize upon graduation. Citizenship obtained through military service may be revoked for \"other than honorable conditions.\" In FY2012, USCIS naturalized 8,693 military service members. President Obama directed federal departments to implement benefits for same-sex legally married couples after the Supreme Court decision on DOMA in June 2013. For naturalization, USCIS treats same-sex spouses the same as opposite-sex spouses. Time spent in marital union with a same-sex spouse counts towards the required residence period. Naturalized citizens must take an oath renouncing allegiance to foreign powers and pledging loyalty to the United States. Naturalization applicants must take an oath of allegiance to the United States, renouncing any hereditary titles or orders of nobility in a foreign state. The oath may be modified for conscientious objectors or those who prefer to affirm rather than swear. Applicants can choose to have the oath administered by USCIS or an immigration judge in a public ceremony. Dual citizenship refers to an individual holding citizenship for two countries simultaneously, based on each country's laws. For example, a child born to U.S. citizen parents in a foreign country may have dual nationality. Similarly, a child born in the U.S. to foreign-born parents may acquire both U.S. citizenship and their parents' citizenship. Some countries allow dual citizenship, while others disfavor it due to concerns over loyalty. In recent years, countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil have made it easier for expatriates to naturalize in other countries without losing their original citizenship. The United States does not prohibit other countries from considering individuals as their citizens, but upon naturalization, the U.S. views them as renouncing other citizenships. Some individuals may have concerns about foreign countries not being aware that they have renounced their citizenship upon naturalizing in the United States. Legislative proposals have been made to address concerns about divided national loyalties. U.S. citizens can lose their citizenship voluntarily through expatriation or involuntarily through denaturalization, which includes acts such as voluntary naturalization in a foreign country, making a formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign country, or serving in the armed forces of a foreign country engaged in hostilities against the United States. Expatriation or loss of nationality can occur through various means such as acquiring foreign nationality, renouncing citizenship before a U.S. officer, formal written renunciation during a state of war, or conviction of certain crimes. Intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship is necessary for expatriation, and it does not have a retrospective effect. Loss of citizenship does not affect derivative citizens like spouses and children. A naturalized citizen may be denaturalized for illegal procurement of citizenship, concealment of facts, or misrepresentation. Acts post-naturalization can be evidence of misrepresentation. For instance, joining a subversive group within five years of naturalization raises a presumption of concealment or misrepresentation. Citizenship of derivative citizens like spouses and children is not affected by expatriation. Citizenship can be revoked if a naturalized citizen is convicted of illegal procurement or less than honorable discharge from the U.S. armed services. The revocation process must be initiated by a U.S. district attorney in the district where the citizen resides. The court handling the revocation must cancel the certificate of naturalization and notify the Attorney General. Denaturalization returns a person to their former alien status, effective as of the original date of naturalization. The denaturalization process can revoke citizenship, effective from the original date of naturalization. Derivative citizens also lose citizenship under certain circumstances, such as procurement by concealment of a material fact or membership in a subversive organization. The number of naturalization petitions has increased significantly over the past two decades, attributed to legislation and demographic factors. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalized 2.8 million LPRs who became eligible to naturalize in the mid-1990s. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased legal immigration limits, leading to more naturalization petitions by the mid-1990s. USCIS attributed the 2007 surge in naturalization to various factors. The number of legal permanent residents admitted to the US increased over the years, enlarging the pool of eligible individuals. The number of naturalizations increased from 537,000 to 757,000 between 2004 and 2012, while the number of petitions denied declined from 103,000 to 66,000 during the same period. Despite a rise in naturalization petitions filed, the naturalized percentage of the foreign-born population has not kept pace with overall growth. In 2010, the naturalized percentage of foreign-born individuals in the United States was at its lowest level since 1920, at 43.7%. Out of the 40.8 million foreign-born residents in 2012, 18.7 million were naturalized citizens, while 8.8 million were eligible but had not naturalized yet. The naturalized proportion of LPRs has increased from 38% in 1990 to 56% in 2011. Factors like country of origin significantly affect naturalization rates, with foreign-born individuals from Mexico and other Latin American countries having low naturalized percentages due to various reasons. The naturalization rates of foreign-born individuals vary based on their country of origin. Immigrants from countries like Vietnam, Iran, and Taiwan have high naturalization rates exceeding 70%, while those from Mexico and other Latin American countries have lower rates. Factors such as geographic distance, political systems, and refugee flows influence naturalization proportions. African and Asian immigrants naturalize sooner, spending a median of five to six years as LPRs before naturalizing, compared to immigrants from North America who spend a median of 10 years. Immigrants from North America spent a median of 10 years as LPRs before naturalizing. Younger immigrants, those in professional occupations, and from Asian, European, and English-speaking countries are more likely to naturalize. N-400 naturalization petitions account for almost 15% of all petitions received by USCIS. The USCIS agency handles N-400 naturalization petitions, with processing times averaging 4.5 months. Potential reforms to U.S. immigration laws could impact the number of legal immigrants admitted and increase the number of naturalization petitions filed. USCIS has made efforts to modernize its processes and has shown the ability to handle sudden influxes of immigration petitions. Recent evidence of USCIS's ability to process large influxes of immigration petitions was seen with the DACA initiative announced in June 2012. By August 2013, USCIS had received and processed 588,725 DACA petitions. The increasing number of pending petitions since August 2012 suggests a potential slowdown in processing other USCIS petitions. USCIS charges naturalization applicants $680, raising concerns about discouraging naturalization due to costs and whether the fee accurately reflects processing costs. The naturalization fee reflects USCIS's cost to process applications and may affect the volume of petitions filed. Fee increases in certain years were followed by declining petition volume, but other factors also contribute to application volume increases. Fee increases are part of overall USCIS fee adjustments to cover the costs of providing immigration services. Proponents argue that immigration benefits should be self-financing. Since 2003, Congress has shown interest in expediting naturalizations for military personnel and their relatives. Legislation has focused on streamlining procedures and extending immigration benefits to immediate relatives of U.S. service members. In the 113th Congress, a legislative proposal aimed to make naturalization easier for noncitizen U.S. service members who have served under honorable conditions in support of contingency operations. This proposal would also eliminate certain naturalization requirements for service members with combat awards and remove the provision allowing U.S. citizens to renounce citizenship during wartime. Several federal agencies, including USCIS Office of Citizenship and U.S. Department of Education, support English and civics instruction for immigrants. Legislative proposals aim to promote English literacy and civics education for immigrants preparing to naturalize, with provisions for older and disabled individuals. Despite existing federal adult education programs and those run by nonprofit organizations, there is still high demand for adult English language and civics education services. More immigrant adults could benefit from English literacy education according to the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy and U.S. Census data. USCIS is advocating for innovative approaches to increase immigrants' access to quality English learning opportunities and adult educators' access to civics education training. Suggestions include a White House committee on immigrant integration or a foundation affiliated with USCIS that accepts private donations to support immigrant integration programs. Additionally, a public-private partnership is recommended to secure a stable stream of private funding for naturalization promotion efforts. In 2008, USCIS revised the naturalization civics exam to be more conceptual and consistent across its offices, with a pass rate of 92%. However, concerns remain for LPRs, especially those aged 65 and older, about passing the English and civics exams. Opposition to funding for naturalization efforts argues that English proficiency and civics education are the responsibility of immigrants, not taxpayers. Increasing numbers of individuals are seeking disability exceptions for the naturalization exam. The legislative proposal aims to expand exemptions from the English and civics exam requirement for naturalization based on age, physical/mental disability, and years of U.S. residency. Suggestions include emphasizing allegiance to the United States in the naturalization oath, conducting all ceremonies in English, and implementing a uniform language testing standard. Some legislators are reconsidering birthright citizenship in the U.S., which grants citizenship to anyone born in the country regardless of parental legal status. Recent Congresses have discussed revising the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Critics of the naturalization process cite high costs as a barrier to accessibility. Some advocates propose reforms to make naturalization fees more affordable and accessible by increasing awareness of fee waivers and providing more payment options. They also argue that the complex and unclear application forms may deter prospective petitioners, suggesting simplifying the language to improve accessibility. Additionally, concerns are raised about residency requirements disadvantaging LPRs working overseas. Overseas individuals must wait to fulfill naturalization requirements in the United States, prolonging the process.
