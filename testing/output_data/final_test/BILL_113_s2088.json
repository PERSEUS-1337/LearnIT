    "content": "The \"American Natural Gas Security and Consumer Protection Act\" authorizes the exportation of natural gas. The Natural Gas Act is amended to authorize the importation and exportation of natural gas. No person can export natural gas without the Secretary of Energy's authorization. The United States can export natural gas to a foreign country upon approval from the Secretary of Energy if it aligns with the public interest. The Secretary may grant the application with necessary modifications and conditions. No order can be issued before final regulations are in place. The Secretary must conduct a NEPA review to determine the public interest. The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires the Secretary of Energy to analyze the environmental impact of exporting natural gas. Final regulations must be issued within 2 years to determine if gas exports are in the public interest. The Secretary of Energy must analyze each application for natural gas export to determine if it is in the public interest by considering current and projected US natural gas demands, production, price, effects on energy expenditures, and the economy. The Secretary of Energy analyzes the effects of natural gas exports on the US economy, jobs, manufacturing, wages, investment, energy security, and domestic natural gas supplies. The Secretary of Energy analyzes the potential for natural gas use in transportation, industrial, and electricity sectors, the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, national security and foreign policy implications, domestic natural gas supply and availability, effects on infrastructure, and the balance of trade in the United States. The Secretary of Energy considers various factors when authorizing natural gas exports, including national security, foreign policy implications, domestic supply, and trade balance in the United States. Exemptions apply if the gas is exported to meet specific requirements under certain acts."
