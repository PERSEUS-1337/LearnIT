    "content": "BOEM manages U.S. offshore oil and gas leasing, renewable energy development, and marine mineral leasing, aiming to balance energy supply and environmental protection. Responsibilities include developing leasing programs, managing lease sales, reviewing plans, facilitating renewable energy projects, conducting evaluations, and performing environmental reviews. Funding comes from discretionary appropriations and offsetting collections from OCS rental receipts and fees. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $175.1 million for BOEM, with $94.9 million from offsetting collections, resulting in a net appropriation of $80.2 million. The House passed an Interior appropriations bill with $169.3 million for BOEM, leading to a net appropriation of $74.4 million, which was less than the FY2016 enacted total. The House's total appropriation for FY2017 was $1.6 million less than the FY2016 enacted total and $5.8 million less than the Obama Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill with total appropriations of $169.6 million for BOEM, resulting in a net appropriation of $74.6 million, which was $1.3 million less than the FY2016 enacted total. The 114th Congress did not enact full-year Interior appropriations for FY2017, providing continuing funds through April 28, 2017. BOEM's appropriations are in a single budget account for Ocean Energy Management, funding oil and gas leasing programs. BOEM published a leasing program for 2017-2022 with lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. Funding also supports lease sales under the current program for 2012-2017. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages oil and gas leasing programs, renewable energy resources, and marine minerals on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). They conduct lease sales for both conventional and renewable energy sources, including wind energy leases in the Atlantic. The Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island was the first commercial wind production in the U.S. and began operations in December 2016. BOEM began wind production in U.S. waters in December 2016. They focus on wind, wave, and ocean current energy for OCS development, issuing research leases and grants for hydrokinetic energy projects. Responsibilities include data collection, stakeholder engagement, and environmental impact assessments under NEPA and OCSLA. Coordination with BSEE for managing OCS environmental programs. BOEM conducts environmental assessments for ocean activities under OCSLA, including G&G exploration and lease sales. The agency collaborates with research agencies to develop scientific knowledge of the OCS. The Executive Direction budget activity covers executive offices. The FY2017 budget request proposed funding changes related to offsetting collections. BOEM anticipated an 11% decline in rental receipts for FY2017 due to various factors like fewer leases sold in the Gulf of Mexico and lower oil prices. They requested direct appropriations of $4.1 million from Congress to offset the reduced rental receipts, stating that this decline is not correlated to their workload. The agency expects this fiscal challenge to continue in the coming years. The Obama Administration proposed changes to the proportion of offsetting rental receipts for BOEM and BSEE in FY2017, with BOEM receiving 70% and BSEE 30%. BOEM also anticipated a net reduction in cost recovery fees but proposed a new fee for the Risk Management Program to generate $2.9 million in revenues. The funds would be used to hire staff with expertise in risk assessment and management. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills reflected BOEM's anticipated changes to offsetting collections, including reductions in rental receipts and cost recovery fees. BOEM proposed new fees for the Risk Management Program and changes in the proportion of rental receipts going to BOEM and BSEE. However, neither bill provided the direct appropriations requested by the agency. Additionally, BOEM proposed a $1.6 million increase in the Conventional Energy budget to attract skilled geophysicists, geologists, and petroleum engineers. The Office of Personnel Management issued special salary rate tables for positions, resulting in a $0.9 million increase for additional staffing in Conventional Energy and Environmental Assessment budget activities. The agency cited a need for more staff to handle a growing number of deepwater drilling plans and regulatory changes. There was also a $0.2 million increase for fixed costs across all activities. Funding for methane hydrate research decreased by $0.4 million in the Conventional Energy budget, while data collection and outreach funding decreased by the same amount in the Renewable Energy budget. The House and Senate committee bills provided less money in direct appropriations than BOEM had requested. The House bill had lower totals for all four of BOEM's budget activities, while the Senate bill funded BOEM's requested amount for Renewable Energy but less for other activities. The Senate committee concurred with proposed reductions for Conventional Energy but did not comment on requested increases. The BSEE oversees oil and gas activities on the OCS, focusing on safety, environmental protection, and resource conservation. Its functions include issuing permits, inspecting facilities, developing regulations, and overseeing spill prevention. Funding comes from appropriations and OCS receipts. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $204.9 million for BSEE, with $108.5 million from OCS rental receipts, cost recovery fees, and inspection fees. The net appropriation was $96.3 million, higher than the FY2016 enacted amount. The House Interior appropriations bill included $204.9 million for BSEE, offset by $96.5 million in collections, with a net appropriation of $88.3 million. The House's total appropriation for BSEE in FY2017 was $88.3 million, $8.0 million less than the agency's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $204.7 million for BSEE, with a net appropriation of $83.1 million after offsets. The committee's net appropriation for BSEE in FY2017 was $5.3 million less than the FY2016 enacted net appropriation and $13.2 million less than the request. The 114th Congress did not enact full-year Interior appropriations for FY2017, providing continuing funds through April 28, 2017, under CRs. BSEE's funding is under two budget accounts, OSEE and Oil Spill Research, with the OSR activity supporting regulations, safety standards, permits, inspections, and oversight of operators' SEMS programs. The OSEE account within BSEE's budget supports safety and environmental management systems, real-time monitoring of drilling, evaluation of technologies, and enforcement of environmental compliance. It includes final safety regulations for Arctic drilling and blowout prevention systems. The Environmental Enforcement activity has pursued over 200 cases of environmental violations since 2011. Administrative Operations and Executive Direction provide administrative services and support BSEE's executive offices. Oil Spill Research is a separate budget account. The BSEE budget account for Oil Spill Research funds research and planning for oil spill responses, oversight of operators' spill response plans, and supports the Ohmsett facility. BSEE anticipated changes to its offsetting collections for FY2017, with a drop in rental receipts and cost recovery fees, but an increase in inspection fees. However, the proposed legislative changes to authorize additional fees for repeat visits to certain OCS facilities were not included in the appropriations bill, resulting in estimated lower inspection fee collections. The committees estimated $12.0 million less in FY2017 inspection fee collections for BSEE than suggested by the agency. Both bills did not provide the direct appropriations requested by BSEE to address the shortfall. BSEE proposed funding changes in its OSEE account, including a $0.5 million increase for fixed costs and a $0.3 million decrease across various budget activities. BSEE proposed funding changes for four budget activities, including pay level increases for skilled professionals. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills mostly reflected BSEE's proposals, except for offsetting collections. The Senate bill did not adopt BSEE's changes for the OSR account, maintaining the FY2016 enacted level. ONRR, under DOI, collects and accounts for funds. The DOI Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget collects, analyzes, audits, and disburses revenues from energy and mineral leases on federal and Indian lands, including the OCS. In FY2016, ONRR disbursed $6.3 billion from mineral leases, with $2.8 billion from the OCS. Revenue amounts fluctuate annually based on oil and gas prices, averaging about $10 billion per year over the last five years. ONRR receives royalties, bonus bids, and rents for leasable minerals like oil, gas, and coal, distributing revenues under various authorities. ONRR disburses revenues from energy and mineral leases on federal and Indian lands, including the OCS. It collects royalties, bonus bids, and rents for leasable minerals like oil, gas, and coal. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and various funds based on statutory formulas. ONRR processes 49,000 royalty and production reports monthly and uses automated systems to verify offshore production information. The Obama Administration requested $129.3 million for ONRR in FY2017. ONRR identified three major areas of importance to support its mission: Financial and Production Management, Audit and Compliance Management, and Coordination, Enforcement, Valuation, and Appeals. The FY2017 request included resources for ONRR to assume trust responsibility for the Osage Nation, a federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma, following a 2011 settlement. The Osage oil and gas leasing program currently operates with support only from DOI's Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request sought $968,000 to fully fund the Osage Trust Accounting program, with additional funding for geospatial information systems and audit and compliance functions at ONRR. ONRR aims to increase Indian leases by 82% with the addition of Osage leases, improving revenue management and royalty reform. ONRR aims to improve compliance measures to reflect all of its work, facing challenges in ensuring audit and compliance effectiveness. Critics argue that less auditing and more compliance reviews have weakened royalty collection, leading to revenue loss. Recommendations from DOI's Inspector General and GAO include adopting a risk-based compliance approach. In FY2015, ONRR closed 110 audits and 667 compliance reviews with state and tribal partners. States and tribes can conduct mineral royalty audits on their land. ONRR has agreements with 10 states and 6 tribes for leasing-compliance activities. The House-passed FY2017 Interior appropriations bill, H.R. 5538, would have supported ONRR's programs at $126.5 million, $2.8 million below the Obama Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill, S. 3068, would have provided $121.8 million for ONRR, $7.6 million below the Administration's request. The 114th Congress did not enact full-year Interior appropriations for FY2017, and continuing funds were provided through April 28, 2017, under the CRs (P.L. 114-223 and P.L. 114-254). H.R. 5538 and S. 3068 contained general provisions related to offshore energy. Section 107 of both bills directed the ocean energy agencies to collect nonrefundable inspection fees. Section 107 of both bills directed ocean energy agencies to collect nonrefundable inspection fees in FY2017 for BSEE's OSEE account. Section 108 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to transfer funds among BSEE, BOEM, and ONRR. Section 124 of the House bill would have prohibited funds for new regulations on drilling margins or static downhole mud weight in offshore wells. The Obama Administration included legislative proposals related to ocean energy agencies in its DOI budget. One DOI proposal aimed to redirect offshore revenue-sharing payments from Gulf states to federal natural resource programs, with a focus on climate resilience. Another proposed federal oil and gas legislation included changes like evaluating royalty rates and implementing fees on nonproducing leases. Congressional action was required for these proposals. The DOI proposed redirecting offshore revenue-sharing payments to federal natural resource programs, focusing on climate resilience. Another proposal included changes to royalty rates and fees on nonproducing leases, requiring congressional action. Congressional action on these proposals may occur outside the appropriations process."
