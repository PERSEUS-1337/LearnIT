    "content": "The Act titled \"Cash Accounting for Small Business Act of 2001\" clarifies cash accounting rules for small businesses. The \"Cash Accounting for Small Business Act of 2001\" allows small business taxpayers to use cash accounting method without limitation, regardless of prior taxable years' gross receipts test. The gross receipts test under subparagraph (B) states that a taxpayer's average annual gross receipts for a 3-taxable-year period must not exceed $5,000,000. An inflation adjustment is applied for taxable years after 2001. The tax code allows for an increase in dollar amounts based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. Inventory rules for small businesses are clarified in the Internal Revenue Code. The tax code clarifies inventory rules for small businesses, stating that eligible taxpayers are not required to use inventories for a taxable year. Additionally, property not inventoried is treated as a material or supply. The gross receipts test for small businesses is also indexed based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The tax code is amended to adjust dollar amounts for inflation starting in 2001. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $100,000, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple. The effective date and special rules for these amendments are also specified. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2000. Taxpayers changing their accounting method must treat the change as initiated by them, with consent from the Secretary of the Treasury, and adjust over a period of up to 4 years."
