Developing methodologies to assess human trafficking prevalence. Establish an expert working group, including survivors and experts on human trafficking, to identify barriers in data collection on sex and labor trafficking.

A report will be submitted within 3 years of the enactment of the Act, in consultation with relevant government departments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center will submit a report to Congress on efforts to estimate human trafficking prevalence, determine trends, evaluate policies for victim needs, and analyze trafficking characteristics. The report required by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center will analyze the characteristics of trafficking victims in different regions, including age, gender, race, involvement in child welfare or justice systems, number of placements, and type of trafficking. Recommendations will be provided to address the unique vulnerabilities of different victims, and the report will be publicly available on the Department of Justice website. Input from relevant parties will be sought in developing the report. The Director will seek input from various stakeholders, including the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, victims, survivor advocates, and service providers. A survey will be conducted to understand how trafficking victims access services and how they are referred to services. The survey will assess how trafficking victims access services, including referrals by first responders, and estimate the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States. No additional funds are authorized for this section. SEC. 5. REPORT ON PROSECUTORS SEEKING MANDATORY RESTITUTION IN TRAFFICKING CASES.
