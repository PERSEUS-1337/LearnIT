    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Battlefield Excellence through Superior Training Practices Act\" or \"BEST Practices Act\". The Department of Defense has made significant progress in medical training and troop protection, resulting in decreased battlefield fatalities. However, they still use over 6,000 live animals annually for training purposes, despite the civilian sector largely transitioning to more effective human-based training methods. Human-based medical training, like simulators, allows for better practice and data collection. The Department of Defense has made strides in developing methods to replace live animal-based training with high-fidelity simulators for medical education and training. This transition is supported by scientific literature showing that medical simulation improves patient safety and reduces errors by healthcare providers. The Department of Defense aims to replace live animal-based training with high-fidelity simulators for battlefield medical procedures by 2011. High-fidelity simulators will be available for teaching all other procedures by 2014. The Department of Defense plans to use high-fidelity simulators for medical training by 2011, replacing live animal-based methods. The Department of Defense aims to implement human-based training methods for combat trauma injuries by October 1, 2016, replacing live animal-based methods. The Secretary has the authority to exempt specific commands or training methods from using human-based training if they are not deemed equivalent or superior to live animal-based methods. Any exemption granted is valid for up to one year and can be renewed. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports to the congressional defense committees on the progress of implementing human-based training methods to replace live animal-based methods for training armed forces members. The Secretary can exempt specific commands or training methods from using human-based training for combat trauma injuries if they are not deemed equivalent or superior to live animal-based methods. Annual reports must include any exemptions in force and their justifications. Definitions include combat trauma injuries like hemorrhage and amputations, and human-based training methods for medical treatment. The use of non-animal systems and devices for medical training includes simulators, partial task trainers, moulage, simulated combat environments, human cadavers, and rotations in trauma centers. Partial task trainers are defined as aids for learning specific medical procedures. In 2017, a requirement was established to use human-based methods for certain medical training."
