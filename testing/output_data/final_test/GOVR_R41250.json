    "content": "The Defense Department released a report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, the fourth review under that name and the sixth comprehensive reexamination of U.S. defense policy since the Cold War. It follows earlier reviews in 2006, 2001, 1997, 1993, and 1990. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) was conducted from April 2009 to February 1, 2010, involving senior leadership systematically assessing defense strategy, force planning, and programs. The main result was concrete decisions on a broad range of program and policy matters, with the report listing initiatives for improvement. The 2010 QDR focused on policy matters and initiatives to enhance capabilities for critical missions. It aimed to address ongoing defense policy discussions and identify future national security strategy issues. Critics question the effectiveness of successive QDRs in adapting to changes in the international security environment. The 2010 QDR differs significantly from previous QDRs in describing global security trends and breaks new ground compared to its predecessor. However, it is criticized for being conservative in force programming, anticipating minimal changes in force structure through FY2015 without laying out a plan beyond the current defense planning period. The 1990 Base Force analysis and the 1993 Bottom-Up Review led to a shift in U.S. defense strategy post-Cold War, maintaining military capabilities. The reviews argued for scaled-down Cold War-era forces, with the Bottom-Up Review not focusing on reconstituting forces in case of renewed threats. Neither review prompted major changes in priorities or organizational structure. The 1990 Base Force analysis and the 1993 Bottom-Up Review led to a shift in U.S. defense strategy post-Cold War, maintaining military capabilities without major changes in priorities or organizational structure. Subsequent reviews expanded the range of challenges for military planners, shifting strategic thinking towards preparing for a diverse array of threats. The 2006 and 2010 Quadrennial Defense Reviews reflected a shift in assumptions, recognizing that future adversaries are unlikely to confront U.S. conventional military capabilities directly. The future of conflict involves a broad spectrum of operations and lethality, where adversaries ranging from non-state terrorist groups to near-peer competitors will exploit U.S. vulnerabilities through asymmetric means. The distinction between irregular and conventional war is outdated, as even terrorist groups may use advanced technology and competing nations may employ irregular tactics. This complex future requires a shift in defense strategy to address a diverse array of threats. The future of conflict involves a broad spectrum of operations and lethality, with adversaries using a variety of weapons including weapons of mass destruction, missiles, AK-47s, and RPGs. Planners are now discussing \"hybrid threats\" that combine different means of attack across the conflict spectrum. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and cyberwar capabilities further complicate the situation. Operations short of a major regional conflict are seen as equally demanding and important in determining force size and composition. These operations include foundational activities like forward deployments and engagement with other nations to prevent conflicts. The 2010 QDR report emphasizes the need for forward deployments, engagement with other nations, and a substantial number of troops for homeland defense, peacekeeping operations, and military training activities. It highlights the challenges of long-duration stability operations like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, which require a large standing force for rotation. The report also calls for adjustments in the U.S. military force posture to prioritize prevailing in current conflicts and addressing changes in the global security environment. The 2010 QDR report emphasizes prevailing in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, maintaining the quality of the all-volunteer force, and managing the impact on military personnel and their families. It calls for new initiatives in joint mission areas like homeland defense, countering weapons of mass destruction, and ensuring access to cyberspace. The report raises questions about whether new security challenges require significant shifts in the global security environment. The 2010 QDR report raises questions about whether new security challenges require significant shifts in the global security environment, including changes in the composition of the force and addressing broader trends in the international security environment. The 2010 QDR report highlights global security challenges such as non-state actors, fragile states, acquisition of dangerous technologies, resource scarcity, climate change, demographic trends, and spread of diseases. It mentions the need for multilateral cooperation but focuses more on current regional relationships rather than expanded cooperative security arrangements. The report raises questions about potential changes in U.S. defense posture. The CRS report questions if the 2010 QDR fully reflects global security implications and suggests a more comprehensive assessment of national security policy may be necessary. It reviews the results of the 2010 QDR, discusses new elements, criticisms, and whether defense plans have adapted to changes in conflict nature. Future QDRs or interagency studies could address broader defense planning contexts. The CRS report suggests a more comprehensive assessment of national security policy may be necessary, with future QDRs or interagency studies addressing broader defense planning contexts. Readers can skip over detailed discussions of statutory requirements and focus on substantive policy issues in the 2010 QDR report. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is a comprehensive examination of national defense strategy conducted every four years by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It aims to establish a defense program for the next 20 years and define a national defense strategy consistent with the most recent National Security Strategy. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is conducted every four years by the Secretary of Defense to define force structure, modernization plans, budget, and other elements needed for national defense strategy execution. The Secretary must provide a report to Congress on the QDR. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is conducted every four years by the Secretary of Defense to define force structure, modernization plans, budget, and other elements needed for national defense strategy execution. The Secretary must provide a report to Congress on the QDR, addressing 16 specific topics related to the national defense strategy, security interests, threats, and assumptions used in the review. The QDR examines threats and assumptions, including readiness of US forces, cooperation of allies, warning times, levels of engagement, and conflicts' intensity and duration. It also considers the impact on force structure and readiness for high-intensity combat, manpower policies for conflicts lasting over 120 days, and roles of the reserve. The QDR considers the roles and missions of reserve components in national defense strategy, combat forces to support forces ratio, specific military capabilities needed for strategic objectives, and transportation capabilities required for national defense strategy. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 110-181, outlines various aspects related to national defense strategy, including resource allocation, revisions to the Unified Command Plan, impact of technology on force structure, Coast Guard's mission, homeland defense, support to civil authority missions, and any other relevant matters as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 110-181, requires the next QDR to assess armed forces' capabilities for responding to climate change consequences, updating defense plans, and developing mitigation strategies. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act mandates the annual preparation of a national security strategy by the White House. The law also requires the national defense strategy to be part of each Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Congress has established numerous reporting requirements on national security policy for the Defense Department and other agencies, including assessments by independent panels and reviews by the Government Accountability Office. Additionally, the White House must prepare a National Security Strategy report for the QDR to base its statement on. The White House prepares a National Security Strategy report for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), which forms the basis for the national defense strategy. Congress has added requirements for separate reports on missile defense, nuclear weapons, and space policy, as well as reviews for Homeland Security and Development and Diplomacy. Additionally, the QDR statute now requires four associated reports and a classified annex detailing military force structure analysis. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) includes a defense strategy and minimum requirements for military capabilities. The Government Accountability Office is tasked to assess the QDR's compliance with statutory requirements. The Secretary of Defense must report on the impact of the review on overseas base closure and realignment plans. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) includes a defense strategy and minimum requirements for military capabilities. An independent panel is established to assess the QDR, with reports due by May 1, 2010, and July 15. The panel will review alternative force structures and compare costs with the defense program recommended by the QDR. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requires an independent panel to analyze military balance trends and strategic approaches of potential adversaries. The President must issue a National Security Strategy report within 150 days of a new Administration, but no Administration has met this deadline except for the first report in 1987. No Administration has met the deadline for issuing an initial report since 1987. The Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton Administrations submitted reports annually except for 1989 and 1992. The George W. Bush Administration produced two national security strategy statements in 2002 and 2006. The Obama Administration is expected to release a report soon. General John Shalikashvili prepared reports on the National Military Strategy in 1995 and 1997. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act established a permanent requirement for the Chairman of Joint Chiefs to prepare a biennial report containing a comprehensive examination of the national military strategy. The report must delineate a strategy consistent with the National Security Strategy and Quadrennial Defense Review, assess risks, and report through the Secretary of Defense to Congress. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the Chairman of Joint Chiefs to prepare a biennial report on the national military strategy, consistent with the National Security Strategy and Quadrennial Defense Review. The report assesses risks and is reported to Congress through the Secretary of Defense. The first subsequent report was released in 2005, along with a National Defense Strategy report. The QDR is required to delineate a national defense strategy, with the first two reports containing statements of defense strategy. The Defense Department released a separate National Defense Strategy document in 2005, which served as the basis for the 2006 QDR. Subsequent revisions to the National Security Strategy statement were released in advance of the QDR reports. The 2008 National Defense Strategy (NDS) influenced the 2009-2010 QDR, despite being prepared during the Bush Administration. The absence of a new National Security Strategy did not hinder the 2010 QDR preparation, as guidance was drawn from DOD's National Defense Strategy. The 2010 QDR aimed to define new strategic objectives and identify priorities. The 2010 QDR aimed to define new strategic objectives and identify critical missions. There is a discussion on whether future QDRs should include a broader discussion of global security policy to provide a more complete context. The role of military power in national security policy is also questioned, considering the timeliness and detail of the National Security Strategy. Additionally, separate statutes require the preparation of three additional reports addressing specific aspects of U.S. defense and security policy in more depth. The 2010 QDR aimed to define new strategic objectives and identify critical missions. Separate statutes require the preparation of three additional reports addressing specific aspects of U.S. defense and security policy in more depth, including a Nuclear Posture Review, Ballistic Missile Defense Review, and Space Posture Review. These reports discuss the role of nuclear weapons, missile defense strategy, and space requirements. The Space Posture Review, required to define objectives for space situational awareness, control, and superiority, has been delayed to fall 2010. DOD conducted this review in parallel with the QDR, with results informing each other. The QDR report discusses the Administration's intent for tailored deterrence architectures, including conventional military capabilities and missile defense. It emphasizes a reduced role for nuclear weapons in national security strategy, deferring detailed discussions to the Ballistic Missile Defense Review and the Nuclear Posture Review. The Executive Summary of the QDR report emphasizes the need for the Defense Department to rebalance priorities towards supporting forces in current operations, counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism. It also highlights the importance of reforming business practices to be more agile, innovative, and efficient in using limited resources. The report emphasizes the need to allocate resources and manage risk among four strategic objectives: Prevail in today's wars, Prevent and deter conflict, Prepare to defeat adversaries, and Preserve the all-volunteer force. Ongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere will determine the force's size and composition for years. U.S. policy focuses on preventing conflict through diplomacy, development assistance, and maintaining military forces to discourage challenges to peace and security. If threats arise, U.S. forces must be able to prevail in various operations across multiple theaters. The QDR tested U.S. forces' ability to succeed in various operations occurring simultaneously, emphasizing sustaining the all-volunteer force and improving capabilities in six joint mission areas. Key objectives include defending the U.S., conducting counterinsurgency operations, building partner state capacity, deterring aggression, and preventing proliferation. The Defense Department's key missions include deterring aggression, countering weapons of mass destruction, and operating effectively in cyberspace. The 2006 QDR and 2008 National Defense Strategy also listed similar missions but with some differences. The QDR report emphasizes the need to reform DOD's ways of doing business in six specific areas. The report emphasizes the need for DOD to reform its business practices to adapt quickly to evolving threats and requirements. It criticizes the outdated Cold War-era processes for security assistance, which are slow and not flexible enough to support allies in combating immediate threats. The National Security Council is reviewing security assistance to propose statutory revisions. The Defense Department is streamlining processes for managing foreign military sales and integrating defense and development assistance. The weapons acquisition process still follows outdated Cold War-era practices. The report highlights the need for a more selective approach in establishing requirements based on evolving threats. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring new technology is mature enough before proceeding with weapons development milestones. Additionally, it calls for a more rapid response to unexpected developments in requirements. The Defense Department has been able to quickly acquire new capabilities for current conflicts by bypassing regular budgeting and procurement processes, but now needs to institutionalize this flexibility. The report emphasizes the need for the Defense Department to institutionalize flexibility in identifying new threats, establishing system requirements, allocating resources, and rapidly procuring and fielding new capabilities. It also criticizes the outdated U.S. system of export controls, stating that it hinders cooperation, technology sharing, and interoperability with allies and partners, becoming an impediment to U.S. security. The Administration plans to propose comprehensive changes to high technology export laws and regulations in the future. The report discusses the need for comprehensive reform of high technology export laws to enhance U.S. international competitiveness and cooperation with allies. It also addresses strengthening the defense industrial base by focusing on second and third tier producers and ensuring critical suppliers have access to capital. Additionally, a strategic approach to climate change and energy policy is highlighted as part of a defense reform agenda. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act requires discussions on the impact of climate change on the Defense Department in strategic reports. Intelligence assessments suggest that climate change could worsen global poverty, resource shortages, weaken governments, spread disease, and increase demands for humanitarian aid. This could further strain fragile societies. The report highlights that climate change may exacerbate challenges for already vulnerable societies, especially in regions that are resource poor and poorly governed. It emphasizes the need for flexible response to unexpected developments and mentions potential threats to DOD bases from rising sea levels. Energy security is a top priority for the Defense Department due to budget costs and vulnerability to attacks. The Defense Department will focus on improving energy efficiency to increase range and reduce the need to protect energy supply lines. Measures will be taken to enhance security of energy supplies for key facilities and missions, as well as diversifying energy sources for military forces. The report also discusses U.S. security relationships with foreign nations and cooperation with other U.S. agencies. The report discusses cooperation with other U.S. agencies and reaffirms existing alliances. It briefly mentions relations with Russia and China, focusing on shared interests in countering proliferation and terrorism. The report promises continued discussions on missile defense and the Arctic with Russia. The United States will engage with Russia's neighbors as independent states, not accepting Russia's sphere of influence. Regarding China, the report acknowledges its rising global influence and military capabilities, welcoming a stronger China in global affairs but criticizing its lack of transparency in military development. The report raises concerns about China's future conduct and intentions, emphasizing the need for multidimensional relations. It avoids naming specific threats or mentioning Taiwan, opting for abstract discussions on potential threats and the importance of coordinating defense plans with regional security systems. The report emphasizes the importance of U.S. military forces overseas in promoting multilateral approaches and regional security architectures. It highlights the need for collaborative defense planning within the U.S. government and stresses the significance of a global defense posture in communicating U.S. foreign and security policy. The report also supports greater investments in the capabilities of civilian agencies like the State Department and U.S. AID to operate alongside military forces in operations abroad. The report emphasizes the importance of U.S. military forces overseas in promoting multilateral approaches and regional security architectures. It highlights the need for collaborative defense planning within the U.S. government and stresses the significance of a global defense posture in communicating U.S. foreign and security policy. The report also supports greater investments in the capabilities of civilian agencies like the State Department and U.S. AID to operate alongside military forces in operations abroad. Additionally, it suggests that the Defense Department should generally play a supporting role in responding to domestic security challenges, with the Department of Homeland Security taking the lead. The QDR statute requires the report to identify the budget plan needed to successfully execute the full range of missions at a low-to-moderate level of risk, with the Secretary of Defense assessing risk in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The QDR report to Congress includes a discussion of the national defense strategy, strategic planning guidance, and force structure suited for low-to-moderate risk. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs assesses risk and capabilities needed. Assessing and balancing risks is fundamental in defense planning at all levels. Military planning involves evaluating risks when resources are limited. The Defense Department assesses risks in military plans and operations, deciding on the level of risk worth taking based on the mission objectives. The concept of \"minimum risk force\" was used until the mid-1980s to ensure mission success with minimal risk of failure, even with increased defense spending. The Defense Department used the concept of \"minimum risk force\" until the mid-1980s to ensure mission success with minimal risk of failure. However, by about 40% above inflation over a five-year period, the minimum risk force remained about half again as large and expensive as the force being planned. The Defense Department then stopped assessing the minimum risk force, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is required to submit an annual assessment of strategic and military risks associated with executing missions under the National Military Strategy. This assessment, known as the \"Chairman's Risk Assessment,\" influences congressional testimony and comments by Members of Congress. The Chairman's Risk Assessment focuses on short-term military readiness, highlighting increased risk in responding to major regional conflicts due to ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2010 QDR report discusses risk management, identifying high-risk areas for the Defense Department's objectives in four categories. Operations may take longer and casualties could be higher if forces fall short of the level needed to minimize risks. Planners must decide where to accept greater risk of failure and where to invest more to reduce unacceptable risks. The Defense Department's ability to achieve its objectives is assessed in four categories: Operational risk, Force management risk, Institutional risk, and Future challenges risk. The report highlights areas that could worsen risks and identifies improvements in DOD capabilities and processes. The report identifies the need for improvements in DOD capabilities to mitigate operational risks, including enhancing ISR systems, vertical lift aircraft, electronic warfare capabilities, and cultural/language skills. It also emphasizes the importance of building the capacity of indigenous partner states for security management and highlights cyberspace as a growing danger. The report does not address how ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan may impact force availability for future conflicts, increasing risks. The report highlights risks related to force management, DOD health care costs, and the role of reserve forces. Institutional risks include challenges in the acquisition process and the industrial base's focus on outdated weapons platforms. The report emphasizes the need for the Department of Defense to address future challenges by improving capabilities, anticipating threats, and staying competitive in science and technology. It also highlights the importance of a planning process that includes traditional defense capabilities and emerging technologies. The 2010 report discusses strategic, military, and political risks in executing defense priorities and military operations, both domestically and internationally. The 2010 QDR addresses strategic, military, and political risks in executing defense priorities domestically and internationally, emphasizing the Department's ability to balance risks across different timeframes and military missions. It maintains continuity with previous defense strategies post-9/11, reflecting a consistent approach to national security. The 2010 QDR reflects Secretary Gates' focus on prevailing in current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, prioritizing support for military personnel and their families. It also shows a shift in strategic thinking towards planning for a variety of challenges, moving away from traditional armor-heavy conflict models. The QDR maintains the requirement for forces to defeat aggression. The 2010 QDR no longer considers the two-war requirement as fundamental in force composition, acknowledging a range of threats beyond major regional conflicts. Adversaries have developed diverse strategies and capabilities challenging the U.S., its forces, allies, and interests. The focus has shifted towards planning for various challenges rather than traditional conflict models. The 2010 QDR no longer emphasizes the two-war requirement for U.S. forces, recognizing the need for a wide range of missions in different circumstances. Secretary Gates highlighted the complexity of current defense planning, stating that the world requires readiness for various challenges beyond major conflicts. The 2010 QDR no longer focuses on the two-war requirement for U.S. forces, acknowledging the need for readiness in a complex environment with a broad range of missions beyond major conflicts. The 1993 Bottom-Up Review premise was that forces prepared for two simultaneous wars could also handle less demanding challenges, with subsequent QDRs addressing capabilities for various operations. The 1997 QDR broadened military strategy to include shaping the international security environment, quick response to various missions, and preparation for future conflicts. It emphasized the two-war requirement but also acknowledged the strain of long-duration smaller operations. The 2001 QDR introduced a new force sizing construct beyond the two-war requirement. The 2010 QDR introduced a new force sizing construct called the \"1-4-2-1 strategy\" which includes defending the homeland, deterring conflicts in four major regions, halting aggression in two regions simultaneously, and decisively defeating an adversary in one theater. It aims to better address force requirements for various missions and account for low-density/high-demand assets. The review tested the ability of planned forces to respond flexibly and effectively to various scenarios, including major stabilization operations, deterring and defeating regional aggressors, and supporting civil authorities in the United States. Planning for two major wars remains part of the process, but the Defense Department now considers other scenarios as well. The 2010 QDR emphasizes improvements in six joint mission areas: defending the US and supporting civil authorities, counterinsurgency operations, building partner state capacity, deterring aggression, preventing proliferation, and operating in cyberspace. This marks a shift from the 2006 QDR which focused on defeating terrorist networks, homeland defense, shaping strategic choices, and preventing WMD acquisition and use. The 2010 QDR introduces new focuses on defeating anti-access threats, cyberspace, and building partner state capacity. It replaces the 2006 QDR's emphasis on shaping strategic choices and defeating terrorist networks with a broader mandate for counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations. The report also shifts away from describing missions as part of a \"long war\" against terrorism or violent extremism, and changes the discussion on homeland defense and counter-WMD measures. The 2010 QDR introduces new focuses on defeating anti-access threats and the importance of U.S. power projection capabilities in maintaining alliances and stability. U.S. ability to project power globally is unique and costly, leading to high defense spending compared to other nations. Regional conflicts post-Cold War have become a key focus of U.S. strategic planning. During the Cold War, regional conflicts became a key focus of U.S. strategic planning. American strategists warned of the risk to U.S. power projection in key areas like East Asia and the Persian Gulf from \"anti-access\" or \"area denial\" strategies by nations like China or Iran. This could make overseas ground bases and naval forces vulnerable. Overseas ground bases and naval forces face increasing vulnerability to various threats such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, submarines, smart mines, and small explosive-laden boats. Anti-access strategies have been identified as asymmetric challenges that require more attention in defense planning. Anti-access threats, highlighted in defense planning, were addressed in the 2006 QDR review by a \"red team\" recommending a reduction in short-range fighter aircraft. In a 2002 war game, the OPFOR commander demonstrated damage to U.S. naval forces using swarming small boats and anti-ship missiles. Recent reports on Iranian and Chinese naval capabilities show investments in anti-access capabilities. The 2010 QDR suggests improvements to counter anti-access strategies. The 2010 QDR recommends various initiatives to counter anti-access strategies, such as developing a joint air-sea battle concept, expanding long-range strike capabilities, enhancing subsurface operations, increasing resiliency of forward posture, assuring access to space, improving ISR capabilities, defeating enemy sensors, and enhancing presence of U.S. forces abroad. These initiatives may require substantial new investments, including a new manned or unmanned bomber for long-range strikes and funding for unmanned underwater vehicles. The development of an unmanned underwater vehicle for various tasks is significant, with potential new investments in carrier-based, long-range unmanned strike systems. The 2010 QDR addresses anti-access measures, including missile defense for forward deployed forces, likely leading to major new initiatives. The 2010 QDR introduces new initiatives in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations, marking a shift from previous strategic assessments. It no longer uses terms like \"Global War on Terrorism\" or \"long war,\" and does not specifically mention \"violent Islamic extremism\" as a threat. The report also does not refer to \"irregular warfare,\" unlike the 2005 National Defense Strategy. The 2010 QDR introduces new initiatives in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations, shifting from previous strategic assessments. It no longer uses terms like \"Global War on Terrorism\" or \"long war,\" and does not specifically mention \"violent Islamic extremism\" as a threat. The report replaces the familiar \"four challenges\" framework with a discussion of specific missions and the complexity of the security environment. In a 2009 Foreign Affairs article, Secretary Gates discussed the blurring categories of warfare and the use of various tools and tactics simultaneously in hybrid forms of warfare. The 2010 QDR reflects the need to confront multiple challenges simultaneously and shows efforts to develop new military doctrine for counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations. In 2005, the Defense Department defined stability operations as a core military mission equivalent to combat operations. The Army and Marine Corps published a new counterinsurgency Field Manual in 2006, leading to revised strategic approaches in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the Army produced a Field Manual on stability operations, and a DOD directive in December 2008 encompassed irregular warfare activities such as counterinsurgency, stability operations, and others. The Defense Department's effort to articulate doctrine for counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations aims to institutionalize lessons learned from post-9/11 military activities. The 2010 QDR highlights the evolution of DOD doctrinal thinking on these issues, including the rejection of the \"war on terrorism\" terminology. The Administration emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to defeating global terrorist groups, combining military, intelligence, law enforcement measures with other means to weaken their appeal. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to defeating global terrorist groups, combining military, intelligence, law enforcement measures with other means to weaken their appeal. John Brennan, the senior counterterrorism advisor, stressed the importance of a more comprehensive effort beyond just kinetic and intelligence operations, rejecting the concept of a 'war on terror'. The QDR could have benefited from a broader discussion on counterterrorism policy and the role of military power in addressing evolving security challenges. Measures in the QDR focus on enhancing current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with increases in resources like helicopters, UAVs, and intelligence. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to defeating global terrorist groups, combining military, intelligence, and law enforcement measures. Measures include increases in helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 aircraft gunships to prevail in current wars. The report also discusses converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with potential for more conversions as resources allow. Additionally, there are general measures to improve strategic communications. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to defeating global terrorist groups, combining military, intelligence, and law enforcement measures. It includes increases in helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 aircraft gunships to prevail in current wars. Additionally, there are measures to improve strategic communications by enhancing language and cultural capabilities and increasing educational and training programs for working with foreign populations. These efforts do not indicate a reduced focus on defeating terrorist networks or winning the \"long war\" against terrorism. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the evolution of military thinking towards core responsibilities like capacity building for COIN, stability, and CT operations. This discussion builds on initiatives from the previous administration and the 2006 QDR, highlighting the importance of building partnership capacity in military planning. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of capacity building for COIN, stability, and CT operations. It states that as U.S. forces draw down in Iraq and progress in Afghanistan, more capacity will be available for training foreign security forces globally. Special operations forces alone cannot meet the demand, so general purpose forces must also be assigned for training and advising foreign militaries. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for capacity building in COIN, stability, and CT operations. To meet demand, general purpose forces will need specialized training for supporting foreign militaries. Initiatives include reforming security assistance, facilitating rapid transfers of materiel, providing language and cultural training, and supporting UN peacekeeping efforts. Additionally, DOD programs are being expanded to strengthen governance in key nations, potentially increasing the Defense Department's role in foreign areas. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for capacity building in COIN, stability, and CT operations, expanding the Defense Department's role in foreign policy areas traditionally handled by the State Department. General purpose forces, especially in the Army, must be prepared for foreign military assistance missions, combat missions, stability operations, and counterinsurgency activities. Training responsibilities may need to be assigned to deployed combat units in situations like Iraq and Afghanistan, where partnering with indigenous forces can be valuable. The need for capacity building in COIN, stability, and CT operations is emphasized in the 2010 QDR. General purpose forces, especially in the Army, must be prepared for foreign military assistance missions, combat missions, stability operations, and counterinsurgency activities. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton has expressed doubts about troops' ability to retain specialized skills without additional training. Some strategists suggest creating specialized advisory and assistance brigades or \"constabulary\" units for large-scale stability operations. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for capacity building in COIN, stability, and CT operations. The Army plans to augment deploying infantry brigades with additional personnel for training, security, and economic infrastructure development. The 2010 QDR report drops the extensive discussion on shaping the choices of nations at a strategic crossroads from the 2006 QDR report. The 2006 report focused on cooperative endeavors with nations in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Latin America. It highlighted progress in democracy in the Middle East and Libya's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program. India, Russia, and China were identified as key powers. Concerns about Russia's democracy erosion and China's military buildup were also discussed. The 2006 report addressed concerns about China's military buildup, emphasizing the need for the US to integrate new powers as partners while deterring conflict and aggression. It highlighted the importance of improving capabilities, including undersea warfare, to counter anti-access strategies. The 2006 report discusses challenges such as undersea warfare capabilities, global strike, and missile defense to deter potential adversaries and maintain strategic predominance. It emphasizes investments in key capabilities as prudent hedges against future conflicts. The 2010 QDR focuses on specific measures to counter potential competitors' asymmetric means to challenge U.S. capabilities. It highlights the anti-access challenge as an area of vulnerability and emphasizes the technological nature of potential threats and measures to counter them. The 2010 report emphasizes the importance of operating successfully in cyberspace as a critical mission area. It views cyberspace as part of the \"global commons\" alongside air, sea, and space realms. Defending against disruptive cyber attacks has been a long-standing concern, with previous strategy documents highlighting the need for greater efforts in cybersecurity. The 2010 QDR report highlights the growing importance of cyberwarfare and the need for improved capabilities in defending against cyber threats. It treats cyberspace as a new theater of warfare and emphasizes the importance of planning to cope with it. The report also focuses on homeland defense and protection against weapons of mass destruction, with new measures identified to enhance capabilities in these areas. The 2010 QDR report reorganizes DOD CBRNE response teams for homeland defense, establishes Homeland Response Forces in FEMA regions, and enhances radiological detection efforts. It acknowledges the U.S. homeland is no longer a sanctuary during conflicts abroad due to new technologies. The 2010 QDR report emphasizes the need to protect the U.S. homeland during conflicts abroad by reorganizing DOD CBRNE response teams, establishing Homeland Response Forces, and enhancing radiological detection efforts. It highlights the global reach of new technologies that may turn the homeland into a theater of operations, requiring measures for homeland defense to be planned as part of any major conflict. The report also addresses the importance of preventing proliferation and countering weapons of mass destruction, with a focus on tagging and tracking nuclear materials and interdicting shipments. The 2010 QDR report focuses on protecting the U.S. homeland during conflicts by reorganizing CBRNE response teams and enhancing radiological detection efforts. It emphasizes the need to prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction, including tracking nuclear materials and interdicting shipments. The report does not address steps towards nuclear weapons elimination, leaving that discussion to the Nuclear Posture Review. Some critics argue that military reviews are influenced by personal perspectives rather than logic. They believe the acquisition process is flawed, leading to technology-driven forces that are less prepared for war at a higher cost. There are concerns that defense policy is losing focus on major wars due to missions in non-security related areas. Critics also warn against a strategy that accepts greater risk in traditional state-on-state conflicts, fearing potential threats from China or Russia. Many critics argue that military reviews are influenced by personal perspectives rather than logic, leading to technology-driven forces that are ill-prepared for war at a higher cost. Concerns are raised about defense policy losing focus on major wars due to missions in non-security related areas. There are also warnings about accepting greater risk in traditional state-on-state conflicts, with fears of potential threats from China or Russia. The current QDR is criticized for being too constrained by budgets and not addressing military capabilities adequately. It is also faulted for not making necessary choices among major programs and lacking emphasis on investments in conventional forces for future threats. Additionally, it is seen as timid in characterizing threats from Russia and China and lacking guidance on strategic priorities due to a delay in issuing a White House National Security Strategy statement. The current QDR is criticized for lacking guidance on strategic priorities and long-term planning, with force plans not clearly derived from strategic assessments. Critics argue that previous defense reviews were primarily budget exercises rather than strategic planning efforts. The original QDR statute aimed for the opposite approach, emphasizing strategic planning over budget constraints. The QDR statute, initially established in 1996 and revised in 1999, aimed to address concerns about defense budgets and weapons procurement funding. Legislators wanted QDRs to advocate for increased defense spending. The statute has evolved to emphasize that reviews should not be limited by budget constraints. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) aims to examine defense strategy, force structure, modernization plans, infrastructure, budget, and other defense program elements to establish a revised defense program through 2005. The 1997 QDR recognized resource constraints and focused on identifying evolving threats, developing a defense strategy, defining required capabilities, and assessing alternative approaches. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) focused on identifying evolving threats, developing a defense strategy, and assessing alternative approaches with a balance between short-term readiness and long-term capabilities. The report emphasized the need for a military posture to shape the international security environment and prepare for future threats. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of fiscal responsibility in defense spending to ensure economic health and national security. The fiscal reality influenced the implementation of the defense strategy and emphasized the need for organizational reform. The FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act established a requirement for quadrennial reviews to align with the National Security Strategy and define necessary elements for the defense program execution. The defense program requires plans, infrastructure, and budget planning to execute missions in the national defense strategy. Defense budgets increased significantly from FY1999 onwards, with the 2001 and 2006 QDR reports not explicitly addressing budget constraints. The 2006 QDR called for reallocating resources rather than adding capabilities. The 2006 QDR shifted resources towards broader challenges, accepting limits on resources. The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act prohibited budget constraints on the QDR's recommendations. Congress mandated budget recommendations derived from strategy, sustaining a force for all missions with reduced risks, not constrained by the Administration's budget plan. The Administration's budget plan is not clear on how the statutory requirement will impact QDRs. The Defense Department must propose a budget plan that is not limited by the President's budget, making it challenging for the Secretary of Defense. The White House will ultimately decide defense funding by balancing it with other budget demands. Some defense planners argue that strategic thinking must consider realistic resource constraints from the start to effectively allocate resources for policy objectives. The QDR must guide defense program priorities based on urgent security challenges and realistic funding expectations. Robert Hale emphasizes the need to consider fiscal constraints in defense planning, as budgeting involves balancing risks with available resources. Robert Hale emphasizes the need to balance risk against available resources in defense planning, ensuring that the Quadrennial Defense Review is \"resource-informed\" rather than budget-constrained. This approach, reflected in the 2006 and 2010 QDRs, aligns strategic priorities with realistic funding expectations. Hale believes the current process works effectively without the need for additional legislation. The Defense Department's 2006 QDR and 2010 QDR proposed reallocating resources towards capabilities for irregular, disruptive, or catastrophic challenges, rather than traditional conflicts where the US had a secure advantage. The 2010 QDR also highlighted the higher risks associated with current and future hybrid, asymmetric conflicts, allowing for greater risk acceptance in traditional warfare capabilities. The 2010 QDR emphasized the need to accept greater risks in traditional warfare capabilities to reduce vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. The budget trends were adjusted to provide growth of about 1 percent above inflation each year in overall DOD funding, reflecting the main conclusions of the QDR. This slight increase in resources could have a substantial impact if sustained over several years. Several congressional critics of the 2010 QDR believe that the proposed increase in resources is inadequate, pointing to shortfalls in Navy and Air Force aircraft inventories, cuts in major weapons programs, and budget constraints impacting defense spending. On the other hand, some argue that the QDR fails to address realistic budget constraints and establish clear priorities due to potential federal budget deficits in the long term. The QDR emphasizes the need to rebalance defense resources towards capabilities for current threats, such as technology to combat improvised explosive devices and more unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the FY 2011 budget does not fully reflect this shift, with only a small percentage allocated to today's missions and needs. The Defense Department should shift 7-10% of spending to current missions and needs, with 40% allocated to versatile weapons. Critics suggest reallocating resources to support ground forces and counterinsurgency operations, scaling back purchases of conventional warfare systems. They question the planning scenarios used to test force capabilities in the QDR. The QDR emphasizes the need for hard choices in allocating resources for current missions, including counterinsurgency and stability operations, while still preparing for a wide range of contingencies. The 2010 QDR broadens the list of challenges to U.S. security, emphasizing potential threats from future peer competitors and the need to reallocate resources to address new high-end dangers like anti-access strategies and cyberwar. The 2010 QDR highlights new high-end dangers such as anti-access strategies and cyberwar. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon criticizes the QDR for prioritizing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over conventional national defense challenges, leading to budget cuts and increased risk. The 2010 QDR is criticized for underestimating deterrence requirements and overestimating force capabilities. Major program cuts include terminating Navy shipbuilding programs, stretching out aircraft carrier procurement, halting production of various aircraft programs, and terminating communication satellite and helicopter programs. The debate surrounding military programs includes issues with Navy fighter aircraft, amphibious ships for the Marine Corps, shipbuilding rates, sustaining the Navy's ship goal, and developing an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Concerns also exist about the ability of U.S. forces to manage multiple combat operations simultaneously. The United States faces challenges in managing multiple combat operations due to the high number of troops committed in stability operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Critics question the Defense Department's conclusion that capabilities for traditional conflicts are adequate, especially considering the difficulties faced in current conflicts. Secretary of Defense Gates downplays concerns about the need to take \"additional acceptable risk\" in traditional military capabilities to bolster capabilities for irregular conflicts. The Strategy suggests that the U.S. has sustainable predominance in conventional warfare, with ample striking power in air and sea forces to deter aggression in various regions. Despite assuming some risk, it is seen as prudent and manageable. Congress's support for current programs and reluctance to redirect investments is viewed as a barrier to necessary changes in priorities. Secretary Gates has criticized the lack of institutional support for the capabilities needed to win current and future wars, highlighting the military services' reluctance to adapt to changing nature of warfare. The changing nature of warfare has led to debates over program terminations and priorities in defense strategy. Secretary Gates criticizes the lack of adaptability in current processes, while others argue against shifting resources away from existing military capabilities. The 2010 QDR report focuses on power and national security, with limited criticism of Russia and China. Concerns were raised about downplaying the China threat in the report, with changes in language noted between the draft and final versions. Representative McKeon expressed worries about potential cuts to defense programs. The final version of the 2010 QDR report, released in February 2010, showed changes in language regarding China. The report focused on countering high-end asymmetric challenges, including anti-access strategies and cyberwarfare initiatives. The Administration's approach prioritized gaining cooperation from Russia and China on arms control and non-proliferation. The 2010 QDR report focused on arms control, non-proliferation, and security measures. Efforts were made to gain Russian and Chinese support for sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. Criticisms included a delay in issuing a White House National Security Strategy statement and a lack of clarity on force plans derived from strategic assessment. The 2010 QDR report focused on arms control, non-proliferation, and security measures. Efforts were made to gain Russian and Chinese support for sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. The current QDR lacks specific force plans and long-term planning details. The White House is required to issue a National Security Strategy statement within 150 days of a new presidential term, but no new Administration has done so early. The absence of a national security strategy report did not limit the QDR, according to Obama Administration officials. The QDR process involved senior officials in the Office of the Under Secretary for Policy and consultations with the White House and other agencies. Some suggest that broader security issues should be discussed more extensively in the QDR, which could be facilitated by having a national security strategy statement available first. However, past statements have been broad without much discussion of strategy. Addressing this issue legislatively may be challenging as the deadline for QDRs has been pushed back. The deadline for QDRs has been pushed back to the first Monday in February for subsequent QDRs to ensure influence on defense program plans. Delays would only shape defense programs in a President's final 15 months in office. Producing national security strategy statements within five years is challenging. Producing national security strategy statements within five months is challenging due to delays in appointing new Administration's political appointees. This may result in QDRs being carried out without them, impacting defense programs in a President's final months in office. Officials responsible for the work may not all be in place until well into a new President's first or second year. Officials responsible for the QDR work may not all be in place until well into a new President's first or second year in office. Congressional committee Members and staff have concerns about the 2010 QDR not clearly showing how force plans are derived from strategy. Representatives Skelton and McKeon wrote a letter to the QDR review panel asking for consideration of force structure recommendations. They noted the recommendation to maintain the current force structure for future defense plans. Members are seeking greater discussion linking threats to force planning and structure. The 2010 QDR raised concerns about the disconnect between changes in strategic priorities and force posture, with questions remaining about the analysis used to determine force structure. The 2010 QDR report does not fully endorse the planned force structure but supports new initiatives to enhance capabilities for specific missions. The report includes a detailed list of the force structure planned under the FYDP through FY2015, with a statement expressing reservations about the dynamic security environment and the need for enhanced capabilities. The 2010 QDR report raises questions about future force requirements, particularly regarding the Marine Corps' amphibious assault capabilities and the Navy's aircraft carriers. Secretary Gates expressed concerns about the planned force structure and the QDR's limited time horizon. Under Secretary of Defense Mich\u00e8le Flournoy mentioned that scenarios looked up to 2028 but did not fully comply with the mandated twenty-year outlook. The 2028 snapshot informed the refinement of plans for the Future Years Defense Plan (FDYP) up to FY2015. Long-term force structure planning is challenging due to changing world dynamics and capabilities. The QDR report did not address long-term trend impacts on defense plans, leaving assumptions for 2028 scenarios unclear. Long-term projections are often based on the continuation of current trends for planning purposes. Discussions in successive QDRs show an evolution of official thinking on security challenges. The 1990 Base Force analysis and the 1993 Bottom-Up Review emphasized maintaining strong military capabilities post-Cold War. Future planning focused on technological advantage and the ability to prevail in two regional conflicts. The 1997 QDR addressed strains from smaller scale contingency operations and proposed measures to alleviate them. It also recognized the need for military forces to shape the international security environment. The 1997 QDR focused on addressing strains from current operations and the need for military forces to shape the international security environment. The 2001 QDR emphasized the need for a full range of capabilities to cope with unpredictable dangers, including protecting the homeland and maintaining a deterrent presence in critical regions. The 2001 QDR discussed the need to transform the force to meet unexpected future challenges, focusing on pursuing new technologies. The 2006 and 2010 QDRs reflected the impact of the 9/11 attacks and lessons from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, adopting a \"four challenges\" framework. Investments were recommended to shift from traditional force-on-force conflicts towards addressing modern threats. The 2010 QDR marked a significant shift in perspective towards irregular, disruptive, and catastrophic challenges, focusing on exploiting U.S. weaknesses rather than direct confrontation. This change in strategic concepts over successive QDRs reflects a reactive evolution in response to emerging threats. The 1997 National Defense Panel (NDP) anticipated strategic precepts embraced by the 2010 QDR, emphasizing the use of asymmetric means by future foes to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities. The NDP's final report warned about the need to project power globally from distant bases. The 1997 National Defense Panel recommended new programs to address the anti-access challenge, including long-range strike systems and converting ballistic missile submarines. It also suggested substantial investments in experimental exercises to identify evolving challenges and emphasized global security trends, such as transnational threats like terrorism. The 1997 National Defense Panel highlighted global security threats like terrorism, urban warfare, weapons proliferation, space system vulnerability, and cyberwar as critical challenges. The panel criticized the Defense Department for not adapting quickly to changing conflict dynamics, although their recommendations were considered by Pentagon leaders. The evolution of military organization and planning post-1997 NDP report has been cautious. Changes in military services' organization and operational planning were mostly independent of successive QDRs. The Air Force, Army, and Navy made significant organizational changes, with only the 1998 Air Force reorganization partially influenced by the 1997 QDR. In 1998, the Air Force reorganized its tactical aircraft units into ten Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) packages for more predictable overseas deployments. The Army also redesigned its force structure in 2001, introducing modular brigades for flexible deployment. Headquarters and support units were reallocated to the brigades in this new organizational approach. The Army redesigned its force structure in 2001 with modular brigades for flexible deployment, fully manned in peacetime to avoid mobilization of reserves. The goal was to create a more expeditionary force for smaller scale operations. In 2003, the Navy adopted the Fleet Response Plan for deploying aircraft carriers and surface combatants. The Fleet Response Plan was implemented by the Navy to ensure rapid deployment of carriers in crisis regions globally. The plan aims for six carrier strike groups to be ready within 60 days and two more within 90 days. Policymakers may need to consider further organizational changes in response to evolving defense strategies. Recent changes in military organization, such as the increase in special operations forces and focus on homeland defense missions, align with the defense strategy outlined in the 2006 and 2010 QDRs. The establishment of Northern Command and Cyber Command also reflect the thinking in these QDRs. The question arises whether more significant changes are needed to address future adversaries' pursuit of asymmetric advantages over traditional U.S. military strength. The 2010 QDR suggests that the U.S. homeland is no longer a sanctuary from conflict and may be subject to attack in the event of a major regional confrontation abroad. There is a focus on bolstering homeland defense and supporting domestic agencies in disaster response. The evolving threat raises questions about necessary changes in military posture. The 2010 QDR suggests potential changes in command arrangements for defensive missions, ensuring communication during disruptive attacks, continuity of military command, and equipment needs for forces. It focuses on combating anti-access strategies without proposing force reductions but emphasizes defending forward deployed forces and investing in long-range strike capabilities and underwater systems. The 2010 QDR discusses investments in long-range strike capabilities and underwater systems to address challenges in power projection capabilities. Some analysts view U.S. power projection capabilities as a \"wasting asset,\" while DOD officials believe blue water power projection capabilities will remain unmatched. The discussion of the air-sea battle concept raises concerns about anti-access/area denial strategies potentially forcing U.S. forces away from conflict regions, leading to substantial resource implications. Carriers are deemed critical despite the need for less investment in shorter-range systems. Investment in longer-range air- or space-based strike systems, improved intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, increased submarines and submarine-launched weapons, and defenses against ballistic and cruise missiles are highlighted as crucial in the 2010 QDR. Conversion of Army heavy armored brigades into lighter, more mobile Stryker brigades is also mentioned. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for investments in longer-range strike systems, improved intelligence, and defense against missiles. It questions the necessity of maintaining large heavy ground forces for two regional wars, inherited from the Cold War era. In the 21st century, the main great power challenge may be in Asia, primarily a naval theater. Resources saved from reducing heavy ground forces could be reallocated depending on strategic priorities, such as accelerating deployment of brigades with new, lighter armored vehicles. Alternatively, investments in defending access to global commons like air, sea, space, and cyberspace may be more valuable. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of building partner state capacity through security cooperation activities like training, exercises, foreign military sales, officer exchange programs, and education at U.S. military schools. Security force assistance is highlighted as a critical mission, with examples from training Afghan and Iraqi military forces. The 2010 QDR emphasizes building partner state capacity through security cooperation activities like training, exercises, and foreign military sales. It discusses training and advisory assistance with smaller numbers of U.S. troops in the Philippines, the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and Colombia. The Army is focusing on strengthening advisory assistance capabilities of general purpose forces and plans to add 500 \"train-the-trainer\" personnel across all services. The 2010 QDR emphasizes building partner state capacity through security cooperation activities like training, exercises, and foreign military sales. It discusses measures to increase language and cultural training, enhance regional expertise, support ministerial level training in key nations, and expand efforts to support UN and regional security organizations. The potential question arises about the importance of developing specialized security force assistance units compared to reducing the number of general purpose forces. In some nations, training is often contracted out rather than carried out by U.S. military personnel. The 2010 QDR focuses on building partner state capacity through security cooperation activities like training, exercises, and foreign military sales. There is a debate on whether security force assistance requires specialized skills not fully developed by units assigned to multiple missions, and if it will be a secondary priority for general purpose forces. A precedent for this discussion is the establishment of Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in 1987 due to concerns about the under-appreciation of special operations forces' unique value. Today, some Special Operations Forces specialize in foreign military assistance. The 2010 QDR emphasizes building partner state capacity through security cooperation activities like training, exercises, and foreign military sales. There is a debate on whether specialized security assistance units are necessary, with some arguing for separate advisory and assistance units while others believe in the value of building direct relations with foreign militaries. The QDR strategy identifies additional threats that require different capabilities and downplays traditional requirements, suggesting a need for additional capabilities and forces. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of building partner state capacity through security cooperation activities. It discusses the shift in focus from traditional state-on-state conflicts to new threats like cyberwarfare and hybrid warfare. The need for maintaining existing advantages and adding countermeasures to address new means of attack is highlighted. The Quadrennial Defense Review focuses on enhancing existing advantages and implementing countermeasures against evolving threats. It differs from the 1995 Roles and Missions Commission's proposal for a national security review managed by the National Security Council. The QDR mandated by Congress addresses defense strategy, force structure, and resources, while security policy is outlined in annual White House National Security Strategy reports. This has led to criticisms of the QDRs being limited in scope and addressing specific security issues. The 2010 QDR, QDDR, and QHSR focus on security issues and collaboration with other agencies and the White House. They emphasize preventing conflicts, cooperating with partner states, strengthening civilian agencies, improving interagency coordination, and adopting a \"whole-of-government\" approach to security. The reports also address global financial developments, advanced technology diffusion, energy limitations, and the need for a comprehensive security strategy. The evolving security landscape is shaped by global financial developments, advanced technology diffusion, energy limitations, environmental health, climate change effects, demographic trends, ethnic divisions, and global communications pace. While the QDR does not define policy on these matters, policymakers may consider how national security issues impact military power and defense policy. Key policy matters for defense planning include the use of military force, global financial trends, domestic economic and budget trends, and rising costs of personnel and operations. The 2010 QDR report discusses defense planning, including the impact of growing costs on long-term plans, evolving Cold War-era alliances, global cooperation on various issues, and the integration of defense and non-defense responsibilities in national security policy. It emphasizes America's interests in security, prosperity, universal values, and international cooperation, stating the need for Armed Forces with unmatched capabilities to advance these interests. The nation will use force when necessary, either through cooperation or unilaterally. The United States will uphold international norms and provide rights to detainees and prisoners of war. The report emphasizes the importance of considering U.S. and allied interests, treaty commitments, and the costs and risks of military action before committing forces to hostile environments. It also stresses the need for a clear mission and well-resourced plan to ensure the safety of American military personnel. However, some policymakers may find the discussion lacking in addressing contentious issues like preemptive use of force. The QDR report discusses the role of military force in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in light of the threat posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program. The report suggests a need for a more comprehensive and up-to-date discussion on the use of force in addressing global security challenges. The 2010 QDR report does not discuss preemption but reserves the right to use military force to protect U.S. interests. It raises questions about when military action is warranted, the definition of an imminent threat, confidence in intelligence estimates, likelihood of success, consequences of inaction, availability of alternatives, and the impact of unilateral military action on international cooperation. The United States has intervened in various countries for humanitarian reasons and to restore stability, but has not always acted in cases of genocide or government collapse. Military force has been used in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo to address ethnic cleansing and restore order. The invasion of Iraq was partly justified by spreading democracy, but systematic human rights violations in other countries have not always led to U.S. military intervention. The U.S. has intervened in various countries for humanitarian reasons and to restore stability, but not always in cases of genocide or government collapse. Lessons from military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan highlight the challenges of post-invasion stability operations and the difficulties in reestablishing order, overcoming insurgencies, and maintaining order. The Army and Marine Corps had to revisit older doctrinal thinking when faced with unexpected insurgencies in Iraq. The military had to take on governance and economic assistance roles in counterinsurgency operations, leading to a need for future QDRs to address planning processes for military operations, security post-operation, legal authority for governance, oversight mechanisms, reconstruction capabilities, and long-term considerations. The role of military power in promoting stability, preventing wars, and expanding global cooperation in security affairs is questioned in relation to trade, diplomacy, development assistance, adherence to universal values, and communications. Defense officials recognize the importance of non-military means in promoting security, but clashes with other perspectives can occur in shaping foreign policy. The Defense Department has been critical of constraints on security assistance to nations like Indonesia and Pakistan due to human rights and anti-proliferation policies. Recent debates in Congress focus on expanding the Defense Department's role in providing security-related aid to foreign nations. Future QDRs may discuss priorities in building security relationships, coordinating policy among agencies, and engaging with partners and adversaries. The 2010 QDR report emphasizes the importance of clear missions and realistic plans for military personnel in harm's way. The Defense Department has been critical of constraints on security assistance to nations like Indonesia and Pakistan due to human rights and anti-proliferation policies. Recent debates in Congress focus on expanding the Defense Department's role in providing security-related aid to foreign nations. Future QDRs may discuss priorities in building security relationships, coordinating policy among agencies, and engaging with partners and adversaries. The 2010 QDR report emphasizes the importance of clear missions and realistic plans for military personnel in harm's way. Discussions have included historical debates over military strategies such as the \"Weinberger Doctrine,\" the \"Powell Doctrine,\" and efforts by Secretary of Defense William Perry to address when military forces might be committed to uphold less than vital U.S. interests under certain circumstances. President Obama and Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen have also contributed to this discussion. The Director of National Intelligence warned about the global financial crisis as a short-term threat to stability and the shift of global financial strength to Asia in a long-term assessment. The use of military power was discussed in a speech at the University of Kansas in 2010. The report highlighted the shift of global financial strength to Asia, predicting China's economy to surpass the United States by 2036. The BRIC states' economies may exceed the traditional G7 powers soon. The report did not discuss the implications for defense policy. Economic crises can lead to internal instability and aggressive military actions. Building effective multilateral means to stabilize the global economy post-World War II is seen as a success story. Flexible and adaptive new trade and financial institutions are considered essential in the 21st Century. The construction of more flexible and adaptive new trade and financial institutions is seen as essential for global stability. Incorporating more nations into the global economy may promote a more secure international order. Economic cooperation with rising powers like China reinforces the case for resolving security disputes through negotiation and expanding security cooperation. Providing assistance to isolated and impoverished nations in the global economy is as important as building internal security capabilities. Overinvestment in military hardware could weaken economic prospects. Maintaining military power is also important. The growth of China's economy has implications for military planning, with investments focused on regional conflicts and expanding naval forces. Overmatching Chinese military strength in Asia may become more difficult as their economy and technological capabilities grow. The QDR may address the importance of alliances, peaceful dispute resolution, and global norms rejecting the use of force. In the 1980s, Congress implemented measures to reduce budget deficits, including changes in Social Security and tax increases. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act imposed automatic spending cuts if deficit control legislation was not enacted, with defense not exempted from limits. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act imposed automatic spending cuts if deficit control legislation was not enacted, exempting Social Security and limiting reductions in Medicare and Medicaid. Defense spending declined for 14 years after the Cold War, resurging in FY1999 with budget surpluses. A commission has been established to recommend measures for deficit control as Baby Boomers retire. Defense spending may face challenges in the future as Baby Boomers retire and medical costs rise. The FY2011 budget request exempts defense and security spending from a freeze on discretionary spending, with modest growth of about 1 percent per year above inflation through FY2015. Uncertainty remains on whether defense will continue to be exempt from budget cuts or face declines. Economic recovery could impact budget decisions, potentially putting defense spending on the table sooner rather than later. The QDR report does not directly address long-term budget trends, but considers them in the review. The QDR reviewed defense priorities assuming flat baseline budgets through FY2015, but the Administration decided to support modest growth. Future QDRs may assess tradeoffs with different spending levels. A spending freeze could lead to a decline in funding for weapons acquisition, prompting potential force size reductions to protect modernization funding. Real growth in defense spending would allow for increased investments in specific capabilities. The QDR report did not address factors driving up defense costs in recent years, making it harder to sustain planned programs within budget limits. Military personnel costs increased by 45% above inflation from FY1999 to FY2008. Military personnel costs have increased by 45% above inflation from FY1999 to FY2008, with various factors contributing to the rise including catch up pay raises, larger pay raises for mid-grade personnel, increased housing allowances, and improved retirement benefits. Operation and maintenance costs have also grown at a pace of 2.5% to 3.0% per year above inflation since the end of the Korean War, while costs of new weapon systems have been escalating compared to earlier generations. The growth in costs of new weapon systems has outpaced earlier generations, leading to smaller numbers of weapons being purchased with current acquisition funding. This has slowed the modernization of the force. Major acquisition programs have experienced significant cost increases despite efforts to control costs. Ground forces have expanded in size and equipment requirements due to rotational deployments and increased needs for force protection, transportation, and communications. New capabilities have been added to address these demands. The growth in costs of new weapon systems has outpaced earlier generations, leading to smaller numbers of weapons being purchased with current acquisition funding. This has slowed the modernization of the force. Efforts to control costs have not prevented significant cost increases in major acquisition programs. The expansion of ground forces has increased equipment requirements for force protection, transportation, and communications. New capabilities have been added to address these demands, including space and cyber defense, missile defense, homeland defense, and force projection measures. The current long-term defense plan lacks funding for costly programs like replacements for Trident missile submarines and new bombers. The QDR may need to consider measures to rein in cost growth, such as alternative military compensation systems and better cost estimation procedures. The QDR report focuses on regional alliances and military deployments, but lacks assessment of strains on current alliances and measures to revitalize them for the post-Cold War era. It emphasizes the need for tailored deterrence systems in critical regions and maintaining military capabilities to reassure allies. Future QDRs may address issues in managing alliances, such as burdensharing, declining popular support for military power in Europe, allied defense budget cuts, and limitations on missions in Afghanistan. In Asia, support for U.S. counterterrorism operations varies among allies, with issues like U.S. bases in Okinawa causing tensions with Japan's new governing party. Future QDRs may also focus on what the U.S. expects from its allies. Future QDRs may address issues in managing alliances, such as burdensharing, declining popular support for military power in Europe, allied defense budget cuts, and limitations on missions in Afghanistan. In Europe, France has been supportive of U.S. security interests but has disagreements on various issues. In Asia, tensions with Japan's new governing party exist over U.S. bases in Okinawa. Taiwan has sometimes moved towards declaring independence from China, which goes against longstanding U.S. policy. In the international arena, the U.S. faces challenges in managing alliances and resolving conflicts without resorting to force. Issues include strained relations with key Arab states over policies towards Israel, tensions in Indian-Pakistani relations, Brazil's divergence from U.S. policy goals in Latin America, governance problems in Africa, and various other regional issues. Future QDRs may focus on managing regional alliance relations as a critical aspect of security policy. NATO, a successful alliance formed during the Cold War, faces challenges in adjusting to post-Cold War stability. Tensions with Russia over NATO expansion and missile defense systems persist. Future QDRs may address how to encourage cooperation from Russia and integrate it into security systems without compromising key principles. In Asia, U.S. alliances aim to deter China. In Asia, U.S. alliances aim to deter China and engage in regional defense measures. Future QDRs may address mechanisms to encourage China to resolve disputes peacefully and cooperate in global security. The U.S. seeks to foster a cooperative global security order through common action by leading powers. The report emphasizes engaging abroad on the basis of mutual interest and respect, promoting an international order that reinforces the rights of all nations. It assures adherence to global norms like the Geneva conventions in military operations and seeks multilateral sanction for the use of force. However, it does not discuss strengthening existing collective security mechanisms or building new systems for security promotion. Some argue that policy statements from the President or Secretary of State should provide guidance on collective security measures for global security. The Defense Department may address support from allies and major powers like China and Russia in enforcing global rules on proliferation and terrorism. Sanctions against Iran for its nuclear weapons program could be an alternative to military action. The effectiveness of global rules enforcement directly impacts defense planning. Secretary Gates has reportedly discussed follow-on policies if sanctions fail. Future QDRs might address global cooperation on critical issues. Future QDRs may address global cooperation on critical issues such as state support for terrorist groups, arms transfers, and military technology limitations that could impact U.S. security and defense planning. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for export control reforms to enhance cooperation with allies while safeguarding critical technologies. Identifying military transfers that could threaten regional or global stability may also be a focus of future QDRs. Future QDRs may focus on identifying military transfers that could threaten global stability, including advanced air defense systems and anti-ship cruise missiles. Discussions on regulating the trade in destabilizing military technologies and strengthening current regimes to control the spread of nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies may be necessary. Additionally, measures to secure access to space and cyberspace as global commons may be explored to address potential threats and establish rules for open access in these regions. Future QDRs may focus on identifying threats to open access in regions and establishing rules to limit future dangers. The 2010 QDR emphasizes a whole-of-government approach to security and identifies trends reshaping the global security environment. Future QDRs may need to clarify primary responsibility for defining policy and the Defense Department's role in providing leadership or support. The DOD plays a supporting role to DHS policies but also has critical responsibilities. An integrated assessment of security policy can identify global trends and how they impact international security. The Quadrennial Defense Review complements the PPBES by preparing program and budget plans. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) prepares long-term program and budget plans, engaging different parts of the DOD organization. It has sparked extensive discussion and debate in the national security community, serving as a model for long-term planning. Despite some criticism, Congress has applied similar planning models to other departments. The value of QDRs remains debated, leading to regular amendments to the legislation. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is undergoing changes to address resource issues differently and broaden the scope of the independent review. Congress may consider replacing the annual National Security Strategy statement with a more comprehensive, less frequent review. Various recommendations have been made to improve interagency coordination in national security policy-making. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to reassess national security implications. Secretary of Defense Gates has highlighted the need to reevaluate U.S. national security structures due to the rapidly changing global security environment. The current mechanisms may hinder adaptive flexibility, requiring enhancements to processes like the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) to address evolving challenges and opportunities. The appendix includes the current QDR legislation, including Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 118, as well as provisions from the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. These statutes outline the requirements for the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The Secretary of Defense conducts a quadrennial defense review every four years to examine national defense strategy, force structure, modernization plans, budget, and policies of the United States. This review establishes a defense strategy for the next 20 years in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The quadrennial defense review is conducted to delineate a national defense strategy consistent with the National Security Strategy, define force structure and budget plans, identify resources needed for missions at a low-to-moderate risk level, and make recommendations without constraints. The quadrennial defense review is conducted to assess risks in executing national defense strategy missions, with the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff defining political, strategic, and military risks. The Secretary submits a report to Congressional Committees in the year following the review. The quadrennial defense review assesses risks in executing national defense strategy missions. The report includes results of the review, national security interests, threats examined, and assumptions used. The quadrennial defense review evaluates risks in carrying out national defense strategy missions, including factors like cooperation with allies, warning times, levels of engagement in various operations, and the impact on force structure and readiness. It also considers manpower and sustainment policies for conflicts lasting over 120 days, as well as the roles and capabilities of reserve components in the national defense strategy. The quadrennial defense review assesses the necessary equipment and capabilities for reserve components to fulfill roles and missions, including combat forces ratio, specific military platforms, transportation capabilities, forward presence, and resource allocation among theaters. The quadrennial defense review evaluates resource allocation among theaters, potential revisions to the Unified Command Plan, impact of future technologies on force structure, Coast Guard's national defense mission, and homeland defense missions of active and reserve components. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submits an assessment to the Secretary of Defense after each review. The Secretary of Defense receives the Chairman's assessment of the quadrennial defense review, including risk assessment and needed capabilities. An independent panel is established to assess the review before submission to congressional committees. The panel appointed under paragraph (1) will submit an assessment of the quadrennial defense review to congressional committees, including recommendations, assumptions, vulnerabilities, trends, and strategic approaches of potential adversaries. The national security strategy and national defense strategy after January 28, 2008, must consider the effect of climate change on Department facilities, capabilities, and missions, providing guidance for military planners to assess risks and update defense plans accordingly. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 requires the armed forces to update defense plans to address climate change impacts, including natural disasters and other missions. The Secretary of Defense must use climate projections for planning purposes. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 mandates the consideration of climate change impacts in defense planning, including natural disasters.

The Secretary of Defense must submit a report detailing the impact of the assessment on overseas base closure and realignment actions as part of a global defense posture realignment strategy. The report should also cover the status of comprehensive master plans for overseas military bases and include recommendations for additional closures or realignments outside the United States. An interagency review involving the Department of State and other relevant federal departments and agencies is required. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions for a report on the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The Comptroller General must assess the report's compliance with statutory requirements, and if deficiencies are found, the Secretary of Defense must submit a corrective report to congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to congressional defense committees addressing items related to the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review within 30 days of a report by the Comptroller General. This report includes analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in major military capabilities from the previous review. The term \"major military capabilities\" includes capabilities determined by the Secretary, discussed in the 2006 quadrennial defense review report, and described in section 118(d) of title 10, United States Code. Additional members are added to the independent panel for assessing the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review.
