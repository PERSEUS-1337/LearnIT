    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Act is titled the \"Preserving Access to Modern Prosthetic Limbs Act of 2016\" and highlights findings related to Medicare coverage for prosthetic limbs, advancements in prosthetic technology, a decrease in federal spending on prosthetic devices, and the role of Medicare contractors in managing prosthetic coverage. The Medicare Administrative Contractors released a document on Lower Limb Prostheses that could restrict access to modern prosthetic care for Medicare beneficiaries across the United States. The proposed changes would deny access to current standard prosthetic limb technologies. The proposed policies by Medicare contractors would limit access to modern prosthetic devices for beneficiaries, which are outdated, less durable, and less safe. These changes could also impact other federal health programs and commercial insurers. The lack of clinical evidence supporting these policies calls for a transparent process with stakeholder feedback before any coverage modifications are made. A moratorium on proposed Medicare policies would allow for transparent stakeholder feedback before implementation. Moratorium on proposed Medicare local coverage determination on lower limb prostheses. Moratorium on implementing policies in LCD on lower limb prostheses until June 30, 2017. Removal of policy from websites during moratorium. Secretary granted authority to oversee development of local coverage determinations. The Secretary is granted authority to oversee the development of local coverage determinations to ensure consistency with Medicare regulations. This does not prevent enforcement of existing statutes, regulations, and local coverage determinations, except for policies in the LCD on lower limb prostheses. The term \"LCD on lower limb prostheses\" refers to the local coverage determination on lower limb prostheses proposed by a Medicare administrative contractor in document DL33787 released on July 16, 2015."
