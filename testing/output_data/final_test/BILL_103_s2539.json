    "content": "The Act titled \"Landless Native Land Allocation Act of 1994\" is established for the purpose of addressing land allocation for native communities. In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to recognize and settle the aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to lands they used for traditional purposes. The Act awarded $1 billion and 44 million acres of land to Alaska Natives, establishing Native corporations to manage the funds and land. Alaska Natives are enrolled in one of thirteen Regional Corporations, with most residing in communities eligible to form Village or Urban Corporations within the geographical area of a Regional Corporation. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act awarded cash and land rights to Village or Urban Corporations, with corresponding Regional Corporations receiving cash and land with subsurface rights. Certain southeastern Alaska communities, including Haines, Ketchikan, and Wrangell, seek eligibility for benefits under the Act despite not being listed initially. The Act awarded cash and land rights to Village or Urban Corporations in Alaska. Certain southeastern Alaska communities, including Haines, Ketchikan, and Wrangell, have sought eligibility for benefits under the Act for over two decades. Congress directed a report to examine why these communities were denied eligibility, which found that they are similar to other eligible communities. The Act awarded cash and land rights to Village or Urban Corporations in Alaska, with certain communities seeking eligibility for benefits for over two decades. The omissions in eligibility criteria for some communities are not clearly explained in the Act. The Act aimed to address the exclusion of five communities from eligibility for benefits, including forming Village or Urban Corporations and receiving settlement lands. This omission has led to Alaska Natives being denied financial and cultural benefits for years. SEC. 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 40, regarding land allocation for landless natives. The new section SEC. 40 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act defines 'adequate and feasible access' for Landless Village Corporations, including direct access to conveyed lands from the nearest navigable salt water and access to US Forest Service infrastructure. The Landless Village Corporation refers to communities in Alaska that have incorporated and organized as a Village Corporation. The Regional Corporation of southeastern Alaska is defined as per section 7(a)(10). Unprocessed timber is any tree or roundwood not processed to end product standards. The Landless Village Corporation allows Native communities in Alaska like Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell to receive land and benefits under the Act. The Secretary enrolls Native members of these communities in the Corporation, including those previously enrolled in the regional corporation of southeastern Alaska. Native members of a community in Alaska enrolled in a Landless Village Corporation will receive 100 shares of Settlement Common Stock if they were also enrolled as shareholders of the Regional Corporation of southeastern Alaska before March 30, 1973. Additionally, other Native members who did not receive shares through inheritance or gift from a previous shareholder will also be eligible for shares in the Landless Village Corporation. Native members enrolled in a Landless Village Corporation in Alaska before March 30, 1973, will receive shares of Settlement Common Stock equal to what they inherited or received as a gift from the Regional Corporation. The Secretary is authorized to withdraw eligible public lands for conveyance. During a 5-year period, Landless Village Corporations can nominate public lands for conveyance. The withdrawal of land described shall be separate and not subject to certain sections. The Secretary must make the withdrawal within 60 days of enactment, and the lands will remain withdrawn until all conveyances are completed. Public lands eligible for selection are subject to certain criteria. Public lands eligible for selection for conveyance to a Landless Village Corporation in southeastern Alaska exclude lands within conservation units, the Tongass National Forest timber base, national defense reservations, or already selected by other corporations. The lands selected for conveyance to a Landless Village Corporation in Alaska under the Alaska Statehood Act shall be subject to valid existing rights and acreage based on the number of Natives enrolled in the corporation. The Secretary reviews nominations for selection of public lands by Landless Village Corporations to avoid conflicts with other nominations or selections. The Secretary resolves conflicts between nominations for public lands made by Landless Village Corporations, favoring the one closest to the disputed lands. After review and conflict resolution, the Secretary selects and conveys the lands to the respective Village Corporation. The Secretary resolves conflicts between nominations for public lands made by Landless Village Corporations, favoring the one closest to the disputed lands. After review and conflict resolution, the Secretary selects and conveys the lands to the respective Village Corporation. The conveyed lands include surface estate to the nominating Village Corporation and subsurface estates to the Regional Corporation of southeastern Alaska. Access rights are ensured for economic, cultural, and traditional purposes. The appropriate head of a Federal agency must grant permit applications for access to lands conveyed to a Landless Village Corporation. Construction of infrastructure projects for access to these lands is exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act. The Secretary can award a $250,000 grant to Landless Village Corporations for planning and development purposes, exempt from environmental assessment requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act. The subsection allows Landless Corporations to use grants for planning and development purposes. Unprocessed timber from lands conveyed by the Federal Government in southeast Alaska cannot be exported, except for surplus red and yellow cedar timber. The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, annually determines surplus grades of unprocessed cedar timber for manufacturing facilities. Penalties apply for willful export of unprocessed timber in violation of the prohibition. The Secretary may impose civil penalties for exporting unprocessed timber in violation of the prohibition, not exceeding 2 times the timber's gross value. This section takes precedence over any conflicting provisions in the Act or other Federal laws."
