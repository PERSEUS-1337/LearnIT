    "content": "The \"Savings Advancement and Enhancement (SAVE) Act of 1998\" exempts certain interest and dividend income from tax under section 116 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Savings Advancement and Enhancement (SAVE) Act of 1998\" excludes dividends from domestic corporations and interest from gross income up to $250 ($500 for joint returns). There are limitations based on taxable income, with no exclusion allowed if taxed at 39.6 percent. Certain dividends are also excluded. The distribution made by a corporation in a taxable year may be exempt from tax if the corporation is tax-exempt under section 501 or 521. Interest for this purpose includes interest on bank deposits and amounts paid by savings institutions. Interest on deposits or accounts in savings institutions insured under Federal or State law, as well as interest on certain types of corporate debt and obligations of the United States, State, or political subdivisions, may be exempt from tax. The section discusses the taxation of interest on participation shares in a trust established by a corporation under Federal law. Special rules apply to distributions from regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. Amounts of dividends and interest allocated to beneficiaries are deemed to have been distributed. The text discusses the taxation of interest on participation shares in a trust established by a corporation under Federal law. Special rules apply to distributions from regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. Amounts of dividends and interest allocated to beneficiaries are deemed to have been distributed ratably. In the case of nonresident alien individuals, certain exclusions apply only to dividends and interest connected with a trade or business in the United States. Chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include a new item after section 115. Section 116 allows for partial exclusion of dividends and interest received by individuals. Amendments are made to sections 265(a), 584, and 643 of the Code to reflect this provision. Amendments are made to section 643 of the Code to include dividends or interest excluded from gross income under section 116. Section 854 is also amended to address the treatment of dividends received from regulated investment companies meeting certain requirements. The text chunk discusses the treatment of dividends and interest received by a company during the taxable year. If the sum of dividends and interest equals or exceeds 75% of gross income, they are treated as a dividend. Otherwise, only a portion of the dividend is considered based on the ratio of dividends and interest to gross income. Gross income and interest received are reduced by deductions allowable under section 163. The regulated investment company's distribution of dividends as a dividend exclusion for shareholders should not exceed the interest received for the taxable year. The company must notify shareholders in writing within 60 days after the close of the taxable year. Gross income excludes stock or securities gains, and aggregate dividends only include dividends from domestic corporations. For dividend exclusions, rules from section 116 apply, and limitations on dividends received from real estate investment trusts are outlined in section 857(c). Real estate investment trust dividends meeting requirements are not considered as dividends. If the trust's interest income is 75% or more of its gross income, the dividend is treated as interest for tax purposes. The dividend amount is treated as interest if the interest received is a significant portion of the gross income. Adjustments to gross income and interest received are made by excluding net capital gain, deducting allowable deductions, and reducing gross income by certain taxes. The amendments made by section 857(b) define 'interest' and specify that a real estate investment trust must notify shareholders in writing within 60 days after the close of its taxable year regarding the amount of distribution that can be considered as interest for exclusion under section 116. These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1997."
