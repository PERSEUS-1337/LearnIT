The Congress finds that Judge Neringa Venckiene sought asylum in the US after fighting for justice for her niece, Deimante Kedyte, who accused Lithuanian officials of sexual molestation. Deimante's claims were deemed credible by court-ordered psychologists. She accused an assistant to the Speaker of the Parliament and a judge, both linked to her mother. Venckiene and Deimante's father requested a full investigation but faced obstacles. In 2010, Lithuania's parliament found the investigation into Deimante Kedyte's sexual molestation accusations to be negligent. Despite evidence, Deimante's mother was never indicted for complicity. Judge Venckiene was ordered to return Deimante to her mother in December 2011. In 2012, Deimante Kedyte, then 7 years old, was forcibly taken from Judge Venckiene by the Lithuanian Government, sparking protests globally. Deimante refused to return to her mother, fearing sexual molestation, and has since disappeared from public view. In 2012, Judge Venckiene published a book about Deimante Kedyte's ordeal and Lithuania's failure to investigate. This led to the formation of the \"Way of Courage\" political party in Lithuania, electing Judge Venckiene to parliament. She sought asylum in the US in 2013 due to threats and an alleged attempt on her life. The Lithuanian Government has prosecuted journalists, a medical professional, Deimante Kedyte's grandparents, Judge Venckiene's neighbor, and others who supported claims of sexual molestation or opposed the violent removal of Deimante. More than 35 charges have been leveled against Judge Venckiene for various actions, including filing petitions on behalf of Deimante, making critical statements to journalists, and involvement in unauthorized protests. The extradition treaty between the United States and Lithuania does not allow Judge Venckiene to present counter-evidence in US court or argue for political motivation regarding the charges against her. A US Magistrate Judge approved her extradition in April 2018 for hindering a bailiff's activities, not complying with a court decision, and causing physical pain. Former political prisoners and government officials in Lithuania have warned that the charges against Judge Venckiene are politically motivated. The Chairman of the Supreme Court of Lithuania has publicly criticized Judge Venckiene, calling her a trouble for the state. Several countries including Sweden, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Denmark, and Malta have been involved in the case. Several countries, including Sweden, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Denmark, Malta, Ukraine, and Russia, have refused to extradite individuals to Lithuania. Judge Venckiene can present evidence of political motivation in Lithuania's charges against her in her asylum case filed in 2013. SEC. 3. EXCLUSION FROM EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA. Judge Neringa Venckiene is excluded from extradition to Lithuania under the Extradition Treaty and other laws, and is allowed to remain in the US until a final decision is made on her asylum application. Judge Neringa Venckiene is granted free movement and work permission until a final decision is made on her asylum application, and she will not be detained for any immigration-related or extradition-related offense."
