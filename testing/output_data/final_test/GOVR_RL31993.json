    "content": "The U.S. has maintained a stockpile of nuclear weapons since the 1950s, with the Bush Administration reaffirming this policy in 2002. The report discusses the need to resume production of \"pits,\" a key component of nuclear warheads. Warheads consist of a primary stage with chemical explosives surrounding fissile metal, triggering a fission chain reaction. The secondary stage produces most of the warhead's explosive yield through fission and fusion. The Rocky Flats Plant manufactured thousands of pits for nuclear weapons from 1952 to 1989 under DOE supervision. Following a 1989 raid, pit manufacturing operations were suspended and permanently closed in 1992. Since then, the U.S. has had no capability to build pits. The United States has lacked the capability to build pits since 1989, leading to concerns about sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The National Nuclear Security Administration is responsible for restoring pit production to prevent potential impairments to the nuclear stockpile. The National Nuclear Security Administration is responsible for restoring pit production to prevent potential impairments to the nuclear stockpile. Some pits undergo tests that preclude their reuse, including destruction. Warheads are expected to remain in the stockpile beyond their design lives, and without replacement pits, deployed warheads may need to be removed. NNSA anticipates pits will last for decades but will eventually deteriorate, requiring replacement. If new nuclear warheads are designed in the future, new pits would likely be needed. NNSA currently stores thousands of pits. The Nuclear Posture Review emphasizes the importance of pit production for the nation's nuclear deterrent. NNSA is working on the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign to ensure the future viability of the stockpile. Stored pits may not be reliable for future warheads due to aging issues. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign aims to maintain the stockpile's future reliability by manufacturing and certifying pits. It includes short-term pit production, restoring capability for other pit types in the medium term, and building a higher-capacity manufacturing facility in the long term. Funding estimates are provided, and the campaign is based on a decision to reestablish pit fabrication capability at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Los Alamos National Laboratory has the capability to produce about 50 pits per year, which is deemed sufficient for the next 10 years. The Rocky Flats Plant stopped production before completing pits for the W88 warhead, leaving only one pit for evaluation. The urgent need is to produce and certify W88 pits. The current pit program aims to produce and certify W88 pits. It consists of two main elements - W88 Pit Manufacturing and W88 Pit Certification. Additionally, there are Pit Campaign Support Activities at NTS involving subcritical experiments to provide data for W88 pit certification. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign for W88 pits had a reduction in funding from $298.5 million to $296.8 million in FY2004 due to an omnibus rescission. The reduction was applied to W88 pit manufacturing, with $126.7 million appropriated for that component. Source: U.S. Congress. Committee of Conference. In FY2004, funding for W88 Pit Manufacturing was reduced to $126.7 million. FY2008 and FY2009 funding for this activity is included in Directed Stockpile Work at $110 million per year. NNSA projects W88 Pit Manufacturing to continue through FY2007 and beyond in the Weapons Activities budget. The transition from manufacturing to interim production of W88 pits is planned, with Pit Campaign Support Activities at NTS not budgeted in FY2007. Certifiable pits meet quality control and process standards, while certified pits meet product performance standards. War reserve pits meet engineering and physics standards for deployment. NNSA is working to certify pits for use in nuclear weapons without conducting underground tests. This involves demonstrating through various experiments and data that pits from Los Alamos are equivalent to those from Rocky Flats. The goal is to meet engineering and physics standards for deployment. NNSA seeks to ensure the reliability of Los Alamos pits by maintaining tight specifications and manufacturing precision. A facility in PF-4 was established to produce W88 pits at a low rate, with the goal of reaching a sustained manufacturing rate of 10-20 pits/year by FY2007. Los Alamos manufactured its first certifiable W88 pit in April 2003 and aims to certify the first pit made there in FY2007. Alamos aims to certify the first W88 pit made there in FY2007. NNSA indicated that production of certifiable pits was proceeding well, with a goal to produce pits needed for certification experiments. Nuclear testing could accelerate pit certification, but NNSA would likely conduct a series of tests for reliability confirmation. NNSA would conduct a series of tests for reliability confirmation, taking 2-3 years from a presidential decision to test. The Administration aims to reduce this time to 18 months. Testing could accelerate pit certification by a year. DOE's capacity for pit production has changed over time, with contradictory statements on the required capacity. In December 1996, DOE planned for a capacity of 20 pits per year but ended up with 50, which was deemed sufficient for some time. The DOE foresees only replacing destroyed pits unless a life-limiting issue is found. They have the capability to manufacture about 50 pits per year, with 20 pits needed annually for routine testing. The FY1999 budget request aimed to establish a capacity for manufacturing up to 50 pits per year. DOE planned to produce a single war reserve pit per year at LANL starting in FY 1998. The DOE planned to produce a single war reserve pit per year at LANL starting in FY 1998 and provide up to 10 pits annually into the stockpile by FY 2001. They aimed to rebuild, qualify, and certify Trident II pits by FY 2001 and develop the capability to produce 20 pits per year at LANL by 2007. This decision did not change the 50-pit-per-year mission assignment but suspended full implementation until a later date. The NNSA's plans for pit production at LANL have evolved over time, with initial goals set for certification by FY 2005 and a certified pit available by FY 2009. However, delays and challenges have led to adjustments in production capabilities, with a focus on achieving a sustained manufacturing rate of 10-20 pits per year by FY 2007. These changes have been influenced by a better understanding of pit requirements and the complexities of pit certification at Los Alamos. The NNSA's plans for pit production at LANL have faced delays and challenges, leading to adjustments in production capabilities. Certifying pits has proven to be more complicated and time-consuming than anticipated, causing schedule slips. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign includes an intermediate-term element, Pit Manufacturing Capability (PMC), for activities not specifically supporting the W88 warhead. NNSA aims to manufacture and certify pits for the W87 warhead and the B61 mod 7 bomb, which would help in certifying all types of existing pits in the future. While PF-4 could build some developmental pits by 2012, PMC would not manufacture. PMC will not manufacture war reserve pits for the W87 and B61 warheads as spare pits are available for examination. Instead, PMC will focus on developing manufacturing technologies for various types of pits. Plutonium pits undergo changes over time that may affect weapon performance, but as of May 2003, NNSA labs have determined that pits will perform adequately for 45-60 years. The NNSA weapons laboratories have determined that pits will perform adequately for 45-60 years. Experimental data and analysis may change this estimate. Los Alamos and Livermore labs are conducting aging experiments to assess pit lifetimes. Results will guide decisions on a new pit manufacturing facility. NNSA requested funds for Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign and Enhanced Surveillance in FY2004. The FY2004 budget allocated $25.9 million for pit aging research under the Enhanced Surveillance campaign. Factors like stockpile size, pit lifespan, and international events impact the need for new pits. Debate exists on the longevity of pits, with some suggesting they could last decades. Spare pits from retired warheads are seen as a hedge against aging. The debate on the longevity of pits from retired warheads continues, with some suggesting they could last decades due to \"benign aging\" and good crystalline order. NNSA believes pits will ultimately fail, leading to potential issues with all warheads using the same type of pit. Maintaining the stockpile indefinitely may require a higher pit fabrication capacity than currently available. The debate on the longevity of pits from retired warheads continues, with some suggesting they could last decades due to \"benign aging\" and good crystalline order. NNSA believes pits will ultimately fail, leading to potential issues with all warheads using the same type of pit. Maintaining the stockpile indefinitely may require a higher pit fabrication capacity than currently available. The Foster Panel recommended establishing a pit production capability adequate for national needs. NNSA has decided to proceed with pit production despite uncertainty about pit life. Despite uncertainty about pit life, NNSA is planning for a new facility, the Modern Pit Facility (MPF), with a capacity of 125 to 450 pits per year. Operations are expected to start in FY2019, reaching full production capability in FY2021. The estimated cost of the MPF is $2 billion to $4 billion, with five candidate sites being evaluated for its location. The Modern Pit Facility (MPF) management evaluated five candidate sites for its location. Public meetings were held to gather feedback on the draft EIS, with the final EIS delayed due to congressional concerns. MPF's progress was hindered by competing priorities and uncertainties, but the Nuclear Posture Review provided impetus for NNSA to prioritize MPF starting in FY2004. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act reduced funds for the Modern Pit Facility (MPF) from $22.8 million to $10.8 million, causing a one-year delay in the schedule due to cuts in activities like conceptual design and compliance with environmental regulations. NNSA projects a budget increase for MPF through FY2009, despite schedule slippage between June 2003 and February 2004 due to congressional budget reductions. The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration has delayed the Modern Pit Facility Environmental Impact Statement and the selection of a preferred location. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed DOE to submit a report on options for accelerating MPF's schedule and ensuring appropriate sizing. DOE's report states that MPF's schedule can be accelerated by 3 to 4 years by minimizing transitions and that the Los Alamos facility will have inadequate capacity for all but the smallest stockpiles. Accelerating MPF's schedule by minimizing transitions between design steps, starting construction actions early, and using a longer work week can reduce required capacity. This would spread out production over more years, lowering capacity needs. Planning activities before construction are expected to take up more than half of the total project time at a fifth of the estimated cost. NNSA states that using PF-4/TA-55 as the sole pit facility has drawbacks due to inadequate floor space for manufacturing different types of pits for a stockpile in the 1000's of warheads. They recommend against upgrading TA-55 to manufacture 50 pits per year due to high risk and operational challenges. NNSA plans to preserve expertise in pit production by maintaining an interim production capability at Los Alamos, drawing on U.S. experts, and hiring staff for the future MPF operation. They have determined a range of capacities for pit production based on various factors and will continue to revalidate MPF capacity, with an estimated 125 pits per year as a reasonable estimate. The DOE plans to revalidate MPF capacity with an estimated 125 pits per year as a reasonable minimum capacity. Challenges to accelerating MPF production include the potential for PF-4 to produce 1,750 pits by 2050 if it began production at a rate of 50 pits per year in 2015. If MPF's capacity is 125 pits per year and the stockpile included 2,000 pits, NNSA could rebuild them in 16 years. MPF operations could potentially begin in 2034, with the option to accelerate it by a few years. It might be more prudent to wait until pit life and future stockpile size are clearer before proceeding with MPF production. Large-scale production at MPF is scheduled to start three decades after Rocky Flats shut down. Decades after Rocky Flats shut down, the Mixed-Oxide Plutonium Facility (MPF) would operate in a new facility with different processes. Uncertainties about MPF pit performance could lead to pressure for nuclear tests. Despite Senate direction to base MPF capacity on specific requirements, NNSA used parametric analysis. If a smaller capacity is needed, the U.S. would still be committed to MPF, even though it may have been cheaper to use PF-4. Congress is interested in the pit program. Congress has long expressed interest in the pit program, raising concerns over management issues, budgeting, and slow pit certification. They have supported low-rate pit production at Los Alamos. Various Acts have directed the Secretary of Energy to submit reports on pit production plans and to start conceptual design for a production facility. Appropriations conferees criticized the program for being behind schedule and over cost, citing DOE's lack of attention to the critical program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees criticized the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign for being behind schedule and over cost. The House recommended the requested amount for the project but questioned DOE's lack of a viable plan. The Senate recommended increased funding to fully fund activities and deemed the current schedule unacceptable. NNSA later notified committees of projected cost increases for the campaign. The NNSA notified committees that the projected cost for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign had increased to $219.0 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended $237.7 million to fund new pit manufacturing efforts, but expressed concerns about rushing into designing a new facility due to uncertainties about the nuclear weapons stockpile. The House Armed Services Committee bill included the requested amount and noted delays in W88 pit certification. The NNSA planned to certify a W88 pit by FY 2009, with a goal of achieving FY 2007. The House Armed Services Committee recommended providing the requested amount and expressed concerns about Los Alamos's capacity for the long run. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended adding $5 million to the pit campaign for the re-establishment of a large-scale pit production facility. The conference bill provided $199.5 million for the campaign, an increase of $5.0 million over the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $246.0 million for pit manufacturing and certification, expressing concerns about NNSA's funding requests not aligning with their project plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NNSA to revise the plan and report to Congress annually. The House Appropriations Committee provided $194.5 million for pit manufacturing and certification, with a final appropriation of $220.6 million. The increase in funding aims to ensure NNSA's commitment to producing a certifiable W88 pit by 2003 and a certified W88 pit by 2007. The NNSA was directed to provide a revised pit production and certification plan to Congress annually. The FY2004 budget included significant increases for manufacturing the W88 warhead pit, W88 pit certification, pit activities not specific to the W88, and planning for the Modern Pit Facility. Additionally, funding for subcritical experiments supporting W88 pit certification was transferred into the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign. The total FY2004 request was $320.2 million, a 35.7% increase from FY2003. In FY2004, the National Defense Authorization Act recommended authorizing the full amount for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign, urging DOE to accelerate MPF and maintain pit production expertise. The Secretary of Energy was directed to report on steps taken to accelerate MPF and protect production expertise, ensuring the MPF is appropriately sized. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act recommended authorizing the full amount for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign, urging DOE to accelerate MPF and maintain pit production expertise. The Secretary of Energy was directed to report on steps taken to ensure the MPF is appropriately sized. The conference bill included the full request for the campaign, with no comments from the House Appropriations Committee recommending a reduction in funding. The House passed H.R. 2754 without amending the Weapons Activities section, which includes funds for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign. The committee praised NNSA and Los Alamos National Laboratory for their efforts but urged NNSA to reduce costs and take a less aggressive planning approach to the Modern Pit Facility. They recommended reducing funding for the MPF and developing technologies for manufacturing pits other than the W88. The House passed H.R. 2754 without amending the Weapons Activities section, including funds for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the campaign. The Senate later passed H.R. 2754 with amendments, providing $298.5 million for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign, with reductions totaling $21.7 million. The report directed the Secretaries of Energy and Defense to submit a plan to Congress for nuclear force reductions as outlined in the President's revised Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum. The conference report emphasized the need for Congress to review the future Stockpile plan before making decisions on the Modern Pit Facility. Both Houses agreed to the report, with the President signing it into law on December 1. The FY2005 request maintains W88 Pit Manufacturing and Certification levels, increases funding for Support Activities at NTS, and substantially boosts funding for Pit Manufacturing Capability and MPF. The FY2005 budget document includes a detailed breakout for out years, revealing NNSA's plans for pit program elements. Pit manufacturing funding for W88 will be phased out within Campaigns, with certification work reduced. The W88 Pit Certification and Support Activities at NTS are being reduced as certification work is completed. The focus will shift towards developing technology for manufacturing other pit types and on the MPF program. Issues addressed include the need for new pits, required capacity, and how quickly it can be obtained. NNSA's plan for certifying pits without nuclear testing involves using sophisticated techniques to rule out potential sources of failure. Some believe only nuclear testing can guarantee pit functionality due to sensitivity to variations, while others view the certification plan as excessive. Despite past success with non-war reserve pits, the US is likely to follow NNSA's plan in the absence of nuclear testing. The United States is considering the need for new pits for nuclear weapons. Some argue for greater pit manufacturing capability to hedge against uncertainty in pit life and ensure the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent. Others believe pits will deteriorate slowly, and the decision on manufacturing can be deferred. Critics reject the idea of new warheads as it may imply preparation for testing and deployment of nuclear weapons. Those advocating for nuclear disarmament would not support the production of new weapons. The need for new pits for nuclear weapons is debated, with some arguing for increased manufacturing capability to ensure the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent. Critics suggest that existing pits could be replaced without the need for new designs or warheads, and proceeding with manufacturing new pits could divert funds from other stockpile stewardship programs. One study emphasized the importance of starting work on plutonium pit production capability to hedge against uncertainties in pit life and production facility timelines. The FY2004 energy and water development appropriations conference report required a stockpile plan supporting the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum, stating it would be premature to proceed with MPF due to potential impacts on other stockpile stewardship programs. The FY2004 energy and water development appropriations conference report required a stockpile plan supporting the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum. NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks could not provide an estimate of the delivery date of the report in a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee. The report should clarify stockpile size and required capacity, but the stockpile and capacity could change significantly by 2021. The fate of MPF, scheduled to begin full production operations in 2021, remains uncertain. Critics suggest that NNSA could expand PF-4 to build enough pits without MPF, as some areas of PF-4 are not currently used for pit manufacturing. Fabricating plutonium-238 components for space probes, monitoring weapons components, and storing obsolete equipment from past plutonium R&D. Floor constraints hinder efficient layout of pit production equipment at PF-4. Increasing efficiency, using all of PF-4 for pit production, and implementing multiple shifts could potentially raise capacity to over 50 pits a year. National security may require boosting production to 100 pits a year if necessary equipment is prepositioned. Some plutonium work could be consolidated or moved to other facilities. Proponents argue against using PF-4 for production, citing interference with R&D. NNSA estimates PF-4's maximum capacity at 80 pits per year, requiring significant changes to achieve. The prospects for the Modern Pit Facility (MPF) are uncertain due to the need for major changes and considerable expense to increase capacity at PF-4. It is unclear if PF-4 would suffice for future stockpile needs, and congressional approval for MPF is also uncertain. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act provided funding for the pit program, but the future of MPF remains unsettled. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act cut MPF funding from $22.8 million to $10.8 million, pending a report on the stockpile plan. NNSA's report suggests steps to accelerate MPF by 3 to 4 years, but potential delays and tradeoffs raise concerns. The debate shifts towards the desirability of accelerating MPF, with uncertainty surrounding congressional actions and the original schedule. MPF's schedule delay is debated in Congress. Supporters argue against delaying due to uncertainties in plutonium aging and international situations, while opponents believe delaying would prevent unnecessary spending on a facility that may not be needed. MPF's schedule delay is debated in Congress. Supporters argue against delaying due to uncertainties in plutonium aging and international situations, while opponents believe delaying would prevent unnecessary spending on a facility that may not be needed. NNSA could proceed with the current track until 2012, completing preconstruction work. If events turn out unfavorably, MPF could proceed to construction and operation with little or no loss of time. In the short term, a delay in submitting the DOD-DOE report on stockpile plans could impact the MPF in the FY2005 budget cycle. The prospects for acceleration or delay in the longer term are uncertain. Key dates in NNSA's proposal for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign are outlined in Table 4."
