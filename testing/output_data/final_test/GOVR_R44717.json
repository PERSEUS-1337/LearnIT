Congress focused on U.S. trade agreements, trade laws, bilateral trade balances, and reforming the process for determining national security implications of foreign investment. The U.S.-China economic relationship and economic sanctions were also significant topics. During the first session of the 115th Congress, key international trade and finance policy issues were addressed, including the Trump Administration's trade policy shift. Congress focused on U.S. trade agreements, trade laws, bilateral trade balances, and reforming the process for determining national security implications of foreign investment. The U.S.-China economic relationship and economic sanctions were also significant topics. President Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and preference for bilateral trade agreements were notable changes in U.S. trade policy. Renegotiation of NAFTA and talks on modifying the U.S.-South Korea FTA were also important developments. The revised TPP, now known as the CPTPP, raises legislative and policy issues for Congress, including consideration of implementing a revised NAFTA, the rationale for U.S. participation in FTAs, modernizing past FTAs, prioritizing new FTAs, and the impact of FTAs excluding the U.S. on economic interests. Another major issue is the U.S. role in the WTO-led rules-based trading system. The WTO, historically led by the United States, serves as the foundation of the international trading system. President Trump may request an extension of U.S. Trade Promotion Authority until 2021 for expedited consideration of future trade agreements. This presents Congress with an opportunity to examine the U.S. role in the WTO and trade agreement negotiations. The Trump Administration has renewed the use of specific trade laws. The Trump Administration has renewed the use of specific trade laws, such as Section 232, to investigate the national security impact of imports. Emphasis is placed on \"fair\" and \"reciprocal\" trade, with a Section 301 case launched against China for intellectual property rights and forced technology transfer. China is seen as a main competitor of the United States in the global economy. Congress must consider how firms, industries, and workers are affected by potential trade actions, as well as other countries' reactions and future trade policy alignment. The U.S.-China trade relationship is complex and will continue to be closely examined by Congress. In addition to trade practices, Congress may also scrutinize China's Belt and Road Initiative and industrial policies in high technology industries. International trade issues are important to Congress as they can impact the U.S. economy, businesses, and workers. The 115th Congress is uniquely positioned to address trade and finance issues that impact the U.S. economy, businesses, workers, and geopolitical interests. The U.S. has played a key role in shaping the international economic order post-World War II, characterized by trade. Geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can significantly affect international trade and finance, making policy deliberation challenging. Congress's constitutional authority allows for legislating and overseeing international trade and financial policy. The global economic order is facing challenges from rising economic powers like China and internal groups affected by U.S. integration. Despite signs of a synchronized recovery in major economies, there are concerns about monetary policy, inflation rates, slower wage growth, and demographic challenges that could restrain growth. The IMF forecasts global real annual GDP growth to increase by 3.9% in 2018, with the U.S. economy expected to grow at a rate of 2.7%. The U.S. economic growth slowed to 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The dollar has depreciated 9% against major currencies since the start of 2017. The IMF forecasts global real annual GDP growth to increase by 3.9% in 2018. The U.S. economy is expected to grow at a rate of 2.7%. The dollar has depreciated 9% against major currencies since the start of 2017. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive for U.S. consumers but boosts competitiveness of U.S. exports. Developed economies are projected to grow at 2.3% in 2018, with the EU's growth rate remaining low due to high corporate debt. Emerging markets are expected to grow by 4.9%, with China's economy projected to grow at 6.6% in 2018. Commodity exporters are expected to experience a stronger economic growth rate. Commodity exporters are projected to experience a stronger rate of economic growth in 2017 due to a partial recovery in commodity prices, supporting higher global trade volumes. The World Economic Forum (WEF) highlights risks such as cybersecurity, economic protectionism, environmental concerns, and geopolitical tensions that could hinder the projected global economic recovery. Global trade is growing but lags behind historical levels. Emerging markets are expected to face fewer risks to economic growth in 2018 due to a modest recovery in global trade and stable exchange rates, inflation, commodity prices, and equity markets. Growth rates are projected to recover in Russia and Brazil, but political and policy uncertainty could constrain Brazil's growth. China is expected to experience slower growth as it transitions to a more sustainable model focused on innovation and private consumption. Venezuela is facing a major economic and financial crisis. In Venezuela, a major economic crisis is causing the economy to contract, with the IMF projecting a 15% fall in economic activity in 2018. Global uncertainties, such as tensions over North Korea's nuclear policies, could impact markets. Developed and developing economies struggle with low growth, inflation, and productivity, leading to structural stagnation. Declining birth rates and aging workforces in many countries may further restrain economic growth. The United States, accounting for a quarter of global GDP, has seen improvements in economic conditions with a 4.1% unemployment rate in December 2017. Stabilization in oil prices is impacting the economy positively, with low energy prices expected to boost real incomes and stabilize employment in the energy sector. Average U.S. real household incomes are slowly recovering from the 2008-2010 economic recession, with widening income disparity fueling political movements. The Trump Administration lowered corporate tax rates to stimulate the economy and is focusing on infrastructure spending. Reducing U.S. bilateral trade deficits is a priority, although the current account deficit has fallen since 2006. The global trade outlook is improving, with the United States playing a key role as a major importer and overseas investor. The Euro and Japanese yen have been volatile since the Brexit vote, while the pound has slightly appreciated due to Bank of England policy actions. Developing economies are seeing renewed capital flows, leading to currency appreciation in some countries like China and South Africa. However, the Mexican peso continues to depreciate amid uncertainties over NAFTA renegotiations. The U.S. Federal Reserve is strengthening due to stronger economic performance and low inflation rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates due to low inflation rates, while Europe and Japan are pursuing expansionary monetary policies. Reduced uncertainty in global financial markets has lessened upward pressure on the dollar. Congress has the authority to regulate foreign trade according to the U.S. Constitution. In the 19th century, U.S. trade policy was influenced by the conflict between northern manufacturing regions supporting high tariffs and southern raw material exporting regions advocating for low tariffs. The passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 significantly raised U.S. tariff levels, leading to a decline in world trade and worsening the Great Depression. Congress then delegated trade authority to the executive branch through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, allowing the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal agreements. Congress has renewed or amended the Trade Act of 1974 five times, granting \"fast-track\" trade negotiating authority. Since 2002, this authority has been known as trade promotion authority (TPA). In 2015, Congress authorized new TPA through 2021, with the condition that the President requests an extension and Congress does not enact an extension disapproval resolution before July 1, 2018. Congress also exercises trade policy authority through the enactment of laws authorizing trade programs and measures to address unfair practices. Congress plays a crucial role in trade policy by enacting laws for trade programs, addressing unfair practices, overseeing trade policies, agreements, tariffs, and nontariff barriers. It also has authority over international investment and finance policies, including bilateral investment treaties, financial commitments to multilateral development banks, and oversight of agencies like the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Congress has oversight over international financial institutions like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), Federal Reserve, and Department of the Treasury. It also monitors international financial markets impacting the U.S. economy. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was renewed in 2015, allowing expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is crucial in negotiating trade agreements, ensuring adherence to U.S. trade policy objectives set by Congress. It aims to maintain Congress's role in implementing legislation for trade agreements that require changes in domestic law, such as tariffs. TPA has been renewed or amended five times since 1974, with the latest grant expiring on July 1, 2021, pending a request for extension by the President and no disapproval resolution passed by Congress. The World Trade Organization (WTO) administers trade rules and agreements among its 164 members to eliminate barriers and create non-discriminatory trade principles. The WTO was established on January 1, 1995, succeeding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) from 1947. The WTO, established in 1995, succeeded the GATT from 1947. The Trump Administration is skeptical of the WTO, focusing on its dispute settlement system. The future of the WTO as a multilateral trade organization is uncertain due to deadlock in negotiations between emerging-market economies, developing countries, and advanced nations. Developing countries are hesitant to lower tariffs under the Doha Round. Developing countries are hesitant to lower tariffs under the Doha Round, while developed economies push for changes in negotiating dynamics at the WTO. The 11th Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires in December 2017 did not yield major outcomes, but the United States sees it as breaking the impasse at the WTO. The impasse at the WTO was broken at the 11th Ministerial Conference, paving the way for new work in key areas like e-commerce and investment facilitation. The Doha Round concluded in 2015 with no clear path forward, emphasizing the importance of a rules-based trading system. Work continues on sectoral or plurilateral agreements outside of the Doha agenda. The United States has been actively involved in plurilateral talks on e-commerce, investment facilitation, and supporting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. They have signed onto declarations in support of e-commerce and have worked on reducing trade barriers through various agreements. The Trump Administration has made changes to U.S. trade agreements, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump Administration has initiated renegotiations of NAFTA and talks to potentially modify the U.S.-South Korea FTA. They have not acted on other trade negotiations launched during the Obama Administration. President Trump has expressed interest in negotiating bilateral trade agreements with the UK, Japan, and other TPP partners. NAFTA, a comprehensive FTA among the US, Canada, and Mexico, entered into force on January 1, 1994, establishing trade liberalization commitments and new rules for future FTAs. NAFTA, a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) among the US, Canada, and Mexico, has had a significant impact on trade among the partners. It gradually eliminated tariffs and most nontariff barriers, leading to a more integrated North American market. Trade experts credit NAFTA and other FTAs for expanding trade, creating more efficient production processes, and increasing economic linkages among countries. The Trump Administration has made NAFTA renegotiation and modernization a priority, viewing it as the \"worst trade deal\" and focusing on the trade deficit with Mexico. Critics argue that FTAs result in outsourcing, lower wages, and job dislocation. The Trump Administration prioritized NAFTA renegotiation, citing Mexico as a major reason. Negotiations began in August 2017 with an initial goal of concluding by early 2018. Contentious talks led to an extension, with a possible conclusion in spring 2018. Modernization aims to address new issues like technology and e-commerce. The renegotiation of NAFTA aims to modernize the agreement by addressing digital trade barriers and enhancing IPR protection. Various groups have differing opinions on the renegotiation, with some opposing the elimination of NAFTA and others advocating for stronger labor protections and rules of origin. Reported issues in the negotiations include proposals for stronger rules of origin in the auto sector, a \"sunset clause,\" modified dispute resolution provisions, and changes to government procurement provisions. The U.S.-South Korea (KORUS) FTA, signed in 2007 and implemented in 2012, has seen changes in auto and agricultural trade commitments. It aims to eliminate over 99% of tariffs and includes extensive commitments on nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor protections. Despite modest growth in trade, the bilateral trade deficit has increased with U.S. imports rising faster than exports. Imports have risen faster than U.S. exports, leading to an increase in the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea. Views on the KORUS FTA are mixed, with proponents citing increased consumer choice and improved regulatory processes, while critics argue it has negatively impacted U.S. employment opportunities. The business community broadly supports the agreement but has raised concerns about South Korea's implementation of certain commitments. The Trump Administration criticized the KORUS FTA with South Korea, citing a growing trade deficit. Consultations were requested in August 2017 to address concerns, leading to talks to potentially modify the pact in January 2018. Specific commitments sought for modification remain unclear. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the TPP in January 2017, a proposed FTA among 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP withdrawal by the United States has raised concerns about its export competitiveness and leadership in Asia. Some stakeholders support the decision, citing concerns about nontariff commitments infringing on U.S. sovereignty. The Trump Administration is interested in negotiating bilateral FTAs with TPP parties. The remaining 11 parties are moving forward to ratify the TPP without U.S. participation. The conclusion of negotiations on the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to be signed in early March. The 11 countries have agreed to maintain most of the original TPP text, with some provisions pushed by the United States suspended. The economic significance of the CPTPP agreement would be smaller without U.S. participation, but it would provide liberalized trade with Japan, the world's third largest economy. Japan is leading the CPTPP process. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) led by ASEAN may gain importance after the US withdrawal from TPP. RCEP includes ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and New Zealand. TPP countries may strengthen ties with China within RCEP or bilaterally. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) aims to enhance trade between the US and EU. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) aims to liberalize U.S.-EU trade and investment by addressing tariff and nontariff barriers on goods, services, and agriculture. Negotiations began in 2013, with the latest round in October 2016 showing progress in many areas but facing unresolved complex issues. Presently, negotiations are inactive as both sides evaluate T-TIP's status, with Brexit adding complexity to the EU's prospects. Public opposition in the EU due to concerns over GMOs, ISDS, and data privacy, along with U.S. attempts to tighten Buy American provisions, has added uncertainty to the agreement. The future of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) is uncertain due to public opposition in the EU and U.S. evaluation of the agreement's status. Some in the EU are calling for a tougher approach against the \"America First\" policies of the Trump Administration. Support for T-TIP remains high among some Members of Congress, but trade issues persist. U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer emphasized the importance of the U.S.-EU trade relationship. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross highlighted the differences between T-TIP and TPP negotiations, while EC Trade Commissioner Malmstr\u00f6m acknowledged trade irritants between the U.S. and EU. The future of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) is uncertain due to public opposition in the EU and U.S. evaluation of the agreement's status. Trade irritants between the U.S. and EU have changed parameters for T-TIP negotiations. If negotiations stall or terminate, Congress may explore other ways to enhance U.S.-EU trade relations. Brexit presents issues for transatlantic trade relations, with the UK being the EU's second-largest economy and a significant trade partner. Brexit poses economic uncertainties for U.S. firms in the UK, impacting trade relations. Calls for a U.S.-UK FTA have been made, with discussions initiated by President Trump and Prime Minister May in 2017. In 2017, the U.S. and UK launched a Trade and Investment Working Group to explore a post-Brexit FTA. Experts see a potential U.S.-UK FTA as politically feasible due to similar trade policies, but domestic interests could complicate negotiations. Brexit may impact U.S. trade policy, potentially affecting T-TIP and TiSA negotiations. The Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) negotiations aim to liberalize trade in services among signatories, including various economic activities like construction, retail, e-commerce, and financial services. Initiated by a subset of WTO members in 2012, negotiations involving the United States and 22 other participants began in 2013, accounting for over 70% of global trade in services. Despite 21 rounds of negotiations by 2016, the Trump Administration's stance on TiSA remains unclear. The TiSA negotiations, involving the US and 22 other participants, started in 2013 and had 21 rounds by 2016. The Trump Administration has not taken an official position on TiSA, and no negotiations occurred in 2017. Services trade policy issues are unique, with GATS being the only multilateral rules on trade in services. Policy experts suggest updating GATS for effective liberalization. TiSA is of interest to Congress due to its potential impact on the US services sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the economy. Since China's economic and trade liberalization in 1979, U.S.-Chinese economic ties have significantly expanded. Total bilateral trade increased from $2 billion in 1979 to $636 billion in 2017. China became the largest trading partner of the United States, with a merchandise trade deficit of $375 billion. U.S. merchandise exports to China grew by 82.4% from 2008 to 2017, making China a $400 billion market for U.S. firms. China's large population, infrastructure needs, and rising middle class make it a significant market for U.S. businesses. Chinese foreign direct investment in the U.S. has increased significantly. China plays a crucial role in the global supply chain for many U.S. companies. Despite growing commercial ties, the U.S.-Chinese relationship is complex and contentious. Trade tensions often stem from China's economic policies. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China arise from China's incomplete transition to an open-market economy, leading to policies that distort trade and FDI flows. Despite some optimism among businesses investing in China, there is a perception that foreign businesses are less welcomed. The U.S. has initiated numerous WTO dispute settlement cases in response to these issues. China has faced more WTO dispute settlement cases than any other member, with 12 cases against the United States. In December 2016, China filed a case over U.S. treatment of China as a non-market economy. Additionally, China initiated cases against the U.S. over safeguard measures on washing machines and solar cells. The Chinese government's involvement in economic decision-making, including policies that encourage high household savings and provide low-cost financing to Chinese firms, especially state-owned enterprises, continues. The Chinese government provides low-cost financing to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to promote key industries. This leads to overcapacity in sectors like steel and aluminum. Foreign firms face restrictions in China, including discriminatory regulations and uneven enforcement of commercial laws. The Chinese government imposes discriminatory regulations, FDI barriers, export restrictions, and technology transfer requirements on foreign firms. They aim to transition from manufacturing to innovation with policies like \"indigenous innovation\" and the \"Made in China 2025\" plan. New regulations in banking and insurance restrict foreign providers under the guise of national security. American firms also face challenges with Intellectual Property Rights protection and cyber-theft in China. American firms in China face challenges with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection and cyber-theft. Despite improvements in IPR enforcement, piracy rates remain high. Many industry officials believe trade secrets and trademarks are inadequately protected. China's internet restrictions burden foreign suppliers, with top global sites blocked. Cyberattacks by Chinese entities are also a concern. American firms in China face challenges with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection and cyber-theft. Cyberattacks by Chinese entities against U.S. firms have raised concerns over potential theft of U.S. IPR, especially trade secrets. President Obama issued an executive order authorizing sanctions against those engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities. Talks between Chinese and U.S. officials on cybersecurity led to an agreement in September 2016. In 2016, the U.S. and China agreed not to support cyber theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage. They established a high-level dialogue on cybercrime. In 2017, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a \"100-day plan on trade\" and the \"U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.\" In May 2017, the U.S. and China announced market openings for various products and services. China agreed to open its markets to U.S. beef, biotechnology products, and more, while the U.S. agreed to Chinese cooked poultry and welcomed Chinese purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas. President Trump hinted at linking trade policy with China's cooperation on North Korea. In July 2017, the two countries held the first session of the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington, DC, focusing on a new one-year action plan on trade and investment. The U.S. and China held a Comprehensive Economic Dialogue (CED) focusing on a new one-year action plan on trade and investment. The outcome of the meeting was unclear, with no joint fact sheet released. The U.S. side mentioned China's acknowledgment of reducing the trade deficit, leading to claims of high tensions and disagreements. China issued a document outlining positive outcomes, including discussions on trade in services, steel, aluminum, and high technology. In August 2017, the Trump Administration announced a Section 301 investigation into China's protection of U.S. IPR and forced technology transfer policies. The Section 301 case against China could impact bilateral commercial ties, especially if pursued unilaterally. President Trump aimed to make U.S.-China trade \"fair and reciprocal\" due to trade barriers and IPR practices. The Trump Administration is taking a tougher stance against China. The Trump Administration is taking a harder line against China on trade issues, with a focus on significant trade deficits and imposing import restrictions. The enforcement of anti-dumping measures on Chinese imports is a major priority, along with addressing China's IPR policies. This approach could potentially impact U.S. global leadership and weaken efforts to push China towards fair trade practices. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence warns that China and Russia aim to challenge U.S. influence globally. Uncertainty among U.S. allies about its commitment may lead them to reconsider trade policies. Trade agreements impact economic growth, income distribution, and employment, with economists arguing that liberalized trade benefits the economy in the long run. International trade and investment promote efficiency and growth in the economy, offering consumers a wider variety of goods and services. While trade agreements can initially lead to job and firm losses, the long-term benefits include enhanced production, employment, and reduced poverty levels globally. Trade has reduced global poverty rates by half over the past 25 years, impacting employment, wages, and income distribution. Economists believe that macroeconomic factors like technology and demographics play a significant role in shaping trade relationships. Measures show that exports support 11.7 million jobs in the U.S., with workers in export-intensive industries earning 18% more on average. Manufacturing industries earn 18% more on average compared to other industries. Global markets opening up has increased international competition, leading to adjustment costs for workers and producers. Closed plants can result in economic dislocations like property devaluation and lost tax revenues. The global transformation facilitated by advances in communications, transportation, and technology can impact local communities by affecting property values, tax revenues, schools, and infrastructure. Different industries evolve at varying speeds due to technological advancements, productivity, and efficiency, leading to disparities in economic rewards, capital attraction, and competitive challenges. The global transformation driven by advancements in communications, transportation, and technology has led to complex supply chains crossing borders, reshaping traditional trade concepts, and increasing global economic participation. Trade liberalization can impact workers differently within the same industry, with some experiencing wage reductions when switching jobs due to imports from low-income countries. Conversely, occupations linked to exports may see positive effects. Trade liberalization can impact workers differently within the same industry, with some experiencing wage reductions when switching jobs due to imports from low-income countries. Governments have implemented safeguards and worker retraining programs to address adverse effects of trade liberalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) provides federal assistance to parties affected by foreign trade, aiming to mitigate negative domestic effects. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, provide federal assistance to workers, firms, and farmers affected by international competition. The largest TAA program, TAA for Workers (TAAW), offers career services, training, and income support to workers impacted by imports or job relocation. TAA programs aim to mitigate negative domestic effects of trade liberalization. TAA for Firms provides technical assistance and matching funds to trade-impacted businesses. The program is administered by the Department of Commerce with a $13 million appropriation in FY2017. TAA for Farmers was reauthorized but has not received funding since FY2011. Intellectual property (IP) grants legal rights to creators and is a source of comparative advantage for the United States. The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) in the United States is crucial for commercial, health, safety, and security interests. This includes addressing issues such as cyber-theft and seeking IP commitments in trade agreements that exceed the minimum standards of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). The United States aims for \"TRIPS-plus\" standards in its free trade agreements to ensure a level of protection similar to U.S. law. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPA) aims to enhance intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, including addressing cyber-theft and protecting trade secrets. The renegotiation of NAFTA may involve updated provisions on pharmaceutical patents, copyright, trademarks, geographic indicators, and enforcement measures. Congress may assess if the IPR outcomes align with U.S. trade objectives in the TPA. The United States has various trade policy tools to advance intellectual property rights (IPR) goals, including the \"Special 301\" report and \"Section 337.\" These tools are relevant for addressing IPR challenges in emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil. President Trump's focus on trade enforcement may increase the prominence of these tools. The U.S. Trade Representative publishes the \"Special 301\" report annually to address IPR issues. The USTR publishes an annual \"Special 301\" report to identify countries with inadequate IPR protection. Countries designated as a \"Priority Foreign Country\" could face trade enforcement actions. China remains a top concern and is on the \"Priority Watch List.\" In August 2018, USTR initiated a Section 301 investigation of China's IPR practices. The U.S. International Trade Commission conducts \"Section 337\" investigations into allegations of U.S. imports infringing U.S. IP. The U.S. is a major source and recipient of foreign direct investment, with important economic, political, and social interests at stake in international policies. The development of international policies on direct investment is crucial, with U.S. investment policy being a key focus of trade debates. Recent presidents have supported open investment policies, but there are concerns about potential restrictions on foreign investment. The Administration's stance on investment issues in NAFTA renegotiation may signal changes in U.S. investment policy direction. The United States has established policies treating foreign investors equally to U.S. firms, with exceptions for national security. The President has discretionary authority over U.S. direct investment policy, including the ability to block investments threatening national security. Congress plays a role in formulating foreign investment policy, as seen in the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 establishing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 established the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to oversee foreign investments, including those related to homeland security and critical infrastructure. The President has the authority to block foreign investments that threaten national security, with growing concerns over Chinese investment in U.S. high-technology firms leading to proposed amendments to the CFIUS process in 2017. The proposed amendments to the CFIUS process, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2017 (FIRRMA), aim to reform the foreign investment review process by emphasizing both U.S. economic and national security interests. The changes include provisions that would scrutinize foreign investments based on the country's security arrangements with the United States. Over the past decade, national security concerns have led to increased restrictions on foreign investment in various countries. Different approaches are taken to review and restrict foreign investment on national security grounds, leading to varying entry conditions for foreign investors. The United States negotiates international investment agreements to reduce restrictions and ensure nondiscriminatory treatment. The United States negotiates international investment agreements, such as Investment Treaty (BIT) and free trade agreements (FTAs), to reduce restrictions on foreign investment and ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors. U.S. IIAs are comprehensive and of a higher standard compared to other countries' agreements. Congress may focus on investment issues during the NAFTA renegotiation, possibly looking to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) for guidance on investment rules. The NAFTA renegotiation may focus on the treatment of ISDS, which involves international arbitration of private investors' claims against host country-governments. The U.S. government and businesses traditionally favor ISDS, but civil society groups contest it. The USTR's objectives for NAFTA do not mention ISDS, but renegotiating these commitments is possible. Questions may arise on whether to retain ISDS, make changes modeled after TPP, or pursue an alternate approach. The number of ISDS cases has increased due to the growth of FDI. Investment issues in other trade negotiations like T-TIP could require congressional oversight. BIT discussions with China and India are currently stalled, raising questions about achieving high standard investment commitments. Congress may also consider multilateral discussions. The Department of Commerce's SelectUSA program aims to attract and retain business investment in the United States, serving as an information resource and advocating for inward investment. Congress may consider codifying the program to stabilize its operations. The SelectUSA program aims to attract and retain business investment in the United States. Supporters argue for a permanent authorization to boost exports and jobs, while critics suggest improving the investment environment through other policies. The Trump Administration's support for investment attraction efforts is evident through hosting the 2017 SelectUSA Investment Summit. Trade enforcement encompasses various functions to ensure compliance with international commitments. The USTR enforces U.S. rights under trade agreements, with CBP and ICE detecting fraud and ensuring compliance at the border. CBP also facilitates trade and coordinates with 47 partner government agencies. The USTR enforces U.S. rights under trade agreements, with CBP and ICE detecting fraud and ensuring compliance at the border. CBP also coordinates with 47 partner government agencies that have licensing and regulatory authority over various imported merchandise. U.S. trade laws include trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws, enforced by agencies such as the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce. Other laws address unfair trade practices related to intellectual property rights. The U.S. enforces trade agreements through the dispute settlement process of the WTO and various U.S. FTAs. The USTR enforces trade agreements through the dispute settlement process of the WTO and U.S. FTAs. Dispute settlement is a common feature of WTO agreements with over 500 cases filed since 1995. U.S. FTAs also have dispute settlement mechanisms, but they are used less frequently. The USTR can launch cases on behalf of the United States after input from various agencies and stakeholders. Countries typically try to resolve disputes through consultation first, with both the WTO and U.S. FTAs offering mechanisms to do so. The DSU in the WTO outlines procedures to ensure the dispute is handled efficiently, with a six-month timetable for case conclusion and the option to appeal to the Appellate Body. The USTR enforces trade agreements through the dispute settlement process of the WTO and U.S. FTAs. Dispute settlement is a common feature of WTO agreements with over 500 cases filed since 1995. U.S. FTAs also have dispute settlement mechanisms, but they are used less frequently. The DSU in the WTO outlines procedures to ensure the dispute is handled efficiently, with a six-month timetable for case conclusion and the option to appeal to the Appellate Body. Cases can be appealed to the Appellate Body. If a party is found to violate an agreement, it has time to bring its law into conformity with the decision. If the party refuses to comply, the aggrieved party can retaliate by withdrawing trade concessions to a level equivalent to the economic damage. The entire dispute settlement process can take two to three years. The U.S. Administration is skeptical of the WTO's dispute settlement system and has blocked the appointment of Appellate Body panelists. The United States has not yet proposed specific solutions to perceived shortcomings in trade dispute settlement. Some Members of Congress question if more cases should be brought to dispute settlement, if panelists interpret agreements too broadly, and if proceedings are timely. Trade remedies like antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard measures are used to address harmful trade practices. The United States uses trade remedies like antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard measures to address harmful trade practices. These remedies are administered through the International Trade Administration and the United States International Trade Commission. The World Trade Organization agreements also impose specific obligations on these measures. Congress has enacted and amended U.S. trade remedy laws over time. Individual cases do not require direct congressional action. The United States uses trade remedies like antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard measures to address harmful trade practices. Safeguard remedies, based on Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, provide temporary measures to help domestic industries adjust to import competition. The International Trade Commission is the principal agency involved in Section 201 investigations, but presidential action is required for implementation of a remedy. The International Trade Commission is involved in Section 201 investigations, but presidential action is needed for remedy implementation. Congress can enact a joint resolution of disapproval if the President's action differs from the ITC's recommendation. Trade remedy laws are controversial, with differing views on their impact and necessity for protecting domestic companies and workers. Congress has limited options for action in trade remedy cases, but oversight of investigating agencies. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose import restrictions under the \"national security clause.\" The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 includes Section 232, allowing the President to impose import restrictions based on national security concerns. The Commerce Department conducts investigations, and if affirmative, the President can decide on actions like tariffs or quotas within 90 days. The President has the authority to impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures under Section 232 to address adverse effects, with no limits on duration. The Commerce and Defense Departments have discretion in defining investigation scope. Digital trade barriers are a key focus in U.S. trade agreements due to the growing importance of digital trade flows. The United States prioritizes addressing digital trade barriers in trade agreements to maintain a free and open internet. Congressional oversight includes regulating cross-border data flows and addressing digital trade issues in international forums. Policy challenges include restrictions on data flows, intellectual property rights infringement, forced source-code disclosure, online filtering, and burdensome testing requirements. The United States is working to address barriers to digital trade through trade agreements and international forums. Cross-border data flows between the US and Europe are the highest globally. In 2015, the CJEU invalidated the Safe Harbor Agreement between the US and the EU. In 2016, the EU and US agreed on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor Agreement. The new agreement included additional obligations for the US government and companies, such as a new ombudsman and limitations on surveillance. It also involved proactive monitoring and enforcement by US agencies and is subject to an annual joint review. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement involves monitoring and enforcement by U.S. agencies and is subject to an annual joint review. Some parties have challenged the Privacy Shield in court, but the EU reaffirmed it after the first review in September 2017. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will go into effect in May 2018, potentially imposing additional requirements on companies enrolled in the Privacy Shield. EU privacy regulators have issued guidance on transferring data under the GDPR. The EU Member States will enforce GDPR implementation, and Congress may monitor its impact on U.S. companies doing business in the EU. Exchange rates are crucial in the global economy, affecting imports, exports, and investment flows. Different governments have varying approaches to exchange rates, with some letting the market determine value and others pegging it to a specific value. Some concerns have been raised about governments purposefully undervaluing their currency. Policy experts have raised concerns about governments undervaluing their currency to gain an unfair advantage in exports. Some economists are skeptical about currency manipulation and its impact on the value of the dollar and the U.S. economy. The International Monetary Fund members have committed to refraining from currency manipulation, but no country has been publicly labeled as a currency manipulator. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for monitoring this under U.S. law. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for monitoring currency manipulation under U.S. law. Despite concerns raised by policy experts, no country has been publicly labeled as a currency manipulator in over two decades. President Trump criticized China and Japan during his campaign but has not found them to be manipulating their currencies since taking office. The U.S. has identified addressing currency manipulation as a negotiating objective in NAFTA renegotiations, which could set a precedent for future negotiations. Some stakeholders seek to improve labor and environmental conditions in other countries through U.S. FTAs to prevent lost jobs and production to overseas firms. They believe trade agreements can enable economic growth to address these issues. The negotiation of U.S. FTAs has highlighted the importance of worker rights provisions to protect U.S. labor from unfair competition. Since 1988, Congress has included worker rights as a principal negotiating objective in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation to protect U.S. labor from unfair competition and promote core internationally-recognized worker rights. The United States has been at the forefront of using trade agreements to promote freedom of association, collective bargaining rights, elimination of forced labor and child labor, and non-discrimination in employment. The ILO, a UN specialized agency, promotes labor standards through international conventions. It assesses country standards and provides technical assistance but lacks enforcement authority. The US aims to strengthen labor provisions in NAFTA renegotiation, evolving from the first FTA (NAFTA) that committed parties to enforce labor laws and resolve disputes. Recent FTAs include stronger language on labor rights. The proposed TPP and current NAFTA renegotiations aim to incorporate stronger language on labor rights, with specific commitments for certain countries. There is a concern among U.S. policymakers about the nexus between trade and environmental protection, with some arguing that trade liberalization may negatively impact the environment while others believe they are mutually supportive. The United States has negotiated environmental provisions in FTAs, evolving over time with the Trade Act of 2002 granting trade promotion authority containing environmental negotiating objectives. These provisions aim to enforce environmental laws and resolve disputes, supporting U.S. environmental goals through trade liberalization. Environmental obligations in U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea, as well as the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority legislation, require parties to adopt and maintain laws consistent with multilateral environmental agreements. Non-compliance can result in the withdrawal of trade concessions. The WTO lacks environmental protection provisions, but Congress may push for revised environmental clauses in NAFTA renegotiations. Congress may examine the consistency of renegotiated environmental provisions with Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and whether new provisions, such as fishing subsidies, are included in a revised NAFTA. The President has authority to control exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons, with various programs and statutes administered by different departments. In the 115th Congress, controls and sanctions may pose challenges in balancing U.S. foreign policy and national security with commercial interests. The Obama Administration initiated a review of the export control system in 2009, currently divided among Commerce, State, and Treasury for licensing based on product type. Defense advises on license applications, with enforcement shared among multiple agencies. The Obama Administration initiated a review of the export control system in 2009, currently divided among Commerce, State, and Treasury for licensing based on product type. Enforcement is shared among multiple agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. Key elements of the Administration's reform agenda included creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single enforcement coordination agency, and harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List. The Obama Administration's reform initiative included the establishment of an interagency Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2) and an integrated information technology system. The idea of a single licensing agency for export control was not pursued. The 115th Congress and the Trump Administration may review the work done by the Obama Administration, including the potential placement of a licensing agency. Economic sanctions are coercive measures to induce policy changes, such as trade embargoes and restrictions. The United States maintains economic sanctions against foreign governments, entities, and individuals, including those identified as supporters of terrorism, nuclear arms proliferators, and violators of human rights standards. These sanctions can include trade embargoes, restrictions on imports and exports, denial of foreign assistance, and control of foreign assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Secondary sanctions also impede trade and transactions involving U.S. citizens or businesses with foreign entities in third countries. The United States imposes economic sanctions on countries and entities that support terrorism, violate human rights standards, and threaten regional stability. Sanctions target individuals involved in human rights abuses, corruption, terrorism, narcotics trafficking, weapons proliferation, cyber activities, conflict diamond trade, and transnational crime. Additionally, restrictions are placed on individuals and entities to comply with United Nations Security Council requirements. The 115th Congress took a strong stance on foreign policy decisions, including deterring Iran's missile activities and human rights abuses, isolating Russia over Crimea and Syria, and halting North Korea's nuclear weapon development. Sanctions were a key tool in addressing these challenges. Many Members of Congress introduced bills to support importer requests for temporary tariff suspensions on various goods. Importer requests for temporary tariff suspensions on chemicals, raw materials, or non-domestically made components used in manufacturing to reduce costs and enhance competitiveness. Miscellaneous tariff bills (MTBs) package these requests together, with the most recent MTB enacted in 2010 and expired in 2012. The process for considering MTBs was reformed in 2016 with the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act. The Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 reformed the process for considering Miscellaneous Tariff Bills (MTBs). The legislation passed with overwhelming support in both the House and Senate. The law established a new process for initiating two MTBs, one in 2016 and one in 2019. The International Trade Commission (ITC) is now responsible for receiving petitions for reduced or suspended duties, collecting public feedback, and reporting findings to Congress. The 2016 MTB process began in October 2016 and concluded with Congress receiving the final report in June 2017. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2017 was introduced in November 2017 with identical bills H.R. 4318 and S. 2108. The House passed H.R. 4318 in January 2018, while Senate bill action is pending. The U.S. uses trade to promote economic growth in developing countries through trade preference programs and trade capacity building. Congress has been involved in this policy since 1974. Since 1974, Congress has established six trade preference programs to assist developing countries, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), Andean Trade Preference Act (APTA), Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), Haitian Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act (HOPE), and trade preferences for Nepal. These programs provide temporary, duty-free access to the U.S. market for select exports. The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-27) reauthorized and made revisions to AGOA and GSP. The 115th Congress is overseeing trade programs like AGOA, GSP, and HOPE, with a focus on reauthorizing GSP. They are also considering the impact of potential trade agreements on preference program beneficiaries. Congress may consult with the Administration on enforcing eligibility criteria for these programs. GSP provides duty-free treatment for products from developing countries. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free treatment for products from designated beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) and eligible least-developed beneficiary developing countries. Countries must meet criteria to remain eligible, including protecting intellectual property rights and worker rights. The program includes limits on product eligibility to protect U.S. manufacturers and workers. The GSP program was authorized in the Trade Act of 1974 and was most recently extended until December 31, 2017. The GSP program, authorized in the Trade Act of 1974, provides duty-free treatment for products from designated beneficiary developing countries. It was most recently extended until December 31, 2017. Legislation for a three-year extension (H.R. 4979) has not yet been renewed, and the Trump Administration's stance on GSP seems favorable, with a focus on duty-free access for all beneficiaries and improved enforcement of preference programs. The White House supports improved enforcement of preference programs, as shown in a Trade Policy Staff Committee investigation of Bolivia's compliance with GSP eligibility related to child labor. The Administration also aims to remove certain products from GSP eligibility if the country is \"sufficiently competitive.\" AGOA is a non-reciprocal U.S. trade preference program for eligible sub-Saharan African countries, offering duty-free treatment for qualifying imports. AGOA benefits are more extensive than GSP, including duty-free treatment for certain textile and apparel products. The AGOA program was authorized by Congress in 2000 to promote export-led growth in sub-Saharan Africa and improve U.S. relations with the region. In the 114th Congress, AGOA's authorization was extended for ten years until September 30, 2025. This longer timeframe aims to reduce investor uncertainty and give AGOA beneficiaries a competitive edge in exporting to the U.S. market. However, utilization of AGOA preferences is concentrated in a few countries and product categories, with domestic constraints hindering export capabilities. Proposed legislation like H.R. 3445 and S. 832 seek to address these challenges by enhancing trade capacity building efforts for AGOA countries. The 115th Congress may focus on the Trump Administration's review of AGOA eligibility criteria for Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. President Trump reinstated AGOA eligibility for Gambia and Swaziland. The Congress may also consider advancing U.S. trade relations with the region and potential FTA negotiations. Trade capacity building (TCB) supports a country's ability to engage in international trade through various forms of assistance. The United States uses Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to promote economic development, increase trade and investment opportunities, and enhance trade policies. Currently, there is no single agency responsible for coordinating U.S. government TCB efforts. USAID typically receives the most funding for TCB activities, with infrastructure-related funding also provided through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The United States utilizes Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to boost economic development and trade opportunities. Various U.S. government agencies, including USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), are involved in funding TCB projects. Coordination among these agencies has been a concern for Congress, leading to proposed legislation to enhance effectiveness and formalize coordination efforts. The 115th Congress oversees U.S. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to support exports, investment, and economic growth. Trade finance and promotion activities aim to align with U.S. foreign policy goals and commercial interests, raising questions about economic justifications and federal resources. The Ex-Im Bank provides export credit assistance to help U.S. businesses. The Ex-Im Bank provides export credit assistance, backed by the U.S. government, to finance U.S. exports and support U.S. employment. It charges fees to fund its activities and operates under a statutory charter extended by Congress. Proponents argue it benefits U.S. exports and jobs, while critics claim it crowds out private sector activity and poses risks to taxpayers. The Ex-Im Bank's Board of Directors has unfilled positions, limiting its ability to approve export financing over $10 million. There is a backlog of $40 billion in transactions. President Trump nominated individuals for the Board, pending Senate approval. Ex-Im Bank follows OECD guidelines, but concerns arise from non-OECD members like China providing financing. In FY2017, OPIC authorized $3.8 billion in new commitments for financing and political risk insurance, reaching a record high of $23.2 billion for its overall portfolio exposure. OPIC promotes economic growth in developing economies by providing project and investment funds financing and insuring against political risks abroad. OPIC, backed by the U.S. government, charges fees for its services to fund activities and is subject to annual appropriations. Its authority was extended through September 30, 2017, and may face scrutiny in the 115th Congress due to a proposal to consolidate it with other development finance activities. Supporters argue that OPIC fills gaps in private sector investment support, helps U.S. businesses compete, contributes to deficit reduction, and advances U.S. foreign policy interests. OPIC, part of the Department of Commerce, contributes to economic development in developing countries and advances U.S. foreign policy interests. Critics argue it diverts capital from efficient uses, crowds out private alternatives, and questions its development benefits. Changes in international development finance landscape raise questions about OPIC's competitiveness and the need for international rules on investment financing. The International Trade Administration (ITA) aims to strengthen U.S. industry's international competitiveness, promote trade and investment, and ensure fair trade and compliance with trade laws and agreements. The International Trade Administration (ITA) provides export assistance to U.S. companies seeking foreign business opportunities, including export counseling, market research, business matching services, and advocacy. ITA has a network of trade promotion professionals in over 70 countries and over 100 U.S. locations to promote U.S. exports and attract investment to the United States. Congress may consider ITA funding levels and its role in U.S. export promotion efforts. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) focuses on export promotion and international development, assisting businesses in early stages of international transactions. President Trump's budget proposes to eliminate TDA, with a $12.1 million budget request for an \"orderly closeout\" starting in FY2019. Supporters highlight TDA's unique role, while critics argue its functions overlap with other agencies. Since World War II, governments have utilized formal international institutions and informal forums to coordinate economic policies. With increased economic integration over the past 30 years, international economic policy coordination has become more active. This coordination involves a mix of formal institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and regional development banks, as well as informal forums like the G-7 and G-20. Congress oversees U.S. participation in these international economic forums and financial institutions. The 115th Congress oversees U.S. participation in international economic forums and institutions, authorizing contributions and approving political appointees. They also monitor new institutions like the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the evolving international financial architecture post-financial crisis. Additionally, Congress is likely to continue monitoring major economic developments overseas, such as the Eurozone's economic conditions. The Group of 20 (G-20) emerged as the premier forum for international economic cooperation following the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. This group includes developed and emerging-market economies, accounting for 85% of global economic output, 75% of global exports, and two-thirds of the global population. Venezuela is facing an acute economic crisis with speculation of a government debt default. The G-20 countries hold annual summits and other meetings. The G-7, excluding Russia, also meets regularly. Congress oversees the Administration's participation in these forums. Italy hosted the G-7 summit in 2017, and Germany hosted the G-20 summit. President Trump attended these summits with his \"America First\" platform. President Trump attended the G-7 and G-20 summits with his \"America First\" platform, signaling a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy. The United States was viewed as isolated at the summits, with differences over climate change and trade. Some see this as a trend of U.S. leadership abdication, while others argue it aligns with Trump's campaign pledges. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) promotes global macroeconomic stability and has 189 member countries. The IMF's functions have evolved to focus on surveillance of member states and the global economy, lending during economic crises, and providing technical assistance. The U.S. authorized participation in an IMF reform package in FY2016, doubling core resources and giving emerging markets more governance power. Legislation in the 115th Congress is evaluating IMF rules on large loans, used controversially during the Eurozone crisis. The IMF Reform and Integrity Act (H.R. 1573) in the 115th Congress aims to limit the U.S. Executive Director's voting power in large IMF programs. The MDBs, including the World Bank and others, provide financing for economic development in developing countries using private capital markets. The MDBs were established post-World War II to fill the gap in financing for war-torn or developing countries. The MDBs have thrived over the past decades, but the international economy has changed. Developing countries can now borrow from international capital markets. Emerging-market countries are creating their own MDBs, like the China-led AIIB. The Trump Administration proposed cutting $650 million in funding for MDBs. The World Bank is seeking a capital increase for non-concessional lending. Congress oversees U.S. participation in MDBs. In January 2018, the House passed H.R. 3326, World Bank Accountability Act of 2017, which would authorize replenishment of U.S. funds to the World Bank's lending facility for low-income countries. The bill also conditions future U.S. funding on reforms to fight corruption, strengthen management accountability, and undermine violent extremism. China and 20 other countries established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2014, with a focus on financing infrastructure projects. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was established in 2014 to finance infrastructure projects in Asia, including the \"Silk Road Economic Belt.\" The AIIB has approved $4.4 billion for 24 projects as of February 2018, with a target of $4-5 billion in yearly lending. Concerns exist about potential duplication of existing institutions and lack of policy conditionality and safeguards. The United States is not a member of the AIIB. Donors prioritize policy conditionality, safeguards, and governance best practices in development assistance. The United States, not a member of the AIIB, can still influence its policies through oversight. Venezuela faces a political and economic crisis under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's authoritarian rule. Venezuela's economy has contracted by 35% since 2013, facing inflation, shortages of food and medicine, budget deficits, and deteriorating living conditions. The Trump Administration imposed sanctions in 2017, increasing fiscal pressure. Venezuela announced debt restructuring in 2017, with uncertainty about future repayments. Venezuelan dollar-denominated bonds issued under New York law could lead to significant losses for U.S. investors if Venezuela defaults on payments. Legal challenges in U.S. courts could result in the seizure of Venezuela's assets, including CITGO, oil exports, and cash payments. Members of Congress play a crucial role in shaping U.S. trade policy, with ongoing debates likely to continue in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, economic issues such as trade agreements, oversight of NAFTA renegotiation, KORUS FTA modifications, new bilateral trade negotiations, and U.S. trade relations with China will be key areas of interest. Congressional actions may include implementing legislation for revised NAFTA, examining previous trade negotiations, and considering future implications of TPP without U.S. participation. In the 115th Congress, economic issues such as trade agreements, oversight of NAFTA renegotiation, KORUS FTA modifications, new bilateral trade negotiations, and U.S. trade relations with China will be key areas of interest. Congressional actions may impact the U.S. economy, businesses, workers, standard of living, and geopolitical interests. Members of Congress and stakeholders may have differing views on U.S. trade policy. The global economy's dynamic nature, interconnected global market, and emerging markets' influence are important factors to consider. The global market's interconnected nature, the influence of emerging markets, and digital trade are key factors in the trade and finance debate in the 115th Congress."
