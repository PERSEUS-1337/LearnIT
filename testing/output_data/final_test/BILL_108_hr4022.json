    "content": "The \"Private Security Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act outlines key points. The \"Private Security Enhancement Act\" acknowledges the increased need for homeland security post-9/11 attacks and emphasizes the importance of cooperation between government and private sector for protecting the nation's key assets. Increased cooperation between Government and the private sector is crucial for protecting the nation's key assets from terrorist attacks. Private security companies have seen a significant rise in demand since 9/11, with businesses also increasing their security efforts internally. The hiring and placement decisions of private security companies have become critical as they determine who will protect the nation's key assets and its populace. It is essential for companies to have access to an efficient criminal background checking system for security personnel. Private security companies need access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) for background checks on employees to make informed hiring decisions. This access is currently available to other industries like banking and nuclear power, and should be extended to private security companies. The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, is best suited to serve as the central hub for obtaining and sharing NCIC criminal history records to enhance security efforts with private security companies and businesses. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions for \"covered employee\" and \"covered employer\" are provided. A covered employee is someone not an active law enforcement officer, employed by a security company or as an internal security employee in a company with over 50 employees. A covered employer is a nongovernmental company providing security guard services. A covered employer is a nongovernmental company that is licensed to provide security services in jurisdictions where it operates, with more than 50 employees. A covered employer must have over 50 employees, including at least 3 internal security employees, be licensed to provide internal security services in each jurisdiction it operates, and be involved in interstate commerce or provide services to the Federal Government. An internal security employee is defined as someone primarily responsible for internal security. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to internal security: NCIC refers to the National Crime Information Center, Secretary refers to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and State includes various territories of the United States. The curr_chunk authorizes the receipt of NCIC information. The Secretary is required to conduct an NCIC criminal history records check for covered employees upon request from their employer, using fingerprints submitted electronically. The results of the check are then provided to the employer. The Secretary may establish a fee for responding to a request for an NCIC criminal history records check for covered employees. SEC. 5. USE OF NCIC INFORMATION BY COVERED EMPLOYERS. Covered employers must conduct an NCIC criminal history records check on covered employees before employing them for security services. The check should not reveal any unpardoned felony convictions or specific offenses like illegal weapon possession or burglary. Covered employers can use NCIC criminal history records checks to screen employees for security services, prohibiting those with felony convictions or specific offenses like illegal drug possession or assault. The prohibition on hiring individuals with certain criminal backgrounds does not apply to current employees until six months after the enactment of the Act. The Act allows for a 6-month period after enactment for employers to conduct NCIC criminal history records checks on employees for security services. The Secretary may specify a later date if results cannot be obtained within the initial 6 months despite reasonable diligence. SEC. 6. EMPLOYEE RIGHTS. Covered employers need written consent from employees for fingerprint requests. Requests can only be made once every 12 months unless there is good cause. Employees can provide feedback on the accuracy of background check results. SEC. 7. RECORDS MANAGEMENT. SEC. 7. RECORDS MANAGEMENT. Covered employers must maintain information confidentially, not misuse or share it with unauthorized individuals, and destroy it within 180 days of receiving it. SEC. 8. USE OF INFORMATION BY DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.\n\nThe Secretary will establish procedures for the Department of Homeland Security to use check results under section 4. This includes limiting dissemination to covered employers, using results for employment suitability, and protecting employees from misuse.\n\nSEC. 9. REGULATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary will create regulations to implement this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. The Secretary will establish regulations for implementing the Act.
