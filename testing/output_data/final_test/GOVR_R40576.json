    "content": "The latest amendments to the Higher Education Act align with past efforts to improve teacher quality through support and accountability for teacher preparation programs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has long sought to enhance quality by supporting professional development, recruitment, retention, and smaller class sizes. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 established federal highly qualified teacher requirements. Researchers and policymakers are exploring compensation reform to improve teacher quality, but federal policy has not heavily focused on teacher pay. There is a growing concern about teacher pay and the need for reforms to make teaching more financially attractive. Some advocate for pay-for-performance systems based on achievement gains, while others argue for broader factors like teacher evaluations and advanced credentials. Federal education policy, apart from the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF), has not heavily focused on teacher pay. Federal education policy, aside from the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF), has not significantly addressed teacher compensation. However, various federal programs support the salaries of teachers serving educationally disadvantaged students, newly hired teachers, and special education teachers. Proposals to reform teacher compensation systems may be considered as Congress reauthorizes the ESEA, potentially expanding the TIF program. The report discusses potential Congress proposals to reform teacher compensation, including strengthening pay reform under ESEA Title II. It covers background on the teacher pay system and various reform efforts such as performance-based pay and competency-based pay. The report outlines reform efforts in teacher compensation at national, state, and local levels, tracing the origins of the current system back to the early 20th century. It discusses the shift from \"room and board\" and \"grade-based\" models to uniform pay steps known as the single salary schedule, which became widespread in public schools by the mid-20th century. The single salary schedule for teacher compensation was widely adopted in public schools by the mid-20th century. Teacher salaries are determined at the school district level based on years of experience and educational qualifications. Critics argue that this system rewards longevity and college credits over classroom effectiveness. Some research suggests that teacher quality, such as teacher ability, education, and experience, has a strong impact on student achievement. However, other studies have found little evidence that factors like teacher-student ratios or teacher education significantly affect classroom effectiveness. Some argue that the current single salary schedule may not attract the best teachers or adequately reward them. Efforts to reform teacher compensation have been driven by concerns about attracting high-quality teachers, rewarding productivity, and allocating teachers to fields where they are most needed. The debate centers around whether teachers should be rewarded for improving their own skills or for improving student outcomes. This debate has a long history in education reform. In the context of teacher compensation reforms, there are three main approaches: knowledge-based pay, merit-based pay, and service-based pay. Performance-based pay focuses on rewarding teachers for improving student performance, while competency-based pay rewards improvements in a teacher's knowledge. Service-based pay includes incentives for teaching in hard-to-staff schools and advancing in career roles. Performance-based pay policies aim to link employee pay directly to output, either through individual or group incentive plans. This approach aligns with the belief that employees should be rewarded based on effort and theories of human motivation. While most employers primarily use time-based pay, incorporating performance-based pay requires supervisory time and additional costs for employee monitoring. Group incentive plans reward organization-wide effort and promote cooperation and teamwork. They can overcome the limitations of individual incentive plans but may not always recognize individual effort. Employers often use both group and individual incentives to enhance performance and teamwork. Gain-sharing plans tie part of pay to group effort and may include components of individual performance. Gain-sharing plans tie part of pay to group effort and individual performance, enhancing motivation and organizational culture. Merit pay systems for teachers emerged after A Nation at Risk in 1983, providing bonuses based on student outcomes. Merit pay systems for teachers can be awarded to individual teachers, groups, or schools based on various factors like student performance, classroom observations, and teacher portfolios. School-based performance awards are the most common form of merit pay, with bonuses given to schools based on a range of measures including student achievement, attendance, dropout rates, participation in advanced courses, and community involvement. The awards are granted to schools for use at the school level. Implementing school-based performance awards for teachers can be challenging due to the difficulty in measuring teacher performance accurately. The criteria for evaluating teachers often demand quantitative measurements, while the factors that truly impact classroom performance are qualitative and hard to measure. This discrepancy makes it challenging to determine true teacher quality and establish effective implementation standards. Merit pay reforms have historically faced obstacles in the evaluation process, which often involves subjective assessments by principals. Measuring teacher performance for school-based performance awards can be challenging, with subjective assessments by principals and teachers being a common obstacle. Teachers often find the evaluation process ill-defined and biased. Recent changes include using student test scores as a more quantitative measure of teacher effectiveness, although debate exists over its reliability. The purpose is to attribute changes in student test scores to individual teacher effectiveness, amidst various influencing factors. Issues arise regarding the validity and reliability of testing instruments and whether they measure desired student outcomes. Value-added modeling (VAM) is a research avenue addressing the debate over using student assessments for teacher evaluation. Goldhaber notes that debates on measuring teacher contributions to student learning are far from settled. Value-added modeling (VAM) aims to estimate the impact of teachers on student achievement, but data systems are limited. Research shows VAM is not yet reliable for high-stakes decisions. Other pay reform programs reward teachers for improving inputs linked to better student performance. Reform programs in public schools, known as \"competency pay,\" reward teachers for improving inputs that enhance student performance. These programs include financial incentives for obtaining additional licensure or certification, teacher performance evaluations, and extra pay for advanced certification in multiple subject areas. In public schools, competency pay rewards teachers for improving student performance through incentives like additional certification. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) offers additional compensation for certified teachers. Standards-based teacher evaluation systems assess teacher performance against defined standards, such as the \"Framework for Teaching.\" The \"Framework for Teaching\" by Charlotte Danielson defines four performance domains for teacher evaluation: planning, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. It includes specific performance components with 66 elements and four performance levels. Teacher compensation reforms include increased pay for hard-to-staff positions and advanced responsibilities. Recruitment and retention policies in teaching aim to address turnover and distributional issues rather than a labor shortage. Teaching jobs can be hard-to-staff due to undesirable working conditions, higher pay in non-teaching professions, or special skills required for certain student populations. Identifying hard-to-staff schools can be done through human resource data like unfilled vacancies and teacher turnover rates. Incentive pay is offered to teachers in hard-to-staff schools, but research shows that money alone is not enough to attract and retain them. Pay for high-need subject areas aims to meet market demand for specific skills, such as math degrees. This type of knowledge-based pay system may shift yearly based on school needs. Professional development for teachers, including those working with high-need student populations, has evolved from one-time workshops to more ongoing and intense activities. One new method is veteran teachers mentoring new teachers, with additional pay and release time offered. Career Ladder programs offer incentives for teachers to take on advanced roles, but widespread implementation of teacher compensation reforms has not occurred. Surveys show that only a small percentage of teachers receive performance-based or incentive pay. Data suggests that compensation reforms may be spreading, with 14% of teachers reporting changes in a recent survey. In the 2005-2006 school year, $529 billion was spent on public elementary and secondary education, with $39 billion (7.4%) coming from the federal government. A significant portion of the total expenditure ($274 billion) was allocated to instruction, mainly for staff salaries and benefits. Federal K-12 education funds are primarily used for instructional staff, with Title I, II, and III funds being major sources. The federal government allocates a significant portion of education funds to instructional staff, with Title I, II, and III funds being major sources. Title I resources in an average-size school of 500 students add 3.5 full-time equivalent staff, including teachers and aides. The federal role in teacher compensation was limited until the creation of the Teacher Incentive Fund, which allowed for performance-based compensation systems. The 2008 amendments to the HEA eliminated Title II grants to states but retained support for performance-based compensation systems. The ESEA Title II-A program allows funds for merit pay programs to promote teacher retention, with only 4% of funds used for financial incentives or merit pay programs. The Teacher Incentive Fund represents a change in federal policy on teacher compensation, moving towards incentive pay. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) supports pay reform efforts by allowing federal funds for incentive pay. Unlike past reforms, current efforts rely on outside financing. The TIF program, funded through the FY2006 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act, represents a significant federal effort in teacher compensation reform. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) provided $261 million for activities authorized under Title V, Part D of the ESEA. $99 million was reserved for discretionary grants to improve education quality through performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools. Grants are competitively awarded to local education agencies, states, or non-profit organizations. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) provides funding for performance-based compensation systems in high-need schools. The Secretary allocates 5% for the Center for Educator Compensation Reform to raise awareness and provide technical assistance to TIF grantees. Program funds support the development of compensation systems for teachers and principals, including incentives, professional development, evaluation tools, and staff salaries. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $97.3 million to fund 34 projects for teacher compensation in high-need schools. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 allocated the same amount for continuation awards. An additional $200 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funded 60 new TIF grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 provided $400 million for 94 continuation awards and 65 new TIF grants. Non-federal efforts to reform teacher compensation were also identified. Non-federal national-level efforts to reform teacher compensation exist, with the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) being the most prominent. TAP, launched in 1999, focuses on finding and rewarding excellent teachers through multiple career paths, professional growth, accountability, and performance-related incentives. TAP receives support from various foundations and a federal TIF grant. TAP offers multiple career paths for teachers to advance professionally and earn higher salaries without leaving the classroom. Teachers can become career, master, or mentor teachers with salary increases of up to $15,000. The program also provides time for teachers to collaborate on instructional issues and uses a grading rubric for evaluation. TAP uses a grading rubric to assess teacher performance and determine career advancement. Performance-related compensation rewards teachers based on student performance, roles, and teaching performance. TAP operates in over 125 schools across 9 states with approximately 3,500 teachers and 56,000 students. Other national programs like the Institute for Compensation Reform and Student Learning and the Partnership for Innovation in Compensation for Charter Schools assist in implementing performance pay initiatives in various locations. The Effective Practice Incentive Community, established by New Leaders for New Schools, implements performance pay in charter schools affiliated with the National Charter School Consortium. In 2005, Minnesota approved the Quality Compensation (Q-Comp) program, which includes career ladder and professional development for teachers, with compensation based on student achievement. Funding increased from $13 million in FY2006 to $64 million in FY2008. 17 states have teacher compensation reform efforts, with initiatives in Minnesota, Arizona, and Texas highlighted. An Appendix lists components of state programs. The Q-Comp program in Minnesota requires 60% of compensation increases to be based on professional standards and student achievement gains. School districts must submit proposals to the state department of education to participate, receiving up to $260 per student for implementation. Participation has grown from 22 districts in 2005-06 to 43 in 2008-09, with 15 TAP schools in Minneapolis also receiving funds. In Arizona, 28 districts have participated in the Career Ladder Program since 1993, enrolling 31% of students and employing 40% of teachers. Seven in ten eligible teachers participate in the program. Arizona Revised Statute 15-918 requires participating districts to ensure pupil academic progress, teaching skills, teacher responsibility, professional growth, and equal pay for performance. Proposition 301 established the Classroom Site Fund for pay-for-performance plans, funded by a sales tax. In FY2007, over $400 million was collected for this fund. Districts must allocate 20% of the funds. In 2006, the Texas Legislature enacted the Educator Excellence Award programs, allocating $340 million for performance pay. The Governor's Educator Excellence Grants distribute funds to top-performing schools with economically disadvantaged students based on state assessment criteria. The Texas Educator Excellence Grants (TEEG) allocate funds to top-performing schools based on state assessment criteria. Approximately 100 schools qualified in 2008, receiving varying award amounts. Schools must use 75% of funds for teacher incentives based on student achievement and collaboration. The remaining 25% can be used for other school employees, professional development, mentoring programs, after-school programs, signing bonuses, and teacher recruitment/retention programs. The Texas Educator Excellence Grants (TEEG) have similar criteria to the GEEG program but require schools to be in the top half of Texas schools in terms of economically disadvantaged students. TEEG grantees must reapply annually, while GEEG grants last for three years. In 2006-07, 1,163 campuses were eligible for grants ranging from $40,000 to $295,000. Districts can also apply for funding, with 60% required to reward classroom teachers based on student achievement. The curr_chunk discusses state-level teacher compensation reform programs, including stipends for mentors, awards for principals based on student achievement, and implementation of the TAP. Information was collected from various sources such as the National Center on Performance Incentives and the U.S. Department of Education. At present, CRS has identified 20 teacher compensation reform programs in 17 states, all using student performance as a criteria for rewarding teachers with incentive pay. Some programs also base incentive pay on teacher evaluation and provide additional pay for career advancement. Some state programs offer additional pay for teachers based on student performance, teacher evaluation, and career advancement. Programs vary in eligibility, incentive amount, and funding delivery method. Over 80 teacher compensation reform programs have been identified by CRS. In 25 states and the District of Columbia, CRS has identified over 80 teacher compensation reform efforts at the local level. Three prominent initiatives in Denver, CO; Guilford County, NC; and Hamilton County, TN are discussed. Denver implemented the Professional Compensation Systems for Teachers (ProComp) in 2004, linking pay to student achievement and evaluations. An Appendix provides a table with main components of all identified local programs. Compensation Systems for Teachers (ProComp) was adopted in 2004 in Denver, funded by a 2005 ballot initiative and a Federal TIF grant in 2007. The program aims to expand to 90% of the district's schools, supported by the ProComp Teacher Compensation Trust with a $44 million balance. ProComp offers teachers the opportunity to increase their salary by up to 18% through components like knowledge and skills, professional evaluation, market incentives, and student growth. Teachers can earn salary increases for completing an advanced degree or certification, professional development, and a satisfactory evaluation. In 2006, Guilford County Schools implemented the Mission Possible program, a teacher incentive plan with various components to retain and attract effective teachers. Initially, 20 high-need schools were selected, with an additional eight schools added in 2007. A $2 million grant supported a math incentive pilot program called Cumulative Effect, bringing the total participating schools to 30 in the 2007-2008 school year. Mission Possible teachers and administrators receive recruitment and performance incentives based on state and national accountability requirements. Teacher bonuses range from $2,500 to $4,000 and are paid in late November after student data is released. Funding for the program comes from the Benwood Foundation and the Public Education Foundation. The Benwood Initiative, funded by the Benwood Foundation and the Public Education Foundation, provides performance incentives in low-performing schools. Teachers can receive up to $2,000 in bonuses based on student achievement, with principals eligible for up to $10,000. Additional incentives include a $5,000 bonus for teachers showing growth in student achievement and a forgivable loan for staff to purchase homes near their schools. The curr_chunk discusses 82 local-level teacher compensation reform programs identified in 2008, all using student performance as a criteria for additional compensation. These programs also include teacher evaluation components and service-based incentives, with student performance being a common factor in all performance pay initiatives. Some programs use value-added modeling techniques to link student achievement to teacher compensation. Incentive awards are provided in 82 local-level teacher compensation reform programs identified in 2008, with most programs using value-added modeling techniques. Three-quarters of the programs offer school-wide awards, complemented by individual teacher awards based on traditional evaluation systems. Career ladder incentives are common, and some programs offer pay incentives for teaching in high-need schools or hard-to-staff subjects. The initiatives are influenced by TIF funding or TAP assistance, with TIF funds supporting 30 programs. The Mare Island Technology Academy's \"New 3Rs\" program in Vallejo, California received $29.2 million for 11 schools in Tucson, Arizona's Amphitheater Unified School District #10. The Mission Possible program received an $8 million award, doubling the district's funds. TIF grantees must meet 75% of their costs through non-federal funds by the final year of the grant. Forty-seven of the 82 local programs are affiliated with the TAP program, with incentive awards coming from non-TAP sources. The funds for incentive awards in TAP programs come from non-TAP sources, with some districts using federal Title II funds for performance pay. Only 4% of Title II funds nationally are spent on recruiting and retaining teachers. It is possible that districts in TAP programs use Title II funds differently. The research suggests that funds for performance incentives in education may come from private sources like grants and donations. There is a debate on federal involvement in reforming teacher compensation, with proposals to expand the TIF approach. Recent legislative action has focused on funding promising reform efforts at the local level. The 111th Congress tripled TIF appropriations for FY2009, with minimal guidance on fund usage. Recent congressional actions included bills to reauthorize the HEA and establish Innovation Districts for teacher performance incentives. During the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to increase funding for the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) and relocate its authority from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to the Higher Education Act (HEA). The HEA reauthorization bill, H.R. 3746, included TIF provisions but stalled in committee. During the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to increase funding for the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) and relocate its authority from ESEA to HEA. H.R. 3746 included TIF provisions but stalled in committee. The HEA was eventually reauthorized by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), without the TIF provisions. Three other TIF-related bills were introduced, but action stopped with committee referral. TIF was reauthorized through the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The FY2006 authorizing language was used for TIF funding in various acts. Few bills related to teacher performance pay have been introduced in Congress, including the Innovation Districts for School Improvement Act. The bills introduced in Congress regarding teacher performance pay incentives were more specific than existing TIF language. The TEACH Act proposed awarding \"premium pay\" to teachers in high-need schools teaching shortage subjects. However, these bills did not progress beyond committee referral. Both the House and Senate held hearings on K-12 teaching quality, focusing on teacher incentives and performance pay during the ESEA reauthorization process. Education experts favored providing incentives to promote teacher quality, supporting pay incentive components like TIF and TAP. During the ESEA reauthorization process, discussions were held on teacher incentives and performance pay. Education experts supported pay incentive components like TIF and TAP, emphasizing the need for a variety of evaluation methods beyond student performance measures. A witness argued against using value-added modeling to measure individual teacher performance. A proposed legislation draft included a discretionary grant program for awarding \"premium pay\" to exemplary teachers in high-need schools. The Committee discussed developing a system to identify exemplary teachers based on learning gains, classroom observations, feedback, and evaluations using research-validated rubrics. The NEA and AFT representatives opposed premium pay provisions for teachers. The NEA opposes federal requirements for teacher pay based on student performance or test scores, while the AFT is concerned about the top-down approach. Panel members see potential in the proposal to address teacher distribution inequities through premium pay and career ladders. Ms. Van Hook supports performance pay as part of a comprehensive approach. The 112th Congress is considering compensation reform and teacher incentive pay proposals, including the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) program. The program is broadly defined and implemented at the local level in various ways. The federal role may continue to support local pay reform experimentation and provide seed money for financial commitments. Future deliberations may focus on whether TIF should remain an experimental approach or if the federal role should be expanded beyond TIF. Congress may need to consider expanding the federal role in teacher compensation reform beyond the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF). Competency-based and service-based incentives have support, but performance-based incentives may be controversial and difficult to enact on a large scale. The debate over pay reforms may involve whether federal involvement should focus on state or local levels. Scaling up federal support for Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) may be easier at the local level, while a more specified federal role may be better suited for the state level. The debate may also involve proposals to amend the ESEA Title II-A state formula grant program. Congress could consider prioritizing compensation reform through ESEA Title II-A by strengthening current language. Performance measurement, particularly tied to student achievement, is a key issue in the debate over pay reforms. Traditional teacher evaluation methods are being challenged by the push to connect student achievement to teacher performance. Significant improvements have been made in connecting student achievement to teacher performance, especially in subjects like math. However, challenges exist in using value-added methods for evaluating individual teachers due to the need for large amounts of data. This is why school-wide incentives are more common for rewarding performance, as measuring a school's performance is easier than measuring an individual teacher's. School-wide awards are more common for rewarding performance as measuring a school's performance is easier than measuring an individual teacher's. There are challenges in using value-added methods for evaluating teachers due to the need for large amounts of data. Congress may need to consider targeting school and individual performance goals collectively in pay incentive programs. Congress should be aware of the political barriers to linking teacher and student records, as some states have prohibited this practice. Performance incentives should be based on data elements that are consistently available. CRS has compiled inventories of state and local programs, although not comprehensive, using methods like reviewing literature and internet searches. CRS compiled inventories of state and local incentive pay reforms through a thorough search of academic literature, project websites, and discussions with experts. The inventories provide a snapshot of programs in operation, but may not be exhaustive. Tables A-1 and A-2 contain the state-level and local-level reforms, respectively."
