    "content": "The \"Continuity in Representation Act of 2004\" requires special elections to be held to fill vacancies in the House in extraordinary circumstances. Section 26 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (2 U.S.C. 8) is amended to include special rules for holding special elections in extraordinary circumstances to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives within 45 days of the vacancy announcement by the Speaker of the House. The Speaker of the House can announce a vacancy, leading to a special election within 75 days. Political parties can nominate candidates within 10 days of the announcement. Extraordinary circumstances occur when vacancies in the House exceed 100, with provisions for judicial review. In cases where vacancies in the House exceed 100, judicial review provisions apply. Actions challenging the announcement must be filed within 2 days in the United States District Court of the vacant seat's district and heard by a 3-judge court. The complaint must be promptly delivered to the Clerk of the House. The final decision in actions challenging House vacancies must be made within 3 days and is not reviewable. The executive authority of the State with the vacant seat has the right to intervene. Military and overseas voters must be able to participate in special elections. The State must ensure absentee ballots are sent to military and overseas voters within 15 days of a House vacancy announcement. The State must send absentee ballots to military and overseas voters within 15 days of a House vacancy announcement.
