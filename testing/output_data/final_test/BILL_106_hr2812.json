    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Development Venture Capital Assistance Act of 1999\". Congress recognizes the need for private equity capital in underserved areas to create jobs for low-income residents. Specialized skills are required to invest in smaller businesses in these areas, but there is a shortage of professionals with these skills. Assistance is needed to provide training and technical support for individuals and organizations in this segment. Assistance from the Federal Government could attract private sector investment and develop a specialized venture capital industry focused on creating jobs and generating wealth in low-income communities. The Small Business Act is amended to include a new section on Community Development Venture Capital Activities. The Small Business Act is amended to include definitions for community development venture capital organizations and developmental organizations, which focus on promoting community development in low-income areas through investments in private businesses. The Small Business Act now includes definitions for community development venture capital organizations and intermediary organizations, which promote community development through investments in private businesses in low-income areas. An intermediary organization is a private, nonprofit entity with a primary mission of investing in businesses in low-income communities and experience in providing technical or financial assistance to venture capital organizations. The Small Business Act defines community development venture capital organizations and intermediary organizations to promote investments in businesses in low-income areas. The Administrator has the authority to enter contracts and make grants for training and research activities to support the development of these organizations. A developmental organization receiving a grant must use the funds for training and research activities such as enhancing professional skills and increasing interest in community development venture capital. The curr_chunk discusses promoting best practices and mobilizing academic resources for community development venture capital organizations. This includes providing internships with stipends, organizing national conferences, and encouraging the formation of centers for the study of community development venture capital. The curr_chunk focuses on funding for community development venture capital activities, with a limitation on the amount used for specific purposes. Intermediary organizations receiving grants are required to use funds for training and assistance in marketing, management, and technical issues to promote community development. The Administrator provides grants to community development venture capital organizations for start-up costs and operating support. A matching requirement is imposed on intermediary organizations receiving grants. Regulations may be issued as needed, and $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2003."
