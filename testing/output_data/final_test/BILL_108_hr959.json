    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceanography Amendments Act of 2003.\" It amends Section 201 of Public Law 102-567 to establish a Coastal Ocean Program. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will establish a Coastal Ocean Program to improve predictions of trends in Great Lakes, estuarine, and coastal ocean resources. Additionally, Section 202 of Public Law 102-567 will be amended to address laboratories. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will establish laboratories to support its primary missions, including the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, and Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. Additionally, there will be a National Undersea Research Program. The National Undersea Research Program, established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, aims to increase scientific knowledge through undersea research related to coastal and ocean resource management. The program is led by a Director appointed by the Secretary and operates through a national headquarters and regional research centers, focusing on research, education, and technology activities. The National Undersea Research Program manages activities through an open and competitive process to evaluate scientific merit, relevance to coastal and ocean resource management missions, and technical feasibility. SEC. 5. OCEANOGRAPHY PROGRAMS. Title II of Public Law 102-567 is amended to include a new section on the Ocean Exploration Program. The ocean exploration program aims to explore various aspects of the ocean, integrate scientific disciplines, create missions for discovery, develop new technologies, and enhance scientific literacy. The ocean exploration program aims to achieve scientific literacy and public appreciation of the oceans, facilitate data availability, conduct exploration voyages, survey marine environments, and enhance marine science capabilities. The ocean exploration program aims to promote improved oceanographic research, communication, navigation, and data management. It also conducts public education activities to enhance understanding of ocean science and accepts donations for exploring the oceans. The Coastal Observation Technology System is outlined in Section 207. The term 'coastal observation technology system' refers to a system that collects marine observations, transmits data in real or near real time, produces forecasts, and manages data for future use. Before designating a regional unit as part of the national system, the Secretary must establish criteria in consultation with the National Ocean. The Secretary shall establish standards and protocols for data collection by regional coastal observation technology systems, ensure data quality control, and designate units to collect necessary data for the Administration's missions. The Secretary will use data collected to develop forecast models for various activities, and may provide assistance for coastal observation technology activities through contracts, agreements, or grants with a maximum federal share of 50 percent of costs. \"Authorization of appropriations for coastal observation technology activities.\" Authorization of appropriations for ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes research activities, including funding for ARGO floats, laboratories, joint institutes, VENTS, Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, and coastal ocean program. Authorization of appropriations for various ocean research programs from 2004 to 2008, including funding for coastal ocean, national undersea research, ocean exploration, tsunami hazard mitigation, and Arctic research partnership programs. Authorization of appropriations for various ocean research programs from 2004 to 2008, including funding for coastal environmental health, biomolecular research, and coastal observing technologies ranging from $15,000,000 to $25,000,000 per fiscal year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceanography Act of 2003 is cited as the short title. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council is required to provide a plan for implementing the President's Panel on Ocean Exploration report, including a recommendation for a dedicated multiyear, multidisciplinary voyage of discovery within 180 days of the enactment of the section."
