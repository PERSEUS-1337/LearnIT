    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Triad Program Act\" and includes findings. The Congress acknowledges that senior citizens are a rapidly growing segment of society, currently comprising 15% and predicted to reach 18% by the turn of the century. They face unique challenges such as social isolation, limited access to transportation, and physical vulnerabilities that increase their risk of criminal victimization. Senior citizens are often victims of abuse, neglect, violent crime, property crime, fraud, and medical quackery. Studies show they are more likely to be injured in violent crimes than younger victims. Data on crimes against seniors is incomplete and outdated, with abuse and neglect being underreported and undetected. Many law enforcement agencies lack effective practices for addressing senior citizen abuse, leading to inconsistent responses. Collaboration between law enforcement and social service providers is hindered by differing perspectives. Efforts are being made to establish partnerships for a coordinated criminal justice approach. The Triad program, supported by various organizations, aims to coordinate criminal justice and social service efforts to address senior citizen victimization. The Federal Government should expand initiatives to reduce crime against this vulnerable population. The Act aims to support efforts to prevent violence against senior citizens through coordinated law enforcement and social service strategies. It also seeks to promote collaborative crime prevention programs like the Triad model to address crime against seniors effectively. The Director of the National Institute of Justice will conduct a national assessment on crimes against senior citizens, including violent and nonviolent crimes, unreported crime, collaborative needs of law enforcement and social service organizations, and strategies for effective response. The national assessment will address the analysis of data on crimes against senior citizens, institutional and community responses to elderly victims, and special services required by elderly victims. The national assessment will focus on analyzing data on crimes against senior citizens, institutional and community responses to elderly victims, special services needed by elderly victims, differences in experiences with service organizations compared to younger populations, effective programs for reducing victimization of senior citizens, successful coordination among public sector agencies and community organizations, and the research agenda needed to understand crimes against senior citizens as society ages. The Director of the National Institute of Justice will use existing studies to avoid duplication in assessing crimes against senior citizens. They will disseminate successful strategies through various means like reports, publications, and training programs. SEC. 5. PILOT PROGRAMS. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will provide grants to coalitions of local law enforcement agencies and senior citizens to develop and test crime prevention programs based on the Triad model. The Triad cooperative model involves the participation of sheriffs, police chiefs, senior citizens' organizations, and other relevant advocacy groups. The Bureau of Justice Assistance provides grants to coalitions of law enforcement, victim service, and senior citizen advocate organizations to establish pilot programs. If a county lacks a sheriff or police chief, another key law enforcement official like a local prosecutor can participate. The application process includes describing the community, ensuring funds are used for senior citizen education and services, and detailing the level of involvement from each party. The Triad program requires a comprehensive plan detailing crime problems facing senior citizens, types of projects, evaluation methods, and available resources for implementation. The Triad program requires a comprehensive plan detailing crime problems facing senior citizens, types of projects, evaluation methods, available resources, development or expansion, gaps that cannot be filled with existing resources, how the grant will be used to fill those gaps, means and methods to reduce criminal victimization of older persons, and funding requirements for implementing the plan. Awards will be distributed to Triad programs based on county population sizes. The Triad program requires a post-grant period report detailing organizations involved, problem areas, data on criminal activity before and after the grant period affecting senior citizens, and plans for program continuation. SEC. 6. TRAINING ASSISTANCE, EVALUATION, AND DISSEMINATION AWARDS. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the National Institute of Justice will make awards to organizations for training, technical assistance, and research to establish and evaluate crime prevention programs based on the Triad model. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will award public service advertising coalitions to increase awareness of crimes against senior citizens and promote prevention programs. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Director of the National Institute of Justice will submit an annual report to Congress on the results of pilot programs conducted under section 5. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorized appropriations include $2,000,000 for Triad pilot program awards, $1,000,000 for national training and technical assistance, $1,000,000 for public service announcements, $2,000,000 for national assessment and research, and additional funds for administrative costs."
