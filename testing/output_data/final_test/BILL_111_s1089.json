    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting American Agricultural and Medical Exports to Cuba Act of 2009\" clarifies payment terms under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to define 'payment of cash in advance' as the payment by the purchaser of an agricultural commodity or product before the transfer of title or release of control to the purchaser. SEC. 3 of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 authorizes direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. depository institutions for agricultural commodities. A depository institution is defined as any entity primarily engaged in banking. Establishment of Agricultural Export Promotion Program for Cuba. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a program to provide information and technical assistance to promote exports of US agricultural commodities to Cuba. This includes maintaining information on the Department of Agriculture's website to assist exporters. Funding will come from the Agricultural Export Promotion Trust Fund. The Export Promotion Trust Fund was established under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 5. INCREASE IN AIRPORT TICKET TAX FOR TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND CUBA; ESTABLISHMENT OF AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROMOTION TRUST FUND. This section amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the ticket tax for transportation to and from Cuba before January 1, 2016 by $1.00. Additionally, it establishes the Agricultural Export Promotion Trust Fund under subchapter A of chapter 98 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Agricultural Export Promotion Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by increased taxes from transportation to and from Cuba. The fund is available for expenditures to promote American agricultural and medical exports to Cuba. Section 9502(b)(1) of the Code is amended to include an exception related to subsection (c)(4), specifically after \"sections 4261\". Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subchapter A of chapter 98 of the Code. SEC. 9511. Agricultural Export Promotion Trust Fund. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to transportation after a 90-day period from the enactment of this Act, excluding amounts paid before the end of the period. Sense of Congress is for the Secretary of State to issue visas to Cuban nationals for temporary entry into the US for agricultural activities. The Secretary must submit reports to specific committees every 90 days. The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives must submit reports on visas issued to Cuban nationals for purchasing activities in the US under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Each report should detail the applications received and their dispositions. SEC. 7. EXPORT OF MEDICINES AND MEDICAL DEVICES TO CUBA. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is amended to repeal the requirement for onsite verifications. This amendment does not limit the President's authority to impose export controls on medicines or medical devices to Cuba under certain acts or to exercise emergency powers in response to threats from Cuba. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is amended to address an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. SEC. 8. TRAVEL TO CUBA. Freedom of travel to and from Cuba for US citizens and legal residents is protected, and any existing regulations prohibiting such travel will no longer be valid. The restrictions on presidential authority do not apply in cases of war with Cuba, ongoing hostilities, or imminent danger to public health or safety of US citizens. This section applies to actions taken by the President before or after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 9. ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS FOR THE MUTUAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Repeal of prohibition on transactions or payments related to certain US intellectual property under the Department of Commerce Appropriations Act, 1999. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue necessary regulations to implement the repeal and remove any transaction prohibitions. Further regulations will amend the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations will be amended to allow the transfer or receipt of trademarks or trade names under general license, involving designated nationals as defined in the Department of Commerce Appropriations Act, 1999."
