    "content": "The Act titled \"Job Creation and Affordable Housing Act of 2010\" provides grants to states for low-income housing projects in place of low-income housing credits for bond-subsidized housing projects. The Secretary of the Treasury will grant each State an amount equal to its low-income bond-subsidized housing election amount, which is determined by the State and cannot exceed 85% of the State's bond-subsidized credit amount. The bond-subsidized credit amount is the total low-income housing credits that would be awarded to the State without certain restrictions. Qualified residential rental project bonds are defined as bonds issued for low-income buildings where at least 95% of the proceeds are used for qualified residential rental projects. These bonds are taken into account for the state ceiling under the Internal Revenue Code. The State receiving a grant must use it to make subawards for the construction or rehabilitation of low-income buildings that have received qualified residential rental project bonds. Subawards must adhere to the same requirements as low-income housing credit allocations. The State receiving a grant must use it to make subawards for low-income building construction or rehabilitation, following the same requirements as low-income housing credit allocations. The State must perform asset management functions to ensure compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and building viability, and may collect fees from subaward recipients for administrative costs. A State receiving a grant under this section must impose conditions on subawards to ensure that the building remains a qualified low-income building during the compliance period. Recapture amounts will be proportional to noncompliance time and qualified basis percentage, payable to the Treasury and enforceable through liens. A State housing credit agency can enforce liens or other methods determined by the Treasury. The agency may also reallocate bond authority if applicants fail to find purchasers, increasing funds for affordable housing. The State can reallocate bond authority for qualified residential rental projects without affecting subawards. Reallocated bonds won't impact eligibility for low-income housing credits or grants. Unused grant funds must be returned to the Treasury by January 1, 2012. Unspent subaward funds must also be returned unless 30% of the total adjusted basis in property is paid or incurred by that date. The subaward funds not disbursed by January 1, 2013, must be returned to the Treasury. Any funds returned to the State housing credit agency after January 1, 2012, should be promptly sent back to the Treasury. Amounts returned under this provision will be deposited into the Treasury's general fund. Definitions in this section align with those in the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary of the Treasury or their delegate is referenced. Appropriations are allocated to the Secretary. Appropriations are allocated to the Secretary of the Treasury as necessary to carry out this section. SEC. 3. COORDINATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT WITH LOW-INCOME HOUSING GRANTS. In amending section 42(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, no credit shall be determined for qualified low-income buildings if they receive bond-subsidized credit amount under the Job Creation and Affordable Housing Act of 2010. Grants and loans will not reduce the basis of such buildings. The amendment excludes grants and loans from reducing the basis of qualified low-income buildings under section 42(i) of the Internal Revenue Code. Grants under specific acts are not included in gross income or alternative minimum taxable income. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 2009, with the exclusion of grants from gross income effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 2008. SEC. 4. FIVE-YEAR CARRYBACK OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT. The amendment allows for a 5-year carryback of low-income housing credit, separate from other business credits, starting for taxable years after December 31, 2007. The amendment allows for a 5-year carryback of low-income housing credit for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007. SEC. 5. CARRYBACK OF NEW INVESTMENTS. Section 42(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a special rule for certain investments made in 2010 and 2011. Taxpayers entering into specific agreements during this period can determine the taxable year for low-income housing credits. The special rule under Section 42(f) of the Internal Revenue Code allows taxpayers entering into agreements in 2010 and 2011 to determine the taxable year for low-income housing credits. This rule exempts certain provisions and specifies the credit period for the allocated housing credit dollar amount. The provisions of this section apply to buildings under agreements described in subparagraph (A) as if such subparagraph had not been enacted. Excess credit taken into account will be recaptured at the end of the credit period if it exceeds the total allowable credit for the building. The excess credit will be recaptured as if it were part of the credit recapture amount. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009. SEC. 6. Allowing low-income housing credits to offset 100% of federal income tax liability. SEC. 6. Allowing low-income housing credits to offset 100% of federal income tax liability by amending subsection (c) of section 38 to apply separately with respect to such credits and treating the tentative minimum tax as zero. The excess credit for the taxable year is increased by business credit carryforwards not allowed due to limitations, for purposes of determining the amount that may be carried back to a preceding taxable year. The limitation under paragraph (1) is modified by clause (ii) to increase the limitation for taxable years with excess applicable low-income housing credits carried back. The excess credit for the preceding taxable year is determined under rules similar to those described in subparagraph (A), with an ordering rule provided in clause (ii). The excess business credit carryforwards are treated on a first-in first-out basis. Applicable low-income housing credits are defined as credits from buildings placed in service after a certain date and for specific taxable years. For taxable years 2008-2010, business credit carryforwards related to buildings placed in service are subject to specific conditions outlined in subparagraph (D). This includes a requirement for the taxpayer to commit to investing equity by a certain date for future projects to qualify for the credits. The taxpayer and successors must commit to a specified dollar amount of investment to qualify for credits, with deadlines based on the taxable year. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007, and credit carrybacks from those years."
