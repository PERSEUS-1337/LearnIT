The Force trained in hazardous conditions in Montana and Virginia to target German war efforts. The combat echelon consisted of 1,800 soldiers from both countries. The First Special Service Force, formed during World War II, consisted of troops from the United States and Canada. A service battalion of 800 members from the US provided support for combat troops. The Force, led by a US colonel, fought in Italy in battles south of Cassino, including Monte La Difensa and Monte Majo. After capturing Monte La Difensa, the Force faced tough battles in high altitudes and rugged terrain, reducing their size from 1,800 to fewer than 500 soldiers. They engaged in raids at the Anzio Beachhead for 4 months before liberating Rome on June 4, 1944. Following this, they moved to southern Italy to prepare for the liberation of France. During August 15, 1944, the Force landed on Les Iles D'Hyeres in France, facing heavy German resistance. They advanced to the Franco-Italian border and were disbanded on December 5, 1944, in Nice. The Force suffered 2,314 casualties in 251 days of combat, capturing prisoners and earning campaign stars and battle honors. The Canadian Force earned 8 battle honors and never failed a mission. The United States is grateful for their bravery and selflessness in fighting for freedom. Their efforts in Europe were crucial in stopping Nazi Germany and liberating communities in France and Italy. The bond between US and Canadian Force members remains strong, meeting annually for reunions. The traditions of the Force are carried on by the Special Forces of the United States and the Canadian Special Operations Regiment. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to the Canadian Force for their bravery and selflessness in fighting for freedom during World War II. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for a gold medal to be awarded to the First Special Service Force for their service in World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, which will then be given to the First Special Service Force Association in Helena, Montana for display or loan. The loan of the gold medal awarded to the First Special Service Force will be displayed at various locations associated with the force, including Fort William Henry Harrison in Helena, Montana. The Secretary is authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering production costs. Proceeds from the sale will go to the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Medals created under this Act are considered national medals according to the United States Code."
