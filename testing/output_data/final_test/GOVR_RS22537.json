    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) has not released a composite estimate of Iraqi civilian deaths during Operation Iraqi Freedom. However, in the report Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq, it has released a chart with two separate estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths from January 2006 to August 2008. The first estimate is from a compilation of coalition and Iraqi reports, while the second is from the Iraq Significant Activities (SIGACTS) III database, which includes coalition reports only. The DOD noted that host nation reports capture some types of deaths not visible to the Coalition. The specific data used to create the chart have not been released. The United Nations attempted to release comprehensive statistics on Iraqi civilian deaths, but the Iraqi government stopped providing casualty figures to the UN. This decision was made because Iraqi officials believed that releasing high casualty numbers would fuel unrest. The UNAMI report expressed regret for the lack of data on casualties from the Iraqi government. The report recommended the government to release mortality data regularly. In November 2008, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad reported to the UN Security Council that the security situation in Iraq had significantly improved since June 2007. Overall attacks decreased by 86% and Iraqi civilian deaths due to violence decreased by 84%. Iraq Body Count also noted a decrease in civilian deaths in 2008, with approximately 25 deaths per day compared to 67 per day in 2007 and 76 per day in 2006. The decrease in deaths was not consistent on a monthly basis. The reported decrease in civilian deaths in Iraq has not been consistent monthly. In November 2008, there were 148 deaths compared to 118 in October and 156 in September. Various studies have been conducted on violence-related mortality in Iraq, including the \"Lancet studies\" by researchers from Johns Hopkins University and Al-Mustansiriya University. A study conducted by a consortium of researchers, including those associated with the World Health Organization, known as \"the WHO study,\" estimated between 8,000 to 194,000 civilian casualties in Iraq due to violent deaths since the start of the war. The first study, published in 2004, has faced criticism for not considering the long-term health effects of the Saddam Hussein era. Former British Foreign Minister Jack Straw rejected the findings of the study, citing inaccurate data. The second study, published in 2006, reported an estimate of between 426,369 and 793,663 Iraqi civilian deaths from violent causes since the beginning of Operation Iraqi. The Lancet article on Iraqi civilian deaths from violent causes since Operation Iraqi Freedom has sparked controversy. Stephen Moore criticized the research methods, while UK Ministry of Defence documents praised the survey's methods as \"close to best practice\" and \"robust.\" Another recent study involved investigators from various Iraqi ministries and organizations. The Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS) Study Group, consisting of the Kurdistan Ministry of Health, the Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology in Baghdad, and the World Health Organization, conducted a study on violence-related mortality in Iraq. They estimated 151,000 violence-related deaths from March 2003 to June 2006, with violence being the main cause of death for men aged 15-59 in the first three years after the 2003 invasion. The study is widely cited for violence-related mortality rates in Iraq, but does not differentiate between different victims of violence. Associated Press has maintained a database of Iraqi civilian and security forces casualties since April 2005. Between April 2005 and January 5, 2009, 44,971 Iraqi civilians have died and 51,540 have been wounded. The Iraq Body Count estimated that between 90,253 and 98,521 civilians had died as a result of military action as of January 7, 2009. The Brookings Institution used various sources to develop its own estimates of casualties. The Brookings Institution used various sources to estimate that 108,707 Iraqi civilians have died between May 2003 and January 5, 2009. The Iraq Coalition Casualty Count (ICCC) separately reported 44,276 civilian deaths from April 28, 2005 through January 7, 2009."
