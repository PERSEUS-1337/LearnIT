    "content": "Private equity firms engage in buying and selling businesses, with the industry divided into venture capital and buyout funds. Venture capitalists invest in small startup firms, while buyout funds acquire ownership stakes in businesses of all sizes, often through leveraged buyouts (LBOs). An example is the proposed $24.4 billion LBO of Dell Computers by a consortium led by founder and CEO Michael Dell, using a mix of equity and debt to take the company private. After completing an LBO, the company goes private, allowing private equity investors to own the entire target company. They can pay themselves fees, salaries, and dividends without answering to public shareholders. Debt is often used to pay a special dividend to shareholders, who are the private equity investors. The company is typically resold after several years, either through an IPO or to another firm. Hedge funds engage in various investment strategies across financial markets. Hedge funds trade in various financial markets with a wide range of investment strategies, including speculative positions on financial assets and complex portfolios. They have shorter investment horizons compared to private equity funds. Some hedge funds operate as activist funds in the corporate takeover market, buying stakes in public companies and pressuring them to make changes. Between 2000 and 2007, private equity and hedge funds experienced rapid growth due to factors like the end of the bull market in 2000 and low interest rates. Institutional investors turned to alternative investments like hedge funds and private equity to make up for low yields in traditional asset classes. These funds typically buy stakes in public companies and pressure them to make changes in operations, governance, or financial structure to boost share prices. If initial efforts fail, they may hold onto investments for years, following a strategy similar to value investors like Warren Buffett. Private equity and hedge funds saw rapid growth between 2000 and 2007 as institutional investors sought higher returns. The economic turmoil since 2008 has impacted their performance, with hedge funds experiencing negative returns in 2008 and 2011 for the first time. Private equity returns are also expected to be below historical levels through 2014. The industry has seen significant growth, with over 9,000 hedge funds managing $2.2 trillion in investor funds, compared to 2,500 funds and $200 billion a decade ago. Private equity and hedge funds have raised over $1 trillion in the past decade, with LBOs accounting for 9% of corporate mergers in 2012. Their influence in the market has grown significantly, leading to increased congressional scrutiny on their tax treatment as partnerships. Private equity and hedge funds operate as partnerships, allowing earnings to flow directly to individual partners without firm-level taxation. General partners, typically with Wall Street experience, guide investment strategies, while limited partners, institutional investors, contribute capital without decision-making authority. This structure can be used to manipulate tax attributes and shelter income and assets from taxation. Limited partners in hedge funds are usually institutional investors with significant resources. They contribute a large share of the total fund managed. Hedge funds establish multiple funds to cater to different investors' tax preferences, with many registered in the Cayman Islands. Foreign investors and U.S. tax-exempt institutions may prefer foreign-chartered funds, while other U.S. investors may find it disadvantageous to invest in foreign funds. Investing in hedge funds can be challenging for small public investors due to income and asset requirements. Most funds rely on exemptions to avoid registration with the SEC for public offerings. Some hedge funds and private equity partnerships have gone public by selling shares in an IPO. Hedge funds and private equity partnerships have gone public by selling shares (units) in an IPO. Their securities are now traded on major markets, and may be purchased by anyone. These firms, like Fortress Investment Group and Blackstone, will operate as before but must file financial statements and disclosures required by the SEC. Partners receive income when investments yield a positive return, taxed at the individual level. General partners also receive compensation, typically following a \"2 and 20\" pay formula. The fund's assets are subject to a management fee and a 20% performance bonus, known as carried interest, which is taxed at the capital gains rate. Top hedge fund managers earned $14.4 billion in 2012. Private equity managers' compensation figures are not publicly available. The taxation of carried interest for fund managers has been a topic of debate, with proposals evolving to tax it as ordinary income rather than at the capital gains rate. Private equity managers' compensation figures are not publicly available, unlike hedge fund managers who earned $14.4 billion in 2012. The current debate surrounds the taxation of carried interest for fund managers, with proposals to tax it as ordinary income rather than at the capital gains rate. This is based on the principle of horizontal equity, suggesting that fund managers should be taxed similarly to other workers. One option is to tax carried interest as ordinary income, with some proposals suggesting a mix of capital gains and ordinary income. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 exempts carried interests derived from real estate. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposes to tax carried interest as a mix of ordinary income and capital gains, exempting real estate-derived interests. This change is expected to generate significant revenue according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Supporters argue that carried interest is a fee for services and should be taxed as ordinary income, while opponents believe it should be treated like other investment income. Capital gains income, including carried interest, benefits from tax deferral as it is only taxed when realized. Hedge fund managers can further enhance this benefit by receiving compensation in shares of foreign-chartered funds. Deferral increases in value with the length of the deferral period and the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Hedge fund managers can enhance tax deferral benefits by receiving compensation in shares of foreign-chartered funds, allowing for tax-free compounding of returns. Legislation such as H.R. 3996 aimed to include deferred compensation through foreign-chartered funds in the gross income of hedge fund managers. The House of Representatives and the Senate passed H.R. 4351, but the Senate removed a provision. H.R. 6049 was also passed by the House. The debate on taxing enterprise value, including fees and carried interest, remains unresolved. The current treatment of enterprise value as a capital gain is seen as unjustified by some. The current tax law treatment of enterprise value as a capital gain is debated, with some arguing it violates economic equity principles. Proposals like S. 268 and the President's FY2014 Budget Proposal suggest taxing enterprise value as capital gains if separable from other partnership value and unrelated to investment services. Another approach suggests changing the tax treatment of hedge funds organized as publicly. Another approach proposes changing the tax treatment of some hedge funds organized as publicly traded partnerships. These partnerships are generally treated as corporations for tax purposes, subject to a 35% general rate, with exceptions for partnerships with passive income and those publicly traded before December 17, 1987. In the 110th Congress, S. 1624 was introduced on June 14, 2007. In the 110th Congress, S. 1624 proposed taxing publicly traded partnerships providing investment advisory services as corporations to ensure fair treatment in the tax system. The bill in the 110th Congress proposed taxing publicly traded partnerships providing investment advisory services as corporations for fair treatment in the tax system. It faced criticism from Henry Paulson, then Secretary of the Treasury, for singling out one industry sector. The bill was discussed in a hearing by Chairman Baucus in the Finance Committee but did not progress in the Senate Finance Committee."
