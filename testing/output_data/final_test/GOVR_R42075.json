    "content": "In the early 1990s, laws prohibiting women from serving in air and naval combat units were repealed. Despite official policies, many female servicemembers have been in combat environments. The lines between combat and noncombat roles have blurred in recent conflicts. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta rescinded the rule restricting women from combat units in 2013. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter ordered the military to open all combat jobs to women with no exceptions by January 1, 2016, following extensive studies on unit cohesion, women's health, and international experiences with women in combat. This report discusses the background of women's service in the US Armed Forces, recent removal of all restrictions on women in combat roles, and oversight issues for Congress as DOD implements new policy changes. Since the American Revolutionary War, women have been recognized for military service in combat. Margaret Cochran Corbin was the first woman to receive a military pension for her injury while defending Fort Washington in 1776. Women's roles in the U.S. military were initially clerical or in support of medical services until the establishment of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901 and the Navy Nurse Corps in 1908. Despite opposition, women were eventually enlisted in the armed services. During World War II, Congress opened more service roles to women despite opposition, creating the Naval Reserve and Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in 1942. The Marine Corps Women's Reserve was established in 1943, with nearly 400,000 women serving in various armed services by the end of the war. Following World War II, Congress passed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, making women a permanent part of the military. This legislation included restrictions on combat duty assignments and limited the proportion of women in the military. In the 1960s and 1970s, the expansion of women's roles in the Armed Forces was driven by the end of the draft and the difficulty in recruiting enough qualified males for the All-Volunteer Force. In the 1970s, the movement for equal rights for women led to increased opportunities for female servicemembers in the military. Legislation in the 1970s allowed women to enroll in pilot training, enlist without parental consent at the same age as men, and be admitted to service academies. The number of women serving in the military continued to grow through the next three decades. In the 1970s, legislation expanded opportunities for female servicemembers in the military. By 1978, women were allowed on noncombatant Navy ships and temporary duty on other ships. The question of women registering for Selective Service arose in 1979, with concerns about legal and policy restrictions on women in combat influencing the decision not to require their registration. In 1978, the Women's Army Corps was disbanded after a policy change opened closed occupations but closed combat positions to women. As women integrated into combat units, their roles in support of combat operations were unclear. During Operation Urgent Fury in 1983, four military policewomen were sent to Grenada for an evacuation mission. Four U.S. military policewomen were initially sent to Grenada after the invasion but were later removed from the Task Force by Major General Edward Trobaugh. After intervention by Lieutenant General Jack Mackmull, the women were reattached to the unit and deployed to Barbados on November 2, 1983. In January 1988, the Department of Defense Task Force on Women in the Military highlighted inconsistencies in assigning women to combat missions. As a response, DOD implemented a \"risk rule\" in February 1988 to exclude women from noncombat units or missions with direct combat or hostile fire exposure. In 1988, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office, GAO) identified barriers to increasing the number of women in the military due to restrictions on combat and combat-related jobs. Exclusion from direct ground combat roles was justified by lack of public and congressional support. During Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, women in combat roles increased, with 16 women killed and two taken prisoner. Major Rhonda Cornum, a captured Army flight surgeon, was sexually assaulted, sparking public concern. Efforts to expand women's assignments were renewed post-Operation Desert Storm, leading to legislation in 1991 repealing limitations on women's roles in the military. Legislation in 1991 repealed limitations on women's roles in the military, allowing for the assignment of women in combat aircraft. A Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces issued key recommendations, including ensuring gender should not be a barrier to assignments, setting recruitment goals for women, and prioritizing military readiness in assignment policies. Women could be assigned to combat positions under certain circumstances, but direct land combat was to be excluded for women. The commission recommends excluding women from direct land combat units and positions, codifying existing service policies. Service Secretaries should suggest which units fall under this exclusion. Current DOD and service policies on combat missions should be retained. Laws prohibiting servicewomen from combatant vessels should be repealed or modified, except for submarines and amphibious vessels. The risk rule should be maintained, with Navy policies adjusted accordingly. The commission recommended retaining current policies prohibiting the assignment of women in special operations forces. Secretary of Defense directed military departments to open more positions to women and establish an implementation committee. Congress repealed prohibitions on women serving on combatant vessels and aircraft, required gender-neutral occupational performance standards, and mandated notification to Armed Services Committees before policy changes regarding women in ground combat roles. In 1994, Secretary Aspin rescinded the \"risk rule\" and approved the Direct Combat Exclusion Rule, allowing service members to be assigned to all positions for which they are qualified, except for women being excluded from units below the brigade level engaged in direct ground combat. In 1994, Secretary Aspin rescinded the \"risk rule\" and approved the Direct Combat Exclusion Rule, allowing service members to be assigned to all positions for which they are qualified, except for women being excluded from units below the brigade level engaged in direct ground combat. Secretary Aspin specified assignment policies and regulations that may restrict the assignment of women in certain situations, such as when the cost of appropriate berthing and privacy arrangements is prohibitive, when units doctrinally required to physically collocate with direct combat units are closed to women, during long-range reconnaissance operations and Special Operations Forces missions, and when job-related physical requirements would exclude the majority of women servicemembers. Supporters believe these changes offer more opportunities for women in the armed services, while critics argue they increase the risk for women by removing the \"substantial risk\" of being captured from the definition of ground combat. In the early 21st century, the policy prohibiting women from direct ground combat units faced challenges during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The blurred battlefield distinctions in Iraq and Afghanistan led to debates on women's assignment when three Army women were captured in Iraq. In the early 21st century, the Army's 507th Maintenance Company provided logistic support to ground units, not engaging in direct combat. The Army's move towards a \"Modular Redesign\" in 2005 raised questions about the assignment of women in noncombat roles collocated with combat units due to the changing nature of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a changing battlefield environment, women in the Army and Marine Corps were utilized for various combat-related roles such as searching Iraqi females for weapons, patrolling with foot soldiers, participating in convoy escort missions under fire, and being embedded with special operations forces in Cultural Support Teams. Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester made history in 2005 as the first female soldier since World War II to be awarded the Silver Star for close combat action. Concerns over the deployment of support units led to legislative action in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 required the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress and wait 30 days before making changes to the ground combat exclusion policy or military career fields. A report was also mandated on the assignment of women in the Army, with concerns raised about compliance with assignment policies. The RAND report found evidence that support units are often near direct combat units, but it is inconclusive if they are interdependent. The report highlighted that many female Army members have received Combat Action Badges, showing recognition of their combat service. Recommendations were made to update assignment policies for women to align with modern warfare. Since 2003, 166 women have died and 1,033 have been wounded in combat, with over 9,000 women receiving Army Combat Action Badges. In modern combat operations, over 9,000 women have received Army Combat Action Badges for engaging with the enemy, and two have received Silver Stars for gallantry. Women were recently allowed to serve on submarines after being barred due to privacy and cost concerns. Efforts to open up submarine assignments for women began in 2000, despite opposition from some Navy officials. Efforts to allow women to serve on submarines faced opposition from senior Navy officials and Members of Congress citing cost and privacy concerns. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 halted the Pentagon's efforts until Secretary of Defense notified Congress in 2010. In 2011, the Navy began assigning female personnel to nuclear submarines. In 2011, the Navy started assigning female officers to submarines, and in 2015, enlisted women were allowed to apply for submarine assignments. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established the Military Leadership Diversity Commission to address diversity issues in the Armed Forces. Recommendation 9 from the Military Leadership Diversity Commission suggests eliminating combat exclusion policies for women to create a level playing field. This includes allowing women in career fields open to them to be assigned to any unit that requires their specialty. Recommendation 18 calls for reporting to Congress on the process and timeline for removing barriers hindering women from achieving senior leadership positions. Recommendation 18 calls for annual \"barrier analyses\" to review demographic diversity patterns across the military life cycle, including accession demographics, retention rates, command selection, promotion rates, assignment patterns, attitudinal survey data, and identification of persistent deviations. Recommendation 20 suggests revising Title 10, Section 113, to require the Secretary of Defense to report annually on the available pool of qualified racial/ethnic minority candidates. The Secretary of Defense must report annually on the pool of qualified racial/ethnic minority and female candidates for 3- and 4-star flag/general officer positions. If no qualified candidates are found, an explanation must be provided. This recommendation aims to address the limitations faced by women in attaining senior military ranks due to the combat exclusion policy. The DOD conducted a review of combat exclusion policies to ensure equal opportunities for women in military leadership. The review was mandated by the Ike Skelton National Defense Act for Fiscal Year 2011, with the results submitted to congressional defense committees in April 2011. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense released a report in February 2012 on combat exclusion policies for women in the military. The report found no evidence of unequal opportunities for females and identified practical barriers to eliminating gender assignment policies. It also stated the intention to eliminate the collocation exclusion, allow women in combat roles at the battalion level, and assess policy exceptions. The DOD notified Congress of the removal of collocation restrictions and exceptions to the Direct Combat Exclusion Rule. This allowed support units with women to be collocated with ground combat units, potentially expanding career opportunities for women and increasing flexibility for field commanders. In 2013, the military opened 14,325 positions to women under new exceptions to the exclusion rule. Women accounted for 17.0% of the active duty officer corps and 15.2% of the enlisted corps in 2015. The Marine Corps and Army have a lower percentage of women compared to the Navy and Air Force, with more combat arms positions historically closed to women. For example, the Army had over 105,000 closed positions in artillery, infantry, and armor occupations in 2013. In 2013, the Direct Combat Exclusion Rule on women serving in combat roles was rescinded by then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. This policy change opened previously restricted combat arms occupational specialties and non-combat specialties in combat units. The implementation was guided by principles to ensure unit readiness, provide career opportunities, maintain trust, and validate occupational performance standards. The military has set standards for all occupational specialties, including those closed to women, with gender-neutral performance standards for open specialties. It is important to have a sufficient number of senior women in commands to ensure success. The assimilation of women into previously closed units will be monitored through assessments and pilot programs. The Secretary of Defense has directed military departments to make necessary adjustments in recruiting, assignments, and policies. The Secretary of Defense directed a review of service-level policies and standards for women in the military between 2013 and 2015, with a focus on integrating women into previously closed positions. The Secretaries of the Military Departments were required to certify occupational standards and implement compliance inspections to ensure legal compliance. In July 2015, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military departments conducted 41 studies on women in the services, covering areas like unit cohesion, women's health, equipment, facilities, and interest in combat roles. By September 30, 2015, final recommendations for closed positions were submitted, with the Marine Corps requesting exceptions for specific roles and units, which were not approved by the Secretary of the Navy. Secretary Carter ordered all combat jobs to be open to women without exceptions, with detailed plans due by April 1, 2016. The final implementation plans were approved on March 10, 2016, impacting the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations community. DACOWITS has been monitoring integration progress. Since 2015, the number of women in ground combat units and career fields has increased. Women are filling these positions through new accessions and transfers. However, the number of women entering Infantry and Special Operations training is low. As of September 2016, no women had graduated from the Special Operations training pipeline. The Army conducted a one-time integrated assessment of female performance in Ranger School without changing entry or completion standards. The Army conducted a one-time integrated assessment of female performance in Ranger School without changing entry or completion standards. 20 women qualified for the school, with 19 starting the course. The historical graduation rate at Ranger School is about 40%. The first two women graduated in August 2015, with a third female graduating in October 2015. The Army has since opened Ranger School to all female soldiers and brought over 640 women into previously closed specialties. In September 2016, the Army had 93 contracts for new Infantryman positions and 28 Lieutenants and one Captain entering the pipeline for Infantry Officer positions. The first women graduated from Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course in October 2016 and are set to report to units in 2017. Thirteen women graduated from the integrated Armor Basic Officer Leader Course in December 2016. In 2012, the Marine Corps temporarily opened Infantry Training Battalion and Infantry Officer Course to female volunteers, with 29 female officers attempting but none graduating due to physical performance failures. The pass rates for women in Marine Corps training courses vary, with a 35.9% pass rate for the Infantry Training Battalion compared to 98% for males. Women are now able to enter the Infantry Officer Course and Infantry Training Battalion. The Marine Corps has integrated 174 women into combat units, with the first three enlisted women set to report to infantry positions in January 2017. Two women have participated in the Marine Corps Special Operations screening process. Two women have participated in the assessment process for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command Individual Training Course, but none have attended or graduated from it. Previously closed career fields in the Navy and Air Force, such as Navy SEALS and Special Warfare Combatant Craft, have now opened to women. As of September 2016, no female applications were received for the Navy SEAL Officer assessment and selection boards. Of the 16 enlisted women who took the physical screening test, three passed for SWCC but none for SEAL. No women have been selected for these career fields yet. As of September 2016, six out of 11 female applicants passed the Physical Ability and Stamina Test (PAST) for previously closed career fields in the Air Force, including Special Tactics Officer. Three of these officers have been accepted into the pipeline for Special Tactics Officers. The decision to open all combat roles to women has faced congressional oversight and controversy from some who oppose women serving in combat roles. The decision to open all combat roles to women has faced congressional oversight and controversy from some who oppose women serving in combat roles. Key legislative issues include implementing gender-neutral occupational standards and laws requiring registration for Selective Service. Concerns for Congress during implementation include the impacts on readiness and career management for women in combat roles. Validation and application of gender-neutral standards are important considerations. The military departments have validated physical standards for combat-related occupations. Congress has authority to review and amend gender-neutral occupational performance standards as needed. The Secretary of Defense must ensure gender-neutral occupational performance standards for military career designators open to both male and female members, without differential evaluation based on gender. Gender quotas are prohibited, and occupational performance standards cannot be changed to adjust the number of women in a career field. The Secretary of Defense must establish gender-neutral physical requirements for military career designators open to both male and female members, ensuring equal application. Members have a reasonable period to meet new standards when they are revised. The military departments establish physical fitness standards for personnel, including gender and age-specific requirements. These tests are designed to maintain a minimum level of physical fitness and health across the military forces. The standards vary by age and gender to accommodate physiological differences. For example, a 22-year-old male must run 2 miles in 17:30 to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test. The Army Physical Fitness Test (PFT) has specific standards for different age and gender groups. Passing times vary based on age and gender, with the goal of maintaining a minimum level of physical fitness across military forces. Additional standards may be set for specific occupational fields to ensure individuals can meet job requirements. Gender-neutral physical standards are used to measure job requirements in the military. Both men and women must meet the same standards, regardless of fitness levels. Concerns have been raised that some standards may be set too high, creating barriers for women in certain career fields. Congress has directed the military departments to develop and validate gender-neutral standards. The military is developing gender-neutral occupational standards that accurately predict performance and are applied equitably. Validation criteria include evidence of predictive task performance and measuring individual capabilities. For example, the number of pull-ups a service member can achieve may predict their performance in certain tasks. The military is developing gender-neutral occupational standards based on predictive task performance and individual capabilities. Different tests may be more predictive for men and women, such as pull-ups for men and rope climb for women. The standards must measure combat readiness of combat units, including special operations forces. The military is developing gender-neutral occupational standards based on predictive task performance and individual capabilities to measure combat readiness of combat units, including special operations forces. DOD publicly released WISR studies in December 2015 following the decision to open all combat roles to women, which included methodology for validating occupational standards and recommendations for maintaining, modifying, or developing new standards. Each military service branch and SOCOM conducted independent validation efforts for occupational standards. Army and Marine Corps also provided results of experiments in combat arms training courses measuring individual and unit-level performance. The validation processes for military occupational standards include physical standards for initial screening and completion of specialty training pipelines. Some combat-related career fields allow direct selection at commissioning or enlistment, while others require competitive selection processes from existing communities. Recommendations on initial screening standards were provided following the WISR directive, which aimed to develop gender-neutral occupational standards for combat readiness. Between 2013 and 2015, the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine developed a physical screening test for seven combat arms military occupational specialties. The test was based on the most physically demanding tasks in these specialties, with proxy tests created to meet the physiological demands of the actual tasks. The US Army developed physical tests for combat MOSs, proposing gender-neutral OPATs in 2016. The test includes a standing long jump, seated medicine-ball throw, strength deadlift, and interval aerobic run. Soldiers must meet the moderate standard, with more physically demanding MOSs requiring the heavy standard. OPAT standards are the initial requirements for selecting an occupational specialty. Prior to the 2015 policy change, the Marine Corps used a standard initial strength test (IST) for entry screening. The NHRC recommended enhancing the IST for combat MOSs. Marines must meet all training requirements for their selected MOS. The Marine Corps has implemented new classification standards based on IST+ recommendations for officers and enlisted recruits entering combat MOSs. Enlisted applicants for ground combat arms MOSs will undergo a gender-neutral Ground Combat Arms IST screening, while officers must meet minimum scores during training to qualify for a ground combat arms MOS. Marines must also pass more rigorous ground combat arms MOS Classification Standards after initial screening. Marines must complete course requirements and meet physical standards to qualify for ground combat arms MOS. Navy SEAL and SWCC occupations can be directly selected at enlistment or commissioning. SOCOM leads integration assessments for closed combat positions in the Navy. The Naval Health Research Center in San Diego validated physical standards for the Navy SEAL/SWCC course, including the PST and training assessments. Researchers evaluated the relationship between these standards and job performance assumptions. The researchers validated physical standards for the Navy SEAL/SWCC course, finding that performance on the PST swim and run components correlated with training success. However, the PST pull-up and sit-up components were not predictive. Interviews with subject matter experts revealed that successful operators should possess specific whole-body physical fitness attributes. While the PST has some predictive capability, it is not sufficient on its own to predict success in training or mission success. The Special Warfare Community maintains PST standards for SEAL/SWCC training, with mental toughness and situational awareness rated as key attributes for mission success. Non-physical screening tests for special warfare candidates are recommended. SOCOM validated existing assessment standards as operationally relevant and gender-neutral, emphasizing the importance of rigorous standards for combat effectiveness and unit readiness. The Air Force validated mental and physical standards for initial accession screening of new recruits and training, without changing existing standards. The Strength Aptitude Test (SAT) is used to classify recruits, with a minimum score of 40 lbs. for most career fields and 80 lbs. for \"Battlefield Airmen\" positions. The review during the WISR process found strong evidence for the validity of the SAT. The WISR process validated the SAT for Air Force recruits, suggesting improvements in standards and testing. Special operations candidates must pass a Physical Ability Stamina Test (PAST) including underwater swims, a run, and strength exercises. Exceeding minimum standards is encouraged for successful completion of training pipelines. Officers candidates and Combat Control and Special Operations Weather enlisted candidates must complete a one-week assessment program involving job-related simulations, physical training, and leadership exercises. The Air Force supports existing physical assessment standards for these career fields. Concerns have been raised about pressure to lower standards to increase the number of women eligible for combat roles, but senior military leaders emphasize the importance of maintaining standards. The Pentagon is adamant about not lowering standards for any group or job, including combat roles, to ensure the safety of Marines and the nation. Women's advocacy groups and military organizations closely monitor changes to occupational standards for combat roles, as mandated by law. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress any changes in the number of female members in the Armed Forces and provide justification. Congress can then decide to postpone, request further studies, or allow the changes to take effect. Concerns have been raised about how these policy changes may impact military readiness, which depends on unit and personnel readiness. Personnel readiness is crucial for military effectiveness, measured by qualifications, experience, availability, stability, and morale of unit members. Opening more roles to women can expand the pool of qualified recruits, enhancing combat assignments with diverse skills and perspectives. Surveys show potential benefits in Special Operations Forces, where communication with local female populations is vital. Gender-integrated teams have shown better performance than all-male teams in Marine Corps studies. Some argue that gender-integrated teams outperform all-male teams in challenging tasks, while others believe that all-male units are superior in close combat due to physical differences. The debate on allowing women in combat roles focuses on individual capabilities rather than averages. The Marine Corps conducted studies to understand task execution in operational environments. The Marine Corps conducted an assessment of integrated units with male and female volunteers. Female-integrated units excelled in some areas, but all-male groups performed significantly better in physically demanding tasks. The Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force (GCEITF) report concluded that integrated units showed degradations in task completion time, movement under load, and target effects. Medical non-availability negatively impacts unit readiness, leading to undermanned or underskilled units for military activities. In the military, non-availability due to musculoskeletal profiles affects 10% of active duty servicemembers monthly. Women facing physical standards designed for men have higher injury and attrition rates. Studies show women in ground combat have double the risk of musculoskeletal injury compared to men. The MoD report acknowledged that women capable of passing close ground combat training may be more physically fit and less prone to injury. The U.S. Army found higher musculoskeletal injury rates for women during Basic Combat Training and in a deployed environment, but similar rates for men and women in the operational Army. Incidence rates of some behavioral health disorders were higher among female soldiers, while men had higher rates of alcohol disorders. Both genders had similar rates of PTSD. The Army studies concluded that appropriate use of physical standards should reduce injuries and medical attrition. The Marine Corps gender-integrated unit assessment found that 40.5% of women suffered musculoskeletal injuries compared to 18.8% of men. Females were more likely to be unavailable for training but were out for fewer days than males. Males were more likely to be unavailable for non-occupational injuries. Higher musculoskeletal injury rates were associated with load-bearing activities. Teams with high cohesion have less conflict and stronger support networks to cope with stress. Research suggests that interpersonal relationships and shared experiences contribute to unit cohesion and performance. Task cohesion, developed through shared experiences, is a stronger predictor of group performance than interpersonal relationships. Gender diversity in groups can lead to conflicting results, with some studies showing higher levels of conflict and tension. Women in predominantly male settings may face challenges. Some studies suggest that women in predominantly male settings may face hostility and social integration challenges. Concerns have been raised about the integration of women into traditionally male units, with surveys showing strong opposition from U.S. Special Operations Forces personnel. 85% opposed letting women into their specialties, and 71% opposed women in their units due to concerns about eroding unit cohesion and privacy issues. Some concerns exist regarding the integration of women into traditionally male military units, particularly regarding privacy and male-female relationships. Research has shown that gender-integrated military groups in noncombat roles have not negatively impacted cohesion. Limited research on cohesion in integrated combat units during the WISR evaluation period did not raise serious concerns. The Army's assessment of the integrated Ranger course did not reveal any significant incidents of sexual harassment or assault. An overarching finding from studies across the Marine Corps, Army, and SOCOM is that positive unit cohesion is more likely when physical and professional standards are applied equally to men and women. Differential treatment of women reinforces negative perceptions about women in combat roles, supporting adherence to gender-neutral standards. Congress may monitor unit readiness through regular hearings or reports as gender integration is implemented. Congress may consider funding for research, development, and acquisition of equipment adaptations to enhance safety and performance for all servicemembers, including women in combat roles. Despite combat roles being open to women, achieving senior leadership positions may still take time. In a recent survey, 43% of military women and women veterans cited job and assignment opportunities as a personal challenge. Concerns exist about the Service's assignment policies and developing a \"critical mass\" of women in combat units due to the small number of women qualifying under existing physical standards. In the Marine Corps, women make up only about 8% of the total force. Infantry squads may have one or two women out of 12 Marines, or no women at all. Female volunteers in the Marine Corps' Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force were generally unconcerned about being the only woman in a unit. Efforts have been made to assign senior female officers and noncommissioned officers to units before junior enlisted women to provide mentorship and support. The RAND Corporation study found that critical mass concepts were not previously included in military personnel assignment policies. The Army plans to place female officers or NCOs in infantry and armor units before junior soldiers. Current law prohibits DOD from setting gender quotas, but Congress could amend this to allow targets for female participation in different MOSs. DOD officials are not interested in a quota system, as it may question existing standards for entry. The Services could rely on DACOWITS for oversight on women in combat roles and Congress could impose reporting requirements on DOD for information on women's career progression in combat arms units. Many believe that combat experience is essential for advancement in the armed services, making the exclusion of women from combat roles a barrier to equal opportunity. The exclusion of women from combat roles is seen as a barrier to equal opportunity for promotion and leadership. Some argue that modern weapons have equalized the potential for women in combat. There is a debate on whether women should be allowed in combat roles and be subject to the draft. Critics argue that it would be unfair to give women a choice that is not given to men. Critics argue that allowing women in combat roles and subjecting them to the draft would be unfair to men. Congress may need to consider if women should be required to serve in combat roles, as decided in the 1981 Supreme Court case Rostker v. Goldberg. Congress has the authority to change draft registration laws to include women, as suggested in the FY2017 NDAA. The military services are still implementing the new policy, with provisions for a National Commission on Military National, and Public Service to review the purpose and utility of the registration system. The military services are in the early stages of implementing the new policy to open combat-related occupations to women. Women have entered previously closed specialties in Armor, Field Artillery, Ordnance, and Combat Engineer fields, with some entering operational infantry and special operations training pipelines. Both men and women must meet validated standards for these roles, and military leaders stress the importance of maintaining these standards. Section 593 of the FY2017 NDAA requires annual reports from key military leaders on the status of implementing the Secretary of Defense's policy on opening military occupational roles to women. The Secretary of Defense's policy to open combat-related occupations to women is being implemented. Annual reports are required to track the progress through 2020, including gender-neutral standards, applicant access, success rates, attrition and reclassification rates in ground combat programs. The curr_chunk discusses reclassification, injury rates, non-deployability rates, lateral move approval rates, reenlistment and retention rates, and promotion rates in newly-opened ground combat military occupational specialties, by gender and military occupational specialty. It also mentions actions taken to address equipment sizing and supply issues related to the implementation of the policy to open combat-related occupations to women. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of the new policy on recruitment, retention, assignments, and force readiness in Armed Forces facilities. Congress may monitor the implementation of the policy."
