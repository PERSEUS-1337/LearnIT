This amendment creates a new section in the Internal Revenue Code for a credit for a portion of Social Security taxes. The \"Budget Surplus Dividend Act of 1997\" allows for a credit against the tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for a portion of the taxpayer's social security taxes in taxable years with a federal budget surplus exceeding $1,000,000,000. The applicable percentage is based on the taxpayer's social security taxes, with a base percentage for amounts up to $3,000 and a phasedown percentage for higher amounts.

The base percentage is determined based on the Federal budget surplus, while the phasedown percentage reduces the base percentage for higher amounts. The \"Budget Surplus Dividend Act of 1997\" offers a credit for social security taxes exceeding $3,000. The base percentage is adjusted by the excess of the taxpayer's social security taxes over $3,000 compared to the maximum social security taxes. Maximum social security taxes refer to the taxes if based on the maximum amount of remuneration under section 3101(a). Dollar limitations apply on a per-employee basis.

Any obligations paid with these funds will be canceled and retired. SEC. 4 states that 25 percent of the federal budget surplus should be used to increase nondefense discretionary spending limits for the following fiscal year. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will adjust the discretionary spending limit accordingly."
