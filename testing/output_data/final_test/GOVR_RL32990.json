    "content": "In 2000, media reported child trafficking in the West African cocoa sector. The House passed a bill to develop a label for chocolate products to indicate no child slave labor. A protocol was negotiated to end abusive child labor in cocoa growing. The Harkin-Engel Protocol, named after Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel, aims to end abusive child labor on cocoa farms by July 2005. The first five steps have been completed, but there is debate over the final step of developing a certification system. If commitments are not met, legislative efforts may be renewed. This report discusses cocoa production, child labor issues, and Congressional efforts, including the Harkin-Engel Protocol. The curr_chunk discusses child labor in the cocoa industry, efforts by Congress and other entities to address the issue, and policy options. It also provides information on cocoa production, including the types of cacao trees and their distribution in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South and Central America. West Africa is the largest producer of cocoa, accounting for 72% of the global supply in 2003/04. According to the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), there was a 10% production increase and a record harvest. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana produced 43% and 16% of world output, respectively. Other key producers include Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Brazil. Global and Africa-specific production trends are detailed in tables 1 and 2. World cocoa production is expected to gradually increase, with a projected growth rate of 2.2% annually. Africa is expected to continue providing the bulk of cocoa production, with the Americas also seeing increases. However, Africa's share of production may drop by 1% by 2010. Despite overall rising trends, a slight drop in production is forecast for 2004/2005. Cocoa production trends show a slight drop in forecast for 2004/2005 due to lower harvest levels. Cocoa prices have been flat or slightly declined recently. U.S. imports of unprocessed cocoa beans mainly come from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Indonesia, and the Dominican Republic. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire exports more than 75% of its cocoa production, with a growing focus on higher value products like cocoa cake and chocolate. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is a major exporter of cocoa, with the European Union being the leading destination accounting for 65% of exports. The United States imports about 20% of Ivorian cocoa, while other countries like Canada and European countries supply processed cocoa products to the US. Cocoa beans enter the US market duty-free, but processed cocoa products face higher tariffs. After harvest, cocoa beans are fermented, dried, and roasted to produce semi-processed cocoa paste, cocoa butter, cocoa cake, cocoa powder, and chocolate. Cocoa farming in West Africa involves labor-intensive work such as thinning or clearing forest growth to shelter cocoa trees and provide shade to reduce damage by pests and diseases. Forest areas are used as a source of natural shade without the need for planting cover plants. Cocoa farming in West Africa involves labor-intensive work such as thinning or clearing forest growth to shelter cocoa trees and provide shade. Forest areas are used as a source of natural shade without the need for planting cover plants. The tropical soils in many areas of West Africa where cocoa is grown are thin and easily leached of nutrients. Traditional land use methods involve clearing mature forest areas for cocoa farming, but practices are gradually changing with the use of chemical fertilizers and organic growing methods. Cocoa farming in West Africa involves labor-intensive tasks such as clearing forest areas for planting seedlings, weeding, applying fertilizers and pesticides, and harvesting cocoa pods. Child labor is commonly found during the harvesting process, with reports of children being trafficked and working under abusive conditions on cocoa farms. In response to reports of abusive child labor on cocoa farms in 2000, the cocoa and chocolate industries, along with various organizations and governments, developed the Harkin-Engel Protocol to end abusive child labor by July 2005. The Harkin-Engel Protocol was developed to end abusive child labor on cocoa farms by July 2005. It includes six steps such as issuing a public statement, forming an advisory group, signing a joint statement, developing a memorandum of cooperation, and establishing a monitoring system for compliance with standards. The Harkin-Engel Protocol aimed to end abusive child labor on cocoa farms by July 2005 through various steps, including establishing a monitoring system for compliance with standards. An independent system was set up to monitor and report compliance, while a joint international foundation was created to manage anti-child labor efforts and promote best practices. Additionally, an industry-wide certification process was developed to ensure cocoa beans are not produced using child labor. A study by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in 2002 assessed the extent of child labor in major cocoa-producing countries in West Africa. The study was supported by USAID, DOL, World Cocoa Foundation, ILO, and governments of Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. Surveys were conducted in all four countries, including Baseline Producer Surveys in 203 villages in Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria, and more detailed Producer-Worker Surveys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The surveys covered the entire cocoa producing region and 1,500 producers. The study funded by USAID covered the cocoa producing region in Cote d'Ivoire, with 1,500 producers interviewed. The ILO expressed concerns about the validity of the survey results, prompting plans for their own survey. Despite this, the survey provides comprehensive data on child labor in the cocoa sector, revealing that cocoa production mainly occurs on small family farms. The average cocoa farm sizes in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria ranged from 4.7 to 6.3 hectares. Around 284,000 children were working under hazardous conditions, with the majority in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Salaried child workers were found to be more productive, with larger farms employing more children from within farm families. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, an estimated 4,630 farmers were employing 5,120 children as full-time permanent workers. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, 4,630 farmers employed 5,120 children as full-time workers, while in Ondo State, Nigeria, 1,220 children were full-time workers. Most salaried child workers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were paid personally, while some had their earnings received by family members or intermediaries. Child labor in cocoa farming is common in West Africa, with family labor being the primary type of labor on cocoa farms in the region. Children are extensively involved in cocoa farming in West Africa, with family labor being predominant. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, 87% of permanent labor in cocoa farming comes from the family, including 24% from children. Some children working on cocoa farms are not related to the farmers, raising concerns of trafficking. Boys make up 59% of child laborers in cocoa farming, with over 60% being under 14 years old. These children are engaged in various tasks, some of which may be hazardous or exploitative. Children in West Africa, particularly in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Nigeria, are at risk of exploitation in cocoa farming, with 41% and 29% of salaried child workers recruited through intermediaries, including family friends or traffickers. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, one-third of school-age children on cocoa farms have never attended school, and those working in cocoa farming tasks are less likely to be enrolled in school. In West Africa, children working in cocoa farming tasks have lower school enrollment rates compared to non-working children. Immigrant cocoa farmers' children in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are also less likely to be enrolled in school. Girls generally have lower enrollment rates than boys. Cocoa production in West Africa is labor-intensive, mainly done by small-scale farmers using family labor. Average annual cocoa revenues per household member range from $30 to $205, with varying wages for child and adult workers in different countries. Cocoa farming in West Africa is a significant source of income for households, with children earning $115 annually and adult workers making $205. Cocoa production accounts for a large portion of household income in countries like Cameroon, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. However, the quantity of cocoa produced is low, leading to financial struggles for families. Child trafficking for cocoa production is a known issue, particularly in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where children are exposed to hazardous conditions on cocoa farms. Child labor and child trafficking in West African cocoa production are influenced by economic factors such as low cocoa prices and the inability of smallholder farmers to afford hired labor. Cultural traditions also play a role, with children often involved in household and farm work from a young age. Lack of adequate school facilities in cocoa-producing areas further exacerbates the issue. Children in West Africa are often involved in household and farm work from a young age, with a tradition of child migration within and across borders. This migration complicates efforts to monitor and prevent child trafficking. Reliable data on child trafficking in cocoa production is scarce, but efforts are proposed for prevention and protection, including national action plans and legal frameworks. Congress has taken action to combat child trafficking by implementing legal frameworks and funding programs to eliminate child labor, including prohibiting the importation of goods made with forced or indentured child labor. Congress has implemented laws to combat child labor, including prohibiting goods made with forced or indentured child labor and adding child labor stipulations to foreign aid legislation. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 provides punishment for traffickers and assistance to trafficking victims, with a focus on women and children. International trade agreements like the Generalized System of Preferences have been used to fight child labor. Development Act of 2000 expanded GSP ineligibility criteria to include Worst Forms of Child Labor. USTR conducts yearly reviews to ensure countries are implementing commitments under ILO Convention 182. Trade Act of 2002 added child labor criteria to ATPA. NAALC, part of NAFTA, promotes fundamental labor standards, including addressing child labor. The NAALC has enhanced transparency and public debate on labor law and enforcement issues. Congress has funded the USDOL-ICLP research on child labor and expanded its mandate to include grants for eliminating child labor and improving access to education. $79 million was appropriated in FY2005 for international child labor elimination efforts. In 2001, efforts were made to combat child labor in the cocoa sector, with various organizations and governments taking action. The US Congress passed a bill allocating funds to develop a label for chocolate products to address abusive child labor practices. The US Congress allocated funds to develop a label for chocolate products to address child slave labor in cocoa production. A comprehensive protocol, the Harkins-Engel Protocol, was negotiated to end abusive child labor in cocoa growing, with consensus on the completion of the first five steps. There is debate on the final step, the development of a certification system, with the chocolate industry failing to meet the deadline set by Senator Harkin. Senator Harkin warned that Congress might take legislative action if the July deadline is not met. There is speculation that a bill similar to the Child Labor Deterrence Act may be reintroduced. Progress has been made in anti-child labor programs in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana according to representatives of the cocoa/chocolate industry. The Ivorian Government funded a child labor monitoring program in the Oum\u00e9 District, with field staff trained using ILO question guides. The cocoa industry is investing $5 million annually for certification and economic programs in West Africa. Data is being collected for a certification report to be reviewed by the National Steering Committee. Similar efforts are underway in Ghana. Surveys to monitor child labor will be ongoing during harvest periods, with plans to scale up monitoring efforts across cocoa communities. Global NGOs are also involved in these efforts. Global Exchange released a progress report on the implementation of the Protocol for the cocoa industry, highlighting key concerns such as the substitution of pilot certification efforts, failure to address the root cause of abusive child labor, and lack of enforcement mechanisms. Senator Tom Harkin, Representative Eliot Engel, and the Chocolate/Cocoa Industry also issued a joint statement on efforts to combat child labor in cocoa growing. The cocoa industry, along with Senator Harkin and Representative Engel, released a joint statement on addressing child labor in cocoa-growing regions. They committed to certifying 50% of cocoa growing areas within three years. The Sustainable Tree Crops Program is one of the initiatives working to combat child labor in cocoa production. The cocoa/chocolate industry, along with various organizations and governments, is addressing abusive child labor in cocoa production by improving agricultural practices and supporting farmers' organizations. The Sustainable Tree Crops Program aims to increase access to technology that boosts profitability and productivity for smallholder tree crop systems in countries like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana, resulting in increased crop yields. The Sustainable Tree Crops Program in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana has led to boosted crop yields of 20% to 50%, allowing some farmers to afford school fees for their children. Over 4,000 farmers have been sensitized on the dangers of abusive child labor. Key program activities include Farmer Field Schools, spraying minimization, crop rotation techniques, agribusiness skills training, child labor sensitization, and HIV/AIDS awareness. The U.S. Department of Labor's International Child Labor Program implements an anti-trafficking program in West Africa, receiving funding in various fiscal years. The International Child Labor Program (ICLP) implements initiatives in Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Mali, and Togo to rescue and rehabilitate trafficked children, raise awareness, establish coordination mechanisms, develop legal actions against traffickers, train border authorities, and provide education and skills training. Additionally, ICLP works with the ILO on a regional program to eliminate child labor in the cocoa sector in West Africa. The West Africa Cocoa/Commercial Agriculture Program (WACAP) received $5 million from DOL in FY2002 to prevent and eliminate child labor in the cocoa sector. The program targeted 9,000 children below age 13, with over 3,000 identified, counseled, withdrawn from work, and placed in educational or vocational training facilities. WACAP aims to develop a National Plan of Action and launch awareness campaigns to combat child labor in the cocoa/agriculture sector. The West Africa Cocoa/Commercial Agriculture Program (WACAP) aims to prevent child labor in the cocoa sector by educating children, providing skills to adult family members, training children in marketable skills, monitoring child labor, protecting children from hazardous work, rehabilitating those removed from hazardous work, establishing a monitoring system, and integrating labor inspection programs. Cote d'Ivoire has ratified key ILO conventions and established a national plan of action to combat child labor. The West Africa Cocoa/Commercial Agriculture Program (WACAP) aims to prevent child labor in the cocoa sector through education, skills training, monitoring, and rehabilitation. Fair Trade Label Organizations International (FLO) supports anti-child labor efforts by encouraging farmer cooperatives and offering minimum prices per metric ton for cocoa. Farmers selling to Fair Trade buyers receive above-market prices and premiums based on world prices. Fair Trade Label Organizations International (FLO) certifies farmers who receive above-market prices for cocoa and must not use forced or child labor. They reserve revenue for social projects and promote environmentally sustainable practices. Fair Trade cooperatives in Ghana, Cameroon, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador involve 42,000 cocoa farmers in various initiatives like shade cultivation, crop diversification, labor standards compliance, credit access, and marketing training. Some economists suggest fair trade and labeling schemes to improve labor standards, including discouraging child labor. The Trade and Development Act of 2000 expanded eligibility criteria to include barring the worst forms of child labor. Trade analysts advocate for revoking trade benefits for countries using child labor in cocoa production. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) aims to provide sub-Saharan African countries with greater access to the U.S. market. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire lost its AGOA beneficiary status in 2005 due to lack of economic reforms and violating a U.N. cease-fire. The country is also under U.S. sanctions for a military coup in 1999 and an election deemed unfair by the United States. The 1999 coup in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire led to the country being under U.S. sanctions. Due to concerns about abusive child labor in cocoa production, there are limited options for imposing further assistance or trade-based sanctions. Advocates suggest considering child labor provisions for cocoa-producing countries and potentially withdrawing preferences for cocoa products if exporting countries do not comply with child labor commitments. The Harkin-Engel Protocol calls for addressing these issues. The Harkin-Engel Protocol aims to establish a certification system in cocoa-producing countries by July 1, 2005, but critics argue for stronger enforcement mechanisms. Advocates are concerned that the voluntary agreement may not effectively address abusive child labor in cocoa production. Industry proponents believe it is premature to consider alternatives to the certification plan set to begin in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The certification plan for cocoa production in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana will focus on farm-level conditions, with a goal to certify 50% of all cocoa producing areas by 2008. Child rights advocates argue for stronger enforcement mechanisms to prevent abusive child labor in cocoa production. Industry proponents believe it is not feasible to certify all cocoa beans as child labor-free. In 2000, Congress amended the Tariff Act to address goods made with forced or indentured child labor. Non-governmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Customs Service to enforce the Tariff Act. Trade analysts debate the potential challenges of using the Tariff Act to ban cocoa imports from countries like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for child labor standards enforcement in the WTO. The WTO agreements do not cover labor standards, except for prison labor mentioned in Article XX(e) of GATT 1994. Some argue that the US import ban on products made with abusive child labor could be justified under Article XX(b) to protect human health. Proponents of banning cocoa imports due to abusive child labor practices cite recent WTO dispute panel decisions supporting enforcement of member countries' laws. Critics argue that an import ban on cocoa produced using abusive child labor may not effectively improve the situation of children in cocoa-producing countries like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. They suggest that addressing rural poverty, the root cause of child labor, should be the primary focus. Questions of fairness and targeting arise, especially considering that the US imports a quarter of its cocoa beans from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, while Europe receives 65% of Ivorian cocoa, some of which may be used in products imported to the US. The extent to which an import ban would cover products from Europe made with cocoa beans produced under abusive child labor conditions is also a concern. The Harkin-Engel Protocol is an agreement in the cocoa/chocolate industry to combat abusive child labor. If challenges arise, other cooperative action plans like the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme could be considered. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) aims to prevent trade in conflict diamonds by using certificates issued by state participants to vouch for the legitimacy of diamonds. The KPCS involves states, regional economic organizations, the diamond industry, and civil society groups as observers. It has a temporary WTO waiver that expires in 2006, with expectations for a further waiver to be sought to continue the process. Creating a similar process to address abusive labor practices in the cocoa industry could potentially face challenges such as lengthy negotiations, adoption of lower labor standards, objections from non-participating countries, and potential WTO challenges. A waiver similar to the one under the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme could be sought to address these issues. Some observers believe that a cocoa trade regime may not conflict with WTO rules, as exceptions related to public health and morals could apply. Cocoa-producing countries could benefit from findings on labor patterns, using child labor as an indicator of poverty. Countries like Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are using revenues from initiatives to improve education infrastructure and combat child labor. Ivorian officials are committed to ending abusive child labor in cocoa production despite facing challenges due to instability in key cocoa-growing areas. The government has spent over $1 million on anti-child labor efforts, primarily through STCP. However, the lack of educational infrastructure in rural areas hinders the removal of children from hazardous labor practices. In Ghana, educational infrastructure is limited, making transport to schools difficult. Many farmers struggle to afford school fees, uniforms, and books. Primary education is free but not enforced due to insufficient schools. Teachers are often obtained through national service programs. Farmers have turned to family labor due to declining cocoa prices, leading to lower productivity and reduced investments in children's education. The fall of world cocoa prices has led to an increase in child labor in cocoa production. Child labor is defined as any economic activity performed by a person under the age of 15, which prevents them from attending school or puts their health at risk. Labor rights advocates argue that higher profits for farmers could reduce the use of child labor. Children under 18 are exploited for various hazardous work on cocoa farms, including clearing ground, applying pesticides, and harvesting."
