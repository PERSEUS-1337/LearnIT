    "content": "AUTHORITY FOR STATES TO REGULATE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE GENERATED IN ANOTHER STATE: Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new section allowing states to regulate municipal solid waste generated in another state. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'affected local government', 'affected local solid waste planning unit', and 'municipal solid waste'. The definitions clarify the roles and jurisdictions of these entities in relation to facilities for waste treatment, incineration, or disposal. The term 'municipal solid waste' refers to nonhazardous residue from combustion generated by the general public, residential, commercial, industrial sources, or incinerator facilities. It includes materials like paper, wood, yard waste, plastic, leather, rubber, metal, and glass. The term 'municipal solid waste' excludes hazardous waste, waste from environmental response actions, recycled materials, waste from air transportation services, and industrial waste not identical to municipal solid waste. The State is authorized to regulate the treatment, incineration, and disposal of municipal solid waste generated in another State, including imposing bans or limits on waste importation. The owner or operator of a waste disposal facility in a State must obtain local government approval to accept municipal solid waste generated outside the State, except as provided under State law. The owner or operator of a waste disposal facility in a State must obtain local government approval to accept municipal solid waste generated outside the State, except as provided under State law. Exceptions include compliance with state laws regarding waste treatment and acceptance of waste from outside the state before the enactment of this section. The operator of a facility must obtain written authorization from local officials and solid waste planning units to treat, incinerate, or dispose of municipal solid waste generated outside the State. This authorization allows compliance with the requirements of the law. When a facility is authorized by a political subdivision and solid waste planning unit to accept out-of-state municipal solid waste for treatment or disposal, the owner/operator is considered compliant. Expansion of waste disposal facilities requires obtaining necessary authorizations. Before accepting out-of-state municipal solid waste for treatment or disposal, a facility must obtain the required authorizations. The affected local government and solid waste planning unit must review and make available a brief description of the planned facility to relevant parties before formal action is taken on the authorization. The facility must provide a description of its size, waste capacity, and expected monthly and yearly waste quantity. It should also include a map showing the facility's location in relation to local roads, topographical and hydrological features, buffer zones, and any units to be acquired. Additionally, a description of the current environmental characteristics of the facility is required. The facility must describe its environmental characteristics, including groundwater resources and alterations due to operation. It should also detail environmental controls like runoff management, air pollution devices, and methane monitoring. The facility must provide details on environmental controls such as covers, liners, leachate collection systems, waste residuals management, site access controls, roadway improvements, and required permits for operation. The facility must provide estimates of personnel requirements, including skill and education levels, violations of law by the owner or operator, and enforcement proceedings related to the violations. The facility must provide information on violations, corrective actions taken, gifts to public officials, and compliance with state waste management plans. The facility must provide information on violations, corrective actions taken, gifts to public officials, compliance with state waste management plans, capital required for construction and operation, insurance, collateral, bond, public comment opportunity, public hearing, and notice of action publication. The Governor must publish notice of the action in a newspaper and notify adjoining local governments and Indian tribes. Within 90 days of enactment, each State Governor must designate a political subdivision to authorize a facility for municipal solid waste treatment. If the State Governor fails to designate a political subdivision within the specified time frame, the affected local government will have jurisdiction over the facility. The table of contents for the Solid Waste Disposal Act will be updated to reflect this change. Authorization for States to regulate municipal solid waste generated in another State."
