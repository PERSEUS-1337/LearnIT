    "content": "Establishment of special enrollment periods and waiver of late enrollment penalty for certain military retirees and dependents. Special Medicare Part B Enrollment Period for individuals aged 65 before enactment, meeting specific conditions related to military coverage and residence within 100 miles of a military facility. Special enrollment period for individuals aged 65 who maintained a primary residence within 100 miles of a military hospital providing inpatient services that closed or discontinued services. The enrollment period lasts for 9 months starting 45 days after the enactment of the Act. Individuals aged 65 who have been covered beneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, and have continuously lived within 100 miles of a military hospital providing inpatient services may enroll in a special enrollment period if the hospital closes or discontinues inpatient services. A special enrollment period of 90 days is granted to individuals aged 65 living within 100 miles of a military hospital that closes or discontinues inpatient services. If the closure is due to a base closure law, it is considered announced upon submission of a report to Congress. Otherwise, a public announcement must be made at least 60 days before the closure. The closure or discontinuation of a military hospital must be announced at least 60 days beforehand, with specific requirements for notifying individuals aged 65 and older. The term 'base closure law' includes specific legislative acts related to military base closures. The enactment of this subsection defines a military hospital as a facility of a uniformed service. Special enrollments under Medicare Part B have a coverage period starting 15 days after enrollment. Additionally, there is a waiver of the late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B. The new subsection (h) states that individuals enrolling in Medicare Part B during a special enrollment period under section 1837(j) will not face increased premiums due to late enrollment. Section 1882 of the Act is amended to prohibit denial or conditioning of issuance of a Medicare supplemental policy based on health status or medical history. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, regarding enrollment in Medicare Part B during a special enrollment period."
