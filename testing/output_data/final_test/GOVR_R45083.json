    "content": "This report provides an overview of FY2018 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the LHHS bill, which includes discretionary and mandatory appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as related agencies like the Social Security Administration. The LHHS bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. The LHHS bill is a major source of discretionary funds for federal programs, particularly focused on appropriations for Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies. It addresses controversial social policy issues like abortion and stem cell research. Congressional clients can refer to the LHHS experts list for specific agency and program information. The LHHS bill provides an overview of major congressional actions on FY2018 appropriations and a comparison of enacted and proposed funding levels for FY2018 to FY2017. The report includes sections on DOL, HHS, ED, and Related Agencies, highlighting funding levels. Appendix A summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2018. Appendix A summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2018, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, FY2018 budget resolution, subcommittee spending allocations, and LHHS-related floor amendments in the House. This report focuses on appropriations to agencies under the jurisdiction of the LHHS subcommittees. The LHHS bill provides appropriations for federal departments and agencies such as the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services (excluding certain agencies funded through other appropriations bills), Department of Education, and related agencies like the Social Security Administration and Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The LHHS bill includes discretionary and mandatory budget authority for various federal departments and agencies, such as the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and related agencies. Funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside the annual appropriations process, and certain direct spending programs receive funding directly from their authorizing statutes. Programs funded through annual appropriations are known as appropriated entitlements. Appropriators have limited control over the funding amounts, as the authorizing statute sets the program parameters. If Congress fails to appropriate the necessary funds, entitled recipients may have legal recourse. Most mandatory spending is not part of the annual appropriations process but is provided through the program's authorizing statute. The funding amounts in the report only include funds provided through appropriations acts, not outside sources. The report focuses on discretionary funding provided through appropriations acts. Mandatory amounts reflect current-law estimates and do not include proposed changes to authorizing statutes. Discretionary funding receives more attention during the appropriations process, while mandatory funding levels have less flexibility for adjustment. Sequestration involves across-the-board reductions to discretionary or mandatory spending. Budget authority is the amount of money a federal agency can spend. Appropriations bills may include budget authority for the current or future fiscal years. Advance appropriations refer to funds available in future fiscal years. Appropriations levels in the report refer to total budget authority provided in a bill. The report breaks out current-year appropriations from total budget authority provided in an appropriations bill. The amount of current-year budget authority is measured against 302(b) allocation ceilings during the annual appropriations process. Scorekeeping adjustments are made by the Congressional Budget Office to reflect Congress's conventions and special instructions. Appropriations levels in the report do not include additional scorekeeping adjustments. On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration proposed rescissions of $15.8 billion in budget authority, including LHHS-related funding. The House passed the measure as H.R. 3 on June 7, 2018, with a vote of 210-206. The Senate referred the measure to the Appropriations and Budget Committees on June 20, 2018. On June 20, 2018, a motion to discharge the Senate Appropriations and Budget Committees from considering the measure was rejected by a vote of 48-50. No further action has been taken on the measure. President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2018 into law on March 23, 2018, providing $186.5 billion in LHHS discretionary appropriations, 7.6% more than FY2017 levels. The FY2018 LHHS appropriations totaled $1.004 trillion, with $817.5 billion in mandatory funding. The 2017 hurricane season was active, with four named storms causing damage. Two supplemental appropriations laws were enacted in response, providing $4.0 billion in funding. Emergency funds were allocated for various purposes under the LHHS appropriations bill, including dislocated worker assistance, Job Corps, CDC activities, NIH, Head Start Program, public health emergency fund, hurricane education recovery, Higher Education Act waiver authority, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities Supplemental Loan. The FY2018 enacted totals in this report do not include emergency funds allocated for various purposes under the LHHS appropriations bill. Temporary funding for LHHS was provided through multiple continuing resolutions enacted throughout FY2018. The FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill was funded through multiple continuing resolutions, with discretionary programs funded at FY2017 levels minus a reduction of about two-thirds of one percent. Mandatory programs were generally continued at current-law levels, less sequestration. The House Appropriations Committee's version of the bill was ordered reported in July 2017. The House committee bill, H.R. 3358, proposed $168.9 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, a 2.6% decrease from FY2017 levels. It also included $817.4 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $986.3 billion for LHHS. Although H.R. 3358 did not pass in the House, its text was included in the omnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 3354, which was approved on September 14, 2017. The House funding numbers in this report are based on H.R. 3358 from the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill with $174.4 billion in discretionary funds, 0.6% more than FY2017. The bill also included $817.4 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $991.9 billion for LHHS. The FY2018 President's budget requested $148.9 billion in discretionary appropriations for LHHS, a 14.1% decrease from FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided $173.3 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS, $3.1 billion more than FY2016 levels. The FY2018 LHHS budget provided $760.6 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $934.0 billion. Table 2 shows FY2018 discretionary and mandatory budget authority by bill title, compared to FY2017 levels. Figure 2 displays enacted FY2018 funding levels. In FY2018, HHS received the largest share of total LHHS appropriations at $848 billion, accounting for 84.4% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies followed with 7.4% and 6.8% respectively, while DOL received the smallest share at 1.4%. The majority of HHS funding is for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds, while ED funding is mostly discretionary and Related Agencies funding goes towards mandatory payments and administrative costs. In discretionary appropriations, the composition of LHHS funding is different. HHS has a smaller share (47.3%) while ED has a larger share (38.0%). Together, they make up 85.3% of discretionary LHHS appropriations. DOL and Related Agencies split the remaining 14.7%. Amounts are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and are rounded to the nearest million or billion. Dollar and percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. The Department of Labor (DOL) is a federal department that provides services related to employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. Annual LHHS appropriations laws direct funding to all DOL entities, which primarily focus on workforce development and worker protection. This includes administering programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), Job Corps, and the Employment Service, as well as income security programs like Unemployment Insurance benefits. The Department of Labor (DOL) provides services related to employment, training, worker protection, and income security. DOL entities focus on workforce development, worker protection, and labor market analysis. The Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) offers employment services for veterans, while agencies like OSHA, MSHA, and WHD ensure worker safety and compliance with labor laws. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data on the labor market. The FY2018 omnibus increased discretionary appropriations for DOL by 1.1% compared to FY2017 enacted levels. Discretionary DOL appropriations would have decreased under the FY2018 President's budget request, as well as the FY2018 House and Senate committee bills. Roughly 89% of the total funding provided for DOL is discretionary. ETA administers the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which authorizes appropriations for its programs. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was signed into law in July 2014, authorizing appropriations through FY2020. WIOA's provisions took effect in FY2015 and FY2016, with Title I authorizing funding for state formula grant programs serving Adults, Youth, and Dislocated Workers. The FY2018 omnibus increased funding for the state formula grant programs by $80 million compared to FY2017, while the President's budget proposed a $1.1 billion reduction. Additionally, the FY2018 omnibus maintained funding at $221 million for the Dislocated Workers Activities National Reserve, while the President's budget and House committee bill proposed cuts. The FY2018 omnibus bill directed $30 million from the DWA National Reserve towards training and employment assistance for workers in the Appalachian and lower Mississippi regions. It also provided $145 million for the Apprenticeship Grant program, a $50 million increase from FY2017. The Senate committee bill would have kept funding for the DWA National Reserve the same as FY2017. The FY2018 omnibus bill allocated $400 million for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) program, matching the FY2017 level. The House committee bill proposed no funding for the program, while the Senate committee bill maintained funding at the FY2017 level. The House committee suggested transferring CSEOA to the Administration for Community Living (ACL) in HHS, but the FY2018 omnibus continued funding at DOL. The FY2018 omnibus bill continued to fund CSEOA at DOL with $86 million for ILAB, matching the FY2017 level. The House committee proposed reducing ILAB funding by $68 million (-78.5%), while the Senate committee maintained funding. The House committee aimed to refocus ILAB on research, advocacy, and technical assistance. The FY2018 omnibus included general provisions related to labor issues. The FY2018 omnibus bill included provisions related to the H-2B program, allowing private wage surveys for prevailing wages. It also exempted certain insurance claims adjusters from overtime protection after a major disaster. Additionally, new labor-related provisions were introduced. The FY2018 omnibus bill introduced new labor-related provisions, including authorizing the Secretary of Labor to provide assistance to apprenticeship programs, employ law enforcement officers for protection, and dispose of real property at the Treasure Island Job Corps Center. It also amended tip pooling provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In 2011, the Department of Labor clarified that employee tips can only be used for tip credits or pooled among tipped employees. A 2017 proposed rule would allow pooled tips to be shared with both tipped and non-tipped workers if the employer pays at least the full minimum wage. The rule did not specify which non-tipped employees could participate in tip pools. The FY2018 omnibus amended the FLSA to prohibit employers from keeping any portion of employee tips, regardless of taking the tip credit. Employers not taking the tip credit can allow both tipped and non-tipped employees to participate in tip pools, but cannot keep any tips. The curr_chunk discusses how the funding mentioned is based on regular LHHS appropriations only, excluding funds for HHS agencies from other appropriations bills or outside the annual appropriations process. It also mentions that HHS is a large federal department composed of multiple agencies working to enhance the health and well-being of Americans. The LHHS bill directs funding to five Public Health Service agencies: HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ. These agencies support various health care services, quality improvement, medical research, and disease prevention. Additionally, the LHHS bill provides funding for components of CMS, responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and other programs. The LHHS bill allocates funding for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, consumer protections, and private health insurance under the ACA. It also provides funding for HHS agencies focused on social services, such as ACF and ACL, which support vulnerable populations. Additionally, funding is provided for the HHS Office of the Secretary for management, research, oversight, and emergency preparedness. The FY2018 omnibus bill increased HHS discretionary appropriations by 12.8%, with the Senate committee bill slightly increasing funding by 2.1%. The President requested a 19.3% decrease in discretionary HHS funding. Mandatory funding dominates HHS appropriations, with CMS receiving the majority for Medicaid benefits and health care trust funds. CMS accounts for 88.2% of all enacted appropriations for HHS. In FY2018, CMS received the majority of HHS appropriations at 88.2%, while ACF and NIH received about 4.5% each. Discretionary funding for CMS constituted only 5.0% of enacted HHS appropriations, with PHS agencies receiving 62.5% of discretionary funds. NIH received the largest share of discretionary funding at 41.0%, followed by ACF at 25.9%. Additional funding mechanisms like the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside and PPHF have been used in recent years for LHHS appropriations. The PHS Evaluation Set-Aside, authorized by Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, allows the Secretary of HHS to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation purposes. LHHS appropriations acts have commonly established a higher maximum percentage for the set-aside, with a maximum of 2.5% since FY2010, including FY2018. The House committee bill for FY2018 proposed reducing the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside to 2.4% of eligible appropriations, while the Senate committee bill and the Trump Administration suggested increasing it to 2.9%. Since FY2015, tap funds have been directed to fewer programs within three HHS agencies, excluding AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. The House committee bill aimed to maintain this distribution for FY2018. The House committee bill proposed maintaining the distribution of tap funds for FY2018, with a change in FY2015 directing more funds to NIH. The FY2018 omnibus allocated $923 million to NIH, with differing proposals from the House, Senate, and President for the transfer amounts. The President's request proposed reducing the transfer by $44 million (-5.4%) for the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) which was established by the ACA to support public health programs. The ACA had initially appropriated $2 billion in mandatory funds for FY2018 to the PPHF, but subsequent laws decreased this amount. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 decreased PPHF appropriations by $6.25 billion over FY2013-FY2021, and the 21st Century Cures Act further reduced PPHF appropriations by $6.3 billion for FY2018 through FY2024. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) appropriations were reduced by $6.3 billion for FY2018 through FY2024, with a 6.6% reduction in FY2018 due to sequestration. After sequestration, the total PPHF appropriation for FY2018 was $840.6 million, $90 million less than FY2017. PPHF funds supplement program funding and support new programs authorized by the ACA. The HHS Secretary transfers PPHF amounts for prevention, wellness, and public health activities based on the President's annual budget request. The Secretary determines distribution of Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) funds annually. Starting in FY2014, provisions in appropriations acts direct fund distribution. CDC receives the largest share, with $801 million allocated for FY2018, a $90 million reduction from FY2017. The President's budget and House committee bill proposed a lesser reduction of $51 million. This section highlights FY2018 discretionary funding by HHS agency compared to FY2017 levels. The FY2018 omnibus provided increased funding levels for HRSA and Title X Family Planning compared to FY2017. The House committee bill proposed eliminating funding for Title X, while the Senate bill and FY2018 omnibus maintained funding. The FY2018 omnibus included increased funding for HRSA and Title X Family Planning compared to FY2017. It also allocated $105 million for the National Health Service Corps to improve access to opioid and substance use disorder treatment in rural areas. Additionally, $100 million was appropriated for a new Rural Communities Opioids Response program within HRSA's Rural Health account. The FY2018 omnibus provided $7.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for CDC, with $911 million more than FY2017 funding. It did not direct any PHS tap funds to CDC but supplemented with $801 million in PPHF transfers and $240 million from the HHS Nonrecurring fund. The FY2018 omnibus directed $240 million from the HHS Nonrecurring Expenses Fund to the CDC Buildings and Facilities account for a new Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Additionally, the omnibus provided $649 million for the Injury Prevention and Control account, an increase of $363 million from FY2017. The FY2018 omnibus allocated $649 million for Injury Prevention and Control, with $476 million designated for Opioid Prescription Drug Overdose prevention. CDC was instructed to use these funds to address the opioid epidemic nationwide. Additionally, $36.2 billion was provided for NIH, $2.9 billion more than FY2017. In FY2018, the PHS tap transfers to NIH increased by $98.4 million (+11.9%) from FY2017, with the entirety going to NIGMS. There was also a $36.1 million (+2%) increase in discretionary appropriations. All NIH Institutes and Centers received funding increases compared to FY2017, with the largest percentage increases going to NIDA, NIA, and NINDS. The omnibus reserved $250 million each for research on opioid addiction within the amounts appropriated to NINDS and NIDA. In FY2018, the omnibus reserved $250 million each for research on opioid addiction at NINDS and NIDA. Additionally, $1.8 billion was directed for Alzheimer's research, representing a $414 million increase from FY2017. The FY2018 discretionary total of $36.2 billion included $496 million for the NIH Innovation Account, with $300 million transferred to the National Cancer Institute. In FY2018, the omnibus allocated $300 million from the Innovation Account to the National Cancer Institute for cancer research, $43 million each to NINDS and NIMH for the BRAIN Initiative, $100 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and $10 million for regenerative medicine research. The FY2018 omnibus provided $5.0 billion for SAMHSA, a significant increase from FY2017 funding levels. Additionally, $134 million in PHS evaluation tap funding and $12 million in PPHF funding were directed to SAMHSA. The FY2018 omnibus provided increases to every SAMHSA account, including $1.0 billion for a new State Opioid Response Grants program. $2.0 million is directed to the National Academy of Sciences for a review of outcomes achieved by CARA. This funding is in addition to the $500 million for the State Targeted Response program authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act. The FY2018 omnibus provided $334 million in discretionary budget authority to AHRQ, a 3% increase from FY2017. AHRQ was funded as its own operating division, separate from NIH, rejecting the President's proposal to consolidate it. The omnibus did not direct any PHS tap transfers to AHRQ, in contrast to previous years. The President's FY2018 request had proposed zero funding for AHRQ. The FY2018 omnibus provided $4.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for CMS, with a slight increase from FY2017 funding. Additionally, $745 million was appropriated for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account, slightly less than the President's budget request. The FY2018 omnibus provided $3.7 billion for the CMS Program Management account, supporting various CMS program operations and activities related to Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA. This amount was the same as proposed by the Senate committee bill, higher than the President's budget (+2.3%), and the House committee bill (+6.3%). The FY2018 omnibus bill authorized HHS to transfer funds from the Medicare trust funds to support Medicare program activities, with a limit of $305 million. The bill also included a provision preventing funds from being used for ACA implementation. Additionally, the omnibus retained a provision preventing funds from being used for risk corridor payments associated with health insurance exchanges. The FY2018 omnibus bill authorized HHS to transfer funds from the Medicare trust funds to support Medicare program activities, with a limit of $305 million. It also included a provision preventing funds from being used for ACA implementation and retained a provision preventing funds from being used for risk corridor payments associated with health insurance exchanges. Total FY2018 discretionary appropriations for ACF were $22.9 billion, a $3.6 billion increase over FY2017 funding levels. The House and Senate committee bills proposed reductions relative to FY2017, while the President's budget would have decreased ACF discretionary funding by roughly one-quarter. The FY2018 omnibus bill increased discretionary appropriations for ACF by $3.6 billion. The President's budget proposed a one-quarter reduction in funding, mainly by eliminating certain programs like LIHEAP, Preschool Development Grants, and CSBG. However, these programs were not eliminated in the final omnibus. The increase in funding was primarily directed towards the Child Care and Development Block Grant, with a significant boost of $2.4 billion to support the full implementation of the CCDBG Act. Funding for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance Programs increased by $190 million in the FY2018 omnibus bill, with a focus on the Unaccompanied Alien Children program receiving a significant boost. Additionally, the FY2018 omnibus provided $2.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for ACL, an increase of $178 million from FY2017. In FY2018, the omnibus bill allocated $178 million more to ACL, with $28 million directed to PPHF transfers for specific programs like Alzheimer's Disease, chronic disease self-management, and elder falls prevention. The bill also proposed streamlining ACL's Alzheimer's disease programs into a single program. Annual LHHS appropriations acts commonly include restrictions on controversial issues like the use of federal funds for abortions. The LHHS appropriations acts commonly include provisions limiting the use of federal funds for abortions, human embryos for research, needle exchange programs, and gun control advocacy. These provisions restrict the circumstances under which LHHS funds can be used for abortions, allowing funding only in cases of endangerment to the mother, rape, or incest. Federal programs and entities receiving LHHS funding are prohibited from discriminating against those that do not provide or pay for abortions. The FY2018 omnibus bill retained restrictions on LHHS funds for abortions, human embryo research, and needle exchange programs. Additionally, a proposed provision based on the Health Care Conscience Rights Act was not enacted. Starting in FY2016, LHHS appropriations allowed funds to be used for needle exchange programs under specific conditions: federal funds cannot purchase needles, the jurisdiction must show a need for the program, and it must comply with state and local laws. The FY2018 omnibus bill maintained these restrictions. Gun Control and ACA Implementation: The FY2018 omnibus bill retained existing restrictions on gun control advocacy and promotion using CDC and other agencies' funds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services clarified that the CDC can still conduct research on the causes of gun violence despite the funding restrictions. Additionally, restrictions on ACA implementation have been in place since FY2011. Restrictions on ACA Implementation: Since FY2011, annual LHHS appropriations have included provisions limiting the ability of HHS to implement aspects of the ACA. The FY2018 House committee bill contained provisions prohibiting funds for health insurance \"navigator\" programs and implementing any provision of the ACA. The FY2018 House committee bill included provisions limiting HHS's ability to implement aspects of the ACA, with exceptions, and prohibiting funds from offsetting collections derived from fees collected from qualified plans. The Senate committee bill did not have similar provisions. Amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and do not include mandatory funds provided outside the annual appropriations process. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) was established in 1980 to promote student achievement and equal access to education. Three-quarters of ED's budget goes to local educational agencies and Pell Grants for low-income postsecondary students. The remaining funds support various activities such as minority-serving institutions and educational research. The federal government contributes about 7% of overall funding for elementary and secondary education in the United States. Overall, the majority of school funding for elementary and secondary education in the United States comes from states and local districts. The federal government provides about 61% of undergraduate and graduate student aid for higher education. Discretionary funds make up the majority of the U.S. Department of Education's annual appropriations, with FY2018 discretionary ED appropriations being 3.9% higher than FY2017 levels. Proposed discretionary ED appropriations for FY2018 would have decreased under the President's budget and the House committee bill, and only marginally increased under the Senate committee. The Student Support and Academic Enrichment State Grants, funded within the School Improvement Programs account, provide formula grants to state educational agencies and LEAs to improve school conditions, technology use, and academic achievement for students. The Title IV-A block grant provides funding for LEAs to support well-rounded educational opportunities, safe and healthy students, and effective use of technology. Grants of $30,000 or more require funds to be used in all three categories, while grants under $30,000 only require funds to be used in one category. The FY2018 appropriation for the program was $1.1 billion, a significant increase from the previous year. The program is authorized at $1.6 billion for FY2018. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program, authorized at $1.6 billion for FY2018, provides loans to students for postsecondary education expenses. One program under it is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, where borrowers in public service jobs can have their remaining loan balance forgiven after 10 years of full-time employment and 120 qualifying monthly payments. The FY2018 omnibus established a new activity within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program Account, authorizing loan cancellations for eligible borrowers who would qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness but made nonqualifying payments. $350 million was appropriated for loan cancellations, available until expended, on a first-come, first-served basis. The House and Senate committee bills for FY2018 did not recommend funds for a specific activity, which was also not requested by the President. The amounts mentioned are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and do not include funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Table 10 shows proposed and enacted funding levels for LHHS related agencies in FY2018, compared to FY2017 levels. Discretionary funds typically make up about 20% of total appropriations for LHHS. The FY2018 omnibus bill increased discretionary funding for LHHS related agencies by 2.8%, with the largest share going to the Social Security Administration (SSA). SSA usually receives about 97% of total appropriations to related agencies in the LHHS bill, with the majority supporting the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. The Social Security Administration (SSA) received 84.8% of discretionary appropriations for LHHS related agencies in the FY2018 omnibus bill. Most of SSA's funding is used to administer Social Security and SSI programs. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is the next-largest agency in terms of appropriations, receiving about 1.6% of total LHHS appropriations in FY2018. Other related agencies typically receive less than $1 billion from the annual LHHS appropriations bill. The CNCS received $1.1 billion in funding in FY2018, a $34 million increase from FY2017. The President's budget proposed a significant decrease in funding, but both the House and Senate committee bills rejected this. The SSA LAE account provides administrative funding for SSA's programs. The SSA LAE account received $12.9 billion in FY2018, with $1.7 billion dedicated to program integrity activities. Funding for LAE saw varying proposals, with the President's request lower than FY2017, the House committee bill decreasing by $92 million, and the Senate committee bill decreasing by $492 million. The LAE account received $1.7 billion for program integrity activities in FY2018, with $1.5 billion in cap adjustment funding. The total program integrity funding for FY2018 was $84 million less than FY2017. The NLRB enforces provisions in the NLRA. The FY2018 omnibus maintained funding for the NLRB at $274 million, with the House committee bill proposing a $25 million decrease. The omnibus retained a provision prohibiting the NLRB from issuing a directive for electronic voting in collective bargaining elections. The bill did not include House committee proposals to restrict funds for enforcing the NLRA against Indian tribes. The FY2018 omnibus bill maintained funding for the NLRB at $274 million and included provisions prohibiting certain uses of funds related to the NLRA and joint employer standards. The budget enforcement framework includes discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester from the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) sets procedural elements for budget resolution, limiting discretionary spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123) altered budget enforcement requirements for discretionary spending. The Budget Control Act (BCA) provides budget process and sequestration measures. The Budget Control Act (BCA) provides mechanisms to reduce mandatory and discretionary spending through sequestration. Reductions in mandatory spending occur between FY2013-FY2027, while discretionary spending reductions are achieved through lower spending limits from FY2014-FY2021. Discretionary spending is only sequestered if statutory limits are breached, with the LHHS bill funding falling under the nondefense category. President Trump issued the FY2018 budget on May 23, 2017. President Trump issued the FY2018 sequestration order, calling for reductions in nonexempt mandatory spending on October 1, 2017. The Office of Management and Budget estimated a total reduction of $17 billion in FY2018, with specific percentages for Medicare and other nondefense mandatory spending. The FY2018 statutory spending limits for defense and nondefense spending were also presented in the OMB FY2018 Sequestration Preview Report. Additionally, the BBA 2018 was enacted on February 9, 2018. The BBA 2018, enacted on February 9, 2018 (H.R. 1892; P.L. 115-123), extended the mandatory spending sequester through FY2027 and increased the discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. The new limits were $629 billion for defense (+$80 billion) and $579 billion for nondefense (+$63 billion). The BCA allows for adjustments to discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and BBA 2018 amended spending limits to accommodate program integrity initiatives at HHS, SSA, and DOL. Adjustments were made for work-related disability reviews, fraud prosecutions, and reemployment services. The BBA 2018 extended mandatory spending sequester through FY2027 and increased discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense. The 21st Century Cures Act included budget enforcement procedures related to discretionary spending limits for the NIH Innovation Account and the Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis. Appropriations from these accounts are subtracted from cost estimates for budget controls. The Cures Act exempted certain programs from sequestration, including Medicaid, health care trust funds, Supplemental Security Income, and others. Additionally, it subjected some programs to special rules under sequestration. The bill includes programs subject to special rules under sequestration, such as unemployment compensation, student loans, health centers, and parts of Medicare. The Budget Resolution and 302(b) Suballocations process sets limits on discretionary budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year, dividing it among 12 subcommittees. These subcommittee-level spending limits, known as 302(b) suballocations, restrict the budget authority available for agencies, projects, and activities under their jurisdiction. The 302(b) suballocations process sets limits on discretionary budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year, dividing it among 12 subcommittees. The House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2018, leading to the adoption of interim suballocations by the House Appropriations Committee and funding guidance by the Senate Appropriations Committee. These measures were not procedurally enforceable during the appropriations cycle. The House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2018, resulting in interim suballocations that were not procedurally enforceable. A budget resolution for FY2018 was eventually adopted in October 2017. The Senate reported its suballocations in March 2018, while the House has not reported any as of the date of the report. Table A-1 displays funding levels for LHHS discretionary funding for FY2017 and FY2018. The House initially proposed decreasing LHHS appropriations by $5.0 billion, while the Senate wanted to increase them by $3.0 billion compared to FY2017. The final enacted appropriations ended up being $16.1 billion higher than the previous year. The table also includes funding for adjustments to discretionary spending limits under the BCA, such as program integrity activities and emergency requirements. Compliance with spending allocations is based on current-year budget authority adjusted by CBO scorekeeping. Note that totals in the table may not be directly comparable to other figures in the report. The LHHS appropriations include current-year budget authority, excluding advance appropriations for future years but including advance appropriations from prior years. Total budget authority available for obligation in the fiscal year is shown in Table A-2, with amounts reflecting appropriations regardless of the year they were first provided. The FY2017 enacted column includes budget authority from the FY2016 omnibus, while the FY2018 columns include budget authority from the FY2017 omnibus. The LHHS appropriations in H.R. 3354 were affected by delays in the FY2018 President's budget release, leading to the bill being amended on the House floor and passed on September 14, 2017. No further action was taken on H.R. 3354. The FY2018 President's budget release was delayed due to the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. Final FY2017 appropriations were not enacted until May 5, 2017. The House decided to consider and amend the 12 appropriations bills in two omnibus packages. The House passed two omnibus packages for FY2018 appropriations, with the LHHS Appropriations Act included in the second package, H.R. 3354. A special rule, H.Res. 504, was used to consider LHHS-related amendments, with 35 out of 52 amendments adopted.

A special rule, H.Res. 504, was used to consider LHHS-related amendments, with 35 out of 52 amendments adopted. These amendments aimed to increase funding for certain activities while decreasing administration funding at the department level. For example, cuts were proposed for the HHS General Department Management and ED Program Administration accounts, potentially affecting how LHHS activities were carried out."
