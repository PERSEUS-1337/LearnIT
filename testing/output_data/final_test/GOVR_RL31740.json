    "content": "The Cuban government released six political prisoners, including Raul Rivero and Oscar Espinosa Chepe, and transferred additional dissidents to the main prison hospital in Havana, possibly indicating more releases. The move is seen as an effort to improve relations with Europe. The FY2005 omnibus appropriations bill dropped provisions easing Cuba sanctions and fully funded $27.6 million for Cuba broadcasting and $9 million for Cuba projects. On November 12, 2004, the Treasury Department instructed U.S. banks to stop transfers of funds to U.S. companies for sales of agricultural and medical products to Cuba. This move was to ensure compliance with the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. There are concerns that this action could impact U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba, which totaled $320 million in the first nine months of 2004. Additionally, Fidel Castro announced on October 25, 2004, that U.S. dollars would no longer be accepted in entities that currently use them. As of November 14, Cubans need to exchange their dollars for \"convertible pesos\" with a 10% surcharge. The Senate approved a bill providing $5 million for cooperation with Cuban government on counter-narcotics. The House approved provisions easing sanctions on family travel, educational activities, and private commercial sales to Cuba. The Bush Administration has threatened a veto if Cuba sanctions are weakened. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a provision to prohibit funds for enforcing travel restrictions. The Administration has also raised concerns about Cuba's bio-weapons program. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a provision directing the Secretary of the Treasury to allow travel to Cuba for commercial sale of agricultural and medical products. The U.S. offered $50,000 in aid after Hurricane Charley, but Cuba rejected it. On July 22, 2004, the Cuban government released political prisoner Marta Beatriz Roque for health reasons, along with 10 other political prisoners. President Bush suspended the right to file lawsuits against those benefitting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. The House approved a bill prohibiting counternarcotics assistance for Cuba in FY2005. The House Appropriations Committee expressed full support for the Administration's $9 million request for projects in Cuba promoting democratization, human rights, and a free market economy. U.S. Coast Guard regulations now require permits for U.S. vessels entering Cuban waters. The House approved a bill prohibiting funds for new restrictions on gift parcels and baggage for travelers to Cuba. On June 25, 2004, the Treasury Department delayed tightened travel restrictions for family visits and fully-hosted travel to Cuba until August 1, 2004. The Department of Commerce also published new regulations limiting gift parcels and personal baggage going to Cuba, excluding items like seeds, clothing, and veterinary supplies. On June 16, 2004, OFAC implemented regulations tightening travel restrictions to Cuba, including restrictions on educational travel, family visits, and remittances. The regulations delayed implementation for family visits and fully-hosted travel until August 1, 2004, and allowed educational activities planned before June 30 to proceed until August 15, 2004. President Bush endorsed recommendations to tighten economic sanctions on Cuba, including restricting family visits, cash remittances, and gift parcels. UNCHR approved a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. Interested parties can comment on regulations until August 16, 2004. Educational activities planned before June 30 can proceed until August 15, 2004. The Senate approved S.Res. 328 urging Cuba to release political prisoners and condemning its human rights abuses. Under Secretary of State John Bolton warned of Cuba's terrorist and biological weapons threat to the United States. President Bush ordered the Department of Homeland Security to expand policing of waters between Florida and Cuba to stop pleasure boating traffic. The State Department condemned Cuba's imprisonment of journalists, librarians, and human rights defenders, citing poor conditions and lack of medical treatment for political prisoners. Bush also suspended the right to file lawsuits against those benefitting from confiscated property for another six months. The State Department cancelled U.S.-Cuba migration talks in 2004 due to Cuba's refusal to discuss issues. Despite some economic reforms, Cuba remains a communist state under Fidel Castro's rule since the 1959 revolution. Castro established an authoritarian regime by consolidating power. Fidel Castro laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime in Cuba by consolidating power and proclaiming himself a Marxist-Leninist. He ruled by decree from 1959 until 1976, with the Communist Party as the leading force in the state. Executive power was vested in a Council of Ministers headed by Castro, while legislative authority resided in a National Assembly of People's Power. In October 1997, the Cuban Communist Party reaffirmed its commitment to a single-party state and reelected Fidel and Raul Castro as the party's first and second secretaries. Direct elections for the National Assembly were held in January 1998 and 2003 without offering a choice of candidates. In response to the Varela Project, a human rights initiative, a national referendum in June 2002 declared Cuba's socialist system as irrevocable. The Constitution was amended to state that socialism and the revolutionary system are permanent, and Cuba will not return to capitalism. Observers are divided over the future of the Castro government, with some predicting its collapse after Fidel Castro's reign due to his age, while others believe he may remain in power for years with a succession plan in place for his brother Raul. Cuba's strong security apparatus and controls on dissidents, along with support from the elite and the population's lack of alternative to Castro, contribute to the regime's stability. The possibility of Castro's overthrow or resignation raises questions about the country's future. Building a democratic Cuba after Castro's potential overthrow or resignation is seen as a challenging task due to the government's suppression of civil society and human rights. Despite hopes for change after the Pope's visit in 1998, the government continues to crackdown on dissent and restrict basic rights. Since the Pope's visit in January 1998, the Cuban government has persistently targeted human rights activists and dissidents. In March 2003, a crackdown led to the imprisonment of 75 journalists and activists, with some receiving lengthy sentences. The government executed three men in April 2003 after a controversial trial for hijacking a ferry. Despite releasing some prisoners in 2004, the government continued to harass activists and detain dissidents, with an estimated 300-400 political prisoners. In late November 2004, the Cuban government began releasing political prisoners, including Oscar Espinosa Chepe, Margarito Broche, Marcelo Lopez, Raul Rivero, Oswaldo Alfonso Valdes, and Edel Jos\u00e9 Garcia. Up to 18 additional dissidents were transferred to the main prison hospital in Havana, often a sign of imminent release. The State Department's human rights report on Cuba highlights ongoing harassment and imprisonment of human rights advocates, journalists, economists, doctors, and lawyers by Cuban authorities. The Cuban government has been accused of suppressing political opposition and dissent, maintaining a pervasive system of surveillance, and mistreating prisoners. International human rights groups have expressed concern about the health of political prisoners, with reports of restricted medical care as a method of control. The State Department's 2003 human rights report on Cuba and Amnesty International's reports on the status of dissidents imprisoned in March 2003 highlight the severe crackdown on human rights in Cuba. Florida State University's Center for the Advancement of Human Rights also began publishing information on the dissidents online. The Center for the Advancement of Human Rights started sharing information about Cuban dissidents online, including sentencing documents. Human Rights Watch also reports on the human rights situation in Cuba. In 2003, there was a significant crackdown on human rights, with activists like Elizardo Sanchez calling it the most intense repression in Cuba's history. Dozens of supporters of the Varela Project were harassed, jailed, and expelled from various institutions. Two members of Oswaldo Paya's Christian Liberation Movement, Jesus Mustafa Felipe and Robert Montero, were sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt and resisting arrest. In March 2003, the Cuban government cracked down on independent journalists, librarians, labor union leaders, and democracy activists, arresting 75 individuals. They were subjected to summary trials and received prison sentences ranging from 6 to 28 years. Foreign journalists and diplomats were excluded from the trials. Notable activists sentenced included Raul Rivero, Oscar Espinosa Chepe, and Omar Rodr\u00edguez Saludes. In April 2003, several democracy activists in Cuba were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, ranging from 20 to 28 years. Additionally, three men involved in a ferry hijacking were executed, while others received life sentences or long prison terms. In April 2003, democracy activists in Cuba were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, ranging from 20 to 28 years. The ferry hijacking was preceded by the hijacking of two small planes to the United States. International human rights groups and foreign countries condemned the crackdown and executions. The EU postponed consideration of Cuba's application for the Cotonou Agreement due to human rights concerns. The U.N. and OAS Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Expression expressed grave concern on the sentencing of the dissidents. In March and April 2003, the human rights situation in Cuba sharply deteriorated, leading to the sentencing of democracy activists to lengthy prison terms. The OAS expressed concern, while the United States strongly condemned the Cuban government's actions. Analysts suggest various reasons for the crackdown on activists by the Cuban government. The Cuban government justified its severe crackdown on democracy activists by claiming they were supported by the U.S. government. Analysts believe the crackdown was a message that Cuba will not tolerate U.S. support for the opposition. Others see it as Castro's attempt to strengthen political control due to economic challenges. The crackdown may also be aimed at eliminating potential opposition to ensure regime succession. The Cuban government's crackdown on democracy activists is seen as a move to eliminate potential opposition and ensure a smooth succession for Raul Castro. Some believe the crackdown is a response to perceived threats to the regime, while others think it is a way to prevent any easing of U.S. policy towards Cuba. The Varela Project, a human rights initiative, is also mentioned in the context. The Varela Project in Cuba, led by Oswaldo Paya, aims to collect signatures for a national plebiscite advocating for human rights, political prisoner amnesty, private enterprise, and electoral law changes for free elections. Over 11,000 signatures were submitted to the National Assembly in 2002, surpassing the required amount. Former President Jimmy Carter acknowledged the initiative. The Varela Project in Cuba, led by Oswaldo Paya, collected over 11,000 signatures for a national plebiscite advocating for human rights and democratic reforms. Despite government crackdowns, the initiative persisted, with Paya delivering more signatures to the National Assembly in 2003. In September 2003, President Bush determined that Cuba did not comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons. Cuba is a country of internal trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor, with child sexual victims being teenage girls aged 14 to 17. The Cuban government does not publicly address the issue, which largely occurs in the context of tourism. Cuban officials categorize allegations of sex tourism as absurd and an insult to national dignity. President Bush accused Castro of welcoming sex tourism for hard currency, which Castro denied. Prostitution increased in the 1990s but the government cracked down on it around 1996. UNCHR resolutions called for investigation into human rights in Cuba, but Cuba refused to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur. The UNCHR annually approved resolutions condemning Cuba's human rights record, but Cuba refused to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur. In 1998, the UNCHR rejected a resolution sponsored by the United States to condemn Cuba's rights record. From 1999-2004, annual resolutions criticizing Cuba's human rights record were approved by the UNCHR. The UNCHR approved a resolution calling on Cuba to improve its human rights record, with support from various nations including the Czech Republic, Poland, the United States, and several Latin American countries. Mexico abstained but expressed concerns about human rights in Cuba under the new Fox administration. The UNCHR approved a resolution urging Cuba to improve its human rights record, with support from various nations including Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. Brazil and Ecuador abstained, while Venezuela and Cuba voted against the resolution. The 2002 resolution recognized Cuba's efforts in social rights but called for progress in civil and political rights. Efforts to express deep concern about a 2003 crackdown failed. Cuba refused to accept a visit from the UNCHR representative. The UNCHR approved a resolution in April 2004, sponsored by Honduras and co-sponsored by other countries, urging Cuba to cooperate with the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights. Congress has also condemned the human rights situation in Cuba, with resolutions passed in response to the crackdown on journalists and activists in 2003. In 2003, the House and Senate approved resolutions condemning the crackdown on democracy activists in Cuba and calling for the release of political prisoners. The Senate also called on international bodies to address the human rights situation in Cuba. In 2004, the Senate passed a resolution expressing concern over ongoing human rights violations by the Cuban government. The resolution urged Cuba to release political prisoners and allow inspections by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Hearings were held in the 108th Congress on human rights abuses in Cuba, including one on \"Castro's Brutal Crackdown on Dissidents\" in April 2003. Other hearings followed in October 2003 and June 2004 on ongoing human rights violations in Cuba. Numerous resolutions have been introduced on the issue. Several resolutions have been introduced in the 108th Congress addressing human rights abuses in Cuba, including H.R. 1201 to revoke naturalization for individuals responsible for violations. Other resolutions like H.Res. 208 condemn UN member states for renewing Cuba's membership on the UN Commission on Human Rights. S.Res. 146 calls for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against humanity by Cuban leaders. H.Res. 563 addresses the one-year anniversary of Cuba's human rights crackdown. The 108th Congress introduced resolutions addressing human rights abuses in Cuba, including revoking naturalization for violators and condemning UN member states for renewing Cuba's membership on the UN Commission on Human Rights. Congress also funds democracy and human rights projects for Cuba. Cuba experienced severe economic decline from 1989-1993 but has seen improvement since 1994, with growth rates averaging 3.7% annually from 1994-2000. In 2001 and 2002, economic growth in Cuba slowed due to Hurricane Michelle and the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. The tourist industry was severely affected, with hotels closing and restaurants empty. Low world prices for sugar and nickel, along with Venezuela's suspension of oil shipments, contributed to the economic slowdown. Economic growth in 2004 could be impacted by a drought in eastern Cuba and hurricanes causing damage in western Cuba. Cuba takes pride in its accomplishments in health and education. Cuba takes pride in its achievements in health and education, with high literacy and life expectancy rates. However, economic decline has led to shortages in medical supplies. In response to the economic crisis, Cuba began implementing market-oriented reforms in 1993, allowing for self-employment and the use of U.S. dollars. Cuban economic reforms in the 1990s included diversifying occupations, breaking up state farms, opening agricultural and artisan markets, legalizing private food catering, allowing foreign investments, and establishing free trade zones. Despite economic reforms in the 1990s, Cuba still faces challenges such as low wages, high prices, shortages of medicines, and power outages. The government's new regulations and taxes have made it difficult for self-employed individuals, leading to the closure of some home restaurants. Foreign investors have also faced difficulties, with some complaining about deals being canceled or being forced out of business. In 2004, the government restricted the use of dollars by state companies, causing concerns about the country's economic direction. In 2004, Fidel Castro announced the end of using U.S. dollars in Cuba, requiring Cubans to exchange them for \"convertible pesos\" with a 10% surcharge. Dollar bank accounts could still be used but new deposits were not allowed. This move was seen as a reversal of economic reform measures and highlighted the historically tense relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban missile crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, the 1994 exodus, and the 1996 shootdown of U.S. planes. Sanctions were strengthened with the Cuban Democracy Act. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, imposed stronger economic sanctions on Cuba. The Helms/Burton legislation includes measures to increase pressure on Cuba and provides for assistance once Cuba transitions to democracy. It holds liable anyone trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government for monetary damages in U.S. federal court. The Helms/Burton legislation imposes economic sanctions on Cuba and holds liable anyone trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government for monetary damages in U.S. federal court. U.S. policy also includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for agricultural exports to Cuba with restrictions on financing. The Clinton Administration made changes to U.S. policy after the Pope's visit to Cuba in 1998 to bolster support for the Cuban people. In 1999, President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including broadening cash remittances, expanding direct passenger charter flights from more U.S. cities, and increasing people-to-people contact. The Bush Administration continued the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba through economic sanctions while supporting the Cuban people through various measures. They emphasized stronger enforcement of sanctions and tightened restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian aid parcels to Cuba. President Bush made a statement on his administration's Cuba policy in May 2001. President Bush announced a new initiative on Cuba in May 2002, including measures to facilitate humanitarian assistance and support democratic change in Cuba. He also emphasized the importance of upholding and enforcing sanctions to prevent unauthorized travel and ensure aid reaches pro-democracy activists. President Bush's initiative on Cuba in May 2002 aimed to facilitate humanitarian assistance and support democratic change. He proposed measures such as providing direct aid through NGOs, calling for the resumption of mail service, and offering scholarships to Cuban students and professionals. The President stated that easing sanctions would depend on Cuba's efforts towards free elections and market reforms, but full normalization of relations would require a democratic government, respect for the rule of law, and protection of human rights. The initiative did not include tighter travel restrictions as some had anticipated. President Bush announced initiatives in October 2003 to hasten the arrival of a new, free, democratic Cuba. These initiatives included increasing inspections of travelers and shipments to and from Cuba, increasing the number of new Cuban immigrants each year, improving refugee identification, processing Cubans seeking to leave Cuba, and launching a public information campaign on safe and legal migration routes to the United States. In 2004, the Bush Administration tightened U.S. sanctions against Cuba by strengthening travel restrictions, blocking assets of foreign companies, and expanding policing of waters between Florida and Cuba to stop pleasure boating traffic. In March 2004, the State Department announced visa denials for Cubans involved in \"show trials\" of dissidents in 2003. President Bush endorsed recommendations to hasten the end of Cuba's dictatorship and committed up to $59 million for democracy-building activities and airborne broadcasts. The State Department announced visa denials for Cubans involved in \"show trials\" of dissidents in 2003. President Bush endorsed recommendations to hasten the end of Cuba's dictatorship and committed funds for activities to empower Cuban civil society, airborne broadcasts to break the information blockade, and public diplomacy efforts to disseminate information about Cuba abroad. Tightened economic sanctions were also recommended, including restrictions on family visits, travel, remittances, and gift parcels. Treasury Department regulations implementing these restrictions went into effect in June 2004. The Commerce Department issued regulations on gift parcels and luggage weight limits for family visits to Cuba, effective June 30, 2004. Various approaches have been proposed to achieve the objective of promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba, including maintaining pressure on the Cuban government while supporting the Cuban people. Some advocate for lifting U.S. sanctions on Cuba to promote peaceful change and avoid violent upheaval. They argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could plant seeds of reform in Cuba. Supporters of changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue for lifting the embargo, citing international support, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. They believe a more realistic approach is needed to induce change and promote human rights. On the other hand, opponents maintain that the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best way to achieve political change. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 outlines steps for Cuba to normalize relations with the U.S. Opponents argue that softening U.S. policy without Cuban reforms would benefit the Castro regime. They believe sustained sanctions can work and blame Cuba's economic policies for its decline, not the U.S. embargo. The Act was enacted into law on March 12, 1996. The Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (P.L. 104-114) was enacted into law on March 12, 1996. Title I, Section 102(h) codifies existing Cuban embargo executive orders and regulations without a presidential waiver. This limits changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba until democratic conditions are met. Title III allows U.S. nationals to sue for damages in federal court against those trafficking in confiscated Cuban property, with the President able to delay implementation for national interest. President Clinton utilized a provision to delay individuals from filing suits against those benefiting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba for six months at a time to expedite a transition to democracy. The first suspension occurred in July 1996, allowing liability for trafficking under Title III to take effect on November 1, 1996. Foreign companies in Cuba were warned of potential lawsuits and liability in the U.S. The second suspension in January 1997 was contingent on America's allies' efforts to promote democracy in Cuba. President Bush continued to suspend the implementation of Title III at six-month intervals, most recently on July 16, 2004. This decision was justified by Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega citing examples of countries condemning Cuba for its human rights crackdown in 2003. Title IV of the law denies admission to the United States to aliens involved in the confiscation of U.S. property in Cuba. The provision in the law denies admission to the United States for individuals involved in the confiscation or trafficking of U.S. property in Cuba. The State Department has banned executives and their families from three companies for investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. In 1997, Grupos Domos disinvested from U.S.-claimed property in Cuba, allowing its executives to enter the United States. STET, an Italian telecommunications company, avoided action by agreeing to pay $25 million to ITT Corporation for property use in Cuba. Sol Melia, a Spanish hotel company, was investigated for investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. SuperClubs resort chain disinvested from two Cuban hotels in 2004. The State Department advised a hotel chain to disinvest from Cuban properties due to confiscated U.S. property issues. U.S. allies criticized the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act for its extraterritorial application of U.S. law. The EU challenged the Helms/Burton legislation at the WTO as an extraterritorial application of U.S. law. The EU challenged the Helms/Burton legislation at the WTO as an extraterritorial application of U.S. law. A settlement was reached on April 11, 1997, where both sides agreed to promote democracy in Cuba and develop investment protection principles. The EU suspended its WTO dispute case and negotiations with the U.S. on investment disciplines were challenging. The EU and the United States reached a second understanding on May 18, 1998, regarding investment in expropriated properties worldwide. Future investment in expropriated property would be barred, and government support for past illegal expropriations would be denied. A Registry of Claims would be established to warn investors and government agencies. Opposition to the agreement has prevented any amendment of Title IV in Congress. The Bush Administration faced challenges in amending Title IV of the Helms/Burton legislation, with efforts to secure waiver authority for provisions related to Cuba. A potential arrangement with the EU involved a stronger policy stance towards Cuba in exchange for waiver authority. Additionally, a dispute in the World Trade Organization between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. highlighted issues related to Cuban exports. Ricard entered a joint venture with the Cuban government to produce and export Havana Club rum, but Bacardi claims rights to the name. A provision in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure prevents the US from accepting payment for trademark registrations from Cuban or foreign nationals connected to confiscated assets in Cuba without the original owner's consent. Pernod Ricard aims to protect future distribution rights for Havana Club. After Bacardi started selling rum under the Havana Club label in the US, Pernod Ricard's joint venture faced challenges. In a joint venture with the Cuban government, PernodRicard unsuccessfully challenged Bacardi in U.S. federal court over the use of the Havana Club name. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled against the joint venture, leading to a WTO dispute settlement panel initiated by the EU in 2000. The panel's ruling in 2001 was described as mixed, with both sides claiming partial victory. The EU appealed a ruling in 2001 that found a portion of the law prohibiting U.S. courts from recognizing Cuban trademarks violated TRIPS. The WTO appeals panel in 2002 upheld the U.S. position on trademark ownership criteria but also found that the law violated WTO provisions on national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment. The United States violated WTO provisions on national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment with Section 211, requiring legislative action to comply. The deadline for compliance has been extended multiple times, with two approaches proposed to amend Section 211. Advocates argue for repealing Section 211, which endangers trademarks of U.S. companies in Cuba. Bills in the 108th Congress aim to repeal this provision, along with other legislative initiatives to lift the trade embargo on Cuba. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to repeal the Section 211 trademark provision, with efforts to ensure it applies to all parties regardless of nationality. However, plans to add a remedy to the Department of Defense authorization measure were abandoned due to opposition. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the Section 211 trademark issue, with advocates for a narrow fix and repeal of Section 211. U.S. sanctions allow medical and food exports to Cuba with restrictions. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows one-year export licenses for food and medicine to Cuba, but no U.S. government assistance or financing is available. Transactions must be in cash or financed by third countries. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for food and medicine to Cuba, with transactions in cash or financed by third countries. After Hurricane Michelle in 2001, Cuba changed its policy and began importing agricultural products from the United States. The first shipments of goods arrived in mid-December 2001. In mid-December 2001, Cuba received its first direct food supplies from the United States since the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Subsequent purchases of agricultural products were made in March 2002. A U.S. Food & Agribusiness Exhibition in Havana in September 2002 showcased products from various states. Despite a denied license in June 2003, Cuba has bought over $700 million in agricultural goods from the U.S. since late 2001. Total U.S. exports to Cuba reached $7.1 billion. In 2001, Cuba received its first direct food supplies from the United States since the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Subsequent purchases of agricultural products were made in March 2002. U.S. exports to Cuba amounted to $7.1 million in 2001, $145.6 million in 2002, and $259 million in 2003, with the majority in agricultural products. By the first nine months of 2004, U.S. exports totaled about $321 million, mostly in agricultural products. However, on November 12, 2004, the Treasury Department instructed U.S. banks to stop transfers of funds to U.S. companies for sales of agricultural and medical products to Cuba, potentially jeopardizing millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. Supporters of easing restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba argue that the restrictions harm the health and nutrition of the Cuban population. They believe that the United States should continue to provide humanitarian donations to Cuba, as evidenced by the $4.3 billion in licensed donations since 1992. On the other hand, opponents of easing sanctions argue that it would support and prolong the Castro regime, urging the U.S. to remain steadfast in its opposition to easing pressure on Cuba. The U.S. government has licensed over $4.3 billion in humanitarian donations to Cuba since 1992, but only small amounts have been sent. Supporters of easing sanctions believe the embargo helps Castro blame the U.S. for his failed policies. U.S. agribusiness companies want trade restrictions on agricultural exports lifted to access a $700 million market near the U.S. Some agricultural exporters support continuing the prohibition on financing for exports to ensure payment, while others want to sell agriculture and farm equipment to Cuba. Legislative initiatives in the 107th Congress focused on easing restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba. The House-passed version of the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill included a provision to prevent sanctions on private commercial sales to Cuba. Some support lifting the prohibition on financing to help smaller U.S. companies expand purchases to Cuba rapidly. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations measure, P.L. 108-7 (H.J.Res. 2), did not include the House-passed provision from the 107th Congress to restrict funds for enforcing restrictions on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba. The White House threatened to veto any provisions weakening the embargo on Cuba. The Senate version of the FY2004 agriculture appropriations bill initially included a provision allowing travel to Cuba for commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods, but it was later dropped in conference. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act dropped a provision allowing travel to Cuba for commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods. Travel to Cuba is currently allowed under specific license approval by the Treasury Department. The Senate version of the FY2005 agriculture appropriations bill also included a provision for travel to Cuba under a general license for commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the provision for travel to Cuba for commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods. The FY2005 omnibus appropriations measure dropped provisions from both the House and Senate versions related to travel restrictions for commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods in Cuba. Several initiatives in the 108th Congress aimed to lift restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba, including bills like H.R. 187, H.R. 3422, H.R. 188, S. 403, and H.R. 1698. Some bills required congressional renewal of trade and travel restrictions with respect to Cuba, including those on food and medical exports. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious component in U.S. efforts to isolate the communist government of Fidel Castro for the past 40 years. Enforcement of U.S. restrictions on Cuba travel has increased under the Bush Administration, with tighter restrictions on travel and private remittances. In March 2003, travel for people-to-people educational exchanges unrelated to academic coursework was eliminated, and in June 2004, family travel was significantly restricted. In June 2004, the Bush Administration imposed stricter restrictions on travel to Cuba, limiting family visits to once every three years for immediate family members. Cash remittances were also further restricted, with quarterly remittances of $300 only allowed for immediate family members and not for certain government officials or members of the Cuban Communist Party. The regulations for travel to Cuba have been tightened, reducing the amount of remittances allowed to $300 and limiting gift parcels to immediate family members. Gift parcels can no longer include certain items like seeds, clothing, and fishing equipment. The authorized per diem for family visits has been reduced to $50 per day. Licensed travelers are no longer allowed to bring back merchandise to the United States, and fully-hosted travel is no longer permitted. The tightening of Cuba travel and remittance restrictions has sparked mixed reactions. Supporters believe it will cut off funds to the Cuban government, while opponents argue it will only cause more suffering for the Cuban people. Concerns have been raised about the consequences of the new restrictions, such as the status of U.S. students on full scholarships at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have also expressed concerns. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concerns about U.S. medical students in Havana facing challenges due to new OFAC regulations. OFAC eventually allowed the students to continue their studies for two years. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include aiding Cuban families and influencing conditions in Cuba, while arguments against it focus on supporting Castro's rule financially. In the first session of the 108th Congress, legislative initiatives were proposed to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on travel to Cuba. The provisions were dropped in the final appropriations act. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 2673 (H.Rept. 108-401) included Transportation-Treasury appropriations and omitted Cuba-related provisions from H.R. 2989 and H.R. 4754. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 2673, excluded Cuba-related provisions from H.R. 4754. A provision to ease Cuba travel sanctions was added by a Flake amendment but was not included in the FY2005 omnibus appropriations bill. The White House had threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. The Administration stated that the President would veto any measure weakening Cuba sanctions. S. 2806 and H.R. 5025 had provisions to ease Cuba sanctions, with the House approving amendments to restrict funds for enforcing restrictions on travel to Cuba. The House approved amendments to restrict funds for enforcing restrictions on travel to Cuba, including prohibiting funds for implementing sanctions on private commercial sales of agricultural and medical products to Cuba. Additionally, a rejected amendment would have broadly prohibited funds from enforcing the economic embargo of Cuba. Representative Jeff Flake announced he would not offer an amendment to prohibit funds from being used to administer certain activities related to Cuba. The Senate version of the FY2005 Agriculture appropriations bill had a provision allowing for travel to Cuba related to commercial sales of agricultural and medical products. The Administration threatened to veto the bill if it weakened Cuba sanctions, but the provision was ultimately not included in the final appropriations measure. Additionally, a bill introduced in the 108th Congress would have barred certain restrictions on travel and remittances imposed by the Administration. Several bills introduced in the 108th Congress aimed to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba, including S. 950, H.R. 2071, H.R. 3422, H.R. 188, S. 403, H.R. 1698, S. 2449, and H.R. 4457. These bills sought to remove various embargo restrictions, with some requiring congressional renewal of trade and travel restrictions with respect to Cuba due to concerns about drug trafficking through the country's waters and airspace. Cuban airspace used by traffickers for drug transport to the United States. Cuban government taking measures to combat drug trafficking, including legislation, training, and cooperation with other countries. Regional counternarcotics conference hosted by Cuba in 2001. Cooperation with the United States on anti-drug efforts on a case-by-case basis. The United States and Cuba have cooperated on anti-drug efforts since the 1970s. In 1996, Cuba assisted in seizing 6.6 tons of cocaine from a ship bound for Miami. Cooperation has increased since 1999, with improved communication links and the presence of a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana. The State Department reported increased coordination with Cuba on anti-drug efforts in March 2004. Despite some Cuban cooperation with the Coast Guard specialist, there were instances of unacceptable harassment. The report criticized Cuba for not providing an effective use of force policy and adequate resources for counternarcotics efforts. However, Cuba did provide information on suspect aircraft and vessels leading to U.S. drug seizures. In January 2002, Cuba deported a U.S. fugitive wanted on drug charges and arrested a convicted Colombian drug trafficker who escaped from jail in Alabama in 1992. Cooperation with the U.S. on law enforcement issues was on a case-by-case basis, not through a formal bilateral agreement. Cuba's willingness to work across the board on law enforcement issues was questioned by the U.S. State Department. In the second session of the 107th Congress, legislative initiatives diverged on Cuba and counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. The Senate bill allocated $3 million for preliminary work on counter-narcotics with Cuba, contingent on the President certifying Cuba's procedures to protect innocent life. Cuba's commitment to law enforcement cooperation with the U.S. was questioned due to providing safe haven to fugitives. In the 107th Congress, legislative initiatives diverged on Cuba and counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. The Senate bill allocated $3 million for preliminary work on counter-narcotics with Cuba, contingent on the President certifying Cuba's procedures to protect innocent life. Final action on the Foreign Operations measure was not completed before the end of the 107th Congress. The final version of the FY2003 omnibus appropriations measure in the 108th Congress did not include provisions on anti-drug cooperation with Cuba. The House and Senate differed on providing international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance to Cuba. The House version of the bill did not allocate funds for assistance to Cuba due to concerns about transparency and monitoring, while the Senate version included provisions for cooperation with Cuba on counter-narcotics matters. The House and Senate disagreed on providing international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance to Cuba. The Senate's bill included $5 million for preliminary work on cooperation with Cuba, contingent on Cuba having appropriate procedures in place to protect against loss of life during drug interdiction and no evidence of Cuban government involvement in drug trafficking. However, these provisions were not included in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. In FY2005, the House-passed foreign operations measure also included restrictions on International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Funds. The Senate's bill included $5 million for cooperation with Cuba on counter-narcotics, contingent on Cuba having procedures to protect against loss of life during drug interdiction and no evidence of Cuban government involvement in drug trafficking. However, these provisions were not included in the final FY2005 omnibus appropriations measure. Another legislative initiative introduced in the 108th Congress would have authorized negotiations with Cuba. The bill introduced in March 2003 authorized negotiations between the US and Cuba on illicit narcotics control efforts. Cuba was added to the State Department's terrorism list in 1982 due to alleged ties to terrorism, but Fidel Castro stated in 1992 that support for insurgents abroad was no longer happening. This change was influenced by the Soviet Union's breakup, leading to economic decline in Cuba. Cuba remains on the terrorism list according to the State Department's April 2004 report. According to the State Department's April 2004 report, Cuba remains on the terrorism list and has provided safe haven to members of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, including Basque ETA terrorists from Spain and Colombian insurgent groups FARC and ELN. Colombia has acknowledged and supported Cuba's mediation with the ELN. Cuba remains on the terrorism list and has provided safe haven to members of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, including Basque ETA terrorists from Spain and Colombian insurgent groups FARC and ELN. Supporters argue that there is ample evidence of Cuba supporting terrorism, while critics believe it is a Cold War holdover driven by domestic political considerations. Cuba's hostile reactions to U.S. after 9/11 attacks included calling the U.S. response \"fascist and terrorist\" and accusing the government of establishing \"unrestricted tyranny.\" Castro criticized the U.S. government as being run by \"extremists\" and warned of potential innocent casualties due to their actions. However, Cuba had a more subdued response to the U.S. decision to send captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. The Cuban government had a muted reaction to the U.S. decision to send captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to Guantanamo Bay. Cuba has expressed concerns about the treatment of terrorist suspects at the naval base. Cuba has been a victim of terrorist incidents in the past, including bombings in 1976 and 1997. In March 1999, individuals were sentenced for bombings, with Cuban officials alleging Cuban exiles funded the attacks. In 2000, anti-Castro activists were arrested in Panama for a plot to kill Fidel Castro, including Luis Posada Carriles linked to a 1976 airplane bombing. The activists were sentenced in 2004, pardoned by the Panamanian President in 2004, leading to Cuba breaking diplomatic relations with Panama. In 2002, the U.S. State Department accused Cuba of developing biological weapons, stating that Cuba has an offensive biological warfare research effort and has provided dual-use technology to rogue states. John Bolton called on Cuba to stop cooperation with rogue states and comply with the Biological Weapons Convention. The Cuban government denied allegations of developing biological weapons and accused the Bush Administration of justifying hard-line policies. Secretary of State Powell clarified that the US believes Cuba has the capability for research but has not claimed they possess such weapons. Former President Jimmy Carter criticized the Bush Administration for justifying hard-line policies during his trip to Cuba. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere held a hearing where Assistant Secretary of State Carl Ford stated that Cuba has a biological weapons effort, not a program. In late June 2003, concerns were raised about Cuba's capability to produce biological weapons, with reports stating that Undersecretary Bolton's assertions were not supported by sufficient intelligence. This dates back to the 1998 statement by then U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen expressing concerns about Cuba's potential to develop biological agents due to its biotechnology infrastructure. Cuba began building its biotechnology industry in the 1980s. Cuba developed its biotechnology industry in the 1980s, investing millions in the sector to produce vaccines and drugs. In 1999, GlaxoSmithKline partnered with Cuba to test a new meningitis vaccine. In 2003, a delegation visited Cuban biotechnology facilities. In 2004, Under Secretary of State John Bolton labeled Cuba a terrorist and biological weapons threat to the US. According to Bolton, the Bush Administration expressed concerns about Cuba developing biological weapons and supporting terrorism. However, intelligence reports on Cuba's BW program were deemed problematic. The Bush Administration later concluded that Cuba may not have an active offensive bio-weapons program. Additionally, several Cuban intelligence agents were arrested and convicted in the US. In 2001, members of the \"Wasp Network\" were convicted on espionage charges in Miami, with sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison. The Cuban government aims to bring back the spies labeled as \"Heroes of the Republic.\" A married couple also received prison terms for their involvement. Two U.S. officials were implicated in spying for Cuba, with one sentenced to five years in prison. In June 2001, Ana Montes, a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, was arrested for spying for Cuba. She provided classified information for 16 years, including names of U.S. intelligence agents and details on national defense. Montes pleaded guilty in March 2002 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In response, the U.S. expelled four Cuban diplomats in November 2002. In May 2003, the Bush Administration expelled 14 Cuban diplomats from the United States for espionage. Cuba denied their involvement in intelligence activities and criticized the action as an irrational act of vengeance. In December 2003, a third secretary of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington was also expelled. The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, established in 1903, remains under U.S. control according to a 1934 treaty. The Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, established in 1903, remains under U.S. control as per a 1934 treaty. The Cuban government initially assured respect for the treaty but later opposed the base's presence. The base's mission evolved during the Cold War, serving as a strategic location for various purposes. In 1994-1995, it housed Cuban and Haitian refugees, with most Cubans eventually paroled into the United States. Since a 1995 migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted numerous individuals. Since the 1995 migration accord, the Guantanamo Bay base has been used to interdict Cubans at sea and return them to Cuba, while a smaller number deemed at risk for persecution have been granted asylum in a third country. The base was also considered as a contingency option for housing Haitian migrants in 2004. Following the U.S.-led global campaign against terrorism post-9/11, the base began housing captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters, despite Cuban government objections. Defense Minister Raul Castro acknowledged the new mission of housing detainees. The Cuban government has expressed concerns about the treatment of prisoners at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay and continues to press the international community to investigate. Currently, there are 600 detainees held at the base. Radio and TV Marti, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, began in 1985 and 1990 respectively with the objective of supporting the Cuban people's right to access information and ideas through various media. TV Marti broadcasts for four and one-half hours daily from facilities in Cudjoe Key, Florida, and began broadcasting on the Hispasat satellite 24 hours a day in September 2003. Radio Marti broadcasts 24 hours a day on short and medium wave (AM) channels. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) plans to close down the existing aerostat transmission system in Cudjoe Key, Florida, in September 2004. Radio Marti broadcasts 24 hours a day on short and medium wave channels. The Broadcasting Board of Governors oversees entities like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting manages Radio and TV Marti from Miami, Florida. Legislation required OCB to relocate from Washington D.C. to south Florida, completed in 1998. The move of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting from Washington D.C. to south Florida was completed in 1998. Both Radio and TV Marti have faced controversies and funding cuts over the years, with various investigations conducted on the programs. Congress has appropriated approximately $460 million for broadcasting to Cuba from FY1984 through FY2004. Opponents of continued funding for TV Marti argue that the program is ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' money, as the Cuban government can easily jam the broadcasts. They believe that TV Marti does not contribute to promoting freedom and democracy in Cuba, unlike Radio Marti. Supporters of TV Marti argue that converting to UHF transmission has not overcome Cuba's jamming efforts. Supporters of continued TV Marti funding argue that eliminating it would send a message to the Cuban people that the United States is not committed to freedom in Cuba. They believe that the Cuban government cannot completely jam TV Marti and that it could be crucial in a future crisis. In early May 2004, the Commission for Assistance for a Free Cuba called for the deployment of the EC-130E/J Commando Solo airborne platform for weekly radio and television broadcasts to Cuba to overcome Cuban jamming. President Bush allocated up to $18 million for regular airborne broadcasts and the purchase of a dedicated airborne platform for Radio and TV Marti transmission into Cuba. The proposal for a dedicated airborne platform would be operated by the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Office of Cuba Broadcasting. The EC-130E/J Commando Solo aircraft, operated by the Air Force Special Operations Wing, has been used for information operations and broadcasts worldwide. In May 2003, the aircraft was tested to broadcast Radio and TV Marti to Cuba to overcome Cuban jamming. Funding for these broadcasts may come from existing resources for Cuba broadcasting. The State Department announced that Radio and TV Marti were broadcast via an airborne platform in August 2004. The cost of acquiring and refitting an aircraft for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting would be covered by the funding authorized for Cuba broadcasting in FY2003. The President signed the measure into law on September 30, 2002, with $25.923 million authorized for Cuba broadcasting. The Bush Administration requested $25.362 million for broadcasting to Cuba for FY2003, with $15 million for Radio Marti and $10 million for TV Marti. In the 108th Congress, the FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill provided $24.996 million for Radio and TV Marti broadcasting to Cuba. For FY2004, the Administration requested $26.901 million for Cuba broadcasting, with $16.355 million for Radio Marti and $10.546 million for TV Marti. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act included funding for Cuba broadcasting under the International Broadcasting Operations Account. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $28.201 million for Cuba broadcasting, $1.2 million more than the Administration's request, to enhance efforts to defeat Cuban government jamming. The Committee directed the Broadcasting Board of Governors and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting to use all available means to overcome the jamming of Radio and TV Marti. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act included funding for Cuba broadcasting under the International Broadcasting Operations Account. The Administration requested $27.6 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2005, with $17.4 million for Radio Marti and $10.3 million for TV Marti, which was fully funded in the FY2005 omnibus appropriations measure. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting proposed closing down the existing aerostat transmission system for TV Marti in Cudjoe Key, Florida in September 2004. The OCB is exploring ways to mitigate TV Marti jamming. Funding for Cuba broadcasting was included in the FY2005 omnibus appropriations measure, earmarking $27.6 million. The House-passed State Department authorization bill for FY2004 and FY2005 allocated funds for Cuba broadcasting, including using additional frequencies to improve Radio Marti signal delivery. The Senate version for FY2005 authorized appropriations for broadcasting to Cuba without a specific earmark. USAID has also provided assistance to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba. Funding for Cuba projects has increased over the years, with the Administration requesting $9 million for FY2005. In FY2004, $7 million was requested for information dissemination to support democratic progress. The House-passed bill for FY2004 had no specific earmark for democracy funding for Cuba. The House-passed bill for FY2004, H.R. 2800, did not have a specific earmark for democracy funding for Cuba. However, the Senate-passed version would have provided up to $5 million for democracy-building efforts in Cuba. The final conference on H.R. 2800 included full funding of the Administration's $7 million request for democracy programs supported by USAID. In FY2005, the Administration requested $9 million for public diplomacy in Cuba to promote democratization, human rights, and a free market economy. The House Appropriations Committee fully supported this request, and Congress ultimately funded the $9 million for Cuba projects in the FY2005 omnibus appropriations bill. Additionally, authorization legislation proposed $15 million for each of FY2004 and FY2005 to support democracy-building efforts in Cuba. The Senate version of the authorization measure, S. 2144, did not include a provision for democracy-building efforts in Cuba. Another legislative initiative, S. 1089, proposed $15 million for democracy building in Cuba and $30 million for assistance to a transition government. In May 2004, the President allocated $29 million for democracy-building activities in Cuba, in addition to the $7 million already provided by USAID. It is unclear how this funding relates to the $9 million budget request for USAID projects in FY2005. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for public diplomacy initiatives. In addition to funding through foreign operations appropriations, the United States provides democratization assistance for Cuba through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). NED-funded democracy projects for Cuba have increased over the years, reaching $1.143 million in FY2003. In 1994 and 1995, Cuba and the United States reached migration accords to prevent mass exodus of Cubans to the U.S. due to threats of another Mariel boatlift. In response to escalating numbers of fleeing Cubans, President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy on August 19, 1994. Cubans rescued at sea were taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Talks between Cuba and the United States led to a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing by boat. The agreement aimed to facilitate safe, legal, and orderly Cuban migration to the United States. In 1984, the United States and Cuba reached a migration agreement setting a minimum of 20,000 legal Cuban migrants per year. A policy change stopped granting parole to all Cuban migrants reaching the U.S., with future migrants intercepted at sea and returned to Cuba. In 1995, an accord allowed over 30,000 Cubans at Guantanamo to enter the U.S., with both countries cooperating. No action would be taken against migrants returned to Cuba for attempting illegal immigration. In January 1996, the last of 32,000 Cubans intercepted at sea and housed at Guantanamo left the U.S. Naval Base. The Elian Gonzalez case in late 1999 to June 2000 drew national attention, with the boy eventually returning to Cuba with his father after legal battles. In June 2000, the boy returned to Cuba with his father after a media frenzy orchestrated by Fidel Castro. The case of Elian Gonzalez generated strong emotions in Cuba and south Florida. The \"Wet Foot/Dry Foot\" policy allows Cubans who reach shore to apply for permanent resident status in one year, criticized for encouraging risky migration but supported by those fleeing Communist Cuba. In recent years, U.S. policy towards Cuban migrants has led to increased prosecution of smugglers and violent incidents at sea. Cuban nationals have been convicted for hijacking planes to reach Florida, while the Cuban government imposes strict penalties on those involved in alien smuggling, including possible life sentences for incidents involving death or violence. The Cuban government executed three men for ferry hijacking in Havana, prompting global condemnation. The U.S. Interest Section in Havana monitors the treatment of repatriated migrants by the Cuban government. The State Department reports to Congress on Cuban government enforcement of migration agreements. In May 2004, the State Department mentioned its inability to monitor returnees outside Havana since March 2003. Despite most returnees not facing retribution, there were instances of harassment and punishment. On July 21, 2003, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 15 Cubans who had stolen a Cuban government vessel. The Cuban government assured no executions or more than 10 years in prison, praising the repatriation as per the 1995 migration agreement. The repatriation of migrants in line with the 1995 migration agreement led to criticism of the Administration in Florida and some Members of Congress. Calls for investigation into U.S.-Cuban negotiations and changing the policy of repatriating Cubans interdicted at sea were made. Supporters argued that implementing the migration accords is crucial to prevent another mass exodus of Cubans to the United States. In response, the President announced an increase in new Cuban immigrants, improved refugee identification methods, efforts to process Cubans leaving Cuba, and a public information campaign in Florida and Cuba on safe and legal migration routes to the United States. The President's announcement aimed to better inform Cubans about safe and legal migration routes to the United States. The State Department cancelled the 20th round of U.S.-Cuban migration talks due to Cuba's refusal to discuss key issues identified by the United States. The cancellation of the 20th round of U.S.-Cuban migration talks was due to Cuba's refusal to discuss key issues, including the repatriation of Cubans interdicted at sea and the return of Cuban nationals determined to be excludable from the United States. Cuban officials criticized the U.S. decision as irresponsible and expressed readiness to address all raised issues. This has raised concerns among Cubans seeking legal migration visas. Cuba has taken back over 1,600 of the 2,746 excludables listed in a 1984 U.S.-Cuban migration accord. The U.S.-Cuban migration talks were canceled due to Cuba's refusal to discuss key issues, including the repatriation of Cubans interdicted at sea and the return of Cuban nationals determined to be excludable from the United States. Cuba has taken back over 1,600 of the 2,746 excludables listed in a 1984 U.S.-Cuban migration accord. Additionally, there are over 900 Cubans in the United States not on the 1984 list who are no longer eligible to remain due to criminal offenses, but Cuba will not accept their return. The U.S. has proposed a technical working group to explore options for the return of some of these individuals. The House and Senate passed bill H.R. 2500 for broadcasting to Cuba in FY2002. The Senate substituted the language of S. 1215 as its version of H.R. 2500 and passed the bill amended. The conference report was filed on November 9, 2001, and approved by the House and Senate on November 14 and 15, 2001, respectively. The bill was signed into law on November 28, 2001 as P.L. 107-115 (H.R. 2506) for Foreign Operations Appropriations in FY2002. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully supports the Administration's budget request of at least $5 million for promoting democracy in Cuba. The Senate version of the bill included $1.5 million for cooperation with Cuba on counter-narcotics, but this provision was not included in the final conference report. The report called for a report by the Secretary of State on Cuba's involvement in illegal drug trafficking and the potential impact of U.S. narcotics assistance to Cuba. The conference report encouraged the Administration to transmit any necessary legislation to decrease drug flow to or from Cuba. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY2002 and FY2003, authorized funds for Cuba broadcasting. H.Res. 91 expressed the House's concerns about human rights in Cuba. The House passed a resolution expressing support for the Varela Project in Cuba. The Senate approved the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005, which included dropping the Cuba provision in agriculture appropriations. The omnibus measure dropped Cuba provisions in agriculture, commerce, justice, and state appropriations, but earmarked $27.629 million for broadcasting to Cuba. Division D removed House and Senate provisions on cooperation with Cuba on counter-narcotics. The omnibus measure dropped Cuba provisions in various appropriations but earmarked $27.629 million for broadcasting to Cuba. Division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 includes provisions on Cuba sanctions, including easing restrictions on family and educational travel and private commercial sales of agricultural and medical products. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, P.L. 108-199 (H.R. 2673), was signed into law on January 23, 2004. It included provisions on Cuba travel, specifically dropping a provision that would have allowed travel to Cuba for commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods without applying to the Treasury Department. Division B funded Radio and TV broadcasting to Cuba under the International Broadcasting. State appropriations fund Radio and TV broadcasting to Cuba under the International Broadcasting Operations Account without a specific earmark. The Broadcasting Board of Governors is expected to provide $1.2 million for alternative means of transmission, including Internet broadcasting to Cuba. The Administration requested $26.901 million for Cuba broadcasting, with $16.355 million for Radio Marti and $10.546 million for TV Marti. Division D did not include assistance for counter-narcotics cooperation with Cuba or a provision prohibiting such assistance. It also funds democracy programs for Cuba without earmarking specific assistance in the bill. The conference report recommended full funding of the Administration's $7 million request for democracy programs in Cuba, while the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2989 dropped provisions easing Cuba sanctions. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2989 had provisions to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on travel, remittances, and educational exchanges in Cuba. P.L. 108-7, signed into law in 2003, did not earmark funding for human rights projects in Cuba but allocated $5.75 million for foreign operations appropriations. The House and Senate introduced several resolutions and acts related to Cuba in 2003. H.Con.Res. 16 called for the release of political prisoners, H.Con.Res. 125 expressed Congress's concern for Cuban democracy activists, H.R. 1201 focused on Cuban victims of torture, and H.R. 1950 dealt with foreign relations authorization.

The Senate-passed version provides up to $5 million in Transition Initiatives funding for democracy-building efforts in Cuba. H.R. 4818 and S. 2812 for FY2005 Foreign Operations Appropriations were introduced and approved by the House and Senate, with no specific earmarks for the Administration's $9 million request for projects promoting democratization, human rights, and a free market economy. The House Appropriations Committee report supports the Administration's budget request for democracy-building efforts in Cuba. Various resolutions express concerns about human rights violations in Cuba and call for the release of political prisoners. H.Res. 208 (Foley) condemns Cuban government's crackdown, calls on UNCHR to recognize House resolution, and criticizes UN Economic and Social Council for renewing Cuba's membership. H.Res. 563 (Ros-Lehtinen) expresses House's view on human rights crackdown in Cuba. S. 1089 (Ensign) is the Cuba Transition Act of 2003, aiming to facilitate peaceful transition in Cuba with up to $5 million in assistance.

Bills were introduced to lift the trade embargo on Cuba and allow for financing of agricultural sales. H.R. 2071 (Flake) and H.R. 2494 (Rangel)/ S. 2002 (Baucus) are bills introduced to improve trade relations with Cuba and promote intellectual property obligations. H.R. 2494 and S. 2002 were introduced to address assets confiscated in Cuba. H.R. 2989 and S. 1589 were part of the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2004. H.R. 2989 included Cuba sanctions amendments, while S. 1589 did not have such provisions. S.1589, reported on September 8, 2003, did not include Cuba provisions. However, during Senate consideration of H.R. 2989 on October 23, 2003, the Senate approved an amendment preventing funds from enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba. The amendment was nearly identical to the Flake amendment, with the only difference being the effective date. The Senate approved H.R. 2989 on October 23, 2003. H.R. 3470 (Rothman) aims to amend the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba, provide scholarships for Cuban nationals, repeal prohibitions on transactions with U.S. intellectual property, expedite security checks for visiting Cubans, and allow Cuban nationals to play professional sports in the United States.
