    "content": "The drug supply chain involves multiple steps from manufacturing to distribution, with potential risks of mishandling or counterfeiting. Efforts are being made by Congress, the FDA, industry groups, and consumers to prevent these issues and ensure the safety of prescription drugs. The FDA regulates the drug supply chain from manufacturing to distribution to ensure drug integrity and safety for consumers. Efforts to secure the drug supply chain involve minimizing risks throughout the continuum, from sourcing ingredients to distribution. Dr. Woodcock highlighted issues such as contamination, diversion, and counterfeiting, citing examples like counterfeit Adderall and stolen insulin vials. Other breaches include stolen and expired seizure drugs re-entering the legitimate supply chain. The pharmaceutical supply chain has experienced various breaches, including the sale of human growth hormone bought from Medicaid patients, stolen insulin cargo, and licensed wholesalers offering prescription drugs obtained from patients. Other incidents involved fraudulent Botox, counterfeit Lipitor from the UK, and counterfeit Avastin with no active ingredient. This report provides an overview of supply chain vulnerabilities and current federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting the integrity of the final drug product. The FDA regulates the approval, production, distribution, and advertising of prescription drugs to prevent unsafe or adulterated products from reaching pharmacies and patients in the United States. The agency works to protect the integrity of the final drug product and discusses potential changes to increase the security of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The FDA requires manufacturers to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their products, follow FDA-approved manufacturing practices, register production facilities, and allow FDA inspections. Drugs are then distributed to FDA-registered U.S. drug wholesale distributors for further distribution to consumers. Consumers receive 11 million prescriptions per day from over 150,000 locations in the US through a drug distribution network involving tens of thousands of independent companies. States license pharmacists, wholesalers, physicians, and dentists involved in pharmaceutical distribution. The downstream pharmaceutical supply chain includes various entities, with different definitions across federal and state laws. Figure 1 illustrates the steps a drug product takes from manufacturer to dispenser. The upstream segment of the pharmaceutical supply chain involves the manufacturer sourcing materials to produce the drug product. The product is then sold to primary and secondary wholesale distributors before reaching the dispenser. Third-party logistics providers may also be involved in transporting or warehousing the drug. Throughout the chain, the drug could be vulnerable to theft or mishandling. The pharmaceutical supply chain involves the manufacturer sourcing materials to produce the drug product, which is then sold to wholesale distributors before reaching the dispenser. The drug is vulnerable to theft, mishandling, adulteration, and tampering at each change of hands. FDA regulations address product integrity and safety in the supply chain, with relevant sections covering prohibitions and penalties for adulterated or misbranded drugs. In the last 25 years, Congress has made three focused attempts to improve supply chain security by amending the FFDCA. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 banned the sale, trade, and purchase of drug samples and mandated storage, handling, and accounting standards. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 banned the sale, trade, and purchase of drug samples and mandated storage, handling, and accounting standards. In addition, PDMA added new requirements for wholesalers, manufacturers, and distributors to ensure supply chain security, including maintaining a pedigree for drug transactions, licensing for wholesale distribution, and defining authorized distributors of record. Penalties were established for violations of these provisions. The FDA drafted regulations to enforce the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, requiring drug companies to maintain a detailed \"chain of custody\" for pharmaceutical products. This would allow manufacturers to trace back suspected counterfeit shipments. Penalties were established for violations of these provisions. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act requires drug sellers to provide detailed transaction information, but excludes manufacturers' authorized distributors of record. This creates a challenge for secondary distributors who may not have the necessary chain-of-custody information. FDA regulations implemented in 1999 faced opposition from the Small Business Administration due to enforcement concerns. The Small Business Administration opposed FDA regulations in 1999 due to enforcement concerns, leading to delays in enforcing provisions that could impact secondary distributors. FDA announced a compliance policy guide in November 2006 for PDMA pedigree regulations, but faced a preliminary injunction a week later. In March 2010, FDA acknowledged challenges in implementing the regulations. In March 2010, FDA stated that they have been exercising enforcement discretion regarding drug pedigree requirements, only requiring pedigrees to go back to the last authorized distributor of record. In July 2011, FDA proposed to remove the rule on pedigree requirements for wholesale distribution. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 added provisions to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 added provisions to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs by requiring a standardized numerical identifier for prescription drug packages. FDA issued guidance on this in 2010, but the use of SNIs was not mandated. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 added provisions for securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs by requiring a standardized numerical identifier for prescription drug packages, but the use of SNIs was not mandated. FDAAA did not authorize the Secretary to require the use of SNIs, and future action on this issue will likely depend on new legislation. FDAAA also directed the Secretary to undertake activities in areas such as addressing promising technologies, enhancing enforcement activities, and establishing regional capabilities for validation and inspection. Attempts to craft a comprehensive supply chain plan led to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) five years later. FDASIA expanded FDA authority on manufacturer registration, facility inspection, and importation. It allowed FDA to refuse entry of imported drugs if inspection was denied, enhance penalties for counterfeit products, and require unique facility identifiers. Key elements like chain-of-custody documentation and track-and-trace technologies were not fully addressed. In the absence of a federal plan, many states have passed their own laws addressing drug pedigrees and supply chain security, with pending legislation in other states. These laws vary in approach and content but generally cover definitions, licensing, permits, registration, pedigrees, and recordkeeping. California's law, first passed in 2004 and amended in 2006 and 2008, is often referenced in discussions about a national system. The California law, amended in 2006 and 2008, requires electronic pedigrees for prescription drugs starting in 2015. It includes seller information, drug details, and shipment data. The system must be interoperable across all distribution states, with definitions and exemptions provided. This law is relevant for federal policymakers awaiting national legislation. Upon federal legislation or regulation on drug pedigree/serialization, certain sections will become inoperative. Concerns exist over California's costly and technology-dependent requirements, with some industry players ready to comply while others push for more comprehensive supply chain laws. Various industry groups have proposed security systems or legislation, with the NABP collaborating on a Model State Pharmacy Act. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) has developed a Model State Pharmacy Act and Model Rules, including criteria for accrediting wholesale distributors through its Verified-Accredited Wholesale Distributors (VAWD) program. 21 states recognize VAWD, with 3 requiring it for wholesale distributors. Accredited facilities undergo annual reviews and site surveys every three years. The Pharmaceutical Distribution Security Alliance (PDSA) proposed the Pharmaceutical Traceability Enhancement Code (RxTEC) Act in February 2012. The draft legislation aims to implement a system for tracing pharmaceutical products through machine-readable graphics on packages. Different requirements for manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers would be phased in over three to six years. Legislation regarding pharmaceutical supply chain security has been considered in the 113th Congress. The goal of pharmaceutical supply chain security is agreed upon by all parties involved. Sub-goals include protecting patients from harmful drugs, manufacturers from financial and reputational losses, and assigning accountability for issues. Policymakers aim to create a national plan to avoid state requirements and establish a cost-effective system. Congress, FDA, and industry stakeholders are working towards increasing supply chain security. While industry and health care stakeholders agree on the goal of increasing supply chain security, they disagree on approaches and details. Legislative drafters face various policy decision points, including whether to make changes to the current state regulation system. The terms and policy decision points under discussion by Members of Congress, committees, and staff are outlined in the following section. In the context of regulating the pharmaceutical supply chain, policymakers must define key terms like wholesaler, distributor, and pedigree. The shift is towards electronic pedigrees and implementing track and trace systems for increased security. The movement is towards electronic pedigrees and track and trace systems for pharmaceutical supply chain security. Serialization involves unique identifiers on packages, while lot- or unit-level activity determines tracking requirements. The Secretary has developed a standardized numerical identifier (SNI) as required by FDAAA. The discussion focuses on the implementation of unit-level tracking and tracing in the pharmaceutical supply chain, which could improve recall efficiency and real-time adverse event investigation. The downstream supply chain, including the path of the finished product after leaving the manufacturer, is the current legislative focus. Some proposals suggest separating labeling and reporting tasks to meet implementation goals. Legislative discussions are centered on downstream supply chain security activities. Opinions differ on specifying start and end points for requirements like pedigrees/transaction records and authentication/verification. The most inclusive approach would cover all transactions from manufacturer to retail sale. Recipients could be required to verify the SNI and distribution history when accepting a shipment. Technology choices for track-and-trace systems are debated, including options like two-dimensional bar codes or radio-frequency. The evolving technologies for track and trace purposes include two-dimensional bar codes and RFID. Interoperability and data management are crucial for the system to work effectively, with centralized or decentralized approaches for data management. Policymakers may specify data access requirements in legislation. Policymakers may specify data access requirements in legislation, considering purposes for data use, real-time tracking needs, and confidentiality. Notification requirements for suspected counterfeit drugs in shipments may also be included in new laws or regulations. Legislation may include penalties for non-compliance with labeling and transaction record provisions. Different time frames are set for implementing steps like SNI use and transaction reporting. FDA registration is required for entities involved in specified activities. Cost considerations, accountability, and the structure of a supply chain security system are key factors in legislative proposals addressing licensing standards for wholesale distributors and other supply chain participants. Registration of supply chain members supports assigning accountability for errors and accidents. Cost implications include who bears the cost, current technology capabilities, and potential costs for new products. Federal and state jurisdiction favor national standards over varying state requirements. Drug production's global supply chain challenges FDA's current authority to secure the nation's drug supply. A robust track-and-trace system for drugs would enhance the ability to detect harmful products in the supply chain and improve efficiency in product recalls. All supply chain stakeholders need to participate for this system to be effective. Current congressional attention is on H.R. 3204, the Drug Quality and Security Act, which aims to keep counterfeit, mishandled, and substandard drugs away from patients. The House passed the bill on September 28, 2013, and it now awaits Senate action."
