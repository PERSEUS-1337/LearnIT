    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Health Care Worker Needlestick Prevention Act\" and includes requirements. The Health Care Worker Needlestick Prevention Act mandates the amendment of the bloodborne pathogens standard to require employers to use needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens. Non-managerial direct care health care workers must participate in identifying and evaluating these systems. The bloodborne pathogens standard requires employers to use needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections, unless they can demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that these systems do not promote employee safety, interfere with patient safety, or interfere with medical procedures. Commercial unavailability is also a valid exception. The amendment requires employers to include needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections in their exposure control plan. They must also maintain a separate contaminated sharps injury log with specific information for each exposure incident. The exposure incident report should include details such as the type and brand of sharp involved, job classification of the exposed employee, department where the incident occurred, procedure being performed at the time, how the incident occurred, body part involved, and whether the sharp had engineered sharps injury protections. The injured employee's opinion on the presence of engineered sharps injury protections and how they may have affected the injury, along with details on training received for using the device before the incident. The injured employee's opinion on whether a mechanism could have prevented the injury, including training requirements for direct care health workers on needleless systems and sharps with engineered injury protections. SEC. 3. NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE ON SAFER NEEDLE TECHNOLOGY. The Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will establish a national database on needleless systems and sharps with engineered injury protections, develop evaluation criteria, create a training curriculum, and monitor needlestick injuries in healthcare. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will collect data on needlestick injuries among healthcare workers and have access to employer records for prevention interventions. $15,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as bloodborne pathogens, contaminated, direct care health care worker, and employer in relation to occupational exposure to infectious materials. The Act defines terms related to occupational exposure to infectious materials, including engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems. The Act defines terms related to occupational exposure to infectious materials, including needleless systems and sharps injuries. A sharp is any object that can penetrate the skin and cause exposure incidents, while a sharps injury refers to any injury caused by a sharp. Injury caused by a sharp includes cuts, abrasions, or needlesticks, and a sharps injury log is a record that meets specific requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will require non-exempt Medicare hospitals to comply with the bloodborne pathogens standard. The Act will be effective upon enactment, with the Secretary of Labor taking action within one year."
