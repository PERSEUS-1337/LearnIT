About forty-four states have laws mandating parental notification or consent for minors seeking abortions. The report discusses the validity of these laws in light of Supreme Court cases like Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, which address a minor's right to choose abortion. Casey upheld a woman's right to choose but allowed restrictions for minors, like parental consent requirements. Ayotte reaffirmed a state's ability to require parental involvement in abortion decisions. In Ayotte, the Court reiterated that a state may require parental involvement in a pregnant minor's abortion decision. The report reviews state parental involvement laws, judicial bypass procedures, exceptions for medical emergencies, and recent federal legislation. Roe v. Wade established a woman's constitutional right to choose abortion, with subsequent cases allowing restrictions. Casey affirmed that a state can require parental involvement for minors' abortion decisions without unduly burdening their right to choose. In 1992, the Supreme Court upheld a parental consent provision for minors seeking abortions, stating that it does not unduly burden their right to choose. The Court introduced the \"undue burden\" analysis, invalidating government-imposed abortion restrictions that impose such burdens. This shifted from the trimester-based strict scrutiny standard of Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court upheld a parental consent provision for minors seeking abortions in 1992, stating it does not unduly burden their right to choose. In January 2006, the Court confirmed the validity of state laws placing restrictions on a pregnant minor's abortion rights, including exceptions for medical emergencies and when parental consent is not in her best interests. In Ayotte, the Court considered a challenge to a state statute requiring parental notification before a minor may obtain an abortion, with Justice O'Connor stating the holding did not revisit Court precedent. In Ayotte, Justice O'Connor clarified that the Court's decision did not reconsider abortion precedent but focused on remedies. The Court ruled that only certain applications of the act could violate a woman's right to abortion and sent the case back to lower courts to ensure compliance with existing judicial precedent. The decision affirmed states' rights to require parental involvement in minors' abortion decisions and prohibited restrictions on abortions necessary for a woman's health or life. Several Court cases preceding Casey and Ayotte established that a state parental involvement statute must provide an alternate procedure for a minor to obtain authorization for an abortion. The Court has held that a state law requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision is unconstitutional if it unduly burdens the minor's right to terminate her pregnancy. In Belotti v. Baird, the Court reiterated the need for an alternative procedure for pregnant minors seeking an abortion, such as a judicial bypass allowing them to waive parental involvement. Thirty-seven states have laws requiring parental involvement but provide for a judicial bypass as an option. This bypass procedure has been upheld by the Court as a valid safeguard for a pregnant minor's rights. The Court has upheld judicial bypass procedures as valid safeguards for a pregnant minor's right to obtain an abortion, including in cases like Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. It has not determined if parental notification laws must include a judicial bypass procedure. In Lambert v. Wicklund, the Court also did not address this issue. The Court has upheld judicial bypass procedures as safeguards for a pregnant minor's abortion rights. While it has not directly stated that parental notification laws must include a judicial bypass, precedents suggest that such laws may be unconstitutional without an alternative to parental notification. In Belotti, the Court ruled that a parental notification law must provide an alternative for a \"mature\" minor or when notification is not in the minor's best interests. Justice Kennedy in Akron rejected the need for specific procedural thresholds for judicial bypass in state parental involvement laws, stating that Ohio's procedure had \"reasonable steps\" to protect minors' identities and expedite court proceedings. The Court majority held that a state may require a pregnant minor to prove her maturity during a judicial bypass hearing for an abortion without parental involvement. State parental involvement laws in 10 states lack exceptions for medical emergencies. The Court reiterated that a state cannot restrict access to necessary abortions for the pregnant woman's life or health. It acknowledged that in some cases, a pregnant minor may need an immediate abortion to prevent serious health consequences, requiring state statutes to include medical exceptions. Legislation introduced to restrict minors' access to abortion must include exceptions for medical emergencies. The Child Custody Protection Act fines individuals who transport minors across state lines for abortions, with exceptions for life-threatening conditions. The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act (CIANA) introduced by Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen prohibits transporting minors across state lines for abortions without parental notification. Physicians performing abortions on out-of-state minors must notify parents at least 24 hours before the procedure or face fines and imprisonment. Exceptions apply in certain situations. The table provides citations to state parental involvement statutes, including instances where a minor declares in writing being a victim of abuse. It indicates if parental consent or notification is required, with provisions for judicial bypass, medical emergencies, and pregnant minors facing parental abuse."
