This tax is imposed under a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with provisions for windfall profit, removal price, adjusted base price, and qualified investment. The Windfall Energy Alternatives for the Nation (WEAN) Off of Oil Act of 2007 introduces an excise tax on major integrated oil companies based on the excess windfall profit from taxable crude oil removed from properties. The tax is paid by the producer of the oil. The term \"windfall profit\" in the WEAN Off of Oil Act of 2007 refers to the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price of the barrel. The removal price is determined by the amount for which the oil is sold, with specific rules for sales between related persons and oil removed from property before sale. The adjusted base price for taxable crude oil is $50 per barrel, with additional amounts for refining begun on the property before removal. The term \"property\" is defined as per section 614. The adjusted base price for taxable crude oil is determined by multiplying the base price by the inflation adjustment for the calendar year. The inflation adjustment is calculated based on the implicit price deflator for the gross national product. The first revision of the price deflator is used for qualified investments, including section 263(c) costs, qualified refinery property, qualified facilities under section 45(d), and alcohol production facilities for fuel under section 40. The term 'section 263(c) costs' refers to intangible drilling and development costs that can be deducted as expenses, excluding costs for drilling nonproductive wells. \"SEC. 5898. SPECIAL RULES AND DEFINITIONS.\" The Secretary will establish rules for withholding and depositing the tax on taxable crude oil.

Definitions include the term 'producer' as the holder of the economic interest in crude oil. The term 'crude oil' includes condensates and natural gasoline. Newly discovered oil from wells drilled after 2007 is excluded, except for proven oil or gas properties. A 'barrel' is defined as 42 US gallons. The Secretary can adjust removal prices to reflect fair market value, and regulations will be prescribed. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the chapter's purposes. This section will not apply to taxable crude oil removed after 3 years from the enactment date. Chapter 56 discusses windfall profits on crude oil.
