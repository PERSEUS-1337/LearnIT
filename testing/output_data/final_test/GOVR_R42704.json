Legislation has been proposed to alter eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart, with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan leading to an increase in recipients due to conditions like traumatic brain injuries and PTSD. Recent events, such as the 2015 shooting in Chattanooga, TN, have raised new questions about who deserves the Purple Heart. The debate over expanding Purple Heart eligibility for servicemembers, sparked by recent events in Chattanooga, TN, raises questions about recognizing PTSD as equal to physical injuries. Veterans groups argue about the criteria for awarding the Purple Heart and whether changes would diminish its value for those who have already earned it. Congress expanded Purple Heart eligibility in 2015 through the NDAA for FY2015, allowing servicemembers wounded in attacks by \"foreign terrorist organizations\" to receive the award. This change resulted in Purple Hearts being awarded to those affected by the 2009 shootings in Little Rock, AR, and at Fort Hood, TX. Congressional offices anticipate increased inquiries about Purple Heart eligibility as servicemembers return from global conflicts. The history of the Purple Heart dates back to 1782 when George Washington created the Badge of Military Merit to reward acts of valor. The award, later known as the Purple Heart, was designed as a purple heart of cloth edged with lace. Records are incomplete, but it is believed that three soldiers from Connecticut were the first recipients during the American Revolutionary War. The Badge of Military Merit was created by George Washington in 1782 to reward acts of valor during the American Revolutionary War. Three noncommissioned officers from Connecticut were the first recipients: Sergeant William Brown, Sergeant Elijah Churchill, and Sergeant Daniel Bissell. The award fell into disuse but was revived by General Douglas MacArthur in 1932 as the Purple Heart, with a redesigned heart-shaped medal featuring George Washington's coat of arms. In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt extended the Purple Heart award to Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard members serving in World War II. In 1952, President Truman retroactively awarded Purple Hearts to personnel in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard that qualified after April 5, 1917, thus including World War I veterans of all services. From 1962 until 1998, eligibility for the Purple Hearts was changed on several occasions. President Kennedy authorized Purple Hearts to all servicemembers. President Kennedy expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers and civilians engaged in armed conflict, particularly in Vietnam. President Reagan further expanded eligibility to include those killed or wounded in international terrorist attacks or peacekeeping operations outside the United States. This expansion was in response to increased terrorist attacks against U.S. servicemembers abroad, such as the Marine Corps Barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 1996 expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include prisoners of war injured before 1962. President Clinton signed the NDAA for Fiscal Year 1998, limiting future Purple Heart awards to military personnel. Over 1 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932, with estimates of 1.8 million total awards. H.R. 7097, the \"Find our Hearts Act,\" was introduced during the 115th Congress to amend Title 10, United States. H.R. 7097, known as the \"Find our Hearts Act,\" aimed to establish a searchable database of Purple Heart recipients in the Armed Forces. The bill was referred to the House Armed Services Committee but did not progress further. The Purple Heart is currently awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been wounded or died under specific conditions. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been wounded or killed in action against an opposing armed force, in any action with a foreign country's armed force, while serving with friendly foreign forces in armed conflict, or as a result of an act of an enemy or hostile foreign force. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been wounded or killed in action against an opposing armed force, in any action with a foreign country's armed force, while serving with friendly foreign forces in armed conflict, or as a result of an act of an enemy or hostile foreign force. The Secretary of the Military Department concerned awards the Purple Heart for various criteria, including international terrorist attacks in the United States or its territories, military operations outside the U.S. as part of a peacekeeping force, and actions by friendly weapon fire during combat. The Purple Heart is awarded to U.S. Armed Forces members wounded or killed in action against an opposing armed force, in any conflict with a foreign country's armed force, or due to enemy action. Criteria include being a former POW eligible for the POW Medal, dying while in captivity as a POW, or being killed or wounded on active duty after September 11, 2001. The Purple Heart is awarded to Service members on active duty who are killed or wounded in an attack by a foreign terrorist organization. The attack must be targeted at the member due to their status as a member of the armed forces and not the result of the member's willful misconduct. Military Department Secretaries can request an intelligence assessment from the Defense Combating Terrorism Center to help determine eligibility for the Purple Heart. The DCTC assesses potential foreign terrorist attacks by individuals or entities based on communication with terrorist organizations and motivation for the attack. The severity of wounds for a Purple Heart award must require treatment by a military medical officer, with documentation in the Servicemember's medical record. Award may also be made for wounds treated by other medical professionals if a medical officer confirms the severity. After May 17, 1998, the Purple Heart may only be awarded to a Service member at the time of being killed or wounded. Before this date, U.S. civilian nationals serving with the armed forces could also receive the award. Deceased servicemembers can have the Purple Heart given to their representatives. Servicemembers can receive multiple Purple Hearts for separate incidents, with subsequent awards indicated by oak leaf clusters or service stars. Congress has expanded its role in awarding military decorations, including the Purple Heart. In recent years, eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart have been adjusted, with Congress passing provisions to expand eligibility. This includes incidents such as a shooting in 2009 where a man opened fire on U.S. Army soldiers, resulting in casualties. In 2009, a shooting incident occurred at Ft. Hood, TX, where an Army major killed 13 and wounded 29. The Defense Department classified it as \"workplace violence,\" sparking debate on whether it should be considered an act of war or domestic terrorism due to the perpetrators' Muslim background and anger towards U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility criteria to include attacks by \"foreign terrorist organizations.\" Some are opposed to awarding the Purple Heart for terrorist acts initially deemed \"workplace violence\" or criminal acts, arguing it sets a subjective precedent for eligibility. In 2015, Purple Hearts were awarded to victims of a shooting at Ft. Hood by Army officials. Purple Hearts were awarded to victims of the Fort Hood shooting and the Little Rock recruiting station shooting in 2009. Legislation was introduced to expand eligibility for military victims of domestic terrorism. Congress considered awarding Purple Hearts to military victims of domestic terrorism, specifically those affected by the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. However, critics argued that the bombing did not meet the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. The final version of the NDAA for FY2016 did not include this provision. Congressional interest in Purple Heart eligibility was reignited after a shooting incident in Chattanooga in 2015. In December 2015, the Purple Heart was awarded to five servicemembers killed and one wounded in the July 2015 shootings in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The FBI investigation concluded the attack was inspired by a foreign terrorist group. On January 14, 2016, Vice Admiral Robin Braun presented the Purple Heart to Logistics Specialist 2nd Class Randall Smith's family. Brigadier General Terry V. Williams awarded the Purple Heart to Sergeant DeMonte R. Cheeley on January 26, 2016. Lieutenant General Rex McMillian presented Purple Hearts to the families of four Marines in April 2016. U.S. Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, along with two friends, subdued a gunman on a train from Amsterdam to Paris. U.S. Airman Spencer Stone, along with two friends, subdued a heavily armed gunman on a train from Amsterdam to Paris. Stone was stabbed in the face and neck by the gunman before he could fire an AK-47. The trio was hailed as heroes and awarded the French Legion of Honor. Stone later received the Purple Heart and Airman's Medal for his bravery. In a separate incident, a security guard killed 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Army Reserve Captain Antonio Davon Brown was killed in the attack at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. He may be eligible for the Purple Heart pending the FBI investigation into the incident. Legislation was introduced to penalize the sale of Purple Hearts to protect them from being sold by con artists or collectors. The Private Corrado Piccoli Purple Heart Preservation Act was introduced in multiple Congress sessions but saw limited action. The bill aimed to protect Purple Hearts from being sold and was reintroduced in the 115th and 116th Congress. The NDAA for FY2019, H.R. 5515, extended MWR privileges to certain veterans, including Purple Heart recipients and caregivers. P.L. 115-232 enacted this provision on August 13, 2018. Section 621 of the bill extends eligibility for MWR and commissary privileges to these individuals starting in 2020. The DOD is reevaluating Purple Heart eligibility for TBI and mental conditions due to the large number of veterans with invisible wounds returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The DOD is reevaluating Purple Heart eligibility for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and mental conditions like PTSD. There is debate on including PTSD as criteria for the Purple Heart, with ongoing studies funded by Congress and executive agencies. The National Alliance on Mental Illness advocates for awarding the Purple Heart for psychological wounds to reduce stigma and promote care-seeking. Currently, DOD does not consider servicemembers with PTSD eligible for the Purple Heart. Army Regulation 600-8-22 allows for \"concussion injuries caused as a result of\" but does not specify further. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility for PTSD continues, with Army Regulation 600-8-22 allowing for injuries caused by enemy explosions but disqualifying PTSD. The Marine Corps also excludes PTSD, defining it as a combat stress injury not directly caused by the enemy. Some argue that recognizing mental injuries for the Purple Heart could reduce stigma and encourage seeking help. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility for PTSD continues, with some veterans opposing it. They argue that medals should be awarded for combat-related injuries, not mental health issues. The history of the Purple Heart dates back to George Washington creating the Badge of Military Merit in 1782. The Purple Heart, originally the Badge of Military Merit, was revived by General Douglas MacArthur and renamed. Over the years, eligibility was expanded to include various branches of the military and civilians serving with military forces. President Reagan extended eligibility to those killed or wounded in terrorist attacks, and President Truman retroactively awarded Purple Hearts to veterans. The Defense Authorization Acts from 1996, 1998, 2007, and 2008 expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include prisoners of war and their families. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded or killed in the 2009 shootings at Ft. Hood, Texas, and Little Rock, Arkansas. Members of Congress can request military decorations for individuals or groups directly from the Service Secretary. The Secretary can approve or deny requests for military decorations, with explanations provided to the requesting Member and committees. This process includes considerations for waivers of time restrictions and exceptions to policy."
