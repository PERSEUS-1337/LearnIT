For minors under 6 years old, a lawsuit must be filed within 3 years of injury manifestation or before the eighth birthday, whichever is longer.

In health care lawsuits, there is no limit on recovering economic damages, and noneconomic damages can be up to $250,000. Future noneconomic damages cannot be discounted to present value, and the jury is not informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages.

If an attorney has a financial stake through a contingency fee, the court can limit their payment and redirect damages to the claimant in the interest of justice and equity. The limitations on contingent fees in health care lawsuits are as follows: 40% of the first $50,000 recovered, 33\\1/3\\% of the next $50,000, 25% of the next $500,000, and 15% of any amount over $600,000. These limits apply regardless of how the recovery is obtained. In health care lawsuits, the court can authorize a fee lower than the maximum for minors or incompetent individuals.

In health care lawsuits, damages received by a claimant will be reduced by the amount of any collateral source benefits they are entitled to, minus any payments made to obtain such benefits. This provision does not apply if the payor of collateral source benefits has a right of recovery. This section also applies to settled health care lawsuits. Punitive damages in health care lawsuits can be awarded if clear and convincing evidence shows malicious intent or deliberate failure to avoid injury. A demand for punitive damages cannot be included in the initial lawsuit filing, but can be added later with court approval. In health care lawsuits, punitive damages may be awarded if there is clear evidence of malicious intent or deliberate failure to prevent injury. A separate proceeding is required to determine the award and amount of punitive damages, with evidence relevant only to punitive damages being inadmissible in other proceedings. In health care lawsuits, punitive damages may be awarded based on factors such as the severity of harm caused, duration of conduct, profitability, and volume of products or procedures. If no compensatory damages are awarded, punitive damages cannot be granted. In health care lawsuits, punitive damages awarded are limited to two times the economic damages or $250,000, whichever is greater. The jury is not informed of this limitation.

The Act does not affect any defense available to a defendant in a health care lawsuit under other Federal law. SEC. 11. STATE FLEXIBILITY AND PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS. The provisions in this Act preempt State laws that hinder the application of laws established by this Act regarding health care lawsuits. It also supersedes certain provisions in the United States Code related to damages, fees, lawsuit commencement period, and evidence introduction. The Act preempts State laws that restrict limitations on damages in health care lawsuits and ensures that issues not covered by the Act are governed by applicable Federal or State law. The Act does not preempt any Federal or State law that provides greater protections for health care providers or manufacturers from liability. It also does not create new causes of action not already available under existing laws or affect the preemption scope of any other Federal law. SEC. 12. APPLICABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to health care lawsuits initiated after its enactment, except for those arising from injuries before the enactment date, which are governed by existing statute of limitations."
