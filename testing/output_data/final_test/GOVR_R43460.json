    "content": "The federal government heavily relies on contractors for goods and services, but contractor fraud costs billions annually. Detecting and deterring fraud is challenging due to limited resources. Fraud can include false claims, bid rigging, defective pricing, and false certification. Congressional efforts to combat fraud date back to the Civil War with the False Claims Act. Various statutes allow the government to recover damages for fraudulent claims. Since the False Claims Act (FCA) was enacted, there has been ongoing debate over the extent of liability for false claims and misconduct. The Department of Justice (DOJ) recovered $3.8 billion in FY2013 under the FCA, with a record $890 million from procurement fraud cases. The government has also obtained significant penalties and forfeitures from contractors involved in fraudulent claims. The Federal Circuit affirmed a $50.6 million civil penalty against a contractor under the Contract Disputes Act's anti-fraud provision and ordered a $13.3 million contractor claim forfeited under the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act. Federal civil fraud remedies can result in significant recoveries for the government, even without a specific claim for payment. Contractors can be held liable for conduct that may not meet traditional fraud definitions. Recent statutory and judicial developments under the FCA have broadened the scope of civil fraud remedy statutes, reducing the level of \"knowledge\" required for liability. Congress aims for effective statutes that deter fraud impacting government programs, but overly broad interpretations may deter contractors from competing for government contracts. This report provides an overview of federal statutes that address contractor fraud, including the civil False Claims Act (FCA), anti-fraud provision of the Contract Disputes Act (CDA), FFCA, and Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act. It also discusses regulatory and judicial developments affecting FCA enforcement, such as the calculation of treble damages, Mandatory Disclosure Rule, and Presumed Loss Rule. Congress enacted the FCA in 1863 to combat fraud by defense contractors during the Civil War, adjusting its provisions over time in response to judicial interpretations and changing perceptions of fraud prevalence. The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on individuals engaging in misconduct against the federal government, allowing the Attorney General and private parties to bring civil actions. Liability under the FCA does not require proof of intent to defraud, but certain provisions necessitate a \"false or fraudulent\" claim for payment. Some courts have broadened the definition of such claims through theories like implied false certification and fraud in the inducement. The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on individuals for misconduct against the federal government, requiring a \"false or fraudulent\" claim for payment. Some courts have limited liability by enforcing mental state and pleading requirements. Additionally, there is a circuit split on calculating treble damages under the FCA. The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on individuals for fraud against the federal government by defense contractors during the Civil War. It includes provisions for treble damages and civil penalties for knowingly presenting false claims. Federal courts often require proof that the falsity of the claim is material to the government's decision to pay. The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on individuals for fraud against the federal government by defense contractors during the Civil War. An FCA cause of action against a contractor must prove its elements, including damages, \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Liability under the FCA does not require specific proof of intent to defraud. The FCA authorizes the Attorney General and certain private parties to bring a civil action against an alleged violator. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may intervene in a relator's suit within a certain time period. If the DOJ intervenes, it conducts the action; if not, the relator may proceed. The court may award the relator between 15 to 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement. Since enacting the FCA, Congress has periodically amended the act to change the extent of potential civil liability for contractors and other parties. In 1943, the Supreme Court expanded the reach of the act's qui tam provisions, allowing relators to base actions on government knowledge already made public in a criminal indictment. Congress later reversed this decision by stripping federal courts of jurisdiction over suits brought by relators when the government had prior knowledge of the alleged fraud. In 1986, Congress strengthened the False Claims Act (FCA) by restoring courts' jurisdiction over qui tam suits based on publicly disclosed information and relaxing the knowledge standard for liability. Congress later amended the FCA in 2009 with the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) in response to perceived weakening of the act. In 2009, Congress passed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) to strengthen the False Claims Act (FCA) by adding a materiality element to the \"false statements\" provision. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 further amended the FCA to reduce jurisdictional obstacles to qui tam suits. Courts have developed case law interpreting the phrase \"false or fraudulent\" in the FCA, including the implied false certification theory. The implied false certification theory allows the United States or a relator to establish the falsity of a claim for payment even when the claim is not explicitly false. Courts have varying interpretations of this theory, with some requiring compliance with governing rules to be material to the government's decision to pay the claim. Violation of a contractual provision may also make a claim false under this theory. Some courts have recognized the theory in cases where the claimant previously certified compliance with a law. The implied false certification theory is used to establish the falsity of a claim for payment, even if not explicitly false. Federal courts have adopted this theory in various circuits, finding support in the FCA's structure and legislative history. The theory has been used in civil lawsuits against contractors, with some courts recognizing it when the claimant previously certified compliance with a law. The Court of Federal Claims' 1994 opinion in Ab-Tech Construction, Inc. v. United States established the concept of \"implied certification\" in False Claims Act (FCA) cases against contractors. Ab-Tech falsely certified compliance with Small Business Administration's eligibility requirements for a contract, leading to a false claim. The court's decision in the Ab-Tech case established the concept of \"implied certification\" in False Claims Act cases. This theory applies when contractors submit claims for payment without complying with contractual or legal requirements, leading to false claims. Some courts limit the reach of this theory by requiring compliance with the law or contract as a precondition for government payment. Some courts view the False Claims Act (FCA) as not meant for minor violations or breaches of contract. Contractors must be aware of which violations may lead to FCA liability. Compliance with the law or contract may not always be a precondition for payment, but it must be material to the government's decision. Courts have limited liability for false certifications based on the contractor's knowledge. In the context of False Claims Act (FCA) liability, courts consider the contractor's knowledge of violating contractual obligations and the materiality of compliance to the government's payment decision. Government awareness of violations may impact the contractor's intent to deceive, and a plausible misinterpretation of a contract may not necessarily indicate intent to deceive without specific evidence. Some courts require specific pleading of fraud elements under the False Claims Act to avoid dismissal. The fraud in the inducement theory holds that a claim for payment becomes false due to promissory fraud. The \"promissory fraud\" theory of inducement holds that fraudulent conduct by a contractor prior to contract formation can make a claim for payment false. This can involve actions like collusive bidding, bid-rigging, or false representations about performance ability. Federal courts of appeals recognizing this theory include the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth circuits, with concerns about the government paying higher prices under fraudulently induced contracts. The Supreme Court's decision in United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess involved electrical contractors colluding to remove competition from the bidding process, leading to fraudulent contracts and government payments. This fraudulent action extended to every payment made by the government, as highlighted in a Senate committee report accompanying the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act. The Senate committee report accompanying the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act stated that any claim submitted under a contract obtained through false statements or fraudulent conduct constitutes a false claim. FCA liability can apply to contractors who underbid contracts with the intention of later seeking price increases, as seen in the case of United States ex rel. Hooper v. Lockheed Martin Corp. where Lockheed Martin allegedly underestimated costs to win a contract for space launch operations. Lockheed Martin won a contract for space launch operations by underestimating costs, leading to a dispute over the final payment amount. The Ninth Circuit ruled that false cost estimates can lead to liability under the False Claims Act, even if presented as opinions. This case sheds light on the concept of fraudulent underbidding and its implications for government contracts. Some courts recognize that intentionally undervalued bids may not render claims false under an inducement theory unless contractors seek price adjustments beyond the bid price. Contractors may underbid to secure future work with a government agency, and price adjustments can be requested for reasons other than defrauding the government. The government may add work to a contract due to changed needs or unforeseen circumstances. Federal court decisions in FCA cases show how contractors can be sued for inducing the government into a contract through underbidding, bid rigging, or false representations about product characteristics, performance, ethics, compliance, financial health, and discounts. Some courts in the Fourth Circuit have limited the use of the fraud in the inducement theory in FCA cases. Limitations aim to prevent ordinary breaches of contract from becoming FCA violations. Courts require that false statements be made in invoices or claims for payment, not just during bidding or negotiations. Additionally, a false record or statement must be material to the government's decision to pay the claim. The False Claims Act requires a causal connection between false records or statements and the payment of a claim. Allegations of kickbacks must show an increase in contract price to be valid. Courts also look for knowing actions that induce a contract, with false promises being a key factor. Government knowledge of inaccurate statements before payment may negate fraud inducement. Some courts have found that a contractor may lack knowledge when making a plausible but erroneous interpretation of a contract, without specific evidence of intent to deceive. Plaintiffs must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) when pleading falsity under fraud in the inducement theory, requiring detailed circumstances. Fraud in the inducement cannot be based on a contractor's failure to disclose information unless explicitly required by law. Courts of appeals have differing views on calculating treble damages under the False Claims Act (FCA) when a defendant has provided value to the government. The FCA mandates treble damages for violations, but does not specify how to calculate them. Federal courts have developed two methods - \"net trebling\" and \"gross trebling\" - leading to significant differences in damages. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has illustrated these differences in the case of United States v. Anchor Mortgage Corp. In United States v. Anchor Mortgage Corp., the district court applied the \"gross trebling\" approach to calculate damages for false information provided in federal guarantees of home mortgage loans. The Seventh Circuit reversed this decision, advocating for the \"net trebling\" approach, which subtracts the amount recovered from selling collateral properties before trebling the damages. The Seventh Circuit favored the \"net trebling\" approach over the \"gross trebling\" approach in calculating damages for false information in federal guarantees of home mortgage loans. This approach subtracts the amount recovered from selling collateral properties before trebling the damages, which is in line with common law contract cases. Most courts of appeals support this method, influenced by concerns of inflated claims during contract disputes. The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 addresses these issues by providing procedures for resolving disputes between the government and contractors, including penalties for unsupported claims. Daewoo Engineering Co., Ltd. v. United States illustrates the consequences of submitting a fraudulent claim during a contract dispute under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA). The CDA was enacted in 1978 to streamline the resolution of contract disputes involving government contracts. If parties cannot settle a dispute, a claim is submitted to the contracting officer for decision. Contractors may face significant civil penalties for fraudulent claims exceeding $100,000. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA) requires contractors to certify claims over $100,000 are made in good faith. The contracting officer's decision becomes final if not appealed within 90 days. Appeals can be made to agency boards or the Court of Federal Claims (COFC), with further appeals possible to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and potentially the Supreme Court. The CDA includes anti-fraud measures to prevent inflated claims. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA) includes anti-fraud measures to prevent contractors from submitting inflated claims during disputes. This provision was added to address concerns about contractors circumventing bidding procedures and later submitting claims to recover costs. The goal is to ensure that contractors support their claims and prevent fraud, supplementing existing government remedies under the False Claims Act (FCA) and Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act (FFCA). The Contract Disputes Act (CDA) includes anti-fraud measures to hold contractors accountable for unsupported claims due to misrepresentation or fraud. The contractor is liable to the Federal Government for the unsupported claim amount and related costs. The Court of Federal Claims (COFC) has jurisdiction over government counterclaims for fraud under the CDA, regardless of a final decision by the contracting officer. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA) defines \"misrepresentation of fact\" as a false statement made with intent to deceive. The government must prove falsity and intent by a preponderance of evidence. The statute of limitations for government claims against a contractor under the CDA's anti-fraud provision is six years. Courts have suggested ways for contractors to avoid liability, such as verifying claims and using plausible legal interpretations. The CDA's anti-fraud provision may result in civil penalties for contractors submitting fraudulent claims to the government. In Daewoo Engineering Co., Ltd. v. United States, the contractor faced penalties for not verifying and justifying its certified claim for a road construction project in Palau. The Federal Circuit suggests contractors ask for clarification if unsure about contract interpretation. Daewoo faced challenges with soil compaction, causing delays in contract performance. They filed a $64 million CDA claim, citing issues with a weather-delay clause and government knowledge withholding. The contracting officer denied the claim, leading Daewoo to sue for damages in the COFC, alleging misrepresentation of weather conditions by the USACE. The United States accused Daewoo of fraudulent claims related to poor weather conditions at the construction site. The COFC found Daewoo liable for acting in bad faith and imposed penalties under the CDA's anti-fraud provision and the FFCA. Daewoo's $50 million claim was rejected, and they were ordered to pay $50 million to the government for the violation. Additionally, Daewoo's contract claims were forfeited, and they were only awarded $10,000. The COFC found Daewoo liable for fraudulent claims related to poor weather conditions at the construction site. Daewoo's $50 million claim was rejected, and they were ordered to pay $50 million to the government. The COFC entered judgment for the government for only $10,000 for the contractor's FCA violation. Daewoo appealed to the Federal Circuit, arguing they had not made a \"claim\" for the $64 million in total costs. The Federal Circuit rejected this argument, confirming Daewoo had made a $64 million claim. The Federal Circuit rejected Daewoo's argument that their $50 million claim was not fraudulent. They found that Daewoo had committed fraud by assuming the government was responsible for all additional performance costs without considering other factors. Daewoo also failed to provide explanations or use outside experts to support their claim. The Federal Circuit upheld a $50 million penalty against Daewoo for violating the CDA's anti-fraud provision. Cases involving contractor fraud include false claims, inflated costs, and misrepresentation of eligibility. The FFCA allows the government to seek forfeiture of fraudulent claims in the COFC. The False Claims Act (FFCA) allows the government to seek forfeiture of fraudulent claims in the Court of Federal Claims (COFC). The FFCA was enacted in 1863 as part of a law granting new powers to the Court of Claims. It states that any person who corruptly practices fraud against the United States shall forfeit their claim. The Federal Circuit has clarified the elements of fraud, including the mental state requirement and burden of proof. The government must prove that the contractor knowingly submitted a false claim with intent to defraud. The False Claims Act (FFCA) allows the government to seek forfeiture of fraudulent claims in the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) without the need to show reliance or injury. The burden of proof is \"clear and convincing evidence.\" If fraud is found in part of a claim under a contract, forfeiture applies to all claims under that contract. Disagreements exist on whether fraud for forfeiture includes fraud in contract execution or performance. The government can seek forfeiture of a contractor's claims under the False Claims Act (FFCA) in the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) for fraudulent conduct related to claim submission. Recent cases show disputes over the scope of fraud for forfeiture and the statute of limitations for FFCA claims. Examples include contractors providing inconsistent cost explanations and claiming unrecoverable lost profits. The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA) allows federal agencies to pursue civil remedies for false claims, with a limit of $150,000 per claim. It aims to address small-dollar fraud cases that the Department of Justice may not pursue due to litigation costs. The PFCRA is similar to the False Claims Act (FCA) in imposing civil penalties on violators. The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA) allows federal agencies to impose civil penalties on violators for false claims or statements, similar to the False Claims Act (FCA). Unlike the FCA, the PFCRA follows an administrative process for recovery of civil remedies, requiring approval from a DOJ official for cases to be referred to a hearing officer. The agency must prove allegations by a preponderance of evidence, providing the alleged liable party with notice and a hearing opportunity. The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA) allows federal agencies to impose civil penalties on violators for false claims or statements. A decision on liability or damages by the hearing officer may be appealed to the agency head and federal district court. Few federal agencies use the PFCRA, with reforms recommended to increase its effectiveness in deterring fraud. The PFCRA may be updated to increase jurisdictional cap and civil penalty limit, allow agencies to retain funds, and simplify procedural requirements. Recent regulatory developments like the Mandatory Disclosure Rule and Presumed Loss Rule could impact contractors' civil liability under the FCA. The Mandatory Disclosure Rule amended the FAR to require contractors to disclose violations of federal law related to a contract or subcontract, allowing agencies to suspend or debar contractors for failure to disclose credible evidence of violations. The Mandatory Disclosure Rule amended the FAR to require contractors to disclose violations of federal law related to a contract or subcontract, allowing agencies to suspend or debar contractors for failure to disclose credible evidence of violations, including bribery, gratuity violations, False Claims Act violations, and significant overpayments on the contract. Contractors must timely disclose civil FCA violations to the relevant agency Office of the Inspector General and contracting officer when there is credible evidence of a violation by a principal or certain other parties. The Mandatory Disclosure Rule amended the FAR to require contractors to disclose violations of federal law related to a contract or subcontract, allowing agencies to suspend or debar contractors for failure to disclose credible evidence of violations. Genuine disputes over the proper application of the civil FCA may be considered in evaluating whether the contractor knowingly failed to disclose a violation. Timely disclosure of a knowing violation offers the contractor an opportunity to demonstrate its present responsibility to avoid suspension or debarment. Businesses that fraudulently obtain contracts prevent legitimate small businesses from receiving them. Congress amended the Small Business Act in 2010 to address this issue. In 2010, Congress amended the Small Business Act to address fraudulent practices in obtaining contracts. The SBA implemented these amendments in a 2013 rule known as the \"Presumed Loss Rule,\" which states that businesses willfully misrepresenting their size or status for contract eligibility will be presumed to have caused losses equal to the government's contract spending. The Presumed Loss Rule, implemented in 2013, addresses fraudulent practices in obtaining federal contracts by businesses misrepresenting their size or status. It allows a trier of fact to determine exceptions, such as unintentional errors, and may impact False Claims Act suits involving contractor fraud. The Court of Federal Claims (COFC) has declined to impose damages on contractors who fail to comply with eligibility requirements, stating that the government did not suffer damages as it got what it paid for. However, under the Presumed Loss Rule, contractors may be held liable for three times the contract amount. Preventing contractor fraud while encouraging competition for government contracts is a challenge due to the various forms of fraud that can be difficult to detect and prosecute. Fraud can be challenging to detect and prosecute due to its various forms. Federal statutes allow for the recovery of damages for false claims, with ongoing debates on liability scope. The False Claims Act (FCA) is a primary civil fraud remedy, with recent court theories expanding liability. Concerns have been raised about punitive damages under the FCA. Some courts recognize theories expanding liability under the False Claims Act (FCA), but limit their use by enforcing mental state and pleading requirements. Recent regulatory and judicial developments may impact contractors' exposure to civil liability and damages. Contractors submitting fraudulent claims during disputes pose challenges for the government, with federal statutory civil remedies in place to deter fraud against federal agencies. Sovereign immunity protects federal agencies from lawsuits and deters fraud by contractors. Courts resolving contract disputes, including fraud allegations, ensure fair competition for government contracts."
