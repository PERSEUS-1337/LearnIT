    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mathematics and Science Proficiency Partnership Act of 1999\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of mathematics and science education for connecting students to the information age and future workplaces. American students lag behind international peers in these subjects, hindering their preparation for the 21st Century economy. Urban and rural schools often lack resources to provide quality education, impacting students' ability to thrive in the information age. Urban and rural schools, along with businesses, are forming partnerships to enhance students' proficiency in mathematics, science, and information technology for the benefit of the Nation in the information age. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director will award grants to local educational agencies in urban and rural areas for information technology programs in math, science, and IT. Grant funds can be used for curriculum development, equipment purchase, and teacher training in these fields. The program described in paragraph (1) trains teachers in information technology, mathematics, and science, and provides students with specialized training in the same subjects. Eligible local educational agencies must be located in areas that have received awards from the National Science Foundation and have agreements with the private sector for services and funds. The program trains teachers in IT, math, and science, and provides specialized training for students. Eligible local educational agencies in NSF-awarded areas with private sector agreements can apply for grants. Private sector participation includes hardware/software donations, internships, mentoring, and scholarships for students. Application guidelines are set by the Director. The guidelines set by the Director require the application to include a description of proposed activities, scholarship program details, and evidence of private sector participation and financial support. The Director will establish a program and issue guidelines within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Selection of local educational agencies will be based on merit after a comprehensive review. Priority will be given to agencies with private sector commitments for services and funds. The Director will assess the effectiveness of activities under the Act and conduct a longitudinal study on scholarship recipients. The report to Congress will include graduation and employment data in STEM fields. Definitions are also provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director\" as the head of the National Science Foundation, \"eligible student\" as a 12th-grade student interested in IT, and \"local educational agency\" as an educational body. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined as an educational body according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 6. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act is $3,000,000. Maximum grant award for eligible local educational agencies is $300,000."
