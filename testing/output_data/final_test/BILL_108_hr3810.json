Congress finds that every minute, 1 woman dies from pregnancy-related complications, with 95 percent of these deaths occurring in Africa and Asia. Additionally, for every woman who dies, 15 to 30 women survive but suffer from chronic disabilities, including obstetric fistula, which is a serious condition caused by prolonged obstructed labor. This results in a hole between the bladder and vagina or rectum and vagina, leading to significant tissue damage. Obstetric fistula is a serious condition caused by prolonged obstructed labor, resulting in a hole between the bladder or rectum and vagina, leading to tissue damage. It affects women who survive obstructed labor, with high maternal mortality rates in Ethiopia due to factors like early pregnancy, poverty, and FGM. Treatment is limited, with only one hospital in Addis Ababa performing over 1,000 fistula operations annually. Obstetric fistula is a serious condition caused by prolonged obstructed labor, resulting in a hole between the bladder or rectum and vagina. It leads to physical, social, and emotional trauma for women, with symptoms including incontinence, infections, infertility, and isolation. The World Health Organization estimates over 2,000,000 women live with fistula, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases each year. Obstetric fistula is preventable through medical care and surgery, with success rates close to 90%. The UNFPA launched a campaign in 2003 to address fistula in Africa and Asia. The UNFPA campaign aims to address obstetric fistula in Africa and Asia by providing surgery, training medical staff, equipping hospitals, and conducting community outreach. The United States Government has provided financial support to UNFPA, and the organization is working in 89 countries to reduce maternal death and disability. In the winter of 2001, the Secretary of State expressed support for the UNFPA to secure funding. The United States pledged $600,000 in October 2001 to address reproductive health care needs of Afghan refugees. Congress showed bipartisan support for a voluntary contribution of up to $34,000,000 in 2002. The Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002 was passed by the House of Representatives and Senate, signed into law by the President in January 2002. In May 2002, a delegation sent by the President to investigate UNFPA programs in China found allegations of coercive abortion practices to be untrue. The Administration overruled its own delegation's recommendation to release $34,000,000 in funding to UNFPA, citing a broad interpretation of the law. The Administration overruled its own delegation's recommendation to release $34,000,000 in funding to UNFPA for prevention, remedy, and repair of obstetric fistula."
