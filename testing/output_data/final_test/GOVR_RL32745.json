    "content": "The Final Report of the 9/11 Commission highlighted the challenges in U.S. policy towards Pakistan and South Asia, emphasizing the divergent national security objectives between the two countries. Despite concerns about Pakistan's nuclear proliferation activities, the U.S. has maintained a long-term commitment to the military-dominated government. This relationship dates back to mutual security agreements in the 1950s as part of the U.S. \"Containment\" policy towards the Soviet Union. During the 1980s, Pakistan exploited its role as a conduit for aid to the anti-Soviet Afghan mujahidin to avoid U.S. nuclear nonproliferation sanctions and receive $600 million annually in U.S. military and economic aid. This led to the development of Pakistan's nuclear weapons capability while receiving significant U.S. assistance. During the 1980s, the United States inadvertently supported the rise of radical Islamic terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Taliban through its assistance to Pakistan. This unintended consequence highlights the complex relationship between the two countries, especially concerning nuclear nonproliferation efforts and the risk of Pakistan falling under the control of radical Islamists. The report explores gaining leverage with Pakistan on proliferation without jeopardizing cooperation on terrorism. Congress endorsed a $3 billion assistance package for Pakistan but expressed concerns about its cooperation in eliminating A.Q. Khan's nuclear supply network. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 did not tie U.S. assistance to Pakistan to specific nonproliferation requirements. The U.S. aims to combat terrorism and prevent nuclear proliferation in Pakistan, but these objectives have often conflicted, particularly regarding promoting democracy and preventing nuclear proliferation. Former Representative Lee Hamilton highlighted Pakistan as a challenging issue in achieving these goals. Press reports in late December 2004 and early 2005 revealed the extensive covert supply network established by A.Q. Khan, highlighting the challenges in addressing both terrorist and nuclear proliferation threats in U.S. policy towards Pakistan. Evidence gathered by the Bush Administration and the IAEA indicated that Khan's network may be more extensive than previously assumed, with discoveries in Libya pointing to Pakistan as the source of Iran's uranium enrichment know-how. The A.Q. Khan network, suspected of supplying centrifuges to North Korea, was also involved in transporting uranium hexafluoride gas to Libya. Another illicit trafficking ring was discovered in 2004, exporting sensitive U.S. technology to Pakistan for its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Israeli arms dealer Asher Karni pleaded guilty to charges related to exporting dual-use U.S. technology to Pakistan. The A.Q. Khan network, involved in nuclear proliferation activities, supplied centrifuges to North Korea and transported uranium hexafluoride gas to Libya. Another trafficking ring exported sensitive U.S. technology to Pakistan for its nuclear and missile programs. Israeli arms dealer Asher Karni pleaded guilty to exporting dual-use technology to Pakistan, including high-speed switches used in nuclear weapons. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. potentially subordinating its nuclear nonproliferation interests to other policy objectives. Pending legislation in the 109th Congress reflects some Members' desire to recalibrate the balance between U.S. counterterrorism and nonproliferation objectives. These initiatives condition U.S. assistance on more cooperation from Pakistan regarding A.Q. Khan's network and curtailment of actions opposing U.S. efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. The report recounts failed efforts to reconcile conflicting American regional security and nuclear nonproliferation policy objectives regarding Pakistan, documents A.Q. Khan's role in supplying nuclear technology to rogue states, and considers issues regarding the nature and objectives of these activities. The report discusses U.S. options for gaining nuclear nonproliferation cooperation from Pakistan and outlines the need for hard choices and long-term commitments. It also addresses the challenges of balancing support for the Musharraf government with other U.S. interests like democracy and non-proliferation. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of supporting President Pervez Musharraf's government in Pakistan to combat terrorism and prevent nuclear proliferation. The report acknowledged Pakistan's potential to be a source of technology and know-how for proliferation but focused more on maintaining stability and cooperation in the fight against Al Qaeda. The 9/11 Commission Report acknowledges Pakistan's potential as a source of nuclear technology but also raises concerns about proliferation. It highlights A.Q. Khan's role in establishing illegal covert networks for global transfer of nuclear materials and recommends multilateral solutions to address the threat of nuclear proliferation. The report calls for expanding initiatives like the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and the Nunn-Lugar Act to combat smuggling activities. The Bush Administration and Congress are urged to provide substantial assistance to Pakistan to bolster Musharraf and gain antiterrorist cooperation, despite concerns about democracy and nuclear proliferation. President Musharraf faces difficult choices due to public opposition in Pakistan towards U.S. policy. President Musharraf faces challenges due to public opposition in Pakistan towards U.S. policy in the Middle East, including the war in Iraq and support of Israel. The U.S. perception as an unreliable ally stems from fundamental differences in expectations, leading to reluctance in supporting Pakistan in past conflicts with India. Pakistan's nuclear proliferation concerns escalated after India's 1974 test, despite its smaller technological base. Pakistan's response to China's 1965 nuclear test focused on obtaining nuclear materials and technology from abroad. US efforts to prevent Pakistan from acquiring nuclear capabilities were undermined by A.Q. Khan's secret program to produce high-enriched uranium. Khan stole plans for an enrichment facility while working at a European nuclear facility in the Netherlands in 1983. A.Q. Khan stole plans for a uranium enrichment facility in the Netherlands in 1983, leading to a conviction for nuclear espionage. His success in acquiring materials and technology made it difficult for the US to prevent Pakistan from obtaining nuclear weapons. US efforts were overtaken by Cold War developments, with Congress playing a key role in shaping nonproliferation policy. In the late 1970s, Congress enacted nuclear nonproliferation provisions to the Foreign Assistance Act due to concerns about India's misuse of U.S. and Canadian nuclear assistance. These provisions banned economic and military aid to countries not complying with IAEA inspections or involved in nuclear technology transfer. The Arms Export Control Act now contains provisions related to the sale of U.S. uranium fuel to countries accepting IAEA inspections. In 1979, the U.S. cut off assistance to Pakistan for secret uranium enrichment activities. In 1979, U.S. relations with Pakistan deteriorated after the discovery of Pakistan's secret uranium enrichment program and a mob attack on the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. The U.S. shifted its policy priorities due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. President Carter's National Security Advisor emphasized the need to address the new security concerns. In 1979, Brzezinski advised the President to repair relations with Pakistan for their support against the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan, prioritizing it over nonproliferation concerns. Congress supported this shift in policy by allowing the President to waive certain provisions for six years and providing $3.2 billion in economic and military assistance to Pakistan. In 1985, despite warnings, Pakistan continued developing nuclear weapons capability and attempted to export dual-use materials in violation of U.S. laws. President Zia ul-Haq asserted Pakistan's right to obtain technology, stating it would benefit the Islamic world. The Reagan Administration accepted the Pressler Amendment in response to evidence of Pakistan's nuclear program. The Pressler Amendment required annual certification from the President that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device for U.S. assistance. President Reagan and President George H. W. made such findings for three years, but in 1990, President Bush could no longer certify, leading to the suspension of most economic and all military assistance to Pakistan. The 9/11 Commission highlighted Pakistan's belief that past U.S. support was self-serving, linked to the imposition of sanctions in 1989 after the Soviet army's withdrawal from Afghanistan. The withdrawal of the Soviet army from Afghanistan in 1989 led to the imposition of sanctions on Pakistan. In 1998, when India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons, most proliferation-related sanctions were waived by Congress and the Clinton Administration. This decision was influenced by doubts about the effectiveness of sanctions, efforts to protect U.S. agricultural markets, and the growing influence of the India caucus in Congress. Legislation in July 1998 made Pakistan eligible for agricultural export credits to purchase U.S. winter wheat. In October 1998, Congress made the President's authority to waive economic sanctions permanent, extending it to military assistance, foreign military sales credits, and exports to high technology entities. India benefited from these relaxations, but Pakistan remained ineligible for most U.S. assistance due to General Musharraf's military coup and debt repayment issues. The 9/11 attacks changed Pakistan's status significantly. The 9/11 attacks changed Pakistan's status from a problem country to a critical regional ally, but raised concerns about Pakistan's nuclear activities. Experts emphasize the importance of preventing terrorists from accessing Pakistan's nuclear weapons, questioning President Musharraf's reliability in this regard. Some doubt Pakistan's commitment to fighting terrorism and exercising nuclear restraint, citing past connections between the ISI and terrorist groups. Pakistan's official alliance with the United States in the war on terror has increased the danger posed by al-Qaeda sympathizers within its nuclear establishment. Musharraf's refusal to provide adequate information about A.Q. Khan's network is seen as a significant factor. Without additional nonproliferation policy initiatives, supporting Musharraf may not be enough to address the risk posed by Pakistan's nuclear establishment. Pakistan remains a significant source of proliferation risk, outside the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Pakistan, not bound by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has been involved in covert acquisition of nuclear-related technologies since the mid-1970s. Dr. A.Q. Khan's activities have raised doubts about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Dr. A.Q. Khan worked for a European nuclear consortium in the early 1970s before being asked by Pakistan's Prime Minister to lead a uranium enrichment project. Khan returned to Pakistan with secret plans for a Dutch-designed centrifuge assembly. Despite obstacles from the U.S. and European governments, Pakistan made progress towards producing weapons-grade uranium by the mid-1980s. A.Q. Khan and his network sold nuclear technology to countries like Iran, Libya, and North Korea from the 1980s through 2002. President Bush outlined aspects of Khan's network, including operations in Pakistan, a factory in Malaysia, and front companies in Dubai. Operatives in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were involved in purchasing activities. A.Q. Khan's confession in Dubai revealed his network's nuclear technology sales to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. The 12-page confession, signed under pressure, detailed his activities after a two-month investigation by the Pakistani government. Khan's activities were brought to light following related proliferation investigations in Iran and Libya. Pakistan admitted in December 2003 to its WMD programs and foreign sources of procurement. In February 2004, they acknowledged selling nuclear technology to Iran and Libya. Despite denials from both governments, U.S. officials testified that Khan provided nuclear technology to North Korea. President Bush mentioned in a speech that Khan supplied designs for centrifuges to these countries. There are theories of bartering technology with North Korea, but President Musharraf claimed they paid for it. Khan's network sold a range of technology to various countries. Pakistan's Abdul Qadeer Khan provided nuclear technology, including centrifuge designs, to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Assistance began in the late 1980s and continued into the early 2000s. Khan's network supplied a full range of technology, from blueprints to nuclear weapon designs. A.Q. Khan provided advanced centrifuge technology to Iran and Libya. There are reports that the nuclear weapon design received by Libya may have originated from Pakistan. Experts believe Khan had support from elements in the Pakistani military and civilian nuclear establishment. Secretary of State Colin Powell accepted President Musharraf's denial of knowledge of Khan's activities. President Musharraf denied knowledge of A.Q. Khan's activities, but U.S. officials were unable to access Khan. Questions about Musharraf's credibility were raised after the arrest of Asher Karni for illegally exporting U.S. technology to Pakistan. Karni was caught with high-speed electrical switches used in nuclear weapons. Asher Karni was caught illegally exporting U.S. technology to Pakistan, including triggered spark gaps rendered useless by the manufacturer. Karni admitted guilt to Federal felony charges and provided information on exports to government agencies in India involved in nuclear weapons and missile research. Asher Karni engaged a New Jersey-based front company to purchase triggered spark gaps under false pretenses and shipped them using a chain of companies in different countries. The items were addressed to a South African hospital to exploit export regulations. The shipment from Giza Technologies was addressed to a South African hospital, but the actual recipient was Karni's company, Top-Cape Technology in Cape Town. Karni sold sensitive dual-use technology to labs connected with India's space program, raising concerns about potential use by other countries like Iran. Additionally, Humayun Khan's ties to the AJKMC, a group supporting Pakistani militants in Kashmir, further raised alarms for U.S. officials. The package was picked up in Islamabad by an employee of the AJKMC Lithography Aid Society, linked to the Agha Khan Foundation. The AJKMC Lithography Aid Society, linked to the Agha Khan Foundation, may have ulterior motives as it confused lithotripters with lithography. U.S. officials suspect the organization of illegal exports destined for the Pakistani military or other countries seeking nuclear weapons. Despite denials from the Pakistani government, some officials believe there is a connection to the transactions. Some U.S. officials suspect Pakistani military figures of involvement in illegal technology orders, possibly linked to A.Q. Khan. There is reluctance to pursue the case aggressively due to concerns about jeopardizing anti-terrorism cooperation. Secretary of State Colin Powell mentioned evidence of Pakistani involvement in nuclear technology spread, but Pakistan's response is unknown. The struggle between federal agencies enforcing U.S. nonproliferation laws and policymakers prioritizing cooperation with Pakistan is evident in the handling of the Humayun Khan case. This reflects a larger tug-of-war where nonproliferation policy takes a back seat to antiterrorism cooperation with Islamabad. Critics are concerned about the Administration's priorities in pressuring Pakistan for cooperation. The State Department blocked a request by other departments to send investigators to Pakistan, potentially hindering efforts to track technology transfers. U.S. investigators are pursuing leads in various countries, with some officials criticizing the lack of forceful requests for cooperation. Humayun Khan was indicted for violating export control laws but remains free in Pakistan. Humayun Khan faces charges for violating U.S. export control laws, with a potential maximum sentence of 35 years. Concerns have been raised about Pakistan and India's nuclear weapons capabilities and the risk of a proliferation \"chain reaction\" if their arsenals continue to expand unchecked. In early 2005, U.S. officials acknowledged Pakistan's intent to upgrade its nuclear capability, potentially including illegal technology exports from the United States. The U.S. government has limited leverage over Pakistan due to its crucial cooperation in the war on terrorism. Officials highlighted the distinction between proliferation to nuclear powers and terrorists, emphasizing the need to address Pakistan's efforts to enhance its nuclear capabilities. Pakistan's efforts to enhance its nuclear capabilities have raised concerns, with U.S. officials noting the country's intent to upgrade its nuclear capability. There are challenges in preventing proliferation to nuclear powers and terrorists, as Pakistan has its own program that they are trying to keep. The U.S. government has limited leverage over Pakistan due to their cooperation in the war on terrorism. In 2000, U.S. officials raised suspicions about activities at Khan Research Laboratory (KRL) to Pakistani officials, leading to an investigation and Khan's early retirement in 2001. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage suggested retired nuclear agency employees could be spreading technology to states like North Korea, causing confusion later clarified as limited to missile cooperation. President Musharraf mentioned in 2004 that the information provided by U.S. officials years ago was not specific enough for action. Pakistan's extensive official cooperation with Iran, Libya, and North Korea, including nuclear cooperation agreements and missile cooperation, was known to the intelligence community. Despite intelligence information and rumors about Pakistani contacts with radical states seeking nuclear weapons, Congress received limited specific information to take action. Despite intelligence information and rumors about Pakistani contacts with radical states seeking nuclear weapons, Congress has received limited specific information on this issue. The CIA's reports to Congress do not highlight Pakistani involvement in supplying WMD technology, with Pakistan only being mentioned as a potential new supplier in the report ending June 2000. Pakistan is not included in the list of key suppliers like China, Russia, and North Korea, and is not mentioned in the report covering the period to June 2002 on \"Emerging State and Non-State Suppliers.\" Non-State Suppliers are mentioned in the text, with a focus on the increasing capability of non-state actors to provide WMD-related technology and equipment. South Asia is highlighted as a region of key suppliers, but there is no direct mention of Pakistan, Iran, Libya, or North Korea in connection with foreign suppliers. The report emphasizes the growing number of knowledgeable individuals or non-state purveyors who can act independently of governments in supplying such technology. The report highlights concerns about non-state actors supplying WMD-related technology, with a focus on South Asia. There is no direct mention of Pakistan, Iran, Libya, or North Korea as foreign suppliers. The A.Q. Khan network's role in supplying nuclear technology to these countries is mentioned, along with concerns about commercial purveyors of dual-use technologies circumventing export control regimes. The U.S. intelligence community does not identify Pakistan as a significant source of nuclear technology for Iran. During the Iran-Iraq War, Iran focused on rebuilding its nuclear program, with Russia stepping in to assist after other governments declined. The U.S. was concerned about Iran obtaining nuclear technology from Russian scientists. Reports mentioned Russia and China as suppliers to Iran's nuclear program, with Iran seeking technology from various sources, especially Russia. By 2002, the U.S. intelligence community suspected Iran of seeking foreign fissile material and technology for weapons development. Transfers to Libya were also noted. The U.S. intelligence community suspected Iran and Libya of acquiring foreign fissile material and technology for weapons development. Libya received centrifuge components from A.Q. Khan in 1997, with reports hinting at a nuclear cooperation agreement with Moscow. Libya used its secret services to obtain technical information on WMD, including nuclear weapons. The reports suggest that Libya obtained technical information on WMD, including nuclear weapons, but there is less evidence of A.Q. Khan's willingness to provide nuclear weapons design plans. Concerns about North Korea's uranium enrichment program date back to the mid-1980s, with reports of procurement of enrichment-related equipment from Pakistan. U.S. intelligence agencies had no evidence of an actual enrichment program until a senior North Korean official reportedly admitted it during a confrontational meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly. Since a confrontational meeting in Pyongyang in October 2002, North Korea has denied possessing a nuclear program. The U.S. intelligence community knew of A.Q. Khan's trips to North Korea, suggesting possible collaboration in nuclear or missile technology. In November 2002, the CIA reported North Korea's uranium enrichment capabilities, confirming construction of a centrifuge facility. The CIA concluded in 2000 that North Korea started a uranium enrichment program using centrifuges. By 2001, North Korea was acquiring materials for this program. Reports in 2002 suggested Pakistan provided aid with centrifuge designs and rotor assemblies. North Korea's attempts to procure aluminum and construction activities raised concerns in the United States. North Korea attempted to obtain materials from China, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, and Europe for its nuclear program. Reports to Congress in the late 1990s and early 2000s mentioned Pyongyang seeking technology worldwide but did not directly link any procurement to nuclear weapons. Pakistan provided most assistance related to rotors for North Korea's uranium enrichment program. The report on North Korea's nuclear program in 2002 noted their acquisition of centrifuge-related materials, with no clear evidence of procurement until mid-2002. CIA Director George Tenet confirmed Pyongyang's pursuit of a uranium enrichment program based on A.Q. Khan's technology in 2004. The Musharraf government's trustworthiness as a security partner for the United States hinges on the extent of Pakistani government and military involvement in A.Q. Khan's nuclear proliferation activities to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Khan's actions, driven by ego and financial gain, required cooperation from Pakistani military and possibly civilian officials due to tight security around nuclear facilities. This section evaluates Khan's role and Pakistan's credibility. The text discusses A.Q. Khan's role in nuclear proliferation and questions Pakistan's denial of involvement at the policy level. Khan enriched himself through his activities, receiving millions of dollars from Iran and purchasing real estate. He shared expertise on uranium enrichment with Iran and may have received a villa as compensation. Khan denies traveling to Iran, with reports suggesting he had significant autonomy in his activities. A.Q. Khan had significant autonomy and a blank check at the Khan Research Laboratory, allowing him to buy anything at any price. His reputation as a national hero in Pakistan was manufactured, overshadowing other scientists' contributions to the nuclear weapons program. Despite Khan's critical role in acquiring plans for an uranium enrichment facility, much of the nuclear weapons production process was overseen by a lead scientist at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) scientist Samar Mubarikmand may have used A.Q. Khan and the Khan Research Laboratory (KRL) as a decoy to divert attention from PAEC's nuclear weapons work. President Musharraf's lenient treatment of Khan, despite serious breaches of Pakistani law, raises questions of official culpability. The Pakistani government was lax in responding to rumors of Khan's activities even before the 1998 nuclear test. Before Pakistan's 1998 nuclear test, scientists at KRL warned officials about suspicious activities by A.Q. Khan. Reports suggest Khan's daughter smuggled documents implicating senior military officers. Despite this, Khan's reputation as the father of Pakistan's nuclear program led to praise from President Musharraf at his retirement dinner in March 2001. In 2003, evidence implicating A.Q. Khan in a proliferation ring was presented to President Musharraf by U.S. officials. Detailed intelligence on Khan's movements raised suspicions, and centrifuge equipment shipments to Libya were intercepted, leading to Qadaffi renouncing weapons of mass destruction by December 2003. In October and December 2003, Libyan leader Qadaffi renounced his weapons of mass destruction programs after revealing assistance provided by A.Q. Khan. Pakistani nuclear scientists were detained for questioning in connection to Iranian uranium enrichment facilities, leading to criticism of the government for scapegoating lower-level scientists to appease the United States. Pakistan detained nuclear scientists to prevent them from talking to foreign investigators or journalists. A.Q. Khan was fired from his position and placed under house arrest, leading to speculation about the true motives behind the actions taken by the government. A.Q. Khan was under house arrest in Pakistan's capital and signed a confession admitting to providing uranium enrichment technologies to Iran, North Korea, and Libya. Motives for his actions included personal gain, diverting attention from Pakistan's nuclear program, bolstering Islamic solidarity, defying the West, becoming a hero in the Islamic world, and gaining wealth. Khan's proliferation ring earned $100 million from deals with Libya. In February 2004, A.Q. Khan revealed that top Pakistani military officers, including Gen. Musharraf, were aware of his assistance to North Korea and Iran in uranium enrichment efforts. Khan also implicated former Army Chief General Mirza Aslam Beg and two other Army chiefs in approving his efforts for North Korea. In September 2004, former army chief Jehangir Karamat, who was Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States, was implicated in A.Q. Khan's nuclear proliferation activities. Khan publicly accepted blame for the proliferation, seeking to atone for the pain caused to the nation. President Musharraf granted a recommendation from his cabinet that A.Q. Khan not be prosecuted for proliferation activities, but the pardon was conditional. Doubts arose about Khan's actions without support from military officers. Several scientists and officials from KRL were arrested, including Mohammed Farooq and Islam-ul Haq. On February 11, Pakistan's Foreign Minister stated that nobody would be spared in the ongoing criminal investigation, including Khan. Four civilian scientists and three retired military officers were charged with proliferation-related crimes. President Musharraf admitted on February 9 that he had long suspected Khan's involvement in proliferation activities. Musharraf and Pakistan's ISI became suspicious of Khan's activities in Dubai after Musharraf's coup in 1999. President Musharraf became suspicious of Khan's activities in Dubai and decided to put an end to his involvement in proliferation activities. Despite Khan's popularity, Musharraf forced him to retire as the head of Khan Research Laboratories due to continued insubordination. Musharraf's main concern was to avoid jeopardizing his desire to lift remaining U.S. economic and military sanctions. President Musharraf forced Khan to retire as head of Khan Research Laboratories for insubordination, putting him in a difficult political position. Opposition parties accused the government of covering up the military's role in proliferation and appeasing the United States. Some commentators argued that the Pakistani state should not be held accountable for Khan's actions, citing his total control of KRL and lack of evidence linking his actions to KRL policy. General Beg, suspected of anti-U.S. tendencies, had a meeting with a U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense in 1990. General Beg mentioned the possibility of sharing nuclear technology with Iran if the U.S. did not provide adequate support. President Bush's decision led to the cutoff of military and economic assistance to Pakistan. Beg denied controlling A.Q. Khan, attributing that role to Benazir Bhutto and Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Accusations against Bhutto and Khan were also made by former President Leghari. Former Pakistani President Farooq Leghari claimed full knowledge of the country's nuclear weapons program, denying involvement in proliferation activities and placing blame on A.Q. Khan. Gen. Imtiaz pressured Khan to transfer outdated centrifuges to Iran. Denials by Gen. Beg regarding transfers to Iran were deemed less than credible, with a former nuclear scientist stating that nothing happens in the Pakistani nuclear sphere without the chief of army staff's knowledge. Beg himself stated that the Pakistani Army never controlled the country's nuclear program. Benazir Bhutto claimed ultimate authority over Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, stating that Khan could not have acted alone. She rejected requests to export nuclear technology and accused senior officials of covering up their involvement. Beg allegedly approached PM Nawaz Sharif in 1991 to sell nuclear technology to Iran, with reports of an agreement with Iran for assistance in their nuclear program in exchange for weapons and oil. In 1991, Beg allegedly sought to help Iran with its nuclear program in exchange for weapons and oil to form a \"grand alliance\" against American power. Khan denies the accusations. The public reaction in Pakistan was nationalistic and anti-American, criticizing bias in singling out Pakistan and ignoring other countries' nuclear programs. There were warnings of Western threats to dismantle Pakistan's nuclear program through intrusive inspections. Former ISI chief Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul suggested that the United States would exploit the situation to gain joint custody of Pakistan's nuclear weapons to the total satisfaction of Israel. Civilian politicians and analysts suggested that Khan was falling on his sword to protect others in the Pakistani government and military involved in proliferation activities. Some believed the events leading to Khan's confession and pardon were scripted and endorsed by the U.S. government to protect a key counterterrorism ally. The Bush Administration maintained that there was no evidence of top Pakistani officials being complicit in Khan's proliferation activities. The Bush Administration found insufficient evidence to trigger U.S. nonproliferation laws regarding Khan's activities, despite not asking for access to him. Some U.S. officials have expressed impatience for greater cooperation from Pakistan, as little new information has been provided about Khan's nuclear weapon plans. Access to his chief assistant, Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir, has not been granted. The Bush Administration did not gain access to A.Q. Khan's chief assistant, Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir, who is jailed in Malaysia. U.S. officials downplayed concerns about Khan's lenient treatment by President Musharraf, with Condoleezza Rice stating that Khan has been \"brought to justice\" by being out of the nuclear business he loved. The Bush Administration did not have access to A.Q. Khan's assistant, Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir, who is imprisoned in Malaysia. Secretary of State Colin Powell and State Department officials believed that the investigation into Khan's activities should be handled internally by Pakistan, with Powell expressing confidence in Pakistan's ability to provide full disclosure and eliminate Khan's network. Many Pakistani analysts approved Musharraf's pardon of Khan, stating his activities did not breach international laws. However, the IAEA Director-General called Khan \"the tip of an iceberg\" and questioned the investigation's effectiveness. The New York Times criticized Pakistan's military involvement in illicit activities, while Indian reactions dismissed the pardon as a charade to protect the military. The Bush administration justified setting aside nonproliferation concerns in Pakistan by emphasizing the need for cooperation against terrorism. The stability of Musharraf's government and the importance of maintaining Pakistani cooperation are highlighted to avoid past cycles of engagement and disengagement with Pakistan. The Musharraf government's stability and the future of Pakistani policy post-Musharraf are crucial for US interests in combating terrorism. Concerns about Pakistani democratization and human rights impacting terrorism and extremism have been raised in Congressional oversight. The military continues to dominate Pakistan's decision-making process, with democratic institutions weakened and political parties marginalized. Analysts question the effectiveness of Pakistan's democracy post-2002 elections, citing the military's profound influence. Critics reject the notion of President Musharraf as a \"best hope\" for stability, highlighting concerns about his policies and US support for military regimes. President Musharraf's stability in Pakistan is supported by his policies and backing from the United States. Despite being popular among Pakistanis, he faces opposition from Islamic radicals, with 65% supporting Osama bin Laden. His government relies on an alliance of Islamist parties to maintain a majority in parliament and control in two provinces. Musharraf's decision to renege on stepping down as Army commander has raised doubts about the Islamist parties' support. President Musharraf's decision to break his commitment to step down as Army commander at the end of the year, made in 2003 to secure support from Islamic parties, has raised doubts about his popularity. Despite facing opposition from Islamic radicals, his stability in Pakistan is supported by policies and backing from the United States. The events of September 11, 2001, have helped strengthen Musharraf's grip on power. Some analysts believe Musharraf's power is supported by U.S. backing and his ability to govern effectively. The advance of democracy in Pakistan is seen as crucial for long-term U.S. policy success in the region, but supporting Musharraf is deemed necessary in the short term. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. preference for bolstering Musharraf's authoritarian leadership over Pakistan's democratic institutions and civil society. Some analysts believe Musharraf's power is supported by U.S. backing, but doubts about his popularity persist. Pakistani commentators emphasize the need for secular political parties for stable democracy. American policymakers generally support Musharraf, despite concerns about the slow pace of change in Pakistan's policies. American policymakers generally support Musharraf as a strong and secure leader in Pakistan, despite doubts about his potential as a reformer. The presence of a stable and secular military institution is seen as preferable to the risk of an unstable, possibly Islamicized state with nuclear weapons. However, concerns arise as Pakistan's law-and-order situation deteriorates in 2004, threatening the country's fragile democratic institutions. The United States closely monitors Pakistan's domestic political developments, particularly the issue of political succession and control of the country's nuclear arsenal. The constitutionally designated successor to the President is currently a member of the military-friendly Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid-e-Azam party. Analysts believe the Pakistani military will continue to play a significant role in the country's administration. The Pakistani military is expected to maintain control in the event of President Musharraf's premature removal, potentially declaring martial law if his removal is violent. Despite doubts about political institutions surviving his removal, the military's hierarchical solidarity and professionalism are seen as stabilizing in the short- and middle-term. After the September 2001 policy shift, Musharraf purged pro-Taliban Islamists from the military, promoting Lt. Gen. Muhammad Yusuf to Vice Chief of the Army Staff for sensitive negotiations with the US. Lt. Gen. Ehsan-ul Haq was appointed as the new Director General of the ISI, replacing an officer with ties to the Taliban. After Gen. Yusuf retired in October 2004, Musharraf named Lt. Gen. Ahsan Salim Hayat as the new VCOAS. Hayat narrowly escaped assassination in a June 2004 attack, confirming his status as an enemy of Islamic extremists. Lt. Gen. Ashfaq Kiani replaced ISI chief Lt. Gen. Ehsan-ul Haq, who had removed pro-Taliban officers from Pakistan's intelligence service after September 2001. Musharraf shifted Haq to the less powerful position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Lt. Gen. Hayat, the new VCOAS, may oversee operations against Al Qaeda and the ISI. Evidence suggests Pakistan is involved in illegal nuclear activities, posing risks of nuclear materials falling into the wrong hands. U.S. military support to Pakistan could inadvertently destabilize the region. U.S. policies to strengthen Pakistan militarily may disrupt positive trends in Pakistan-India relations, risking conflict escalation to a nuclear exchange. The focus is on preventing nuclear proliferation to rogue states and terrorist groups. The Administration aims to prevent nuclear proliferation to rogue states and terrorist groups by improving global interdiction efforts through the Proliferation Security Initiative. President Bush proposed measures such as criminalizing proliferation, expanding cooperative threat reduction, and banning enrichment capabilities to address the nuclear black market threat. In June 2004, President Bush designated Pakistan as a Major Non-NATO Ally, granting expedited access to defense articles. The designation was related to Pakistan's decision to purchase major weapons systems, including maritime patrol aircraft and missiles. Pakistan tested a Shaheen nuclear-capable short-range ballistic missile on December 8, 2004, coinciding with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's visit to India to discuss arms sales and military cooperation. India sought to acquire U.S. Patriot ballistic missile defense systems and explore obtaining Israel's Arrow battlefield missile defense system. India objected to the sale of P-3C surveillance aircraft and TOW anti-tank missiles. The United States may have options for pursuing a stronger antiproliferation policy while supporting Pakistan in the war against terrorism. One approach is to provide economic and military support conditioned on Pakistani cooperation against terrorism. The 9/11 Commission Report views President Musharraf as crucial for stability in Pakistan and Afghanistan, recommending fresh commitments with promises of preparedness. The United States should make promises it is willing to keep for years to reduce Pakistani suspicion and increase President Musharraf's confidence in confronting terrorism. However, this option may have limited nonproliferation benefits and high risks, as it does not fully address Musharraf's authority in antiterrorist cooperation. Despite strong support for Musharraf's government, the Bush Administration has not fully obtained Pakistani cooperation against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Musharraf risks backlash from nationalist and Islamist elements if he adopts a zero-tolerance policy against terrorist networks. The future of Pakistan's frontline status against terrorism is uncertain due to its volatile political situation and the impatience of Islamist forces with Musharraf's moderate approach. The Pakistani government, despite some efforts to suppress domestic jihadists and terrorist groups, still faces challenges in fully supporting U.S. policy and controlling ideological fissures within the military. There are concerns about the military's susceptibility to radical influences and the potential for violent Islamist campaigns or internal coups. Musharraf's ability to control events is questioned, especially in light of rumors in late 2004. Rumors in late 2004 and early 2005 suggested Musharraf was in secret negotiations for a power-sharing agreement with the leaders of the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League. The deal would involve Musharraf remaining President until 2007 but giving up his position as Chief of the Army Staff and holding fresh parliamentary elections in 2005. This potential development could be seen as a positive step towards democratization, but ending his alliance with the MMA could lead to a new political crisis. The rumored power-sharing agreement with Musharraf raises concerns about Pakistan's stability and nuclear policies. The U.S. Government questions the assurances regarding A.Q. Khan's nuclear sales and Pakistan's vertical proliferation activities. Illegal exports of U.S. technology in 2003 highlight potential risks. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by Pakistan under Musharraf's leadership may impact stability and moderation. The discovery of Karni's activities in acquiring sensitive technology was only by luck and the vigilance of a company, highlighting potential risks in U.S.-Pakistani cooperation against terrorism. The U.S. could increase assistance and cooperation with South Africa to prevent illegal exports of dual-use technology. The U.S. could suspend South Africa's Nuclear Suppliers Group privileges due to weak enforcement of export laws. This approach focuses on recipient-side controls to prevent nuclear proliferation, rather than penalizing specific countries or individuals. The Bush administration is focusing on improving global interdiction efforts through the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. President Bush proposed expanding interdiction efforts under the PSI to shut down labs, seize materials, and freeze assets. The initiative, supported by multiple countries, aims to restrict access to capabilities needed for nuclear weapons production. Undersecretary of State John Bolton has described the PSI as a key effort to stop WMD proliferation, supported by over 60 countries. The 9/11 Commission recommended expanding the initiative to include Russia and China, and provide NATO alliance resources. Including Russia, China, and supplier states is crucial for PSI effectiveness. Critics urge Pakistan to reinforce promises with concrete actions to prevent proliferation. Proliferation specialists see potential in the PSI but note limitations due to various factors. Critics welcome the PSI but note limitations, including its ad hoc nature dependent on political will. They suggest bolstering it with changes in international law, such as amendments to existing conventions and U.N. resolutions for interdiction activities. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 requires all states to adopt laws against WMD transfers. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 bans states from aiding non-state actors in acquiring chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. It requires states to tighten export controls and report on efforts to comply with the resolution by October 28, 2004. The resolution establishes a legal basis for interdiction or sanctions in case of non-compliance. The international community is working on enforcing the Additional Protocol as a prerequisite for nuclear imports through the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Efforts to combat nuclear proliferation are seen as a weak point in the President's National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction. Funding for non-proliferation programs in FY2004 was less than $2. The FY2004 funding for non-proliferation programs was significantly lower than funding for Homeland Security and military counter-proliferation efforts. Cooperation from host governments is crucial to shutting down the black market trade in nuclear technology. Iran's defiance of the IAEA and the U.N. Security Council highlights the challenges of multilateral approaches. Expanding the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to Pakistan faces obstacles, especially regarding access to A.Q. Khan. Expanding the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to Pakistan may be challenging due to legal and political restrictions, lack of transparency, and Pakistan's focus on nuclear deterrence. Pakistan is willing to cooperate on denying nuclear technology to terrorists but intends to modernize its own nuclear forces. The United States may insist on improved cooperation from Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues before providing high-value military equipment, such as F-16 aircraft and anti-tank weapons. This could include longer-term waiver authority on U.S. nuclear and missile proliferation sanctions. The United States may require Pakistan's agreement to full cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues before providing high-value military equipment, such as F-16 aircraft and anti-tank weapons. This could involve strict observance of U.S. export control laws, commitment to no future transfers of nuclear or missile technology, and restraint on nuclear and missile competition with India. The rationale for this option is that the benefits of providing such weapons must exceed the costs, including potential complications for relations with India. The potential risk of selling F-16s to Pakistan is that it could become their primary nuclear-capable aircraft, raising concerns about the stability of the India-Pakistan relationship. The United States may need to consider if the benefits of providing such weapons outweigh the costs in terms of foreign policy interests. Pakistan could use its cooperation on terrorism as leverage to pressure the United States into allowing the purchase of F-16s and other desired military hardware. Musharraf's remarks in 2004 hinted at this strategy, indicating a willingness to push back against US demands. Musharraf criticized the U.S. invasion of Iraq and expressed concerns about the decline in operations in Afghanistan affecting the search for Osama bin Laden. The offer to sell F-16s to Pakistan could be used as leverage for cooperation on various issues, but it may backfire due to Musharraf's domestic political vulnerabilities. Conditioning the sale of F-16s on better responsiveness to U.S. nuclear nonproliferation concerns is seen as a less risky option. The U.S. considers using the sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan as leverage for cooperation, but the success of this option depends on factors outside U.S. control. The announcement of the sale followed a trip by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to India and Pakistan in March 2005. The possible sale of combat aircraft to India, part of a new framework of cooperation, may also include ballistic missile defense technology and nuclear energy cooperation. The sale of F-16s to Pakistan is not seen as destabilizing, with a small number of aircraft compared to India's large-scale purchase. The Administration's decision may be linked to gaining more cooperation on A.Q. Khan's network and Al Qaeda. The Administration's decision on the sale of combat aircraft to India and F-16s to Pakistan may be linked to gaining more cooperation on A.Q. Khan's network and Al Qaeda. The value of Pakistan's new cooperation with the IAEA in relation to its nuclear activities is questioned by critics. The State Department is cautious in discussing diplomatic discussions with Pakistan on sensitive issues. The Pakistani government is cooperating well to address concerns regarding arms sales. Congress has the power to block arms sales under the Arms Export Control Act, even if the Administration intends to resume F-16 sales to Pakistan. Congress would have 15 days to block a sale after formal notification. Congress has the power to block F-16 sale to Pakistan, which could negatively impact U.S.-Pakistan relations. Members of Congress may want to engage in dialogue with the Administration to minimize negative consequences for cooperation against terrorism. The Administration's willingness to engage with Congress depends on the strength of opposition to current policy. In response to Pakistan's nuclear proliferation activities, legislation has been proposed to expand existing laws to include penalties for individuals involved in the development of special nuclear material or terrorist threats with weapons of mass destruction. Proposed legislation in the 109th Congress would condition U.S. military assistance on Pakistan's cooperation with requests for information about A.Q. Khan's network. The legislation proposed in response to Pakistan's nuclear proliferation activities has not been acted upon as of mid-2005. The President or Congress could impose sanctions on Pakistan by not using waiver authority under Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act. Congress also has the power to block the President's use of waiver authority and could decline to renew annual foreign operations appropriations authority. Congress could condition U.S. aid to Pakistan on specific requirements, such as full cooperation in investigating A.Q. Khan's network. The President may resist efforts to constrain his actions regarding Pakistan. Section 2235 of S. 600 includes a provision to renew the President's waiver authority for FY2006 in Pakistan's case. The current law in Pakistan allows for sanctions on countries where the elected leader is deposed by a decree or military coup, with exemptions for facilitating democratic transition and combating terrorism. Section 2236 of S. 600 seeks to extend Pakistan's exemption from foreign assistance law provisions on loan defaults. Additionally, a reporting requirement amendment is proposed for the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of FY2003. The \"Targeting Terrorists More Effectively Act of 2005\" authorizes economic and military assistance to Pakistan, contingent on conditions. Military and economic aid to Pakistan is restricted unless the President certifies that no assistance will indirectly support terrorism. The United States may provide assistance to Pakistan with conditions, including restrictions on military aid until certain requirements are met, such as providing access to A.Q. Khan and cooperating with the IAEA. The U.S. Government has determined the extent of A.Q. Khan's illegal activities and their connection to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, confirming the need for complete dismantlement of Khan's network."
