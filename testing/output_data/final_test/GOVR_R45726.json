    "content": "The doctrine of federal preemption, based on the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, states that federal law supersedes state law. The Supreme Court has outlined two ways in which federal law can preempt state law: express preemption, where federal law explicitly displaces state law, and implied preemption, where federal law conflicts with state law. An example is the preemption clause in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act contains a preemption clause stating that certain provisions of the Act override any State laws related to regulated employee benefit plans. Federal law can also preempt state law through field preemption, where federal regulation is pervasive, or conflict preemption, where state law obstructs Congress' objectives. In Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, the Court found that a federal law imposing sanctions on Burma preempted a Massachusetts law prohibiting state entities from doing business with Burma. The federal statute aimed to provide the President with flexible authority over sanctions policy, limit economic pressure on Burma, and allow the President to speak for the country with one voice. Federal banking laws may also expressly preempt state law, such as Section 521 of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980. The Supreme Court has ruled that the National Bank Act preempts state laws that significantly interfere with national banks' powers, influenced by the dual banking system's development in the US. Disputes over federal regulation in finance have been ongoing since the country's founding, with the creation of the First Bank of the United States in 1791 sparking controversy. The First Bank of the United States, established in 1791, acted as the federal government's fiscal agent, collecting tax revenues and paying bills. Proponents believed it would promote economic growth by extending credit and creating a national currency. Critics argued it threatened state sovereignty and state-chartered banks. Congress refused to renew the Bank's charter in 1811 by a single vote. Disputes over federal regulation in finance continued after the War of 1812. After the demise of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, bank regulation was left to the states. Inspired by President Andrew Jackson's opposition to concentrated economic power, some states allowed banks to obtain charters from state banking authorities during the \"Free Banking era.\" This period lacked a uniform national currency, relying on notes issued by individual banks. During the Free Banking era, the country relied on notes issued by state banks, leading to a heterogeneous currency. \"Wildcat banks\" in remote areas issued notes backed by minimal specie, resulting in a higher failure rate compared to urban banks. Scholars debate the success of Free Banking, with some arguing that despite numerous bank failures, total losses to noteholders were not significant. During the Free Banking Era, total losses to bank noteholders were relatively small. The era ended during the Civil War when Congress enacted the National Currency Act in 1863 and the National Bank Act in 1864, creating a dual banking system. Banks had to purchase US government bonds to obtain a national charter, providing revenue for the war. The National Bank Act of 1864 allowed banks to issue national banknotes tied to the value of their bonds, creating a uniform national currency. Despite efforts to incentivize state banks to convert to national charters, many state banks avoided the switch by issuing paper checks instead of banknotes. State banking authorities also offered lax regulations, contributing to regulatory arbitrage. The dual banking system in the US allows state-chartered banks to have laxer regulations than national banks since 1895. The OCC regulates national banks with broad powers under the National Bank Act, granting them various powers such as discounting promissory notes, receiving deposits, buying and selling exchange, loaning money, and issuing notes. Federal court decisions have identified around 80 activities as the \"incidental powers\" of national banks. The dual banking system in the US allows state-chartered banks to operate with less strict regulations compared to national banks. The OCC regulates national banks under the National Bank Act, granting them various powers such as discounting promissory notes, receiving deposits, and issuing notes. State banking authorities oversee state-chartered banks, allowing them to engage in activities similar to national banks. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 to serve as a \"lender of last resort\" during banking crises and also manages the nation's monetary policy. The Federal Reserve conducts the nation's monetary policy, regulates banks in the Federal Reserve System, and bank holding companies. The FDIC insures deposits at regulated institutions and regulates state-chartered banks that do not join the FRS to prevent bank runs. The FDIC regulates banks to ensure their safety and soundness, playing a key role in the banking system. In the dual banking system, national and state banks are subject to both state and federal laws, with the Supreme Court allowing state laws as long as they do not conflict with federal laws or impair national banks' duties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has outlined that state regulations of national banks are valid as long as they do not interfere with federal laws or hinder national banks' ability to fulfill their duties. State-chartered banks are also subject to certain federal laws, including consumer protection, tax, and antidiscrimination laws, as well as Federal Reserve and FDIC regulations. Antidiscrimination laws, Federal Reserve, and FDIC regulations have led to regulatory convergence between national and state banks. \"Wild card\" statutes in the 1960s granted state banks similar powers to national banks. Legislation in 1980 and 1991 ensured competitive equality by imposing reserve requirements and prohibiting certain activities for FDIC-insured state banks. The legislation in the 1980s and 1990s unified state and federal banking systems by imposing reserve requirements and prohibiting certain activities for FDIC-insured state banks. Federal statutes preempt state laws to eliminate unequal regulatory treatment for national and state banks, allowing national banks to \"export\" maximum interest rates to borrowers in other states. The Marquette decision in the 1980s allowed national banks to charge interest rates based on the state where the bank is located, even if lending to customers in states with stricter usury laws. Congress later extended this power to federally insured state banks, equalizing regulatory treatment between national and state banks regarding interest rate exportation. The regulatory treatment of national and state banks has converged, with federal preemption providing unique benefits to national banks. The Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson established that federal laws granting national banks specific powers preempt state laws that significantly interfere with those powers. In Barnett Bank, the Court ruled that a federal law allowing national banks to sell insurance preempted a state law prohibiting it. This decision was based on the principle that Congress intended to grant national banks the authority to sell insurance, regardless of state approval. The Court inferred that federal statutes and regulations granting national banks specific powers preempt state laws that significantly interfere with those powers. Lower courts have followed this rule, as seen in cases like Wells Fargo Bank of Texas N.A. v. James and Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens, N.A. The Sixth Circuit and Ninth Circuit ruled in cases involving national banks, stating that federal laws preempt state laws that interfere with the banks' powers. The courts emphasized that Congress intended to preempt state laws when granting specific powers to national banks. Federal courts have broadly interpreted an NBA provision allowing national banks to dismiss officers \"at pleasure,\" preempting state laws. Cases like Schweikert v. Bank of America and Wiersum v. U.S. Bank have upheld this provision, voiding agreements that restrict a national bank's discretion to terminate officers at will. Federal courts have broadly interpreted an NBA provision allowing national banks to dismiss officers \"at pleasure,\" preempting state laws. In Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, the Ninth Circuit held that federal banking regulations did not preempt a generally applicable state law prohibiting certain types of fraud related to high-to-low posting for debit-card transactions. The Ninth Circuit ruled that OCC regulations preempted some state law claims against a bank for adopting high-to-low posting to maximize overdraft fees. The court held that federal law did not preempt claims related to unfair business practices and failure to disclose posting methods. The Ninth Circuit ruled that federal law did not preempt claims of bank fraud for misleading customers about posting methods, allowing the fraud claims to proceed as they did not significantly interfere with national banks' ability to offer checking accounts. The Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank did not significantly interfere with national banks' ability to offer checking accounts. In Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., the Court held that an NBA provision preempted state requirements for national bank operating subsidiaries. The Court focused on the exercise of a national bank's powers, not its corporate structure. The Supreme Court's decision in Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A. held that national bank operating subsidiaries should be treated as equivalent to national banks with respect to powers exercised under federal law. The Court found that state examination, supervision, and regulation would burden national banks' authorized activities. Congress later abrogated Watters' holding, and the Court limited the preemptive effect of the relevant NBA provision in Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, LLC. The Supreme Court's decision in Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, LLC clarified that the NBA provision did not preempt an information request by the NYAG to national banks regarding their lending practices. The Court distinguished between \"supervision\" and \"law enforcement\" powers, rejecting the argument that the provision preempted the request. The OCC regulations have been central in legal battles over federal banking law preemption. The Riegle-Neal Act formally acknowledges the OCC's authority to issue preemption rules. Section 114 of the Act specifies that the OCC can preempt state laws in certain cases. The OCC has the authority to preempt state laws that limit national banks in various activities. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the OCC issued interpretive letters and legal opinions on preemption. In 2004, the OCC expanded on these with sweeping preemption rules. The OCC's 2004 preemption rules established a standard where state laws that hinder a national bank's federally authorized powers are not applicable, unless required by Federal law. This standard expanded on the Barnett Bank test by removing the phrase \"significantly\" and emphasizing that national banks must be able to \"fully\" exercise their powers. The OCC's 2004 rules established a preemption standard based on Supreme Court constructs in Hines v. Davidowitz and Barnett Bank. The rules outlined categories of state laws that national banks are exempt from, including regulations on real estate loans, licensing, insurance requirements, loan terms, escrow accounts, and more. The OCC's 2004 rules established preemption standards for national banks, exempting them from state laws regarding various aspects of lending, including real estate loans, credit reports, loan terms, and deposit-taking powers. The OCC's 2004 rules identified state laws that survive preemption, including contracts, torts, criminal law, debt collection, property transfer, taxation, zoning, and certain homestead laws. These laws are allowed as long as they do not regulate national banks' authorized activities. The rules were controversial, especially in light of the 2008 financial crisis caused by reckless subprime mortgage lending. The financial crisis in 2008 was partly caused by reckless subprime mortgage lending and a collapse in the real estate market. There was a debate on the role of federal preemption of state predatory lending laws in generating the housing bubble. Some argued that national banks contributed to predatory lending, while others disagreed, stating that national banks had a small share in subprime mortgage lending. In response, Congress addressed concerns over federal preemption in the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 addressed concerns over federal preemption of state predatory lending laws. Section 1044 outlines the conditions under which federal law preempts state laws related to consumer financial regulations. Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act limits the OCC's preemption authority by requiring courts to give only Skidmore deference to OCC preemption determinations, which is less deferential than Chevron deference. This change aims to narrow the OCC's authority in interpreting statutes related to consumer financial regulations. Courts take a less deferential posture toward OCC preemption determinations under Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The provision requires substantial evidence to support preemption findings, following the legal standard set by Barnett Bank. This standard, similar to the Administrative Procedure Act, demands more than a mere scintilla of evidence for preemption determinations to be valid. Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the OCC to periodically review preemption determinations of Federal law over State consumer financial laws. The OCC must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the decision to continue, rescind, or propose an amendment to the determination. Additionally, the OCC must submit a report to Congress regarding its decision on preemption determinations. Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act abrogated the Supreme Court's decision in Watters, stating that \"State consumer financial laws\" apply to subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks to the same extent as to any other entity under State law. Commentators have debated whether this provision modifies pre-existing law or simply codifies the Barnett Bank standard for preemption. Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act abrogated the Supreme Court's decision in Watters, which interpreted the NBA as preempting state laws that \"obstruct, impair, or condition\" the powers of national banks. In response, the OCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2011 to reaffirm its preemption decisions while removing the controversial language. This move aimed to address ambiguities and misunderstandings surrounding the preemption standard. The OCC proposed reaffirming its preemption determinations from 2004, removing the \"obstruct, impair, or condition\" standard. This sparked controversy, with the Treasury Department arguing that the proposal was inconsistent with Dodd-Frank and Senator Carl Levin expressing disagreement. Levin disagreed with the OCC's proposed rules, stating that Congress could have maintained the OCC's preemptive powers by doing nothing. Senators Carper and Warner supported the OCC's rules, arguing that they aligned with the intent of Section 1044 to codify the Barnett case. The OCC eventually revised its regulations in line with their views. In July 2011, the OCC published a final regulation revising its preemption rules in line with the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule incorporated the conflict preemption legal standard from the Barnett decision and removed certain language from the preemption standard. The OCC stated that all future preemption determinations would be subject to Section 1044. The OCC's 2011 preemption rules, in line with Dodd-Frank, incorporated the Barnett Bank standard. Courts have interpreted Section 1044 as codifying this standard, limiting the OCC's preemption of state laws. Judicial deference towards OCC's preemption determinations is also addressed in Section 1044. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the OCC's 2011 preemption determinations are entitled to little deference under Skidmore. Other federal circuit courts may follow suit. Banking preemption issues continue to be debated, with three current issues discussed in the report. The final section of the report discusses current issues involving banking preemption and federalism questions. Recent judicial decisions have sparked debate over whether non-bank financial companies can benefit from banks' ability to export maximum interest rates. Courts are grappling with whether this power extends to non-bank financial companies and debt collectors that purchase loans from federally insured banks. The Second Circuit's 2015 decision in Madden v. Midland Funding rejected the \"valid when made\" doctrine, ruling that non-bank debt collectors cannot benefit from a national bank's exportation power when purchasing debt originated by the bank. This decision has sparked debate over whether non-bank financial companies can access banks' ability to export maximum interest rates. The Second Circuit's Madden v. Midland Funding decision rejected the \"valid when made\" doctrine, allowing New York usury law to apply to debt collectors who purchased credit card debt from a national bank. This decision has sparked debate over the application of state usury laws to non-bank financial companies. Industry groups and the OCC argued that the Madden v. Midland Funding decision would disrupt lending markets by impairing banks' ability to manage risk and charge interest rates, while the plaintiff in Madden believed it would have minimal impact on credit markets. The Second Circuit's Madden decision is unlikely to disrupt credit markets as non-banks can still collect loan balances within state usury limits. Congressional bills like the Financial CHOICE Act and H.R. 3299 aimed to codify the \"valid when made\" doctrine but did not become law. The bill aimed to codify the \"valid when made\" doctrine but did not become law in 2018. Critics argued it would facilitate predatory lending by allowing non-banks to evade state usury laws. Non-bank financial companies have been more active in loan origination than debt collectors in cases involving the exportation doctrine. Some courts have ruled that non-banks using \"rent-a-charter\" schemes are not eligible for certain benefits. Non-banks using \"rent-a-charter\" schemes may not be eligible for federal preemption, as courts have applied the \"true lender\" doctrine to determine the party with the predominant economic interest in loans. This has attracted Congress's attention, with H.R. 4439 in the 115th Congress seeking to address this issue. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 4439 aimed to clarify that a loan's originator is always the \"true lender\" for exportation doctrine purposes. Supporters argued it would protect bank-FinTech partnerships, while opponents feared it would allow non-banks to bypass state usury laws. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services but has not been reintroduced in the 116th Congress. Congress and the OCC are considering extending federal preemption benefits to FinTech companies. The OCC announced in July 2018 that it will accept applications for special purpose national bank charters from FinTech companies engaged in core banking activities. These charters aim to promote responsible innovation and regulatory consistency between FinTech firms and traditional banks. The OCC will evaluate SPNB charter applications using existing standards and procedures. The OCC will use its existing standards to evaluate applications for SPNB charters from FinTech companies, who will be supervised like national banks. Critics argue that the main benefit of these charters is federal preemption, with concerns raised about avoiding state consumer protection laws. State regulators have challenged the OCC's authority to charter FinTech companies. State regulators have filed lawsuits challenging the OCC's authority to charter non-depository FinTech companies. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the New York Department of Financial Services responded by filing suits, arguing that the OCC's decision violated the Tenth Amendment by invading states' sovereign powers. Both lawsuits were dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. After state regulators challenged the OCC's authority to charter non-depository FinTech companies, lawsuits were dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. The OCC's Policy Statement in July 2018 prompted new lawsuits from the organizations. Policymakers are also examining federal law's impact on traditional banks regarding state-level marijuana legalization efforts. Federal law criminalizes marijuana activities and money laundering. The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to report illegal and suspicious activities to FinCEN and maintain programs to prevent money laundering. Federal banking regulators have the authority to discipline banks for violations of these laws, conducting regular examinations of member banks for BSA compliance. Many banks have refused to serve marijuana businesses due to federal law, leading to about 70 percent of them being unbanked. This has raised concerns about tax collection and public safety, prompting congressional interest. The House Committee on Financial Services approved the SAFE Banking Act of 2019 to address legal risks associated with banking the marijuana industry. The Banking Act of 2019, known as the SAFE Banking Act, aims to create a \"safe harbor\" for depository institutions serving marijuana businesses that comply with state laws. It also clarifies that proceeds from transactions by these businesses are not considered unlawful under federal anti-money laundering laws. Additionally, the legislation requires FinCEN to issue guidance on suspicious activity reports for these businesses. The Responsibly Addressing Marijuana Policy Gap Act of 2019 and the STATES Act aim to eliminate federal criminal penalties for marijuana-related activities in compliance with state laws. These bills provide protections for depository institutions serving marijuana businesses, with the STATES Act clarifying that CSA's marijuana-related provisions do not apply to those following state regulations. Compliance with state laws regarding marijuana activities will not lead to federal money laundering charges or criminal forfeiture under the CSA."
