    "content": "To qualify for full Medicaid benefits in the United States, individuals must be citizens, nationals, or qualified aliens. Citizenship verification is not required, and possession of a social security number is not a condition of citizenship. The U.S. passport is one of the few documents that certifies U.S. citizenship and identity. Self-attestation of citizenship was commonly accepted for many years. False claims of citizenship have been a common avenue for benefit fraud and are considered a crime under \u00a71015 of the United States Criminal Code. It is a criminal offense to knowingly make false statements about U.S. citizenship to obtain federal or state benefits or engage in unlawful employment. Congress has enacted specific laws to address fraud issues related to citizenship self-attestation. The REAL ID Act contains provisions to enhance the security of state-issued drivers' licenses and ID cards by establishing minimum issuance standards and verifying documents. The use of social security cards for personal identification has been discouraged, as they are meant to identify records, not the bearer. The Social Security Amendments of 1972 required the SSA to obtain evidence to establish age, citizenship, or alien status, and identity of the applicant for a social security card/number. Since 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act has mandated Medicaid applicants to declare their citizenship status under penalty of perjury. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 required proof of citizenship for federal public benefits, including Medicaid. Since 2006, individuals must provide documentation to prove citizenship for Medicaid eligibility. This requirement was established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and modified by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The requirement for proof of citizenship for Medicaid eligibility was established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and modified by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. Acceptable documents include a U.S. Passport, Certificate of Naturalization, Certificate of United States Citizenship, or state-issued driver's license with verified citizenship. Other documents may be specified by the Secretary to meet the citizenship and identity requirements. Certain groups are exempt from this requirement. The citizenship documentation requirement for Medicaid eligibility was established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and modified by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. Some SCHIP enrollees may also be required to provide evidence of citizenship, even though the requirement does not specifically apply to SCHIP. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued regulations on how states were to implement this requirement, which received significant attention from the media and interest groups. Stakeholders were invited to submit comments in response to the agency's regulations. The final 2007 rule on Medicaid citizenship documentation requirements was issued by CMS in response to public comments and legislative changes. It provides guidance to states on acceptable evidence of citizenship, requiring original documents or certified copies for proof. The final 2007 rule on Medicaid citizenship documentation requirements issued by CMS allows various documents like a U.S. Passport, Certificate of Naturalization, or state-issued driver's license to prove citizenship. Additional documents may be required for identity verification, and states can use data from other programs for certification. The final 2007 rule on Medicaid citizenship documentation requirements issued by CMS allows various documents like a U.S. Passport, Certificate of Naturalization, or state-issued driver's license to prove citizenship. Special rules are set forth for children under age 16, elderly individuals, and other populations who may need additional assistance in obtaining documentation. Children born to women on Medicaid are automatically eligible for Medicaid coverage for one year, but citizenship must be documented when eligibility is redetermined. Some states delayed implementation of the citizenship documentation requirement, citing the need to train staff and notify beneficiaries. The 2007 rule on Medicaid citizenship documentation requirements issued by CMS allows various documents to prove citizenship. Some states reported declines in enrollment due to the new requirement, with significant negative impacts in 13 states and modest impacts in 24 states. Only Wisconsin had a data system to identify denials and terminations due to lack of citizenship documentation, affecting about 19,000 people between July 2006 and March 2007. Between July 31, 2006, and March 1, 2007, eligibility for Medicaid was denied or terminated due to citizenship documentation requirements. Most reported enrollment declines were attributed to delays or losses of coverage for U.S. citizens. The impact on ineligible noncitizens is unknown, and states are facing increased administrative costs for application processing. States incurred increased administrative costs to implement citizenship documentation requirements in SFY 2007 or 2008. A report found that 19 states saw a significant rise in costs, while 26 states reported a modest increase. The new requirements added complexity and expenses to enrollment and renewal processes. States will be reimbursed by the federal government at a 50% rate for these costs. Administrative expenses are expected to peak in the year following implementation and decrease in subsequent years. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009) introduced alternative options for citizenship documentation requirements for Medicaid eligibility. The House and Senate passed the bill, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama as P.L. 111-3. This allows states to choose an alternative process for verifying citizenship. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009) allows states to elect an alternative process for verifying citizenship for Medicaid eligibility. The Section 211 option involves submitting the applicant's name and SSN to the SSA for verification of citizenship. If the SSA cannot confirm the information, the applicant must resolve the inconsistency or provide satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship to avoid disenrollment. This data matching option could potentially replace the need for presenting citizenship documents as required by current law. The proposed alternative option in \u00a7 211 of H.R. 2 and S. 275 for verifying citizenship of Medicaid applicants through a SSA database matching process is sparking considerable debate. Proponents argue that the SSN data matching option would be an efficient and effective alternative to the current citizenship documentation provision. Supporters of current law argue that requiring specific documents to establish U.S. citizenship helps curb fraud and identity theft. They believe that using SSNs for citizenship verification could lead to increased fraud and weaken enforcement."
