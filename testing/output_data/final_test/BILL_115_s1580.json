    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act\". Congress finds that as of June 2018, over 68 million people have been displaced by disasters and conflicts, with more than 25 million being refugees. Additionally, it is noted that education is crucial for displaced individuals, especially women and girls, as it provides socioeconomic opportunities, psychological stability, and physical protection, with nearly 4 million school-aged refugee children lacking access to primary education. The Victims Protection Act of 2000 addresses issues such as child marriage, sexual exploitation, and economic disenfranchisement. Displaced children often struggle to access educational services, with some spending their entire childhood without access. Despite the increasing need for educational services, less than two percent of humanitarian aid was directed towards education in 2016. Sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of providing educational services to displaced children, especially girls, to combat extremism and reduce exploitation and poverty. Vulnerable women and girls' educational needs should be considered in US foreign assistance policies. The United States aims to partner with other countries and organizations to ensure displaced children have access to safe education, enhance training for governments hosting displaced people, and promote the inclusion of displaced children in educational systems. The United States aims to partner with other countries and organizations to ensure displaced children have access to safe education, including innovative approaches like extending school hours or increasing the number of teachers. The United States aims to support educational services for displaced children through assistance programs. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development are authorized to prioritize and advance efforts to support safe education for displaced children, prevent discrimination against displaced girls seeking education, and increase access to educational and economic opportunities for displaced children, especially girls. Coordination with the World Bank is also authorized. The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate with international organizations to collect data on displaced people's access to education and economic activity. They can also work with private sector and civil society organizations to promote safe education for displaced children. The Secretary and the Administrator will report on educational services for displaced girls in response to natural or manmade disasters as part of the READ Act. This is outlined in the AN ACT to improve assistance for access to education for displaced children, including women and girls."
