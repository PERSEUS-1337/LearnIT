    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Child Summer Hunger Act of 2015\" establishes the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program. The \"Stop Child Summer Hunger Act of 2015\" establishes the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program, amending Section 13(a) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to include definitions for eligible households and summer EBT cards. The Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program provides eligible households with summer EBT cards for food purchases to reduce food insecurity and improve children's nutritional status. Cards can only be used at approved retail food stores participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance program. The Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program issues EBT cards at the end of the school year, providing $150 in food assistance per child per summer, with adjustments based on reimbursement rates for school meals. The Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program provides $150 in food assistance per child per summer at the end of the regular school year. Funding is transferred from the Treasury to the Secretary of Agriculture on October 1 each year, without further appropriation. Regulations must be in place by October. The Secretary must issue regulations by October 1, 2016, for the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program. Children enrolled in the free or reduced-price lunch or breakfast programs will be eligible for the summer program without further application. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 requires local educational agencies to distribute information to families of children enrolled in programs authorized under the Act. The Secretary provides agency information on the program authorized under this paragraph, including eligibility rules and how children in eligible households can apply for benefits. Assistance is also given to households receiving summer EBT cards to make healthy food choices and maximize resources. The Secretary allows alternative timing for issuing summer electronic benefit cards in parts of a State without a typical summer break, as long as it doesn't impact Federal costs. The Secretary considers State's ability to issue benefits under an alternative schedule when developing regulations."
