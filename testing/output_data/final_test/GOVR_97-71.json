The President resisted attempts to obtain executive records to maintain independence. A federal public printing program made government documents more accessible. After World War II, some information was available from federal departments. The availability of executive branch records was limited by a narrow interpretation of the \"housekeeping\" statute of 1789. Regulations regarding the custody, use, and preservation of agencies' records were unclear, with limited public access. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 allowed agencies to restrict access to documents. Congressional panels addressed information access issues by enacting four statutes: the Freedom of Information Act (1966), Privacy Act (1974), Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972), and another for access to federal meetings. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972) and the Government in the Sunshine Act (1976) provide access to federal meetings. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was enacted in 1966, requiring public access to executive branch records. FOIA does not apply to legislative or judicial branches, state, local, or tribal governments. Congressional deliberations are not subject to FOIA. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows access to federal agency records for any person, with exemptions for certain categories of records. Disputes over access can be resolved in federal court or through the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). Fees may apply for search, review, or copying of materials. The FOIA was amended in 1996 to allow public access to information in electronic form. In 2007, qualifications for fee waivers were redefined, OGIS was established as a FOIA oversight office, and agencies were required to create tracking systems for information requests. The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 set specific criteria for future statutory creation. The provisions established specific criteria for future statutory exemptions from FOIA, requiring citations to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) mandates open meetings and public access to committee records. FACA aims to enhance transparency in executive branch advisory committees. Congress can choose to apply FACA guidelines to advisory bodies it establishes. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) mandates open meetings and public access to committee records, aiming to enhance transparency in executive branch advisory committees. The Privacy Act, legislated in 1974, provides U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens presumptive access to personally identifiable files held by federal agencies, with exemptions for law enforcement and intelligence entities. Citizens can request corrections to inaccurate information in federal records through the act. Disputes over accessibility or accuracy can be pursued in federal court. The Government in the Sunshine Act, enacted in 1976, aims to open agency policymaking deliberations to public scrutiny. Agencies must provide advance notice of meetings and make them accessible to the public. Disputes over meeting notice or closing deliberations can be taken to federal court. Congress can request nonpublic information from agencies, with formal and informal methods to ensure compliance. FOIA prohibits agencies from withholding information. The FOIA prohibits agencies from withholding information from Congress. Disputes over access to information between agencies and Congress are often resolved through negotiation. Congress and the judiciary have subpoena powers to leverage their information access demands. Federal courts rely on justice and fair play to enforce orders for the production of information by another branch. Conflicts among the three branches are common in the American separation of powers model. Both Congress and the judiciary have subpoena powers to compel the production of materials by another branch. Subpoenas are usually issued after other methods fail, and have sometimes been resisted. In a 2012 case, the Attorney General refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, citing executive privilege. A federal court rejected the privilege claim and ordered the documents to be produced. FOIA requires federal agencies to submit annual reports on their freedom of information workload to the Attorney General by February 1 each year. In March 2011, DOJ launched FOIA.gov, a portal for exploring FOIA metrics in executive branch agencies. The federal government received 714,231 FOIA requests in FY2014, with 159,741 backlogged requests. DHS received the most requests at 291,242. DHS had the highest number of FOIA requests in FY2014 at 291,242, and also the greatest number of backlogged requests with 103,480. There were 1,050 active advisory committees in FY2014, costing over $339 million. 446 FOIA cases were filed in U.S. District Courts in FY2014, an increase from the previous year. TRAC, an organization at Syracuse University, tracks federal FOIA lawsuits. In FY2014, 401 FOIA lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court, with 504 cases pending. Other transparency watchdog groups like Judicial Watch and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also monitor federal access laws litigation. EPIC focuses on civil liberties and privacy issues related to FOIA. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform publishes a Citizen's Guide on Using the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974. The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers tips and tools for agencies and requesters on making FOIA requests. The website provides best practices for making FOIA requests, information on FOIA training for agency administrators, and contacts for requesters. The Department of Justice oversees the administration of the Freedom of Information Act and provides extensive online resources on FOIA. Other organizations like Public Citizen also publish information on FOIA. Public Citizen and the National Security Archive are groups that provide information on freedom of information. Public Citizen is a nonprofit organization that offers FOIA resources on its website. The National Security Archive, a collective of journalists and scholars, has FOIA guides on its website. The General Services Administration's FACA Database has records on federal advisory committees. The website includes committee charters, member information, and data on the cost of advisory bodies. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Federal Advisory Committees are important topics covered in various reports by CRS and other sources. These reports provide in-depth analysis and insights into legislation, policy issues, and oversight related to FOIA and advisory committees in the federal government. The curr_chunk discusses resources and guides provided by the U.S. Congress and Department of Justice for utilizing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act of 1974 to request government records. It includes links to documents such as the Citizen's Guide on Using FOIA, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Source Book, the 2014 Litigation and Compliance Report, and the Department of Justice Guide to FOIA. The curr_chunk provides links to resources and guides from various sources such as the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. General Services Administration, Administrative Conference of the United States, and The George Washington University on utilizing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act."
