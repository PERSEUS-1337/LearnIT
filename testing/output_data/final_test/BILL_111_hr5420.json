    "content": "The Act titled \"Incentives for Successful Companies Act of 2010\" introduces a new section, SEC. 45S, which provides a credit for job training by successful companies. The \"Incentives for Successful Companies Act of 2010\" introduces section 45S, which offers a credit for job training provided by employers to US employees within 4 weeks of hiring. Qualified job training includes labor, material, overhead costs for trainers, and non-working paid training hours. The term 'United States employee' refers to an individual lawfully present and employed full time in the US, excluding those without a valid social security number. The definition of 'social security account number' is a number issued by the Social Security Administration. The term 'successful company' refers to any US company with a long-term growth plan meeting specific criteria determined by the Secretary. The term 'successful company' refers to any US company meeting specific criteria, including having access to loans from lending sources as of June 1, 2008, and having 5 to 500 employees. Special rules allow for the monetization of credit for the taxpayer. The credit allowed under this section is treated as a credit under subpart C, not under subsection (a). Taxpayers can elect not to claim the credit for a taxable year. Subsection (a) does not apply to taxable years after December 31, 2014. The successful company job training credit is added to the general business credit. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by inserting a new item after section 45R. SEC. 45S allows for job training by successful companies, with amendments effective for taxable years after December 31, 2009. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a special rule for successful companies, allowing for higher dollar limitations for taxable years before 2015. The term \"successful company\" is defined for this purpose. The term \"successful company\" is defined as per section 45S(d)(1) and the amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
