    "content": "Some Members of Congress are interested in expanding nuclear power to more Navy surface ships, starting with the CG(X) cruiser. The FY2008 Defense Authorization Act made it U.S. policy to construct major combatant ships with integrated nuclear power systems, unless deemed not in the national interest. The Navy considered nuclear power for the CG(X) design but did not confirm if it would be nuclear-powered. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed canceling the CG(X) program in favor of building an improved version of the conventionally powered Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class Aegis destroyer. This decision would eliminate near-term opportunities for expanding nuclear power to Navy surface ships, leaving most military and large commercial ships conventionally powered. Some countries operate nuclear-powered military ships, which do not necessarily carry nuclear weapons. Using nuclear power in surface combatants eliminates the need for refueling during long operations at sea, allowing sustained high speeds to distant theaters of operations. Nuclear-powered military ships can operate at sustained high speeds to distant theaters of operations without the need for refueling, unlike conventionally powered surface combatants that require refueling during long-distance transits and while in theater. Navy surface combatants have maximum sustained speeds of more than 30 knots, with a speed of 20 knots considered a moderately fast long-distance transit speed. The Navy's nuclear-powered surface combatants can operate at sustained high speeds without refueling, unlike conventionally powered ships. Resupply operations may temporarily reduce the ship's mission capabilities. The Navy's nuclear propulsion program began in 1948, with the first nuclear-powered ship, the submarine Nautilus, commissioned in 1954. The Navy's nuclear propulsion program, overseen by Naval Reactors, began in 1948. The cruiser Long Beach and aircraft carrier Enterprise were commissioned in 1961. Naval Reactors has broad responsibility for the program, as outlined in Executive Order 12344. Naval Reactors (NR) has a history of high safety standards for Navy nuclear power plants. Admiral Hyman Rickover, known as the father of the nuclear Navy, was the first director of NR. Admiral Kirkland Donald is the current director. All Navy submarines and aircraft carriers are nuclear-powered, with the combat submarine force fully nuclear since 1990 and the aircraft carrier force since 2009. No other Navy ships are currently nuclear-powered. The Navy's last conventionally powered carrier is CV-63. In the past, the Navy operated nine nuclear-powered cruisers (CGNs) to provide escorts for nuclear-powered carriers. These cruisers were decommissioned in the 1990s, and procurement of new nuclear-powered cruisers was halted after FY1975 to control costs. In the late 1970s, the decision was made to design a new cruiser with the Aegis defense system, leading to the consideration of nuclear-powered options. The Navy considered nuclear-powered options for a new cruiser with the Aegis defense system but ultimately chose a smaller, conventionally powered hull based on the DD-963 class destroyer. This decision led to the procurement of the 9,500-ton Ticonderoga (CG-47) class Aegis cruiser in FY1978. The initial fuel core for a Navy nuclear-powered ship is installed during construction, with the procurement cost included in the total shipbuilding budget. The initial fuel cores for a Virginia (SSN-774) class submarine and an aircraft carrier cost about $170 million and $660 million respectively in constant FY2007 dollars. The procurement cost of conventionally powered Navy ships does not include the cost of fuel, which is procured through a separate appropriation account. U.S. policy, as outlined in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act, favors constructing major combatant ships with integrated nuclear power systems unless otherwise notified by the Secretary of Defense. The FY2010 defense authorization bill included a provision to repeal a section from the FY2008 defense authorization act regarding the inclusion of integrated nuclear power systems in ships. The CG(X) cruiser was planned as a replacement for the Navy's Aegis cruisers. The Navy planned to replace its Aegis cruisers with the CG(X) cruiser, which was intended to have a powerful radar for ballistic missile defense operations. The Navy considered equipping the CG(X) with a combat system featuring a high power output, potentially using significantly more energy than existing cruisers and destroyers. The CG(X) cruiser, used for combat operations, may have consumed more energy than existing Navy cruisers and destroyers. The ship's energy use is a factor in comparing nuclear power to conventional power. The Navy's 2006 study on alternative ship propulsion systems mentioned a medium-sized surface combatant using a modified version of the reactor plant from the Ford-class aircraft carriers. The CG(X) cruiser, a potential combat ship, could use a modified version of the Ford-class aircraft carrier's reactor plant to minimize development time and cost. The initial fuel core in the single reactor would be sufficient to power the ship for its entire expected life of 30 to 35 years, unlike the Ford class which requires two fuel cores for 40 to 50 years. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed canceling the CG(X) program, costing about $660 million, and instead building an improved version of the conventionally powered Arleigh Burke class destroyer. This cancellation leaves no near-term opportunities for expanding nuclear power to Navy surface ships, with only two shipyards certified to build nuclear-powered ships. Newport News and GD/EB are the only U.S. shipyards currently building nuclear-powered ships for the Navy. Five other U.S. shipyards used to build nuclear-powered submarines, with two of them also constructing nuclear-powered cruisers. All cruisers and destroyers procured for the Navy since FY1978 have been built at General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works and the Ingalls shipyard. GD/BIW has never built nuclear-powered ships, while Ingalls is part of NGSB. Ingalls, part of NGSB, built 12 nuclear-powered submarines, including the Parche (SSN-683) which entered service in 1974 and retired in 2005. They also overhauled or refueled 11 nuclear-powered submarines. Ingalls' nuclear facility was decommissioned in 1980, and they are not certified to build nuclear-powered ships. The Navy has conducted studies on expanding nuclear power to more surface ships. Analysis conducted for Representative Roscoe Bartlett found that the life-cycle cost of a nuclear-powered amphibious assault ship would equal that of a conventionally powered version if crude oil averaged $70 per barrel. A nuclear-powered surface combatant would break even at $178 per barrel. This type of analysis is known as a life-cycle cost break-even analysis. The 2006 Navy alternative propulsion study compared the procurement costs of Navy surface combatant or amphibious ships with nuclear power versus conventional power. It found that using nuclear power would add $600 million to $800 million to the procurement cost, depending on the size of the ship. The increase in procurement costs for Navy surface combatant or amphibious ships with nuclear power ranged from $600 million to $800 million. Nuclear-powered ships have higher procurement costs but lower operating costs due to fuel expenses. Operational tempo and energy use levels impact life-cycle cost analysis, with nuclear power becoming more competitive with higher energy use. New life-cycle cost break-even cost ranges are $210 to $670 per barrel for small surface combatants and $70 to $225 per barrel for medium-size surface ships. The life-cycle cost premium of nuclear power for Navy ships ranges from 17% to 37% for small surface combatants, 0% to 10% for medium-size surface combatants, and 7% to 8% for amphibious ships. Nuclear power is recommended for medium-size surface combatants due to cost efficiency, while it may not be economical for small surface combatants or amphibious ships. Nuclear-powered ships are more economical for medium-size surface combatants compared to conventionally powered ships. The cancellation of the CG(X) program limits opportunities for expanding nuclear power to Navy surface ships. Congress should consider cost, operational effectiveness, ship construction, maintenance, crew training, ports calls, homeporting, and environmental impact when deciding on future nuclear-powered Navy surface ships. The cost calculations for a nuclear-powered surface ship like the CG(X) do not include upfront design and development costs. If the CG(X) displaces 21,000+ tons, it could use a modified version of the Ford-class aircraft carrier nuclear power plant to minimize costs. Otherwise, a new nuclear plant would need to be designed, potentially costing more than modification. The Navy considered basing the design of the CG(X) on the Zumwalt class destroyer to keep procurement costs similar. A nuclear-powered CG(X) could cost 32% to 37% more than a conventionally powered one. For a medium-size surface combatant larger than the DDG-1000, an additional cost of about $600 million is estimated. The Navy considered basing the design of the CG(X) on the Zumwalt class destroyer to keep procurement costs similar. A nuclear-powered CG(X) could cost 32% to 37% more than a conventionally powered one. For a medium-size surface combatant larger than the DDG-1000, an additional cost of about $600 million to $700 million is estimated, equating to a 22% increase in procurement cost. The Navy estimated that building nuclear-powered surface ships could reduce production costs for submarines and aircraft carriers by 5% to 9%. Building one nuclear-powered cruiser every two years could save about 7% in nuclear-propulsion component costs. In a steady-state production environment, these savings could amount to $115 million for each aircraft carrier and $35 million for each submarine. These savings were not included in the cost calculations presented in the 2006 Navy study. BWXT estimated in 2007 that increasing Virginia-class submarine procurement to two boats per year would reduce nuclear propulsion component costs by 9% for submarines and 8% for aircraft carriers. Adding a nuclear-powered cruiser or large-deck amphibious ship would further drive down nuclear power plant costs across the fleet. Total-life-cycle cost analysis can be influenced by future oil prices and ship operating tempo. Views on potential future oil prices vary. Representative Roscoe Bartlett supports using nuclear power for future Navy surface ships like the CG(X). Representative Roscoe Bartlett supports using nuclear power for future Navy surface ships like the CG(X) due to concerns about the increasing cost and access to oil in the coming decades. Ship operating tempo can be affected by the number of wars, crises, and the size of the Navy, impacting the need for nuclear-powered ships. The CG(X) may be smaller than the medium-size surface combatant in the 2006 Navy study, potentially impacting life-cycle energy use and cost. The Navy wants to install a radar on the CG(X) similar to the one modeled on the medium-sized surface combatant. The operational value of increased ship mobility and the translation of nuclear power advantages into dollar terms are key considerations for future Navy surface ships. The operational value of increased ship mobility and the cost comparison between conventionally powered and nuclear-powered CG(X) ships are key considerations for future Navy surface ships. One advantage of nuclear power is reduced detectability due to the absence of an exhaust stack emitting hot gases, potentially making nuclear-powered ships less detectable by infrared sensors. The possible advantages of nuclear-powered ships include reduced detectability by infrared sensors and decreased dependence on refueling oilers, potentially reducing vulnerability to enemy attacks. The advantages of nuclear-powered ships include reduced detectability and decreased dependence on refueling oilers, potentially reducing vulnerability to enemy attacks. Nuclear-powered ships can also provide electrical power for use ashore during emergencies, with a total power-generating capacity of about 80 megawatts. Skeptics question the practicality of using nuclear-powered ships to provide electrical power ashore during emergencies, citing concerns about the need for onshore infrastructure and the potential delay in reaching the connection point. Skeptics question the practicality of using nuclear-powered ships for emergency power, citing concerns about onshore infrastructure and potential delays in reaching connection points. Congress may consider building future Navy surface ships at different shipyards, including Newport News, GD/EB, Ingalls, and GD/BIW. The potential implications of building future Navy surface ships at different shipyards, including Newport News, GD/EB, Ingalls, and GD/BIW, have significant implications for workloads and employment levels. To certify Ingalls and/or GD/BIW to build nuclear-powered ships, facilities such as docks, dry-docks, and pier capabilities are essential. Building the necessary infrastructure and organizations to support nuclear ships involves having lifting and handling equipment, construction facilities for special nuclear components, and organizations for nuclear testing and engineering. For example, Northrop Grumman Newport News currently employs 769 people in nuclear engineering and 308 people in control lines. The director of NR testified that Newport News and GD/BIW have sufficient capacity for nuclear-powered surface ship construction, eliminating the need for additional investment. Only the first and third options are considered viable for building a new nuclear-powered warship due to existing capacity at Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News. The Navy is considering building a new nuclear-powered warship, with concerns about the cost. Options include building the nuclear portions at Newport News and/or GD/EB, and the non-nuclear portions at Ingalls and/or GD/BIW. Final ship erection location would need further analysis, with a potential preference for assembly at Newport News or GD/EB. The Navy is exploring the possibility of constructing a new nuclear-powered warship, considering cost concerns. The idea is to build modular sections of the ship at different yards and assemble them at a nuclear-certified yard. The nuclear portions could be built at Newport News and/or GD/EB, while the non-nuclear sections could be constructed at Ingalls and/or GD/BIW. The delivering yard would ideally be where the reactor plant is built and tested, with expertise in nuclear work. Transporting modules to the delivering yard for final assembly is a feasible option. The Navy is considering building a new nuclear-powered warship by constructing modular sections at different shipyards and assembling them at a nuclear-certified yard. Industry partners, specifically two corporations that own large shipyards, would be consulted on the best workflow for construction and final assembly of the ship. Congress may need to assess if firms producing nuclear-propulsion components have the capacity to handle increased production volume for such ships. The Navy has testified that there is additional capacity in the industrial base for building nuclear-powered ships, with the current capacity running at about 65 percent. This includes over-capacity in facilities to support construction of components for two Virginia-class submarines per year. The Navy has testified that there is additional capacity in the industrial base for building nuclear-powered ships, with the current capacity running at about 65 percent. This includes over-capacity in facilities to support construction of components for two Virginia-class submarines per year. Building future Navy surface ships with nuclear power could impact ship maintenance and repair work distribution, as only certain U.S. shipyards are qualified for such work. The Navy's capacity for building nuclear-powered ships is at about 65 percent, with over-capacity in facilities for two Virginia-class submarines per year. Maintenance and repair work on nuclear-powered ships is primarily done at four government-operated naval shipyards, with additional work done by Newport News and GD/EB. The director of NR stated that the training pipeline has the capacity to produce the personnel needed for future classes of nuclear-powered ships.

Maintenance and repair work on nuclear-powered ships is primarily done at four government-operated naval shipyards, with additional work done by Newport News and GD/EB. The director of NR stated that the training pipeline has the capacity to produce the personnel needed for future classes of nuclear-powered ships. The aircraft carrier Enterprise is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2013, leading to a significant training load reduction. With the introduction of the Ford-class carriers and the phasing out of Nimitz-class carriers, crew requirements are expected to decrease, particularly in the reactor department. The Navy aims for a 50 percent reduction in reactor department sizing with the Ford class. Despite potential challenges in ports with anti-nuclear sentiments, the Navy works to address concerns related to nuclear-powered ships. The Navy's nuclear-powered warships are welcome in over 150 ports worldwide, allowing them to carry out missions without constraint. Forward-homeported ships may require access to maintenance facilities near their home ports, but foreign shipyards may not be qualified for certain maintenance work on nuclear-powered ships. Building Navy surface ships with nuclear power could impact potential locations for forward-homeporting, affecting transit times to operating areas. Nuclear-powered ships offer advantages over conventionally powered ships by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants associated with combustion of petroleum-based fuel. However, they come with environmental impacts related to mining and processing uranium for fuel, as well as storing and disposing of radioactive waste. The Navy is responsible for storing and disposing of radioactive waste from nuclear-powered ships. Despite high safety standards, a serious accident or enemy attack could lead to a release of radioactivity with adverse environmental effects. The House Armed Services Committee discussed the Navy's funding request for FY2011 in relation to this issue. The House Armed Services Committee discussed the Navy's request for FY2011 funding for advanced nuclear power systems, emphasizing the need for smaller scale reactors for destroyer-sized vessels and alternative nuclear power systems using thorium liquid salt technology. Additional funding for engineering research and development is deemed necessary to address challenges in size and weight of nuclear technology. The Senate committees did not discuss nuclear power for surface ships other than aircraft carriers in their reports on defense authorization bills. The House Armed Services Committee emphasized the need for smaller scale reactors for destroyer-sized vessels and alternative nuclear power systems using thorium liquid salt technology. Additional funding for engineering research and development is recommended to address challenges in size and weight of nuclear technology. The House Armed Services Committee emphasized the need for integrated nuclear power systems for the next generation cruiser to meet ballistic missile technology challenges. They also support the use of thorium-liquid fueled nuclear reactors for Navy surface ships, as stated in Section 246 of H.R. 2647. The House Armed Services Committee supports the use of thorium-liquid fueled nuclear reactors for Navy surface ships, as stated in Section 246 of H.R. 2647. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are required to conduct a study on the use of thorium-liquid fueled nuclear reactors for naval power needs. The benefits of thorium-liquid fueled nuclear reactors or uranium reactors for naval operations include improved fuel cycle, security of fuel supply, power for advanced weapons and sensors, safety of operation, reduced logistics, ship upgrades, reduced manning, global range, power for advanced sensors and weapons, increased survivability, high power density propulsion, operational tempo, operational effectiveness, and estimated cost-effectiveness. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will conduct a cost-effectiveness comparison of nuclear reactors used by the Navy, thorium-liquid fueled reactors, and conventional fueled major surface combatants. The comparison will include security, safety, infrastructure costs, nuclear proliferation issues, reactor and nuclear fuel safety, power requirements, and capabilities to execute the Navy Maritime Strategic Concept. A report on the study results is due by February 1, 2011 to the congressional defense committees. The FY2010 defense authorization bill would repeal Section 1012 of the FY2008 defense authorization act, which required new surface combatants and amphibious assault ships to have integrated nuclear power systems. The committee believes that including an integrated nuclear power system in Navy vessels is not in the national interest due to cost concerns and the need for a solid acquisition process. Congress should not dictate outcomes before the Department of Defense conducts a requirements review. The Navy is expected to evaluate the nuclear power alternative for new surface combatants, but the committee prefers a cautious approach. The committee believes that including integrated nuclear power systems in Navy vessels may not be in the national interest due to cost concerns and the need for a solid acquisition process. Congress should not predetermine outcomes before the Department of Defense conducts a requirements review. The Navy is expected to assess the nuclear power option for new surface combatants cautiously. The House bill included a provision for a study on thorium-liquid fueled reactors for naval propulsion, but the Senate did not have a similar provision. The conferees noted that while research on molten salt reactors for commercial use is ongoing, using them on naval vessels is currently not technically feasible due to technology challenges. The conferees recommend that the Navy monitor technology development in commercial molten salt reactors for potential future application on naval vessels. The House bill included a provision to amend the FY2008 defense authorization act to allow for nuclear power on certain types of ships unless deemed not in the national interest. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is amended to include requirements for amphibious assault ships exceeding 15,000 dead weight ton light ship displacement to have integrated nuclear power systems. The House Armed Services Committee emphasizes the importance of not relying solely on traditional power systems for future naval forces. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the FY2009 defense authorization bill emphasizes the need for the future naval force to be independent of fossil fuel sources, particularly for the CG(X) cruiser, which is required to be nuclear powered according to the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008. The Secretary of Defense must submit a notification if an integrated nuclear power system is not in the national interest for the CG(X) cruiser. The Secretary of the Navy has delayed the submission of a report on CG(X) design, cost, schedule, and risk assessment due to ongoing reviews and studies, potentially causing delays in procurement milestones. The committee recommends a decrease in the Navy's research and development funding for fiscal year 2009 to maintain cruiser development activities at the same level as in fiscal year 2008, due to delays in program milestones and pending completion of necessary assessments and determinations. In fiscal year 2008, S. 3001 was signed into law as P.L. 110-417, amending the defense authorization act to include nuclear power for certain types of ships unless deemed not in the national interest by the Secretary of Defense. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 amended the policy relating to major combatant vessels of the United States Navy, including requirements for amphibious assault ships exceeding 15,000 dead weight ton light ship displacement. Additionally, the FY2008 defense authorization bill aimed to make it U.S. policy to build submarines, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other large surface combatants with nuclear power, unless the Secretary of Defense determines it is not in the national interest. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 amended the policy to construct major combatant vessels of the US Navy with integrated nuclear power systems, unless the Secretary of Defense deems it not in the national interest. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 amended the policy to construct major combatant vessels of the US Navy with integrated nuclear power systems, unless the Secretary of Defense deems it not in the national interest. Definitions include major combatant vessels like submarines, aircraft carriers, and large surface combatants for carrier strike groups. Integrated nuclear power system refers to a ship engineering system using a naval nuclear reactor for energy. The term \"budget\" refers to the budget submitted to Congress by the President. The House Armed Services Committee requires new ship classes of submarines, cruisers, and aircraft carriers to be built with nuclear power systems unless the Secretary of Defense deems it not in the national interest. The committee believes nuclear power is essential for the next generation of Navy cruisers due to mobility, endurance, and electric power generation capabilities. The Navy's report to Congress indicated that the total lifecycle cost for medium-sized nuclear surface combatants is equivalent to conventionally powered ships. The committee believes that primary escort vessels for the Navy's aircraft carriers should have the same speed and endurance capability as the carriers. Surface combatants with nuclear propulsion systems would be more capable during independent operations due to no need for fuel replenishment. The Senate-reported version of the FY2008 defense authorization bill did not address nuclear power for Navy ships other than submarines and aircraft. The Navy plans to apply nuclear power guidance to the next generation cruiser, CG(X), which is scheduled for construction in fiscal year 2011. The next cruiser will be designated as \"CGN(X)\" to indicate it is nuclear powered, following the Navy's shipbuilding schedule for aircraft carriers and submarines. The Navy plans to apply nuclear power guidance to the next generation cruiser, CG(X), scheduled for construction in fiscal year 2011. The lead time for nuclear components for ships is 2 years prior to full authorization and appropriation for construction. The milestone decision for the Navy's CG(X) is only months away, leading to a significant design effort with tradeoff decisions and discarding major options. The Navy must proceed through the contract design phase independently to design a CGN(X) regardless of future decisions by the Navy or DOD. The Navy must consider options for maintaining the industrial base for conventionally powered ships, certifying yards to build nuclear-powered vessels, and identifying funds for near-term costs of integrated propulsion systems for the next generation cruiser. The Navy is considering sources of funds to pay for the near-term costs of the integrated nuclear power system for the next generation cruiser, including potential offsets within the Navy's budget or gaining additional funds for DOD overall. Despite added investment, the Navy may not be ready to award a shipbuilding contract for a CGN(X) in fiscal year 2011. The completion of the CG(X) Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) will provide indications of what will be required to design and construct a CGN(X) class. The Navy is considering funding sources for the integrated nuclear power system for the next generation cruiser. A report is required to provide information on the characteristics, costs, and delivery schedule of the CGN(X) class. The Navy is seeking information on the costs and schedule effects of integrating a nuclear-powered combatant into shipyards currently producing conventionally powered surface combatants. Additionally, the report should address potential impacts on the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan and considerations for design, construction, testing, training facilities, homeports, and environmental assessments for the CGN(X) class. Highest risk areas associated with meeting this requirement should also be assessed. The Navy sought information on integrating a nuclear-powered combatant into shipyards producing conventionally powered surface combatants. H.R. 1585 was vetoed by the President, leading to the passage of H.R. 4986, signed into law as P.L. 110-181. Section 1012 of the conference report is similar to Title VIII legislation requiring certain Navy ships to be nuclear-powered. Section 130 of the conference report on the FY2006 defense authorization act required future Navy ships to be nuclear-powered. The FY2006 defense authorization act required the Navy to report on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships by November 1, 2006. The report was submitted to Congress in January 2007, detailing the analysis of alternative propulsion systems. The Navy's report on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships, submitted to Congress in January 2007, includes key assumptions, methodology, current/future technology, propulsion alternatives analysis, life-cycle cost comparison, and cost-effectiveness of nuclear propulsion as oil prices increase. The study examines the impact of rising crude oil prices on ship design and recommendations for future ships. The term \"life-cycle costs\" includes elements for cost analysis in defense acquisition programs."
