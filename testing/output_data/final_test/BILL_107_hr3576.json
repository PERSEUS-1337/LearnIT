    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that it is in the national interest for all citizens, including active-duty service members, to be allowed to vote in Federal elections. Since 1977, active-duty service members in American Samoa have been excluded from fully participating in elections due to various factors, including local laws that require in-person registration and limited transportation services. American Samoa's law contradicts the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act has been in effect for over 15 years, and American Samoa has not addressed the discrepancy between Federal and territorial law. Additional action is necessary to ensure that the votes of uniformed voters are counted in Federal elections in American Samoa, and that active duty service members do not need to appear in person to register to vote. The Act supersedes American Samoa law, and the territory must comply with Federal law. Since 1980, there have been unresolved Delegate elections in American Samoa, leading to run-off elections and delayed outcomes until late November. This delay may disadvantage newly elected Delegates compared to other Members of Congress. When more than 2 candidates file to run for the office of Delegate, holding a primary election to reduce the number of candidates to 2 will increase the likelihood of the general election producing a candidate who receives a majority of the votes cast. Primary election required to reduce the number of candidates to 2 for the office of Delegate. Section 2(a) of the Act is amended to require a primary election in general election years with 3 or more candidates for the office of Delegate. If no candidate receives over 50% of the votes in the primary election, the top two candidates will advance to the general election. Candidates who do not receive more than 50% of the votes in the primary election will advance to the general election. If there is a tie for the top two candidates, both names will be listed on the ballot. Candidates for the office of Delegate to the United States House of Representatives must file their candidacy by the first Tuesday of July in a general election year. Section 4 of the Act is amended to include \"in a general Federal election\" after \"ties between candidates\". The amendments made by this Act will be effective on January 1, 2003."
