    "title": "SB 334",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Education Code in California has been updated to include a new section requiring the department to provide information on reducing lead in drinking water in schools. The State Department of Public Health is also mandated to identify high-risk schools and estimate the presence of lead in schools attended by young children. The State Department of Public Health conducts a sample survey to determine lead exposure in schools from paint, soil, and water sources. Survey results are reported to the Legislature and the department. Schools are notified of survey results within 60 days, and teachers, school personnel, and parents are informed within 45 days. The State Department of Public Health conducts a sample survey to determine lead exposure in schools from paint, soil, and water sources. Recommendations are made to the Legislature and the department regarding the feasibility of statewide lead testing and necessary actions. Environmental lead testing methods and standards are developed as needed. Cost-effective lead abatement technologies are evaluated. A new section is added to the Education Code stating that drinking water at schools must meet EPA standards for lead. Section 32249 of the Education Code requires schools with lead-containing plumbing to flush drinking water sources daily following EPA protocols. Schools are exempt from flushing if water sources are shut off or meet EPA lead standards. Section 38086 is amended regarding school drinking water standards. Section 38086 of the Education Code is amended to require school districts to provide free, fresh, and clean drinking water during meal times in food service areas. This can be done through drinking water access points, including plumbed or unplumbed stations. Article 13 (Section 49580) of the Education Code mandates that school districts must close access to drinking water sources that do not meet EPA standards for lead or contaminants. If this results in a schoolsite lacking the required number of drinking fountains, alternative water sources must be provided by the district. An alternative drinking water source, whether plumbed or unplumbed, can be provided by school districts while contamination is being addressed. Unplumbed sources may include portable water sources and bottled water. The school district must promptly notify parents, guardians, students, teachers, and staff of drinking water test results if alternative water sources are required. If the state mandates costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to government regulations."
