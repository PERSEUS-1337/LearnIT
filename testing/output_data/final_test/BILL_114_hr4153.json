The pilot program aims to assist schools in recognizing eating disorder symptoms and providing intervention. Eligible schools must apply through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and be selected by the Secretary to participate. Eligible health care providers include those with training in health or counseling fields. Reports are due within 6 months after the program ends. Each eligible school in the pilot program must submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 6 months after the program ends. The report should evaluate the process and outcomes, including the number of students assessed and identified as potentially in need of counseling. The report from each eligible school in the pilot program must include the number of students who participated in counseling and follow-up referrals, those who showed improvement, educational seminars provided, parents and teachers needing more information on eating disorders, and evaluation of best practices. After the pilot program ends, the Secretary will publish aggregate information on the program on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality website. No additional funds are authorized for this program beyond what is already allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for surveillance activities."
