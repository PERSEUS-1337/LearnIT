The Federal Asset Management Improvement Act of 1999 requires the establishment of performance measures for Federal property management to track progress and compare agency performance. The Administrator and executive agencies must use data sources and tools for monitoring performance and reporting to Congress. Within 90 days, a management plan must be submitted to Congress outlining program implementation and operational authority. The management plan must include details on the program, qualifications of individuals, and a timeline for implementation. TITLE II--PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\n\nSEC. 201. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AUTHORITY. Title II of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is amended to allow the Administrator to create public-private partnerships for leasing Federal real property and developing facilities for executive agencies. The nongovernmental person in the partnership will have control and majority ownership. Each agreement entered into must comply with the provisions of this section. The public-private partnership agreements for leasing Federal real property must enhance efficiency, be negotiated for competition, offer a lease option to the United States, and outline responsibilities of both parties. The public-private partnership agreements for leasing Federal real property must include provisions stating that the United States is not liable for any actions or debts of the nongovernmental person, and that the leasehold interests of the United States take precedence over any lender to the nongovernmental person. The Administrator may lease real property to a public-private partnership under certain conditions, including the ability to pledge leasehold interests as collateral. Master leases can be determined by the Administrator, and equity interest controlled by the United States can be disposed of if beneficial. The Administrator can provide services to a public-private partnership and retain revenues for property improvement under this section. Real property leased under this subsection is not considered unutilized or underutilized for homeless assistance purposes. Proceeds from property disposal are deposited into a designated fund. The Administrator can delegate authority to executive agencies for public-private partnerships. Revenues from master leases may go to a fund or the Treasury. Net revenues from partnerships are deposited into a specific fund. Business plans for agreements with non-governmental entities must be submitted to Congress. The Administrator enters into agreements with nongovernmental persons for projects on Federal property. The budget must include economic projections for these agreements. Definitions for 'nongovernmental person' and 'master lease' are provided. The Administrator can lease real property to a public-private partnership under this section. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to Congress on the use of authorities provided by the Act, assessing effectiveness and reviewing performance measures. The Comptroller General of the United States must also submit a report on the use of authorities by executive agencies."
