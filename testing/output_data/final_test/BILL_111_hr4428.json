The \"Children's Toxic Metals Act\" defines terms like antimony, barium, and cadmium as elemental forms and their compounds or alloys. It also defines \"children's jewelry\" as any jewelry designed for children 12 years old or younger. The factors considered in determining if jewelry is intended for children 12 years old or younger include manufacturer statements, product labels, packaging representation, and consumer recognition. The Age Determination Guidelines issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in September 2002 provide criteria for determining toy suitability for children 12 years old or younger when sold or distributed at retail. SEC. 3. BAN ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS CONTAINING CADMIUM, BARIUM OR ANTIMONY. Children's jewelry containing cadmium, barium, or antimony is banned under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The Commission may create regulations to enforce this ban. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Penalties for non-compliance with section 3 requirements are treated as violations of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and subject to penalties. The Commission must report annually to Congress on enforcement actions, including criminal and civil penalties imposed.

The Commission must report annually to Congress on enforcement actions, including criminal and civil penalties imposed, as well as a report on banned heavy metals in children's products. SEC. 5.
