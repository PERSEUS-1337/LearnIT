    "content": "SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF THE NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. Amendments to ERISA include a special rule for determining normal retirement age for certain existing defined benefit plans. This rule ensures that applicable plans are not penalized for adopting a specific retirement age. The subsection introduces a normal retirement age based on age or years of service specified by the plan. The plan remains applicable even if the retirement age only applies to certain participants or employers. The defined benefit plan is considered applicable if it expands the normal retirement age to more participants or employers after a specific date. There are limitations on who can be included in the plan based on their participation or employment before January 1, 2017. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a special rule for determining the normal retirement age for certain existing defined benefit plans. An applicable plan can adopt a new normal retirement age without failing to meet requirements, as long as it includes more participants or employers. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows defined benefit plans to adopt a new normal retirement age, based on years of service, without losing their status as applicable plans. The amendment allows defined benefit plans to expand the normal retirement age for additional participants or employers while maintaining their status as applicable plans. There are limitations on who can be included in the expanded application based on their participation or employment before January 1, 2017. The amendment allows defined benefit plans to expand the normal retirement age for additional participants or employers while maintaining their status as applicable plans. The amendments made by this section shall apply to all periods before, on, and after the date of enactment of this Act."
