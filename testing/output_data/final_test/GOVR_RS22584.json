    "content": "International medical graduates (IMGs) are foreign nationals or U.S. citizens who graduate from a medical school outside of the United States. In 2007, there were 902,053 practicing physicians in the United States, with IMGs accounting for 25.3% (228,665) of these. This report focuses on foreign medical graduates (FMGs) who enter the U.S. through the J-1 cultural exchange program for medical education and training. FMGs can stay in the U.S. on a J-1 visa. Foreign medical graduates (FMGs) in the U.S. on a J-1 visa can apply for a waiver of the two-year home residency requirement through an interested government agency (IGA), extreme hardship to family, or fear of persecution in their home country. Requests are typically submitted by an IGA to the Department of State for recommendation, then forwarded to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for approval. Upon recommendation by an interested government agency (IGA), a waiver request for the two-year foreign residency requirement can be submitted for foreign medical graduates (FMGs) in the U.S. on a J-1 visa. The request is then forwarded to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for final approval, converting the physician's status to that of an H-1B professional specialty worker. FMGs must meet certain criteria, including obtaining a statement of \"no objection\" from their home country's government, securing full-time employment, and committing to work in a designated shortage area for at least three years. Foreign medical graduates (FMGs) in the U.S. on a J-1 visa can request a waiver for the two-year foreign residency requirement through an interested government agency (IGA). The waiver requires the FMG to commit to working in a designated shortage area for at least three years. Federal agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, Appalachian Regional Commission, and United States Department of Agriculture can act as IGAs. HHS has recently started accepting waivers for primary care physicians. HHS announced in December 2002 that they would sponsor J-1 waiver requests for primary care physicians and psychiatrists to increase access to healthcare in underserved areas. They began accepting applications in June 2003 but suspended the program for reevaluation. HHS released new guidelines on December 10, 2003, and reinstated the program. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was established in 1965 to ensure access to quality healthcare in Appalachia. ARC covers parts of several states and can grant waivers for primary care physicians to work in underserved areas. Physicians must commit to providing care for at least 40 hours a week for three years at designated facilities. The U.S. physician applying for a J-1 visa waiver must be licensed and have completed a residency in specific fields. They must agree to practice in a designated facility for three years and pay $250,000 if they do not comply. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) began accepting applications for its waiver program on May 17, 2004, covering 240 county or parish areas in eight states to stimulate economic development and improve the economy. The DRA's waiver program, known as the \"Conrad State Program,\" requires physicians to pay a fee, practice in designated shortage areas for three years, and pay penalties if they fail to fulfill their commitment. The program, sponsored by Senator Kent Conrad in 1994, allows states to sponsor up to 30 waiver applications annually, with extensions granted multiple times until 2004. In 2004, Congress extended the Conrad program until June 1, 2006, allowing states to recruit primary care and specialty physicians. Waiver recipients were exempt from the H-1B annual cap, and states could place up to five physicians in shortage areas. The program was extended through June 1, 2008, with FMGs agreeing to practice in shortage areas for 3-4 years. Administration of the program varies by state. States accounted for 90% of waiver requests for FMGs working in shortage areas, with over 3,000 waivers requested between 2003 and 2005. The Conrad Program was extended through March 6, 2009, and further extended until September 30, 2009, by H.R. 1127. Senator Orrin Hatch introduced S.Amdt. 1428 to extend the waiver provision. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. 2892) amendment passed unanimously on July 9, 2009, extending the program through September 30, 2012."
