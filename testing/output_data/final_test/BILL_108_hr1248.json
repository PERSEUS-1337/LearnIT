    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safer Truck Act\". The Safer Truck Act aims to address the lack of modern safety features on heavy trucks carrying cargo on the National Highway System. Truckers face penalties for equipping their vehicles with safety features due to Federal weight and width restrictions. Trucking is the deadliest industry in the United States, with 704 truckers killed in truck crashes in 2001. In 2001, truck crashes resulted in the deaths of truckers, motorists, and pedestrians, totaling over 5,000 preventable deaths. Additionally, 130,000 people were injured by commercial trucks, with 29,000 being truckers. Since the Vietnam War, more than 150,000 people, including 25,000 truckers, have died in preventable large-truck crashes. To prevent future deaths, safety features should be exempt from truck weight and width restrictions, focusing on regulating cargo weight instead. New intermodal technologies offer safer and more efficient transportation options. The current law imposes unreasonable burdens on intermodal trucks, hindering the reduction of foreign oil dependence and lowering food costs. States require special permits and escort vehicles for these trucks, risking the loss of Federal highway funds. Modifying roads for safer short-haul intermodal trucks is cost-effective compared to the wear and tear caused by long-haul trucks. The current law imposes burdens on intermodal trucks, hindering oil dependence reduction and lowering food costs. Modifying roads for safer short-haul intermodal trucks is cost-effective compared to long-haul trucks. Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to allow a single unit truck or bus without a trailer to carry up to 20 metric tons or 44,080 pounds of cargo, regardless of vehicle weight, axle weights, or safety devices, under specific conditions. The front of the vehicle must display weight limits in 3-inch letters. Gross weight is calculated by adding 20 metric tons or 44,080 pounds to the empty weight. Vehicle width limitations are outlined in Section 4. Section 31113(b) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to exclude energy conservation devices and safety devices from the calculation of width for commercial motor vehicles, as long as the safety device fits within legal travel lanes. The term 'safety device' includes mirrors, grabhandles, steps, rearview video cameras, crash absorbent bumpers, body panels, batteries for regenerative braking, wheels, tires, structural members, and drivetrain components positioned to enhance vehicle stability."
