Eligible employees must participate in a program recognized by an employer trade group or committee, work at least 40 hours per week, and the credit can be recaptured if the employee does not meet the minimum service requirement. If an employee's employment is terminated by the employer before the 2-year period of study or training, the taxpayer's tax will increase by the aggregate decrease in credits for prior years multiplied by the inclusion ratio. The inclusion ratio is the ratio determining this increase. The inclusion ratio is the ratio used to calculate the increase in tax if an employee's employment is terminated before the 2-year period. Controlled groups are treated as a single employer for this purpose. Amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017, are not applicable. The inclusion ratio is used to calculate tax increase if employment is terminated early. Controlled groups are considered one employer. Amendments to section 38 of the tax code include a new on-the-job training tax credit. The new on-the-job training tax credit, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2014."
