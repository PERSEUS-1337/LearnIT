    "content": "The \"Streamline America's Future Energy Nuclear Act\" ensures that public health and safety standards set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are maintained. It also aims to streamline the process for combined construction and operating licenses. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will establish an expedited procedure for issuing Combined Construction and Operating Licenses. To qualify, an applicant must use an approved design, build the reactor near an existing nuclear plant, have no orders to modify or revoke a license, and submit a complete application. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will expedite the licensing process for applicants meeting specific criteria. This includes an expedited environmental review, completion of public hearings within 24 months, and issuing necessary reports within 18 months of application acceptance. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission aims to streamline the licensing process for new nuclear reactors by making a final decision within 25 months of application docketing. Additionally, recommendations for further expediting the process will be presented to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will expedite reactor design certification by cutting the time in half and may include designs already under consideration. They will also develop technology-neutral guidelines for nuclear plant licensing to facilitate the entry of new technologies into the market. Additional funding and personnel resources will be allocated to support these efforts. SEC. 6. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will request additional funding and personnel resources to implement sections 2 through 5 without delaying licensing applications. SEC. 7. National laboratories will provide personnel to support expedited licensing and design certification procedures. SEC. 8. Educational program funds will be allocated. SEC. 8. Educational program funds will be directed to support activities authorized by this Act. SEC. 9. National Nuclear Energy Council. The Secretary of Energy will establish a National Nuclear Energy Council (referred to as the Council) subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The National Nuclear Energy Council, appointed by the Secretary of Energy, may establish study and administrative committees as needed. SEC. 10. NUCLEAR POWER 2010 authorizes $121,000,000 for the program to define plant permitting and design certification by September 30, 2010. SEC. 11. NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR POWER PLANT requires a revised schedule for completion by 2015. SEC. 12. URANIUM MINING ON FEDERAL LANDS. SEC. 12. URANIUM MINING ON FEDERAL LANDS. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 shall not be used to prevent uranium mining on Federal lands. No additional leasing fees for uranium mining on Federal lands.
