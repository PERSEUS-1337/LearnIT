The group recommended a new bilateral agreement for trade and investment, aiming to align regulations and reduce non-tariff barriers. President Obama then initiated negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) to promote regulatory compatibility and lower costs. The formal TTIP negotiations began in July 2013, aiming to reduce costs associated with regulatory differences and promote transparency in regulations. Motor vehicle safety and emissions standards are key areas for potential cooperation between the United States and the EU, with the goal of mutual recognition of technical standards and harmonization of future regulations. Trade in vehicles and parts between the two entities reached $57 billion in 2012. The industry alliance contends that reducing non-tariff barriers on vehicles could boost trade, lower costs, create jobs, and improve competitiveness in North America and Europe. Differences in safety, fuel efficiency, and emissions standards between the regions may hinder trade, with the potential for significant export growth if tariffs and barriers are eliminated. Past efforts to protect domestic vehicle industries against foreign competition have resulted from different legal traditions or views on achieving goals like cleaner air and reduced oil consumption. Auto agreements like the 1965 US-Canada agreement and NAFTA have led to a more globalized auto industry. The Trans-Pacific Partnership and TTIP aim to further expand regional trade and investment in the auto industry. The EU and US are major vehicle producers globally. The United States and the EU are major vehicle producers globally, with the EU producing more vehicles than the US in 2012. Germany is the largest auto producer in the EU, while vehicles are manufactured in 15 states in the US. Local consumer preferences and vehicle standards influence where vehicles are sold. In 2012, imports accounted for 20% of U.S. sales and 17% of EU sales. Vehicles may not be sold in certain countries due to differing standards, like Ford's ECOnetic engine not being sold in North America. Ford deemed the cost of complying with North American standards too high compared to consumer demand. Auto manufacturers and parts suppliers are increasingly organizing production on a global basis to reduce costs. For example, BMW produces SUVs for global markets from a plant in South Carolina. Automakers are developing global vehicle platforms to streamline production and cut costs, such as the Fiat Compact Wide platform used for the Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Dart. Ford Focus is built with similar components in multiple countries and sold in 130 countries. Automakers worldwide are collaborating to meet stricter emission standards. BMW and Toyota are working together on fuel cell technology. Diesel-powered vehicles are gaining interest in the U.S. as they are more efficient and emit lower greenhouse gases. Offering a variety of vehicles, including diesels, hybrids, and electric cars, will be crucial to meeting future fuel efficiency and emission standards. The United States and the EU have different processes for establishing vehicle safety, fuel efficiency, and emission standards. In the US, federal legislation now regulates vehicle standards, while in Europe, EU directives passed by the European Parliament have a more direct role in the regulatory process. Aligning diesel engine standards between the two regions could reduce costs. In the early decades of the automobile, U.S. vehicles were lightly regulated by a combination of state and private sector standards. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) became the primary source of standards. Congress focused on helping states and localities construct better roads rather than regulating driver conduct or vehicle design at the national level. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) was founded in 1905 and played a key role in establishing vehicle safety and emission rules. State governments often used SAE recommendations for vehicle equipment regulations. In 1926, a Uniform Vehicle Code was drafted to standardize regulations nationwide. By 1946, 30 states had adopted the code. The Interstate Highway system in the 1950s led to increased automobile travel and a focus on highway safety. In the 1950s, the Interstate Highway system led to more automobile travel and increased highway safety concerns. Congress passed safety bills between 1962 and 1964, including a seat belt regulation. This paved the way for more comprehensive legislation, culminating in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which established federal safety standards for vehicles. Senator Abraham Ribicoff emphasized the need for federal involvement in setting vehicle safety standards due to the scale of the issue. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 set federal standards for automobiles entering the 50 states to improve highway safety. It mandated states to implement safety programs and directed the Secretary of Commerce to issue safety standards for motor vehicles. The National Traffic Safety Agency, later renamed NHTSA, was established to enforce these provisions. Senator Warren Magnuson played a key role in the legislation. The National Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA) was established in 1970 to enforce federal standards for automobiles. Senator Warren Magnuson emphasized the importance of responsible regulation to improve traffic safety without taking over the design and manufacturing functions of the automotive industry. NHTSA issues safety standards and maintains a database on vehicle crashes but does not approve vehicles or parts for compliance. The National Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA) enforces federal standards for automobiles, with automakers responsible for certifying compliance at delivery. Manufacturers are also accountable for testing vehicles, recalls, and penalties if standards are not met. NHTSA conducts tests on new models to ensure compliance and can order recalls if necessary. The EU vehicle system requires government regulatory approval before manufacturing, unlike the U.S. self-certification system. European vehicle safety regulations harmonized for economic integration in the 1950s. The EU regulatory regime includes EU directives and UN standards implemented by member states. The UN established Working Party 29 in 1952 to oversee vehicle construction. Working Party 29 (WP.29) is part of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and aims to harmonize technical regulations for vehicles globally. UNECE standards focus on vehicle safety, environmental protection, fuel efficiency, and anti-theft performance. Signatories to the 1958 U.N. agreement commit to mutual recognition of approvals for vehicle components across countries. WP.29's voting members are government representatives, but other organizations also participate in its meetings. The United States did not sign the 1958 UNECE agreement due to concerns about mutual recognition of standards generated outside the U.S. However, in 1998, the U.S. signed a UNECE agreement establishing global technical regulations (GTRs), transforming the U.N. body into the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. GTRs cover vehicle safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency, and anti-theft performance without requiring type approval or mutual recognition of approvals. The UNECE agreement established global technical regulations (GTRs) in 1998, covering vehicle safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency, and anti-theft performance. These regulations are issued in a UN Global Registry, and each contracting party implements them through their own regulatory process. The European Community and its successor, the EU, have worked towards harmonizing vehicle approvals across member states, initially basing their standards on U.S. practices. Since 1970, the EU has implemented the Whole Vehicle Type Approval system for new model cars, requiring approval by national authorities before entering the market. EU member states enforce EU standards and can choose to incorporate UNECE standards into their regulations. The EU system applies to complete vehicles and considers UNECE standards for specific auto parts. The EU has a Whole Vehicle Type Approval system for new cars, incorporating UNECE standards. Approval is obtained through testing by government agencies or designated test houses. Once approved, a \"certificate of conformity\" is issued for each vehicle. The EU agreed in 2007 to include UNECE regulations in the approval process. Legislative work is led by the European Commission, promoting vehicle safety through various initiatives. Car initiatives in the United States began in the early 20th century and gained momentum after World War II to address air pollution. Ground-level ozone, or \"smog,\" was identified as a major issue in urban areas, with cars being a key source of pollutants like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, air toxics, and greenhouse gases. Vehicle emissions contribute to ground-level ozone formation and are the largest domestic source of air toxics, which can have serious health and environmental effects. The federal government and California took early steps in the 1950s and 1960s to address air pollution from vehicles, recognizing their contribution to ground-level ozone formation and greenhouse gas emissions. This led to the establishment of air quality standards and controls for motor vehicle emissions. In the 1960s, California and the U.S. government implemented regulations for motor vehicle emissions. California set control requirements in 1961 and established HC and CO emissions regulations in 1964. The federal Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act of 1965 adopted California's standards for 1968 model-year vehicles. Congress preempted states from enforcing new motor vehicle emissions standards in 1967. The federal government preempted states from enforcing new motor vehicle emission standards in 1967, with California being the sole exemption. Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency establishes emission standards for engines and vehicles, including greenhouse gases, under the Clean Air Act. California continues to play a significant role in shaping national legislation and regulations. EPA's authority to regulate vehicle emissions is based on the Clean Air Act, and new regulations undergo a federal rulemaking process after public discussion. The EPA establishes emissions standards for vehicles under the Clean Air Act. California has the authority to develop its own emission regulations if granted a waiver by the EPA. California emission standards are administered by the California Air Resources Board. The California Air Resources Board, part of the California Environmental Protection Agency, enforces emission standards for vehicles. The Clean Air Act allows states to choose between federal or California standards. The current \"Tier 2\" standards have been in place since 2004, with proposed Tier 3 standards announced in 2013. Compliance with the CAA and EPA regulations is required to sell vehicles in the U.S., following a similar approval process to the EU system. Manufacturers must adhere to EPA emission standards for their vehicles. The EPA sets emission standards for engines and vehicles, with testing procedures like the Federal Test Procedure. Compliance is ensured through pre-production and production evaluations. The EU did not initially include environmental matters in its founding Treaty of Rome. The UNECE produced regulations on safety, environmental protection, and energy efficiency before the mid-1980s. The Single European Act in 1985 aimed to unify the European market by 1992, harmonizing auto emissions regulations in 1987. Directive 70/220/EEC regulated vehicle exhaust emissions in Europe from 1970. The European Council adopted the Consolidated Emissions Directive (Euro 1) in 1991, setting vehicle emission standards for CO, NO x , PM, and HC. Current standards (Euro 5) cover these emissions for gasoline and diesel vehicles, with Euro 6 standards set to strengthen NO x standards for diesel vehicles in 2014. Emission testing is done using the NEDC chassis dynamometer procedure under the type approval process. The test procedure was modified to align with the U.S. Federal Test Procedure by eliminating the engine warm-up period before emission sampling. The Euro 5/6 legislation introduced a new PM mass emission measurement method similar to the U.S. procedure. Vehicle emissions standards in the EU and the U.S. differ due to testing procedures and approval processes. Compliance in the EU is based on type approval, with emission standards applying only during production. Once vehicles are in service, manufacturers are not liable for continued compliance. Surveillance testing, emissions system warranties, and recall campaigns are features of U.S. emissions regulations. The European regulatory structure does not include mandatory emissions system warranties, recall campaigns, and other U.S. emissions regulation features. The EU uses the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) for testing, while the U.S. uses the Federal Test Procedure (FTP). Differences in distance, duration, and vehicle speed exist between the two tests. Some observers note that European emission standards historically lag behind U.S. standards in terms of stringency. The lag in European emission standards compared to the U.S. is attributed to the consensus-based approach used by UNECE and difficulty in obtaining agreement among many countries. The recent shift to decision procedures allowing less-than-unanimous agreement within the European Commission has enabled the adoption of more stringent emission standards. The United States establishes fuel economy standards through direct statutory authority from Congress, with NHTSA administering the standards in response to the OPEC oil embargo. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for new passenger vehicles in response to the OPEC oil embargo. The average fuel economy of new automobiles increased by 81% from 1975 to 1988. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 granted NHTSA broader authority to establish and modify CAFE standards, raising the fuel economy standards of passenger vehicles to at least 35 mpg by 2020. The Obama Administration, state regulators, and the auto industry collaborated to establish new fuel efficiency standards for light duty vehicles linked to greenhouse gas emission standards in 2009. This agreement allowed automakers to comply with both federal and state requirements under the Clean Air Act and CAFE standards. The combined CAFE/GHG standards have made standard setting more complex. The combined CAFE/GHG standards set fleet-average passenger car and light truck emissions at 163 grams per mile by 2025, equivalent to 54.5 mpg. Each manufacturer must maintain a fleet average below the sales-weighted targets based on track width and wheelbase. This allows heavier cars to have higher emissions while preserving the overall average. The 2012 CAFE and GHG vehicle standards include a system of averaging, banking, and trading of credits based on fleet average CO2 performance. Various program flexibilities are available, such as Air Conditioning Improvement Credits, Advanced Technology Credits, and Flex-fuel and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Credits. Certification is based on fuel economy and emission data provided by manufacturers after EPA laboratory test cycles. CAFE values are generally higher than real-world fuel efficiency. The EPA 2-cycle test and CAFE figures do not fully represent real-world fuel efficiency due to vehicle operation patterns and technology differences. The EU sets GHG emission standards instead of direct fuel economy standards, with targets set through voluntary agreements with the automotive industry in 1998-99. These standards can be used to estimate fuel economy for vehicles sold in Europe. The EU established CO2 emission reduction targets for new passenger cars, aiming for a fleet-average of 130 g/km by 2015 and a long-term target of 95 g/km by 2020. Incentives are provided for vehicles with emissions below 50 g/km and running on E85. Flexibilities include credits for technology innovations, pooling between manufacturers, and exemptions for low-volume manufacturers. The regulations focus solely on CO2 emissions and do not cover other greenhouse gases. The EU regulates CO2 emissions for new passenger cars, with targets of 130 g/km by 2015 and 95 g/km by 2020. Incentives are provided for low emissions vehicles. The US regulates fuel efficiency through CAFE standards and GHG emissions separately. Comparing EU and US standards is challenging due to differences in testing methods. The EU and US have different regulations for vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency. The EU regulates CO2 emissions for new cars, while the US uses CAFE standards for fuel efficiency and GHG emissions separately. Differences in testing methods make it challenging to compare the two standards. EU standards result in greater emission reductions than US standards. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) are involved in setting vehicle standards in the US and EU. SAE develops recommended standards for industry, while ISO develops voluntary international standards for various products and services through negotiation in technical committees. NHTSA and EPA standards in the US are often based on the work done by SAE. ISO has developed nearly 20,000 standards since its founding in 1947. ISO has developed nearly 20,000 standards across industries, including automotive crankshaft bearings. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) develops international standards for electrical and electronic technologies. IEC standards for motor vehicles cover charging system architecture and lithium batteries. Various private-sector groups, such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and American National Standards Institute (ANSI), also contribute to identifying new vehicle standards. In the automotive industry, various organizations like the National Safety Council and European Transport Safety Council participate in standard-setting processes. In 1996, European, U.S., and Japanese auto industry groups proposed harmonizing regulations for vehicle components, but faced challenges in proving functional equivalency. This led to the development of alternative approaches for regulatory compliance. The 1998 UN agreement created a global registry of processes and technical standards for vehicle regulations. The World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations has agreed on 13 global technical regulations. The U.S.-EU High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum has been discussing regulatory conformity since the mid-1990s. President Clinton signed an action plan in 1995 to encourage collaborative testing and certification. The 1996 TransAtlantic Automotive Industry Conference produced ten principles for convergence in the auto sector. NHTSA sent a report to Congress in April 1997 on potential regulatory harmonization. The NHTSA sent a report to Congress in April 1997 discussing potential harmonization of U.S. and European side impact standards. Bilateral regulatory initiatives with Canada and the EU's CARS 21 have also explored harmonization issues. CARS 21 recommended stronger internationalization of the regulatory environment related to autos. Different ways for the U.S. and EU to address convergence of automotive regulations under TTIP include harmonization of rules without requiring identical rules in both regions. Harmonization in the automotive industry aims to minimize unnecessary differences in regulations between the U.S. and EU. Two approaches are proposed: comprehensive mutual recognition, where vehicles meeting U.S. or EU standards can be sold in either market, and selective mutual recognition, focusing on key standards like crash protection and emissions. The pending free trade agreement between the EU and Canada may influence the direction of TTIP, with a focus on protection, child restraint systems, and emissions standards as priorities for selective mutual recognition. Additionally, there is a proposal to develop standards for emerging regulations like electric and fuel cell vehicles, rather than solely focusing on existing regulations. The lengthy rule-making process for international vehicle standards may delay new technologies that could improve road safety. Concerns have been raised about reduced legislative scrutiny and involvement of interest groups if standards become international. U.S. consumer advocacy groups have also expressed similar worries about potential limitations on adopting higher consumer and worker protection standards. Congress may have a significant role in the TTIP agreement regarding auto safety, emissions, and fuel economy regulations. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established standards for limiting tailpipe emissions from new motor vehicles. If the TTIP affects agencies' authority or changes how automotive regulations are developed, Congress may need to modify underlying statutes governing vehicle safety, emissions, and fuel efficiency. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set standards to limit tailpipe emissions from new motor vehicles, with Tier 1 standards effective in 1994 for light-duty vehicles. These standards covered major pollutants and led to the introduction of more stringent Tier 2 regulations in 2000, applying the same emission limits to all vehicle weight categories. The Tier 2 emission standards, introduced in 2000, apply the same emission limits to all vehicle weight categories regardless of fuel type. Manufacturers have flexibility to certify vehicles to different stringency levels called \"certification bins\" but must meet a fleet-average requirement for NOx emissions. U.S. standards are based on grams per mile, while EU standards are based on grams per kilometer. EU Vehicle Emission Standards, known as \"Euro\" standards, have evolved since the adoption of Euro 1 in 1991. The latest standard, Euro 6, will be implemented in September 2014. In contrast, U.S. standards aim for a combined passenger car and light truck greenhouse gas emissions target of 163 grams per mile by 2025, equivalent to 54.5 miles per gallon. The EPA's GHG standards for vehicles are based on CO2 emissions-footprint curves, with different compliance targets for each vehicle based on its size. The regulations also include emission caps for nitrous oxide and methane, as well as a system of credit trading based on fleet average CO2 performance. The EU does not have fuel economy standards like the U.S. CAFE standards. EU regulations require fleet-average CO2 emission targets of 130 g/km by 2015 and a long-term target of 95 g/km by 2020. Credit trading is allowed among all vehicles a manufacturer produces."
