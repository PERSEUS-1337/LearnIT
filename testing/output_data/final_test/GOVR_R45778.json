    "content": "The enactment of spending categories allows for upward adjustment of discretionary limits. Adjustments are specified in Section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. OMB evaluates compliance with spending limits and submits sequestration reports to Congress for transparency. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits are specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. These adjustments vary, with two uncapped adjustments for Overseas Contingency Operations and emergency spending, and five capped adjustments for specific programs. Two additional adjustments address technical issues. OMB reports show approximately $891 billion in spending under these adjustments over seven fiscal years. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits are specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Two uncapped adjustments for Overseas Contingency Operations and emergency spending, along with five capped adjustments for specific programs, are made. OMB reports show approximately $891 billion in spending under these adjustments over seven fiscal years. Spending for OCO totaled around $646 billion, with OCO spending ranging from $74 billion to $104 billion. Emergency spending totaled about $178 billion, with most allocated in FY2018. Other adjustments made up 7% of total spending under the adjustments. The Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO) allows Congress and the President to designate any amount of spending without a limit. The legislation must specify that the spending is for OCO, each account within an appropriations bill must be designated separately, and the President must also designate the spending as being for an OCO requirement. Congress often includes language stating that spending designated for OCO is available only if the President also designates it as such. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 included OCO designations for specific accounts like Military Personnel, Army and Navy, with Congress designating amounts for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 designated funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, as outlined in Section 6 of the act. The President formally designated the spending for OCO and transmitted the designations to Congress. The Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for adjustments to spending limits to accommodate designated emergency requirements, including Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending. OCO funds are not limited to defense spending and can appear in various appropriations bills beyond the Department of Defense. The Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for adjustments to spending limits for designated emergency requirements, including Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending. Congress and the President can designate any amount for emergencies without a statutory limit, with specific requirements for the designation of emergency spending. The Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows adjustments to spending limits for designated emergency requirements, including Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending. Emergency spending must be designated by the President as such, with specific requirements for the designation. An example is the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017, which included emergency designations for various accounts, such as \"Wildland Fire Management\" for urgent fire suppression operations. The Congress designated a specific amount for emergency requirements under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The President subsequently designated the spending as an emergency requirement, as outlined in the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017. The Congress designated funds for emergency requirements under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The President designated the spending as an emergency requirement for disaster relief, with adjustments made to accommodate enacted spending. Adjustment amounts for disaster relief are limited and calculated based on a statutory formula. Congress may provide funds for disaster relief, with spending counted against discretionary limits or designated as an emergency requirement. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $23.5 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for hurricanes, using the emergency adjustment. The formula for disaster relief spending was amended by the CAA of 2018, to apply from FY2019 onwards. The CAA of 2018 introduced a new formula for disaster relief funding starting from FY2019. OMB is required to provide a preview estimate of the adjustment for disaster relief in its Sequestration Update Report. For FY2018, $7.366 billion was allocated for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund in the CAA of 2018. The formula for calculating the limit for disaster relief adjustment for FY2018 and earlier was based on the average funding provided over the previous 10 years, excluding the highest and lowest years. The CAA of 2018 introduced a new formula for disaster relief funding starting from FY2019. The formula for FY2019 and beyond comprises the total of the average funding provided for disaster relief over the previous 10 years, excluding the highest and lowest years; 5% of the total appropriations provided. This change is expected to increase the funding ceiling for disaster relief. The CAA of 2018 introduced a new formula for disaster relief funding starting from FY2019, which includes the total average funding provided for disaster relief over the previous 10 years, excluding the highest and lowest years, and 5% of total appropriations. Adjustments may also be made for wildfire suppression operations in the Wildland Fire Management accounts. The CAA of 2018 introduced a new formula for disaster relief funding starting from FY2019, which includes adjustments for wildfire suppression operations in the Wildland Fire Management accounts. The law allows adjustments to accommodate additional budget authority for wildfire suppression, without requiring a separate designation from the President. The BCA includes adjustments to ensure appropriate spending and safeguard against waste, fraud, and abuse. The BCA allows adjustments to spending limits for program integrity activities conducted by the Social Security Administration, including continuing disability reviews, redeterminations, cooperative disability investigation units, fraud prosecutions, and work-related disability reviews. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 expanded the types of activities eligible for adjustments. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 allows adjustments to spending limits for program integrity activities conducted by the Social Security Administration, including continuing disability reviews and work-related disability reviews. The adjustments are capped for each fiscal year but can accommodate additional budget authority for program integrity activities. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated funds for continuing disability reviews under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 allows adjustments to spending limits for program integrity activities conducted by the Social Security Administration, including work-related continuing disability reviews under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. This includes funding for redeterminations of eligibility, co-operative disability investigation units, and prosecution of fraud. Adjustments are made to accommodate additional budget authority for these activities. The law allows adjustments to spending limits for health care fraud and abuse control program at the Department of Health and Human Services, with a cap specified in statute. Adjustments may not exceed certain amounts for FY2012-FY2021, but can accommodate additional new budget authority exceeding $311 million without requiring a separate designation from the President. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 included related spending for health care fraud and abuse control. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included $745 million for health care fraud and abuse control, with $311 million designated for specific purposes. Adjustments to spending limits may be made to accommodate grants to states under the Social Security Act, with specified amounts for FY2019-FY2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allows adjustments to spending limits for reemployment services and eligibility assessments exceeding $117 million without separate designation from the President. Changes must be calculated by OMB and approved after consultation with relevant committees. The law allows adjustments to discretionary spending limits to accommodate changes in concepts and definitions, similar to adjustments made between 1991 and 2002. Legislation is enacted annually to permit adjustments for that fiscal year. The law allows adjustments to discretionary spending limits for a fiscal year in case of estimating differences between the Congressional Budget Office and OMB. Adjustments are limited to 0.2 percent of the sum of adjusted discretionary spending limits for all categories for that fiscal year. Title I in Division A of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) authorized appropriations for health care, research, and opioid abuse programs. OMB adjusted discretionary spending limits for FY2018 due to estimating differences with CBO, with adjustments made for defense and nondefense categories. The adjustments were within the allowable limit set by OMB. The 21st Century Cures Act established three accounts for NIH, FDA, and opioid crisis response, with funds transferred from the Treasury. Appropriations were authorized for specific fiscal years, with funds only available upon appropriation. Appropriations for these activities are subtracted from cost estimates to enforce spending limits, effectively exempting them from such limits. The bill exempts certain spending from discretionary spending limits between FY2017 and FY2026 for accounts related to NIH, FDA, and opioid crisis response."
