    "content": "The Act titled \"Generic Complex Drugs Safety and Effectiveness for Patients Act of 2015\" is focused on reviewing generic versions of certain complex drug products through a GAO study of scientific issues related to the regulatory pathway. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to determine challenges in approving nonbiologic complex drug products as reference products in generic drug applications. The Comptroller General of the United States will study challenges in approving nonbiologic complex drug products as reference products in generic drug applications, including the degree of characterization required for the proposed generic version and the reference product. The safety and effectiveness of generic versions compared to reference products require determining similarity in active ingredients, evidence of bioequivalence, comparability of manufacturing processes, and the extent of clinical evidence needed. The need for clinical evidence to demonstrate immunogenicity and safety of generic versions compared to reference products is being considered for potential amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA is considering amendments to address the approval of copy versions of nonbiologic complex drug products and biological products, as well as potential amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding clinical evidence for generic versions. The FDA is considering developing a policy document on the evidence needed for approval of generic versions of nonbiologic complex drug products and biological products. The Comptroller General will conduct a study in consultation with relevant entities to consider clinical reports for the development of a policy document on generic drug approval. The Comptroller General will conduct a study to review clinical reports of adverse events related to generic versions of nonbiologic complex and biological products, as well as reference products. This study will also examine the criteria used by the Secretary to approve these generic versions and the specific criteria outlined in guidance documents for licensing biosimilar biological products. The Comptroller General may consider reports and guidelines from foreign countries regarding biosimilar biological products in the licensing process. The Secretary or foreign regulatory agencies may require clinical trials to confirm the therapeutic equivalence or safety and effectiveness of generic versions of nonbiologic complex drug products or biological products. The completion date for this requirement is within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. The Comptroller General will conduct a study and submit a report on complex drug products not fully characterized to relevant committees. The definition includes drugs with molecular diversity and unidentified molecular structures. The active ingredient in complex drug products must have fully identified molecular structures and physiochemical properties. The nature of the active ingredient is not fully understood to identify all molecular components and mechanisms of action for the therapeutic effect. The term \"bioequivalent\" and \"generic drug\" are defined in this section. The term \"generic drug\" in the United States refers to a drug approved under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A \"generic drug application\" is an abbreviated application for approval under the same section. \"Proposed\" refers to a generic version pending before the FDA, and a \"reference product\" is the original drug for a generic version. The term \"generic drug\" refers to a drug approved under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
