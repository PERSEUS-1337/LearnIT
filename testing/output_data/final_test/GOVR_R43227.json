    "content": "The federal government has funded work on global climate change for over four decades, focusing on science, mitigation, and adaptation. At least 18 agencies, along with the Executive Office of the President, are involved in supporting research conducted by various entities. Funding primarily goes towards scientific and technological research and development, aiming to improve decision-making information and reduce technology costs. Federal efforts also include planning and adaptation to climate change, complemented by regulatory actions and capacity-building programs. The federal government has funded initiatives to address climate change, including regulatory actions, capacity-building programs, and tax incentives for low greenhouse gas-emitting technologies. These initiatives are part of the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan, focusing on cutting carbon pollution, preparing for climate impacts, and leading international efforts. Federal funding for these activities varies across priorities and has shifted over time, with different policy instruments and programs requiring varying levels of funding for effectiveness. As congressional debate on climate change funding continues, Members of Congress express varying views on the priorities and magnitude of federal expenditures. Some question the risks and benefits, while others support increased funding based on scientific and economic research. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have identified approximately $77 billion in budget authority for federal funding. Federal agencies have identified around $77 billion in budget authority for climate change activities from FY2008 to FY2013, with over 75% allocated to technology development and deployment, mainly through the Department of Energy. A significant portion of this funding was from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This CRS report provides details on federal budget authority for climate change activities during this period and the President's FY2014 request. The information is sourced from OMB and individual departments and agencies. The OMB has produced a \"budget cross-cut\" for climate change activities, but funding information from individual agencies may not be comprehensive or comparable. Double-counting of funding could occur when agencies cooperate on programs. Some sources report inconsistent or incomplete data, leading to an underestimation of total federal funding for climate change activities. Information is not available for all programs for all years. The President's FY2014 budget request includes $11.6 billion for federal programs addressing climate change. Funding is allocated for the Global Change Research Program, Clean Energy Technologies, International Assistance, and Climate Adaptation. The budget breakdown is 23% for science, 68% for clean energy technology, 8% for international assistance, and 1% for climate change adaptation. The Office of Management and Budget also reports on energy tax provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Office of Management and Budget reports on energy tax provisions that may reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate deployment of low GHG-emitting technologies, reducing tax revenues by $9.8 billion. Minor inconsistencies in funding reports may be due to rescissions or reprogramming. Reported initiatives are cross-agency programs and funding roll-ups, with information availability varying based on agency reporting to OMB. The CRS report provides information on enacted budget authority and tax provisions for climate change programs since FY2001. Past funding may not align with present accounting due to various factors. The report also highlights caveats in comparing funding trends and categories. The historical budget authority for climate change programs has shifted towards Clean Energy Technologies since FY2001, surpassing science funding. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 made a significant one-time investment in climate-related technologies. The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established by Congress in 1990 to improve understanding of climate science and support policymaking. Thirteen departments and agencies participate in the program. The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) collaborates with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to set research priorities and funding plans aligned with the Administration's goals. The program includes the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and Clean Energy Technologies (CET) efforts to develop technologies reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for CET aims to promote the use of renewable energy technologies. The Clean Energy Technologies (CET) initiative aims to develop and promote various energy technologies, including renewable, low-carbon fossil, and nuclear technologies, as well as energy-efficient products and process improvements. The budget for CET, primarily under the Department of Energy, is set to increase significantly in the FY2014 budget request to nearly $7.9 billion, reflecting the current Administration's focus on new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The United States has reduction targets of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and approximately 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. Meeting the 2050 target would require radical change in the energy system. The Department of Energy coordinates the CCTP inter-agency effort, with most activities within the department. The US supports international financial assistance for global climate change initiatives through the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI). The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) integrates climate change considerations into U.S. foreign assistance through bilateral, multilateral, and private sector mechanisms to promote sustainable societies, low-carbon growth, and reduce emissions. Implemented primarily through programs at the Department of State, Department of the Treasury, and USAID, GCCI activities focus on bilateral development assistance and international organizations like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The GCCI receives funding from various sources such as the Global Environment Facility and the Clean Technology Fund. Most agencies do not report funding for climate change adaptation plans as required by Executive Order 13514. The Department of the Interior is an exception, with funding details readily available. The Department of the Interior issued Secretarial Order 3289 in 2009 (amended in 2010) to address the impacts of climate change on America's water, land, and natural resources. Funding for climate change-related activities has increased over the past two decades, expanding from scientific research to various programs and technologies. The federal strategy on climate change focuses on developing technologies, building an analytical foundation for policy actions, planning for adaptation, assisting private sector decision-makers and lower-income countries, and addressing additional needs. The strategy reflects existing programs, presidential initiatives, and congressionally directed activities. Funding priorities for climate change-related programs are primarily aimed at investment and tax provisions to stimulate action. The funding for climate change-related programs, particularly in clean energy technologies, has been a significant focus since FY2001. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided a substantial boost to energy technology development. Funding for climate change science has remained relatively constant, with fluctuations of up to 15% in real dollars. The FY2014 request would bring funding for science close to its peak level. International assistance for capacity-building and GHG mitigation in low-income countries has nearly tripled from FY2001 to FY2013. The FY2014 request proposes a 9.5% increase to $856 million, reflecting a growing focus on climate change adaptation. Federal agencies have expanded activities since 2009, but OMB's budget cross-cut lacks comprehensive reporting on these efforts. Efforts to address climate change are often integrated into broader programs rather than being standalone initiatives. For instance, grants for coastal zone planning may consider factors like sea level rise and storm surges. The Department of the Interior is one of the few agencies explicitly reporting adaptation funds, which make up less than 1% of the FY2013 funding across agencies. However, interpreting the funding allocation for climate change activities is complicated by various reporting issues, such as budget aggregation, changes in reporting scope, and inconsistencies in accounting methods. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigated the Administration's reporting practices on federal funding for climate change activities in 2005, 2006, and 2011. GAO recommended greater clarity and consistency in reporting, but issues persist, making analysis of climate change funding challenging. The 2011 GAO report identified two key factors complicating efforts to align funding with priorities: lack of shared understanding of strategic priorities among federal officials and nonbinding mechanisms for aligning funding with priorities. The funding data described in this report primarily come from OMB's Reports to Congress on Federal Climate Change Expenditures. OMB produces these budget cross-cuts only when required by legislation, and if the 113th Congress finds the data useful, they may consider renewing reporting requirements for climate change-related activities. Some Members of Congress are interested in how federal funding supports the Obama Administration's climate change strategy. Legislative considerations may include sufficiency of resources, demands for adaptation programming, foreign aid for low-income countries, and potential restructuring proposals. Possible legislative proposals to restructure or improve collaboration among agencies regarding climate change activities and incorporate recommendations from evaluations to enhance climate change programs."
