    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Air Force Science and Technology for the 21st Century Act of 2001\". The Air Force has historically prioritized science and technology development. However, funding for Air Force science and technology programs decreased significantly from fiscal year 1989 to 2001. This led to a shift towards more short-term projects with incremental advances rather than long-term revolutionary projects. The decline in Air Force science and technology spending over the last decade is attributed to factors such as lack of high-level advocacy, inadequate visibility in decision-making, and a lack of clear planning linking long-term warfighting needs with technology development in budget planning. The Air Force science and technology budget planning process is ineffective, leading to a decline in development that could impact national security. Congress has tried to reverse this trend by allocating more funds than requested by the President. The Air Force is undergoing significant changes in its budget and policy-making approach. The Air Force has implemented changes in its science and technology development programs, including increased emphasis by senior-level decision-makers, designation of a budget advocate, and a new planning process linked to the Air Force Strategic Plan. The Air Force is conducting a review of its science and technology programs to address long-term challenges and short-term objectives. Additional measures are needed to ensure advocacy and prioritization of technology investment for the Air Force. SEC. 3. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. Sense of Congress: The Secretary of the Air Force should prioritize representation of the science and technology community in program planning and budget decisions, institutionalize advocacy for science and technology development, and emphasize the value of science and technology to warfighters. The Air Force should prioritize representation of the science and technology community in program planning and budget decisions, institutionalize advocacy for science and technology development, and emphasize the value of science and technology to warfighters. Additionally, they should complete and adopt a policy directive for changes in budgetary decisions related to science and technology development programs, conduct a review of long-term challenges and short-term objectives every five years, and ensure that development and planning activities are carried out for the future. The Secretary of the Air Force will reinstate a development planning process that coordinates warfighter needs with science and technology decisions, establishes priorities for programs, analyzes resource allocation, develops technology concepts, and evaluates systems for future goals. The Secretary of the Air Force will reinstate a development planning process that coordinates warfighter needs with science and technology decisions, establishes priorities for programs, analyzes resource allocation, develops technology concepts, and evaluates systems for future goals. This includes evaluating concepts for systems and operations that leverage technology across Air Force organizational boundaries, ensuring a \"system-of-systems\" approach in capability planning exercises, and utilizing existing analysis capabilities within Air Force product centers. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the implementation of this planning process within one year and $20,000,000 is authorized annually for this purpose starting in fiscal year 2002. The Air Force will study and report on the effectiveness of changes in its science and technology programs. The Secretary of the Air Force, in collaboration with the National Research Council, will conduct a study to assess the impact of recent changes to the Air Force science and technology program on future capabilities. The study will review if the changes adequately address concerns raised by various entities and ensure the availability of technology to maintain US military superiority and counter high-risk threats. The study will assess recent changes to the Air Force science and technology program to counter future high-risk threats. Investments are balanced to meet near-, mid-, and long-term needs, technologies are available for flexible responses to threats, and the organizational structure ensures advocacy for science and technology during budget planning. The study will also evaluate if biannual summits provide visibility and value appreciation to senior Air Force decision-makers. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of various aspects of the Air Force science and technology program, including the input of all levels into decision-making, budget advocacy, development planning, and coordination with warfighter needs. The study will assess the effectiveness of the Air Force science and technology program in identifying the basis for the appropriate program top line and investment portfolio. The Secretary of the Air Force must report the results to Congress within 60 days, with an authorization of $950,000 for this purpose. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Science, Technology, and Engineering, should be paid at the highest rate of basic pay for a member of the Senior Executive Service, as per Congress's recommendation."
