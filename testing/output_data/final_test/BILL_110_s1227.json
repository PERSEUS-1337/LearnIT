    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Coal Act of 2007\". The \"Clean Coal Act of 2007\" acknowledges that fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, with coal power plants alone responsible for 30% of annual emissions. Additionally, over 150 new coal-fired electric generating units are proposed to be built, adding 96 gigawatts of new capacity. The \"Clean Coal Act of 2007\" addresses the significant carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States, particularly coal power plants. It mentions the proposal for over 150 new coal-fired electric generating units, with the potential to add 96 gigawatts of capacity. Additionally, it highlights the long operational lifespan of power plants, with Xcel Energy's project aiming to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-generated electricity. The \"Clean Coal Act of 2007\" focuses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, emphasizing the importance of designing new power plants with lower emissions. The Energy Information Administration projected a significant increase in carbon dioxide pollution from power plants between 2004 and 2030. The projected increase in annual carbon dioxide pollution from power plants in 2030 is equivalent to emissions from 196,000,000 cars. Global temperatures rose by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the 21st century, leading to melting glaciers, disappearing species, extreme weather patterns, and more intense hurricanes. Earth's current temperature is the highest in 12,000 years, only 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than the maximum temperature in the past 1,000,000 years. Immediate action is needed to reduce these impacts. Unless significant action is taken today to reduce emissions, the Earth could warm between 5 and 9 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, and increased flooding. SEC. 3. Carbon dioxide new source performance standards for new coal-fired electric generating units. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include Carbon Dioxide Standards of Performance for Affected Units, defining affected units as new coal-fired electric generating units starting construction after April 26, 2007. These units must meet an emissions limitation of producing no more than 285 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour for grid supply, with revisions required every five years by the Administrator. The Administrator must revise the carbon dioxide standard of performance every 5 years to reduce emissions if achievable through the best technological system of continuous emission reduction. The revision must be published in the Federal Register after public comment and is considered final agency action. Injection of carbon dioxide into geological formations, if done in a way that prevents its release into the atmosphere, will not be counted as emissions from affected units for meeting carbon dioxide standards."
