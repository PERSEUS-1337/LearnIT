Batch normalization (BN) is a widely used method but is less effective with multi-modal distributions. A more flexible approach is proposed, extending normalization to multiple mean and variance values to detect data modes dynamically. This method outperforms BN and other normalization techniques in various experiments, including single and multi-task datasets. Internal covariate shift, a challenge in optimizing deep learning models, is addressed by normalization methods like BN. In this paper, a new normalization method called mode normalization (MN) is introduced to address the limitations of batch normalization (BN) in normalizing activations in neural networks exposed to heterogeneous data. MN assigns samples in a mini-batch to different modes, improving normalization effectiveness compared to BN. Mode normalization (MN) assigns samples in a mini-batch to different modes via a gating network and normalizes each sample with estimators for its corresponding mode. MN can be integrated into other normalization techniques like group normalization (GN) by learning which filters should be grouped together. The proposed methods can be easily implemented in deep learning libraries and parameters are learned jointly with the network's other parameters. MN showed consistent improvement over existing normalization approaches in multiple classification tasks. Normalization in neural networks involves adjusting internal activations. Local response normalization (LRN) enforces competition in a local neighborhood, while batch normalization (BN) implements global normalization along the batch dimension. BN requires distinct training and inference modes. After training, shifts and scales are taken from running averages. MN assigns samples to different modes and normalizes them accordingly, showing improvement in classification tasks. Our proposed method addresses heterogeneity and small batch size issues by normalizing data based on different modes. Recent normalization methods like BID1, BID43, and BID14 have emerged to overcome limitations of BN. BID14 introduces a batch renormalization strategy to prevent degenerate cases. While these methods are effective for training sequential and generative models, they have not matched BN's performance in supervised classification. BN has also attracted attention from theoretical viewpoints. In recent research, alternative normalization methods like group normalization (GN) and data-independent reparametrization of weights have been proposed to address issues with batch normalization (BN). These methods show promising results but may not generalize to all non-linearities and layers. Additionally, fitting a Gaussian mixture model to intermediate feature distributions has been suggested to account for modality in some layers. Mixtures of experts (MoE) models involve combining simple learners to split up the learning problem, allocating samples to different subregions best suited for each example. Various expert architectures like SVMs, Gaussian processes, and deep neural networks have been explored. While similar methods use gating networks at each layer for expert opinions, our approach differs by using a gating function at every layer to assign samples in a mini-batch to separate modes. Our method of using gating functions to normalize data within modes and forwarding it to a common module differs from traditional MoE approaches. It is also related to Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks, but we normalize responses within each mode using gating function outputs. Additionally, our approach can automatically discover modes in both single and multi-domain settings without requiring domain knowledge supervision. Our method utilizes gating functions to normalize data within modes and forward it to a common module, different from traditional MoE approaches. It can automatically discover modes in single and multi-domain settings without supervision. The goal is to learn a prediction rule for inferring class labels for unseen samples using deep convolutional neural networks. Batch normalization (BN) and group normalization (GN) are techniques used in deep convolutional neural networks to normalize features computed by layers. BN computes estimators for mini-batches and normalizes samples to have zero mean and unit variance along channel dimensions. GN performs a similar normalization process. Group normalization (GN) separates channels into fixed groups and computes estimators over these groups, avoiding the need for large batch sizes. However, it may prevent channels from developing distinct characteristics. A more flexible approach to normalization is proposed due to the heterogeneous nature of complex datasets. A more flexible approach to normalization is proposed, called Mode normalization, which organizes data into modes before normalization. This method includes training and test phases, as well as Mode group normalization with channel-wise gates and mixtures of experts. Mode normalization, a more flexible approach to normalization, introduces gating functions for mixtures of experts. Each sample in the mini-batch is normalized based on its gate assignment, with weighted averages for mean and variance estimates under the gating network. Gating functions are parametrized via an affine transformation and softmax activation, resembling attention mechanisms. Mode normalization generalizes batch normalization, allowing for different modes and gating functions. Mode normalization introduces gating functions for mixtures of experts, allowing for different modes and gating functions. It normalizes channels with multi-modal behavior, which batch normalization struggles with. The flexibility of mode normalization is demonstrated by learning individual parameters for each mode, showing improved performance. MN normalizes data during training using estimators from the current batch and during inference using running estimates. During inference, running estimates are updated with a memory parameter \u03bb. Additional losses can prevent all samples from focusing on a single gate or encourage sparsity in gate activations. Unlike batch normalization, mode normalization can adapt to normalize based on soft assignments into different modes. Gates in mode normalization tend to receive an even share of samples and are usually assigned to individual modes. Mode group normalization (MGN) adapts to soft assignments into different modes by using a gating network to assign channels. Estimators are computed by averaging channel values, with learnable parameters for affine transformations. MGN, like group normalization (GN), ensures consistent transformation of inputs during training and inference. The risk of clusters collapsing into one is mitigated in MGN experiments. In experiments with Mode group normalization (MGN), the risk of clusters collapsing into one is mitigated. Two experimental settings are considered: multi-task and single task. The dataset used combines images from MNIST and CIFAR-10, with a focus on enforcing heterogeneity in the data distribution. The curr_chunk discusses various datasets used for training a network, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST. It mentions the number of training and test images in each dataset, the type of objects/classes in the images, and the training details such as batch size, epochs, and learning rate reductions. The focus is on training a single network with a 40-way classifier to jointly learn predictions on these datasets. MN outperformed standard BN and all other normalization methods with a small overhead in runtime. Increasing the number of modes did not always improve performance due to estimating statistics from smaller batch partitions. Mode group normalization is designed for large batch sizes, with K fixed at 2 for deeper networks. In a study comparing different normalization methods, Mode Group Normalization (MGN) outperformed Batch Normalization (BN) and Mode Normalization (MN) for various batch sizes. MGN, which combines the advantages of Group Normalization (GN) and MN, showed the best performance across different batch sizes. GN was found to be more robust to small batch sizes compared to BN and MN. Incorporating Mode Normalization (MN) into modern architectures improved performance in single-image classification tasks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ILSVRC12 datasets. The Network In Network (NIN) architecture was modified to include normalization layers (BN or MN) and trained on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with a batch size of 128 for 100 epochs using SGD and momentum. During training, images were augmented by flipping them horizontally and cropping them after padding. Dropout was reduced to 0.25 to improve performance. Adding Mode Normalization (MN) with K = 2 to Network In Network (NIN) increased trainable parameters by less than 1%. MN achieved a 0.4% and 0.6% boost over Batch Normalization (BN) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively. Test error rates for NIN on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are reported in TAB2. Adding Mode Normalization (MN) to VGG13 with BN improved performance by 0.4% on CIFAR10 and over 1% on CIFAR100. Residual Networks like ResNet20 were trained on both datasets with original architecture (BN) and with MN (K = 2), showing improvements in performance. Our implementation of ResNet20 with Mode Normalization (MN) outperformed the original publication, showing a 0.45% and 0.7% performance gain on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively. Replacing all normalization layers with MN in ResNet56 resulted in an improvement of roughly 0.5% on CIFAR10 and 1% on CIFAR100. Additionally, MN was tested in a ResNet18 model on ILSVRC12, achieving positive results after training for 90 epochs with SGD optimizer. MN results in a small but consistent improvement over BN in terms of top-1 and top-5 errors. Qualitative analysis shows MN's sensitivity to color modes in conv3-64-1 and semantic separations in deeper layers like conv-3-256-1. Stabilizing the training process of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Normalization approaches have emerged to stabilize the training process of deep neural networks, allowing for higher learning rates and faster model convergence. Extending these approaches to normalize features within multiple modes improves classification performance across various deep learning architectures. Future work includes exploring customized mode numbers in MN and automatically determining them using sparse regularization. Additional multi-task results show improved performance when jointly training on multiple datasets. In additional experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST, varying batch sizes to N = {256, 512} showed that larger batch sizes with K values larger than two improved performance. However, with a smaller batch size of N = 128, errors from finite estimation prevented this benefit."
