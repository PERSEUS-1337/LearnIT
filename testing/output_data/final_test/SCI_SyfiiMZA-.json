The approach maintains a distribution over design parameters and uses reinforcement learning to train a neural network controller. Through training, the robot distribution is refined to maximize expected reward, resulting in jointly optimal robot parameters and policy. The method is evaluated in legged locomotion, showing the discovery of novel robot designs. In legged locomotion, the physical design of a robot is crucial for its performance. Different designs are better suited for different tasks and environments, and can improve robustness to errors and delays. The computational and physical design of a robot are inherently linked, and must be jointly optimized to achieve optimal control strategies. The physical design and computational design of a robot are closely linked and must be optimized together for successful task completion in a specific environment. Changes in physical design can impact joint torques and locomotion behavior, requiring careful consideration for optimal performance. Co-designing the robot's design and gait for the target environment and task can lead to improved performance and adaptability. In co-designing a robot's physical characteristics and control policy for specific tasks, existing methods often overlook the inherent coupling between design and control. These methods require accurate models of robot dynamics and expert supervision, limiting their applicability and leading to solutions influenced by expert intuition. This work aims to develop a general approach that optimizes a robot's physical characteristics and controllers simultaneously, without the need for expert guidance.

Our method optimizes the physical design and control of a robot simultaneously through joint training with a neural network. It aims to achieve locomotion by maintaining a distribution over physical parameters and training them with a controller using deep reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that our approach can find novel designs and walking gaits that outperform manually designed agents. This method is the first to successfully optimize design and control jointly in a model-free manner. The text discusses optimizing a robot's design and motion parameters simultaneously using neural networks and constraint-based optimization. Previous work has focused on relating design and motion parameters through implicit functions and linearization. Another approach considers physical design and motion parameters for robots with articulated degrees of freedom. The text discusses optimizing robot design and motion parameters for legged robots using trajectory optimization. The method incorporates parameters like dimensions, masses, and contact forces, with a focus on weighted actuation cost. Unlike other approaches, this method guarantees a feasible design within a small neighborhood of a solution without the need for an accurate analytic model of constraint dynamics. The text discusses a derivative-free strategy for optimizing muscle routing and control in simulated bipeds, incorporating biomechanical constraints. In contrast to other methods, this approach applies to arbitrary morphologies and does not require modeling contact dynamics. The focus is on simultaneous optimization of robot design and motion parameters, a relatively new concept in research. The text discusses a method that uses a convolutional neural network to learn complex, nonlinear control policies for a high-speed robot arm without relying on an analytical model of the robot dynamics. This approach allows for more flexibility and accuracy in designing the controller compared to traditional methods. The text describes various approaches to optimizing robot motion and control, including interactive design frameworks for realizable walking gaits, synthesizing emergent behaviors for different tasks, and training neural networks as feedback controllers for complex behaviors in dynamical systems. These methods incorporate supervised learning, trajectory optimization, and noise to improve generalizability. The text discusses trajectory optimization methods for controlling dynamic motion in robots, particularly focusing on respecting contact constraints. These approaches have been successful in generating complex behaviors for various robot designs, including humanoids, by using high-level specifications of the robot's shape, gait, and task. Unlike other methods that combine trajectory optimization with supervised learning, this approach does not rely on knowledge of the model dynamics. There is a recent emphasis on learning control policies directly from sensory input without prior knowledge of system dynamics, with effective methods utilizing neural networks. Recent advancements in robot control involve combining neural networks with deep reinforcement learning to learn continuous control policies for various tasks such as controlling robots, robot manipulation, and legged robots. Black-box optimization is also utilized as an alternative to reinforcement learning for training control policies, offering advantages such as insensitivity to reward sparsity and the ability to handle long time horizons. These strategies have been successful in difficult reinforcement learning scenarios. Recent advancements in robot control involve combining neural networks with deep reinforcement learning to learn continuous control policies for various tasks such as controlling robots, robot manipulation, and legged robots. Strategies previously thought unsuitable for difficult reinforcement learning problems have shown promise in difficult continuous control problems, including locomotion. Policy-gradient methods have been developed to define policies as distributions over controller parameters, resulting in less noisy gradient estimates. Work has also focused on determining robot designs that meet specific task requirements, with some methods learning optimum designs from user demonstrations. BID5 learns optimal kinematic linkages from user demonstrations for a specific task, while BID22 synthesizes robot designs based on user-specified structural specifications. BID23 allows users to specify functional objectives in structured English, parsed into a formal specification using linear temporal logic. Censi (2017) discusses co-design theory for selecting robot parts based on functional constraints. Recent work optimizes sensor design and inference algorithms for perception systems, with BID3 focusing on learning camera sensor multiplexing patterns and reconstruction methods simultaneously. In this section, reconstruction methods for imaging tasks are discussed, focusing on modeling inference as a neural network and using stochastic gradient descent for backpropagation. BID39 jointly learns design and inference for beacon-based localization, encoding beacon allocation spatially and across transmission channels as a differential neural layer. The section also describes extending the standard reinforcement learning framework to learn the physical design of the agent. Reinforcement learning involves an agent receiving a state and taking actions based on a policy to maximize expected return. Policy gradient methods optimize cumulative reward by parameterizing a stochastic policy and performing stochastic gradient ascent on the expected return. These methods are commonly used for complex, continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning. Policy gradient methods optimize cumulative reward by parameterizing a stochastic policy and performing stochastic gradient ascent on the expected return. \"Vanilla\" policy gradient methods compute an estimate of the gradient using a sample-based mean, which yields an unbiased gradient estimate. To reduce variance, a baseline reward can be used. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) imposes a constraint on the KL-divergence between policies before and after an update to mitigate instability in deep reinforcement learning. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a first-order method similar to TRPO that maximizes expected return while encouraging small policy updates. It includes clipping within the objective to prevent large policy changes. PPO achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks and extends reinforcement learning by considering different robot designs. The goal is to find the optimal design and policy pair that maximizes the expected reward function. However, this is a complex optimization problem over all possible designs and policies, making exact solutions computationally infeasible. Instead, a gradient-based approach is developed to tackle this challenge. Our approach to solving the optimization problem involves maintaining a multi-modal distribution over physical designs and training a single controller to act on all sampled designs. This allows for thorough exploration of the design space and efficient evaluation of unseen designs. Learning common strategies across diverse designs while adapting different policies as needed enhances optimization tractability.

We sample different designs, compute their returns, and adjust the design distribution to maximize expected return through iterations until convergence. Validated with three robots in Roboschool, our approach discovers novel designs and outperforms hand-designed robots in locomotion tasks. The reward function in Roboschool environments is based on forward progress, staying upright, and penalties for torque application and joint limits. Robot designs are learned using specified morphologies with parameters for length and radius. Symmetry is imposed, and parameters are shared across legs for certain designs. This allows for a variety of robot shapes and sizes, some more suited for locomotion than others. The control policy is modeled as a feed-forward neural network. The control policy for robot locomotion is modeled as a neural network with three fully-connected layers. The robot design distribution is represented using a Gaussian mixture model with four components. The approach maintains high variance distributions for exploration before settling on a design. Further details are provided in the appendix. The appendix provides details on the evolution of reward distributions for the Hopper, Walker2d, and Ant environments. Training was done with Proximal Policy Optimization using 8 threads and 300M timesteps. The best-performing checkpoint of each run was displayed, with training curves becoming transparent after reaching peak performance. Hyperparameters were set on the Hopper and kept consistent across all experiments. Our approach to joint optimization over robot design and control on the Hopper, Walker2d, and Ant robots outperformed the standard Roboschool design. The method discovered unique robot designs and novel walking gaits that exceeded default designs, showcasing consistency and robustness across different random seeds. Our method learned joint design and controller for the Hopper, outperforming the baseline by up to 50%. The robot's small foot enabled faster, more precise walking, while a longer torso improved stability. This design consistency was observed across multiple experiments. The appendix explores design stability with varying environmental factors. For the Ant robot, our optimization resulted in a significantly different physical design. The learned Ant design significantly outperforms the baseline, improving reward by up to 116%. It has a small, lightweight body with extremely long legs that enable it to move at a fast pace. Different successful designs and walking gaits were observed, with one design having small, thick legs and long feet for balance, and another design moving differently by lowering the knee joint. The Walker2d robot moves differently by lowering the knee joint and lengthening the foot to balance efficiently on its knees and toes. This allows for a long, powerful stride similar to a sprinter using starting blocks. The comparison between default and learned robots shows the physical design and gaits, with a focus on optimizing both the robot's design and control policy simultaneously. Our approach focuses on optimizing the physical design and control policy of a robot without expert supervision. By maintaining a distribution over robot design parameters and using reinforcement learning with a neural network controller, we achieve jointly optimal results. Testing on various legged robot morphologies shows improved performance compared to manually defined designs. Future work includes optimizing designs for different terrains and relaxing current assumptions. Our framework aims to optimize robot design and control policy without expert supervision, exploring applications beyond legged robots. Further evaluation includes analyzing the design distribution behavior during training and the robustness of learned designs to environmental variations. The training process involves initializing a Gaussian mixture model with random means and covariance matrices, converging to optimal results as shown in FIG1. Our algorithm converges to the most successful component during training, showing consistent behavior across different robots and random seeds. The learned design is robust to changes in friction settings, outperforming hand-crafted designs across a range of values. The learned design outperforms hand-crafted designs across different friction values, showing consistent behavior and robustness.
