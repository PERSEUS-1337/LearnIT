    "content": "The \"Diabetes Prevention Act of 2009\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that diabetes prevalence has doubled in the US, with over 23.6 million people living with diabetes and 57 million with pre-diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program study in 2002 showed lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. The New York Times reported that lifestyle interventions for diabetes control have had positive outcomes, but are often unsustainable. Insurance companies cover treatments for diabetes complications but not cheaper interventions to prevent them. Research funded by NIH and CDC shows group lifestyle interventions can be cost-effective and achieve weight loss results similar to the Diabetes Prevention Program. The Urban Institute reported that investing in national lifestyle intervention programs for individuals at risk of diabetes could save $191 billion over 10 years and reduce diabetes cases by 50%. There is a need to increase availability of community-based programs for diabetes prevention. The Federal Government should provide incentive payments to healthcare providers for referring at-risk patients to diabetes prevention programs to reduce complications and lower treatment costs in the United States. Efforts should be made to replicate the successful results of the Diabetes Prevention Program on a larger scale. The Federal Government should provide incentive payments to healthcare providers for referring at-risk patients to diabetes prevention programs to reduce complications and lower treatment costs in the United States. Efforts should be made to replicate the successful results of the Diabetes Prevention Program on a larger scale. A new National Diabetes Prevention Program is established under section 317U of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish a national diabetes prevention program for high-risk individuals of all ages to eliminate the preventable burden of diabetes. Grants will be awarded to support community-based diabetes prevention program model sites working with the healthcare system to identify and refer high-risk individuals. The national diabetes prevention program aims to refer high-risk individuals to cost-effective group-based lifestyle interventions and evaluate scalability, benefits, and approaches to engage those at risk for diabetes. The Secretary will develop a recognition program for entities delivering community-based diabetes prevention programs, focusing on referral systems from healthcare professionals for high-risk individuals. The Secretary will develop a recognition program for entities delivering community-based diabetes prevention programs. Entities must provide proof of staff training as lifestyle interventionists, maintain a community board for program advice, and include members at high risk for diabetes, healthcare professionals, and community leaders. Representatives from the health insurance industry, employers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations involved in promoting healthy food and physical activity must provide data to the Secretary for evaluation purposes. They also need to establish communication plans between referring clinicians and community-based diabetes prevention program sites. The Secretary requires prevention program sites to provide materials and evidence of quality checks. Training programs for diabetes prevention instructors will be developed in partnership with various organizations to ensure consistency in principles. The national diabetes prevention program includes principles for prevention programming, outcomes data collection for quality assurance, community outreach to identify participants, and a national partner outreach program for training and recognition. The Secretary ensures quality assurance for funded diabetes prevention programs by evaluating, monitoring, and providing technical assistance, including reviewing applications, analyzing program data, and sharing feedback for improvement. The Secretary oversees quality assurance for funded diabetes prevention programs by providing technical assistance, conducting audits, and establishing a public registry of recognized entities. Additionally, grants are awarded for research to advance community-based diabetes prevention programs nationally and explore benefit and payment models. The Secretary may conduct studies to prevent type 2 diabetes in at-risk populations by considering factors such as nutrition, exercise education, and maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol, body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, and blood pressure. A report on the implementation of this section must be submitted to Congress every 2 years.

The term 'person at high risk for diabetes' refers to individuals with elevated blood glucose levels or multiple risk factors for diabetes. 'Recognized' means acknowledged under subsection (b)(2). $80,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2011, with additional funding for subsequent years."
