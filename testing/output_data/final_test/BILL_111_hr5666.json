The Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 caused the largest oil spill in US history, resulting in significant economic damages and environmental devastation. Multiple attempts to stop the oil flow, such as using a containment dome and a top kill procedure, were unsuccessful. The Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 caused the largest oil spill in US history. Various attempts to stop the oil flow failed, leading to the conclusion that drilling emergency relief wells is the most effective method. This was demonstrated by the success of relief wells in stopping the Ixtoc and Montara spills, although they took several months to complete and required multiple attempts. Emergency relief wells are crucial in preventing oil spills, as demonstrated by past incidents. If relief wells had been prepared at the Deepwater Horizon drilling unit from the start, disaster relief measures could have been avoided, and millions of gallons of oil could have been prevented from entering the Gulf of Mexico. Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act are proposed. Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act include requiring the drilling of at least 1 emergency relief well concurrently with exploratory drilling under a lease. The Secretary may require alternative measures instead of emergency relief well for stopping major releases from proposed wells. Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act mandate drilling an emergency relief well concurrently with exploratory drilling. Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act now mandate drilling at least 1 emergency relief well concurrently with proposed wells. The Secretary may require alternative measures instead of an emergency relief well for stopping major releases. The Secretary may require alternative measures, determined after public comment, to be as effective as emergency relief wells in stopping major releases from proposed wells."
