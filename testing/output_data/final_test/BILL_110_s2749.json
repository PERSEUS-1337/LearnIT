    "content": "The \"Save Lives First Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows. Congress finds that in 2007, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, with 22.5 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 2.1 million people die from AIDS annually, and fewer than 10 percent of HIV-infected individuals in developing countries receive treatment. Additionally, more than 80 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in developing countries are unaware of their status. Research studies have shown that antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and childbirth can significantly reduce HIV transmission from mother to child, with Nevirapine costing less than $4 a dose and proven to prevent transmission with just two doses. Antiretroviral therapy starting shortly after birth can also greatly reduce transmission risk. Antiretroviral therapy can reduce HIV transmission from mother to child. The American Medical Association recommends universal HIV testing for newborns and pregnant women to identify at-risk children. Testing, counseling, and treatment can significantly reduce pediatric HIV infections and AIDS cases, improve access to medical care, and lower overall costs. Providing HIV/AIDS treatment is crucial in preventing children from becoming orphans and maintaining social and economic stability in affected communities. Treatment offers hope, health, and a future to those living with HIV/AIDS, with a focus on testing and treatment to reduce death rates worldwide. SEC. 3. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THERAPEUTIC MEDICAL CARE. Section 403(a) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 is amended to allocate not less than 55 percent of HIV/AIDS assistance funds for therapeutic medical care from 2009 through 2013. Not less than 5 percent of HIV/AIDS assistance funds shall be used for rapid testing expansion, and at least 25 percent of that amount for countries with universal rapid diagnosis policies. The President must ensure that by the end of fiscal year 2013, at least 7,000,000 people receive antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS and associated infections, 1,000,000,000 rapid tests for HIV/AIDS are conducted in countries receiving funding under this Act. The Act aims to ensure that all infants born to HIV-infected women in funded countries are born uninfected and remain so for the first year after birth through interventions like diagnosis and treatment."
