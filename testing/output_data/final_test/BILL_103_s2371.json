The term \"applicable environmental law\" in the Act includes various federal laws such as the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Clean Air Act, and others. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of an environmental audit as a voluntary evaluation to ensure compliance with environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Pollution Prevention Act. The curr_chunk defines an environmental audit as a report prepared after evaluating compliance with environmental laws, conducted by various parties including owners, employees, or independent contractors. The curr_chunk defines an environmental audit as a report prepared after evaluating compliance with environmental laws, conducted by various parties including owners, employees, or independent contractors. It includes various types of information collected during the audit process, such as reports, drawings, photographs, maps, charts, graphs, and surveys. The term \"component\" refers to the audit report prepared by the auditor, which may contain information on the audit scope, findings, conclusions, and recommendations, along with exhibits and appendices. The curr_chunk discusses the components of an environmental audit report, including a memorandum analyzing the report and an implementation plan for compliance. The curr_chunk focuses on the protection of environmental audits. The curr_chunk outlines that environmental audit reports are generally protected from discovery and cannot be used as evidence in legal proceedings, with some exceptions for information required by regulatory agencies or obtained through monitoring. Environmental audit reports are protected from discovery and cannot be used as evidence in legal proceedings, except for information required by regulatory agencies or obtained through monitoring. Waivers may apply if the owner or operator of a facility waives the protection. The report is protected from discovery unless it is used for fraudulent purposes or shows noncompliance with environmental laws. A court or administrative law judge will review the report in camera to determine its applicability. In criminal proceedings, the report may be used as evidence. In a criminal proceeding, subsection (a) does not apply to an environmental audit report if it is used fraudulently, shows noncompliance with environmental laws, or contains evidence of an offense under environmental law. In a criminal proceeding, subsection (a) does not apply to an environmental audit report if it is used fraudulently, shows noncompliance with environmental laws, or contains evidence of an offense under environmental law. The Attorney General may access the information if there is a compelling need, it is not otherwise available, and obtaining it by other means would incur unreasonable cost and delay. A court or administrative law judge will conduct an in camera review to determine the applicability of subsection (a) to the report. If the Attorney General has probable cause to believe an offense has been committed under an environmental law based on independent information, they may obtain an environmental audit report through legal means. The report will be sealed and its contents will not be reviewed or disclosed. The owner or operator of an activity regulated under an environmental law may file a petition for an in camera hearing within 30 days of the Attorney General obtaining an environmental audit report. Failure to file the petition will waive subsection (a) of the law. The court must schedule an in camera hearing on the petition within 45 days of filing. The Attorney General can review the report if the seal is removed, with limitations to protect against unauthorized distribution. The Attorney General may consult with enforcement agencies for the in camera hearing preparation, ensuring confidentiality of information used. The parties in proceedings may stipulate to entry unless the information is subject to disclosure or obtained independently. The parties may stipulate to entry of an order regarding the applicability of subsection (a) to specific information in an environmental audit report. The court may require disclosure of only relevant portions of the report if deemed necessary. The burden of proving the applicability of subsection (a) lies with the party invoking its protection. In a civil action, the burden of proving compliance with environmental laws lies with the party, and in cases of fraud, the burden shifts to the party seeking discovery. If the Attorney General seeks discovery, they must prove the matters described in the subsection. SEC. 5. EFFECT ON OTHER RULES. This Act does not limit any statutory or common law rules on evidence discovery or admissibility, including attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to Federal civil or criminal actions and administrative proceedings starting after its enactment."
