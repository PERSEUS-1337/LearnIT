    "content": "The \"Public Service Scholarship Act of 2008\" establishes a Public Service Scholarship Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, providing scholarships for public service. The Public Service Scholarship Program aims to promote public service by exceptional students through grants awarded to States for scholarships. Recipients must demonstrate academic excellence and commit to continued achievement. Scholarships are awarded for 1 to 4 years during the first 4 years of higher education. The State educational agency administers the program and determines the award period for scholarships at any institution of higher education. Recipients are known as 'Public Service Scholars'. The Secretary allocates funds to States based on a formula for the Public Service Scholarship Program. The Public Service Scholarship Program is administered by the State educational agency, with scholarships awarded to 'Public Service Scholars'. The Secretary allocates funds to States based on a formula that considers the State's population ages 5 through 17 for determining the number of scholarships available. The Secretary will enter agreements with States to participate in the scholarship program, ensuring State educational agencies administer the program, comply with eligibility and selection criteria, and conduct outreach activities to promote scholarships to eligible students, especially those from low-income families. Students from low-income and moderate-income families have access to information on the scholarship program, with the State educational agency providing $10,000 per academic year to scholarship recipients. Eligibility requires high school graduation or equivalent and admission to an institution. The scholarship program requires students to be recognized by their State, admitted to a higher education institution, demonstrate academic promise, and agree to work for the Federal Government. The scholarship program requires students to work for the Federal Government for a minimum of 5 years. If the student fails to secure employment or is separated due to misconduct, they must repay any scholarships received. If a student fails to repay the amount owed to the Federal Government, the government can recover the sum through legal methods. The Secretary has the authority to waive the right of recovery if the individual is permanently disabled or if recovery would cause hardship. Repayments under this paragraph will be credited back to the original scholarship account for the same purposes and period. The State educational agency establishes criteria and procedures for selecting scholars under this subpart to ensure equitable distribution of awards within the State. In some cases, a limited number of individuals may be selected from specific entities like Guam or the Virgin Islands. The State educational agency consults with various stakeholders for selecting scholars, with the process to be completed before the end of each academic year. Each student awarded a scholarship receives a $10,000 stipend per academic year, ensuring the total financial aid does not exceed the student's cost-of-attendance. The State educational agency awards scholarships to students under this subpart, with a maximum total financial aid of $40,000 for all academic years. The agency ensures that scholars pursue higher education and clarifies that scholarships cannot be used for needs tests in connection with other educational assistance programs. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal year 2009 and beyond.
