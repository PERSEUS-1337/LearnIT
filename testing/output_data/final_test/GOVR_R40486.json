    "content": "Block grants have been a part of the American federal system since 1966, along with categorical grants and general revenue sharing. Categorical grants are limited to specific programs and activities, while block grants provide more recipient discretion. There are four types of categorical grants, totaling 1,078 grants currently. Block grants are a type of federal grant-in-aid that provide state and local governments with funding for broad purposes like community development, social services, public health, or law enforcement. There are currently 21 funded block grants totaling about $50.8 billion in FY2014. General revenue sharing, which is no longer operational, provided state and local governments with funds distributed by formula and few restrictions on spending purposes. The general revenue sharing program distributed funds to states from 1972 through 1980 and to local governments from 1972 through 1986. Block grants are seen as a way to increase government efficiency and program effectiveness by decentralizing decision-making authority from the federal government to states. Block grants are viewed as a way to decentralize decision-making authority from the federal government to state and local governments, with the goal of reducing government expenditures without sacrificing services. Representative Paul Ryan has recommended converting the federal share of Medicaid into a block grant tailored to each state's needs, aiming to improve the health-care safety net for low-income Americans and save $732 billion over 10 years. The House has proposed converting Medicaid into a block grant in various budget resolutions, estimating a similar cost-saving outcome. Critics argue that block grants may have drawbacks. The block grant proposal aims to save $732 billion over 10 years. Critics argue that block grants can undermine national objectives and reduce government spending on domestic issues. They also claim that the decentralized nature of block grants makes it difficult to measure performance and hold officials accountable. The report provides an overview of grant types, criteria for defining block grants, perspectives on their use, historical context, and recent changes. Different federal departments and agencies use varying definitions to determine federal grant-in-aid programs. Project categorical grants have strict control by federal administrators, limited recipient discretion, and high administrative conditions attached to the grant. The curr_chunk discusses different types of federal grants-in-aid programs, ranging from general revenue sharing with the least restraint on recipients to block grants with a midpoint level of recipient discretion. Federal administrators have varying degrees of discretion over grant recipients, with block grants falling in between general revenue sharing and project categorical grants in terms of administrative conditions and recipient discretion. Block grants provide recipients with some discretion in how funds are used within a specified range of activities, with moderate federal administrative conditions attached. Some block grants offer programmatic flexibility within a narrow range of activities, while others have become more restricted over time. Congress imposes additional administrative and reporting requirements on state and local governments to enhance oversight. This includes adding new cost ceilings and set-asides to block grants, reducing state flexibility. Some categorical grants are also becoming more like block grants, blurring their characteristics and creating challenges for analysis of federal grants-in-aid. The blurring of characteristics in federal grants-in-aid can complicate analysis, leading to differing conclusions on block grants' impact on American federalism and program performance. Congress plays a key role in shaping the grant system by determining objectives, selecting grant mechanisms, and overseeing implementation to ensure goals are met. The criteria for determining block grants include eligibility limited to state and local governments, funds distributed using a formula, and recipients undertaking various activities within a broad category to address national objectives. Most block grants provide funding to state governments, with some also funding local governments directly or through \"pass-through\" provisions. A federalism scholar has suggested that efforts to enact block grants typically have been based on arguments such as the national government being too large and out of touch with grassroots needs, the federal bureaucracy being too powerful, and state governments being considered mere administrative subunits of the national government. Block grants are often resisted in Congress due to concerns about recipients' management capacity, allocation choices, and oversight. Congress prefers categorical grants for political credit. Advocates struggle to gain approval due to political considerations superseding their arguments. Block grants face political challenges as they lack support compared to categorical grants. Categorical grants are favored for their ability to establish strong relationships between client groups, program committees, and agencies, ensuring consistent funding for target populations. Unlike block grants, categorical grants offer more opportunities for politicians to claim credit. Block grants are not as popular as categorical grants due to the lack of accountability and strings attached to the money once it goes to the states. Advocates argue that state and local officials are better positioned to identify local needs compared to federal administrators. Advocates of block grants believe that state and local government officials are more visible and accountable to the public than federal administrators. They argue that this accountability leads to more efficient and cost-effective delivery of program services. The flexibility of block grants allows for innovation and experimentation in addressing governmental challenges, leading to better outcomes at a lower cost compared to categorical grants. Advocates of block grants argue that funding through formulas promotes long-term planning and provides greater assurance of continued funding. They believe block grants help reduce duplication among categorical grants. Advocates of block grants argue that they address unnecessary duplication and waste among categorical grant programs by consolidating activities and allowing states to set priorities. They claim cost savings from reduced federal administrative expenses, but evidence on significant reductions is lacking. Some scholars suggest that administrative costs may have been shifted to state and local levels. Converting entitlement programs to block grants is seen as a way to eliminate perceived inefficiencies. Converting entitlement programs like Medicaid into block grants is seen as a way to impose fiscal discipline in the federal budget process. Some policymakers view block grants as a solution to the long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation, particularly with rising costs for elderly entitlements and a shrinking revenue base. Block grants are attractive to policymakers as a way to reduce funding for low-income programs without appearing heartless. Critics argue that block grants reduce federal oversight and data comparability, hindering effective program performance evaluation. Congress has added reporting requirements and performance incentives to some block grants for effective oversight. Critics fear resources may be redirected based on political influence, citing studies on the Community Development Block Grant program. Advocates argue that block grant formulas can target funds to areas with the greatest need by including objective indicators. Advocates argue that block grant formulas can target funds to areas with the greatest need by including objective indicators, despite concerns about potential redirection of resources based on political influence. Studies have shown that block grants have not significantly redirected funds away from the economically needy or low-income families. Critics, however, point out that block grant formulas may include population as a criterion to attract political support. Critics of block grants argue that including population in formulas may hinder targeting assistance to those in need, leading to a decrease in funding levels over time. Studies have shown a decline in real funding levels for block grants, raising concerns about the effectiveness of broad-purpose, state-administered programs compared to categorical programs. In 2006, GAO found that real per capita funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program had declined significantly. Critics view block grants as a way to reduce government spending on domestic issues. Congress addresses concerns by including state maintenance-of-effort provisions in grant programs. The federal grants to state and local governments have maintenance-of-effort requirements to prevent substitution of federal funds for existing state funds. For example, the TANF block grant program requires states to maintain spending at 75% of FY1994 levels, increasing to 80% for states failing to meet work participation requirements. Failure to meet the requirement results in a reduction in block grant funding. Analysts and policymakers have studied the effectiveness of block grants since 1966. A federalism scholar suggests conditions for converting categorical grants to block grants, including supplementing service levels, aligning national and local objectives, setting minimum service levels, and trusting state and local governments with priorities and administration. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) suggested terminating or consolidating small categorical grant programs that lack clear national objectives, receive most funding from state/local governments or fees, or have high fragmentation. The fragmentation index score devised by ACIR measures the percentage of grant programs in a functional category relative to federal funding allocated. Block grants offer flexibility but face criticism for lack of accountability and performance measurement challenges. The Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) reflected difficulties in measuring results through block grants. The George W. Bush Administration developed the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to assess federal programs. The Obama Administration initially planned to continue using PART but later decided not to use PART scores for program performance evaluation. Instead, they focused on program evaluations with different performance goals. The Obama Administration decided not to use PART scores for program performance evaluation. Instead, they focused on program evaluations with performance improvement strategies to achieve high priority goals. PART assessed programs based on purpose, design, strategic planning, management, and accountability. Programs were rated as effective, moderately effective, adequate, ineffective, or results not demonstrated. Block grants received the lowest average score in 2008, with some being rated as ineffective or results not demonstrated. Block grant critics argue that PART's low ratings of block grants as \"results not demonstrated\" prove they should be avoided. Advocates claim PART's focus on single goals is a poor measure for assessing block grant performance. Federal efforts to hold agencies accountable for program implementation go against the trend of devolution. Block grant advocates argue for the conversion of categorical grants into block grants to eliminate program overlap, introduce efficiencies, and provide flexibility to state and local officials. Despite low ratings from PART, President George W. Bush proposed new block grants, with stakeholders' views on future funding playing a significant role in the success or failure of these proposals. In recent years, the issue of block grants has gained more prominence, with advocates emphasizing the reduction of program overlap and duplication as well as the benefits of block grants. The recent emphasis on capping expenditures and closing open-ended entitlement programs has changed congressional consideration of new-style block grant proposals. Congress now focuses on the budgetary implications for both the federal budget and recipients, providing more programmatic authority and flexibility to state and local governments at the cost of restrained spending. President George W. Bush proposed a Strengthening America's Communities Initiative in his FY2006 budget, which aimed to combine 18 community and economic development programs into a two-part block grant. This initiative would transfer administrative responsibility from five federal agencies to the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce would administer a core block grant program and a bonus program to improve economic conditions. Total funding for 18 programs was reduced from $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion in FY2006, but Congress funded all programs at $5.3 billion. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended adjusting federal-state responsibility for Medicaid, considering the use of block grants to contain costs. Representative Paul Ryan was also mentioned in the context. Representative Paul Ryan has recommended converting Medicaid into a block grant to save $732 billion over 10 years. This proposal aims to improve the health-care safety net for low-income Americans and address the current structure's incentive for states to expand the program without saving costs. The budget recommends fundamental reform of the Medicaid program due to unsustainable growth, with the new health-care law adding $792 billion in federal spending over 2015-2024. CBO estimates 13 million new enrollees by 2024. Representative Paul Ryan proposes converting Medicaid into a block grant to save $732 billion over 10 years. The budget resolution proposes fundamental Medicaid reform by converting federal Medicaid spending into state allotments for tailored programs, providing flexibility and ending one-size-fits-all approach. The budget resolution proposes transforming Medicaid into a block-granted program like SCHIP, unifying the programs and growing them together for population growth and inflation. Critics argue that block-granting Medicaid would result in deep cuts to support for vulnerable populations like seniors, individuals with disabilities, and low-income children. Millions of seniors in nursing homes would be particularly impacted by the proposed cuts, which include a 25% reduction in the Medicaid budget and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act expansion. The House's FY2015 Concurrent Budget Resolution proposes converting safety net programs like SNAP and Medicaid into block grants, aiming to save $125 billion over 10 years. It also plans to terminate the Social Services Block Grant. President Obama has not advocated for a major shift in funding priorities, but the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is expected to increase healthcare access. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), supported by President Obama, is set to boost federal assistance to state and local governments in the healthcare sector. The number of funded block grants has slightly decreased during the Obama Administration, with a focus on categorical grants. The Administration has not pushed for a major shift in funding priorities between block grants and categorical grants. The Obama Administration has advocated for new competitive categorical grant programs over expanding existing block grants. For example, they requested permanent authorization for the TIGER surface transportation grant program in their FY2015 budget. The Obama Administration proposed a $4 billion competitive grant program for surface transportation projects nationwide, aiming to incentivize critical reforms in safety and traffic management. They also recommended funding reductions for the Community Services Block Grant, Community Development Block Grant, and HOME Investment Partnership Program, advocating for competitive awards to high-performing agencies. The Obama Administration proposed grants for reforms to improve program performance by eliminating small grantees, driving regional coordination, and supporting strategic investments. This includes a $4 billion grant for higher education and a $6 billion grant for training programs. They also recommended eliminating the Preventative Health and Health Services Block Grant as duplicative. The Obama Administration advocated for the elimination of the Block Grant, citing duplication with existing activities that could be more effectively implemented through targeted programs. They proposed consolidating categorical grant programs into other categorical grant programs to reduce duplication and promote program efficiency in various functional areas. This included merging surface transportation categorical grant programs and Department of Homeland Security categorical grant programs into other relevant programs. The Public Welfare Act of 1946, introduced as an amendment to the Social Security Act, proposed a block grant system for states to provide public welfare assistance. The concept was further highlighted in 1949 by the Hoover Commission, recommending grants based on broad categories like highways, education, public assistance, and public health. In 1966, Congress created the first block grant for health care services, known as the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant. Two years later, the second block grant was established for law enforcement assistance. President Nixon proposed consolidating 129 federal grants in 1971. President Nixon announced a plan to consolidate 129 federal grant programs into six \"special revenue sharing\" programs, but only the urban community development and manpower training proposals gained congressional approval due to opposition from interest groups. The Nixon Administration's efforts led to the adoption of three more block grants: the Comprehensive Employment and Training Assistance Block Grant program, the Community Development Block Grant program, and the Title XX social services program. These programs consolidated existing grant programs and were signed into law by Presidents Nixon and Ford. The 1974 amendments of the Social Security Act created block grants de novo, not consolidating existing categorical grant programs. President Ronald Reagan proposed consolidating 85 existing grants into seven block grants in 1981, with a 25% funding reduction. Congress later adopted the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1981. The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1981 consolidated 75 categorical grant programs into nine new or revised block grants, including Elementary and Secondary Education, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services, Maternal and Child Health Services, and others. Funding for the categorical grants was reduced overall. The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1981 consolidated 75 categorical grant programs into nine new or revised block grants, including Elementary and Secondary Education, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services. Funding for the categorical grants bundled into these block grants was reduced by 12%, about $1 billion, from their previous year's funding level. Some federalism scholars view these block grants as more \"historical accidents\" due to the bill's adoption under special parliamentary rules without the possibility of amendment, designed to reduce the budget deficit rather than reform federalism relationships. Despite this, in FY1984, there were 12 block grants in operation, accounting for about 15% of total grants-in-aid funding. President Ronald Reagan submitted 32 block grant proposals to Congress during his first six years in office, with 9 created by the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1981. Federalism scholars acknowledge his success in gaining congressional approval for block grants, although many of his proposals were ultimately rejected due to opposition from organizations concerned about potential funding cuts to affected programs. President Reagan proposed a $20 billion \"swap\" in 1982, aiming to shift funding responsibility for AFDC and food stamps to states in exchange for federal control of Medicaid. This plan, along with a $28 billion trust fund proposal, faced opposition from organizations fearing reduced funding for these programs. During the period from 1983 to 1995, Congress approved six new block grants to assist states due to a weakening economy. The Surface Transportation Program, established in 1991, had the largest budget of $17.5 billion in FY1993. Three block grants were terminated during this time. In 1995, there were 15 block grants and 618 categorical grants in operation, accounting for 14% of federal grants-in-aid assistance. The Aid to Families With Dependent Children grant was converted into the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant in 1996, funded at $16.7 billion annually. The Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant rivaled the Surface Transportation Program in budget size. TANF balanced federal standards with state flexibility. Funding was also allocated for a Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program, providing funding for various accountability-based purposes. The 21st Century Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2002 consolidated grant programs into the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program, providing funding for services for juvenile offenders and at-risk youth. This includes projects for treatment, education, and prevention of school violence and vandalism. In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security had 17 federal grant programs, including categorical and block grant programs for homeland security. These programs were administered by various agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Justice. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, established in 2005, combines various law enforcement and justice programs into one. It allows funding for law enforcement, prosecution, prevention, corrections, drug treatment, planning, technology improvement, and victim programs. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided temporary funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated approximately $2.7 billion for energy efficiency grants and $454 million for competitive grants. It also authorized a $53.6 billion Government Services State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for education reforms. Most of the $48.6 billion allocated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was for education programs, with a portion also designated for public safety and government services. $5 billion was awarded competitively under specific grant programs. In FY2012, there were 28 block grants, and in FY2013, there were 25 block grants. In FY2013, there were 25 block grants (22 funded and 3, the Innovative Education Program Strategies Block Grant, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant, and the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant, were authorized, but were not funded). The Government Services State Fiscal Stabilization Fund and the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant are no longer available. State Homeland Security Grant and Urban Area Security Initiative Grant programs are now within the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Grant Programs. In FY2014, there are 23 block grants (21 funded and 2, the Innovative Education Program Strategies Block Grant and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant, are authorized, but are not funded). The authorizations for the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant and the Juvenile. The authorizations for the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant and the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant programs have expired, and neither program is currently being funded."
