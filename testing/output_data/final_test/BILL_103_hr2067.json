Indemnity compensation may be paid to dependents of armed forces members separated due to dependent abuse, as authorized by a new section in Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code. The new section in Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code addresses the eligibility for indemnity compensation for dependents of armed forces members who have been discharged under certain conditions or court-martial sentences, including dependent-abuse offenses. Members discharged with a general discharge, under other than honorable conditions, or by court-martial sentence, as well as those discharged in lieu of trial for dependent-abuse offenses, are covered under this section. Additionally, members incarcerated with total forfeiture of pay and allowances by court-martial sentence are also considered as former members dismissed by court-martial. The new section in Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code addresses dependent-abuse offenses by armed forces members on active duty for more than 30 days. The Secretary of Defense will specify criminal offenses considered as dependent-abuse offenses. The new section in Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code addresses dependent-abuse offenses by armed forces members on active duty for more than 30 days. In cases of separation from active duty, transitional and indemnity compensation will be paid to dependents or former dependents of the former member as specified by the Secretary of the military department concerned. Payment of transitional and indemnity compensation under this section shall be made to dependent children of the former member who do not reside in the same household as the spouse or former spouse. If there is no eligible spouse or former spouse, the compensation will be paid to the dependent children. The status of a dependent child is determined at the time of the member's conviction of the dependent-abuse offense or discharge. Payment of transitional and indemnity compensation begins upon the member's pay discontinuance due to separation or sentencing. Compensation ends at the dependents' transitional period, lasting up to 36 months or the length of the member's active duty service. Payment rates for spouses or former spouses are determined monthly. The payment of transitional and indemnity compensation for spouses or former spouses is determined monthly based on rates set under title 38. If the recipient has custody of dependent children, the compensation is increased for each child. If compensation is paid to children, it is divided equally among them. If a former spouse remarries, compensation may be forfeited. If a former spouse receiving compensation remarries, payments will be terminated. If the former member resides in the same household as the recipient of compensation, payments will also be terminated. Any compensation paid before the former member resides in the household will not be recouped. The Secretary may not resume payments if a member ceases to reside in the household before the end of the eligibility period. Compensation may not be paid to a spouse or former spouse if they were an active participant in the dependent-abuse offense. Payments cannot be made to a spouse under both this section and another section. The Secretary may not resume payments if a member ceases to reside in the household before the end of the eligibility period. Compensation may not be paid to a spouse or former spouse if they were an active participant in the dependent-abuse offense. Payments cannot be made to a spouse under both this section and another section. For a spouse or former spouse eligible for payments under section 1408(h)(1), they must elect which to receive. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary of each military department to carry out this section for members of the armed forces. The term 'dependent child' refers to an unmarried child residing with the member at the time of the dependent-abuse offense resulting in separation. The former member's separation criteria for dependent children under 18 years old, incapable of self-support, or enrolled in full-time higher education.
