    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Ambassador James R. Lilley and Congressman Stephen J. Solarz North Korea Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2012. Congress finds bipartisan consensus on promoting human rights, transparency in humanitarian assistance, and refugee protection, especially considering the large Korean-American community in the United States with ties to North Korea. The leadership transition in North Korea has brought new uncertainties, but human rights conditions remain deplorable. Reports indicate a crackdown on border crossing and harsh punishments for defectors. Despite advocacy efforts, the situation remains dire. China has forcibly repatriated North Koreans despite international appeals. The US has resettled 128 North Koreans since 2004. Ambassador James R. Lilley served in Asia-focused public service and as a director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. Stephen J. Solarz, a former Congressman, dedicated himself to advocating for the rights of North Koreans and served as co-chairman of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea until his death in 2010. Congress believes the US should continue seeking cooperation from foreign governments to process North Korean refugees for resettlement in the US. Through persistent diplomacy by senior US officials and close cooperation with South Korea, the US should urge China to stop repatriating North Korean refugees, fulfill refugee obligations, and allow UNHCR involvement. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is amended to allow UNHCR access to North Koreans in China. The Broadcasting Board of Governors must report on US broadcasting to North Korea within 120 days. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is amended to update various sections, including broadcasting to North Korea, promoting freedom of information, appointing a special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, reporting on US humanitarian assistance, and providing assistance outside of North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is amended to reduce the financial limit to $5,000,000 and update the reporting year to 2017. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
