    "content": "The Act titled \"Keystone Species Conservation Act of 1999\" is established for the conservation of keystone species. The Congress finds that numerous species of fauna are in serious jeopardy, with many listed under the Endangered Species Act or in international trade agreements. Insufficient resources are available to address the threats facing these species, requiring joint efforts from countries, the United States, and the private sector. Grant programs are established for tigers, rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, and African elephants. A new grant program is proposed to conserve keystone species without existing programs, aiming to support fauna conservation globally by partnering with public and private sectors and providing financial resources. The proposed grant program aims to conserve keystone species globally by partnering with public and private sectors to provide financial resources. The Act defines key terms such as \"Account,\" \"Secretary,\" \"CITES,\" and \"conservation,\" which includes methods to ensure keystone species populations are sufficient to prevent extinction. The Act defines key terms related to conservation, including keystone species, which are crucial for maintaining habitat and biodiversity. Keystone species are endangered or threatened species that play a vital role in ecosystems. The Act outlines measures for habitat management, research, law enforcement, and community outreach for keystone species protection. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) applies to species listed in CITES Appendices I, II, or III, with ranges outside the U.S., excluding African elephants, Asian elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers.

Priority Guidance for Approved Project Proposals:\n- Priority given to projects enhancing conservation of imperiled keystone species\n- Projects with high non-Federal matching assistance\n- Projects enhancing local capacity for keystone species conservation The section emphasizes the importance of project reporting and guidelines for determining funding priorities and criteria for keystone species conservation. The section highlights the significance of project reporting and guidelines for determining funding priorities and criteria for keystone species conservation, focusing on the most imperiled species and projects with the greatest conservation benefit. The Keystone Species Conservation Account is established to prioritize funding for projects benefiting imperiled species with the greatest conservation impact. The Keystone Species Conservation Account is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund to receive donations and appropriations for conservation efforts. The Secretary can use funds from the Account for implementing section 4, with a small portion allocated for administrative expenses.
