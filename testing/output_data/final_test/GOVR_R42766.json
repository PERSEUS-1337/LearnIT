    "content": "The EFS program originated in 1980 when Paul Bloom of the DOE suggested using $4 million in interest payments from oil companies to provide energy assistance to families in need through national social service providers. The funds were released to charities in 1981. In 1981, the Reagan Administration planned to recapture funds given to charities for energy assistance. After negotiations, DOE Secretary James Edwards announced that fund recovery was unnecessary. $1 million was returned, and charities proposed a pilot program for the homeless under FEMA. The charities proposed a pilot program for the homeless under FEMA, reflecting concerns about HUD's stewardship. House Speaker O'Neill supported the proposal, leading to the approval of legislation appropriating $50 million for an emergency food and shelter program. The program included a National Board chaired by FEMA. The National Board, chaired by FEMA, was responsible for distributing funds to localities for homeless services. Local boards, with representatives from various organizations, were to allocate funds competitively. The Senate passed a bill in 1983, appropriating $50 million for the program. The Senate's version of the bill appropriated $50 million for the Food Distribution and Emergency Shelter program. FEMA, in conjunction with the Director of the Office of Community Services, would distribute the funds directly to states using the Community Services Block Grant formula. States would then decide how to allocate the funds among local jurisdictions. The final version of the bill was passed by Congress on March 24, 1983, and signed into law by President Reagan the same day. The enactment of two programs in 1983 was a response to the recession and increasing homelessness in America. Congress recognized the strain on charitable groups and local governments in addressing these needs. The programs aimed to provide substantial federal assistance for sheltering the homeless population, with competing views on the best delivery system. The Senate's program allocated funds through states to address the issue. The EFS program, unlike most federal grants, bypassed states to distribute funds quickly to local homeless services providers. Concerns were raised about the National Board's ability to administer the program without state involvement. To address this, rigorous accountability standards were imposed on all program transactions. Congress later discontinued funding for the Senate's program, while EFS funds were used for sheltering, rent/mortgage assistance, and utility payments to prevent service cut-offs. The EFS program provides one month's utility payments to prevent service cut-offs for the homeless. The program's funding, authorized in 1987, is determined by a formula based on unemployment and poverty statistics. Funding remained around $150 million in the early 2000s. The EFS program's funding was around $150 million in the early 2000s, temporarily increased to $300 million in FY2009. Subsequently, it received $200 million for FY2010 and $120 million for FY2012. The National Board composition has remained constant since 1983, with FEMA chairing and national organizations like American Red Cross, Catholic Charities USA, and others nominating members. Since 1983, 49 individuals have served as National Board members, with an additional 35 as alternate members. Some social service organizations have shown interest in joining the National Board, but membership expansion requires legislative change. In the late 1980s, an advisory group was established with representatives from various organizations to provide input. The Rural Assistance Coalition advisory group represents local affiliates receiving EFS funding. The National Board oversees EFS fund distribution, program guidelines, administration, and budget. It communicates with Local Boards, considers waiver requests, and has expanded program eligibility rules. Membership expansion requires legislative change. The National Board oversees EFS fund distribution, program guidelines, and administration. It has refined documentation requirements and conducts site visits for feedback. Administrative costs are limited to 3.5% of funding, with 1% used by the National Board, 2% by Local Boards, and 0.5% by State Set-Aside Committees. EFS Local Boards are affiliates of the National Board. The Local Boards, affiliated with the National Board, include a homeless representative and may invite a Native American representative if located within a reservation. FEMA chairs the National Board, while Local Boards elect their own chair from non-profit members. EFS Guidelines encourage diversity in board membership. The Local Board's main responsibilities include advertising fund availability, selecting recipients, monitoring fund usage, and providing reports to the National Board. The EFS program has historically funded various social service providers without a specific focus on any one agency. Some believe the program lacks strong national advocacy due to its local focus and funding of numerous non-affiliated groups. The EFS program provides significant funding to non-affiliated groups like food banks, Community Action Agencies, and church groups. National advocacy groups support the program, but there is no national association of EFS recipient organizations. Local Boards have the primary responsibility for selecting recipients and monitoring activities, with potential issues arising from their unique arrangement. Local Boards have the responsibility of selecting recipients for the EFS program and monitoring their activities. One potential criticism is the conflict of interest as provider agencies on the boards may apply for awards. However, their expertise in evaluating applicants and setting priorities at the local level is valuable. The State Set-Aside program was created in 1987 to provide funding to areas with documented need not reflected in traditional data, such as those affected by plant closures or with high unemployment levels. The SSA Committees, which include representation from various entities, distribute funds based on the ratio of unemployed individuals in different states. States may receive additional funding to meet the minimum award requirement. The SSA Committee considers various factors when allocating funds, including the level of unemployment in different jurisdictions within a state. The SSA Committee funds areas of greatest need in each state, considering economic data. The National Board reviews funding decisions and allows additional funding with a waiver request. The SSA program expands the EFS program's coverage, with most jurisdictions receiving funds through the National Board's formula. In FY2011, FEMA's appropriations were delayed until April 15, 2011, leading to EFS award announcements on July 15, 2011, the latest in the program's history. FEMA attributed the delay to a provision in the Continuing Resolution that restricted funding for programs like EFS. In FY2011, FEMA's appropriations were delayed until April 15, 2011, leading to EFS award announcements on July 15, 2011, the latest in the program's history. In FY2012, EFS program funding was delayed due to language in CRs prohibiting distribution of funds impinging on final funding prerogatives. The National Board announced its FY2012 awards on August 15, 2012, more than seven months after the final appropriations act for FY2102. The National Board reviews remaining funds at the end of each program year, which are often rolled over into the following year's budget or used for special awards, such as supporting veterans \"stand downs.\" The EFS program brings veterans together for one to three days to access community resources and rebuild their lives. FEMA and the EFS National Board differentiate between homelessness addressed by the program and disaster-related homelessness. The National Board occasionally provides supplementary awards to EFS Local Boards in disaster-affected areas. FEMA's handling of pre-existing homeless individuals during disasters is a recurring policy question. The National Board sets thresholds for jurisdictions to qualify for funding based on the number of unemployed individuals, unemployment rate, and poverty rate. The approach aims to target funds for high-need areas efficiently. Different thresholds are established for larger and smaller jurisdictions. The National Board sets thresholds for jurisdictions to qualify for funding based on unemployment rates. Larger jurisdictions qualify with rates 1% below the national average, while smaller jurisdictions qualify with rates 1% above. This approach ensures funds are provided to areas with high homeless populations and hunger needs. The National Board sets thresholds for jurisdictions to qualify for funding based on unemployment rates. In FY2011, the dual unemployment thresholds were replaced with a single threshold of 2.0% over the national average. Due to funding decline and formula changes, some large jurisdictions did not receive direct awards for the first time in years. The National Board continued with a single unemployment threshold in FY2012. The reason for this change is not specified, but it may aim to distribute funds more equally as available funding decreases. Once a jurisdiction meets the threshold, it becomes eligible for a direct award. The National Board sets thresholds for jurisdictions to qualify for funding based on unemployment rates. Once a jurisdiction meets the threshold, it is eligible to receive a direct award. The direct award amount is determined by dividing the total funding available by the total number of unemployed in eligible jurisdictions. A formula change in FY2011 led to a significant shift in fund distribution among jurisdictions. SSA Committees typically receive less funding than direct awards, resulting in smaller awards on a per capita basis. The National Board's funding formula for distributing funds to assist the homeless has been critiqued by Congress. Directly funded jurisdictions received 92% of available funds in FY2010, while SSA jurisdictions received 8%. Congress has encouraged departments to find improved methods for distributing funds to assist the homeless. The HEARTH Act directed HUD to create a new formula for distributing homeless assistance grants. The National Board oversees SSA Committees and Local Boards, with FEMA providing oversight. The National Board's accounts are audited annually, and the EFS program has been audited by the DHS/FEMA Office of Inspector General. The EFS program has been the subject of numerous GAO reports, with a recent report focusing on HUD, HHS, DOL, and VA. FEMA's management of the program was criticized for not accurately tracking the number of homeless people assisted and lacking performance metrics. Some organizations, including the DHS Office of Inspector General, have questioned FEMA's oversight of the EFS program. The DHS Office of Inspector General criticized FEMA's oversight of the EFS program, noting a significant decline in staff from 1997 to 2008. This led to reduced financial and program monitoring, with only one staff member responsible for monitoring activities. FEMA attributed the staff reduction to reassignments for disaster assistance programs, but EFS program advocates argue that maintaining staff levels is crucial for program effectiveness. Advocates argue that reducing FEMA staff has had consequences for the EFS program, impacting its ability to engage in cooperative endeavors with other federal programs providing assistance to the homeless. For example, the EFS program was less likely to participate in initiatives like FEMA's Food Donation program, resulting in a decrease in donated food value in 1997. The EFS program, which has been administered by FEMA since 1983, has faced discussions on whether it should remain at FEMA or be moved to another department like HUD. Despite proposals to move the program, Congress has chosen to keep it at FEMA. The program has received over $3 million in donated food items from DOD commissaries in 1997, but its current status is unknown. FEMA's interest in the Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program has decreased in recent years, leading to delays in fund distribution, which goes against the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. FEMA has not met the requirement to award grants within 30 days in FY2011 and FY2012. FEMA has not met the requirement to award grants within 30 days in FY2011 and FY2012, with a nine-month gap in fund distribution from December 2011 to August 2012. This raises concerns about the need for a change in administration for the EFS program, although moving it to HUD or another agency could have unforeseen consequences. Moving the EFS program from FEMA to HUD or another federal agency could have unforeseen consequences. Most program participants have opposed the idea, citing concerns about losing the program's identity and focus on local decision-making. Congress has not supported proposals to move the program due to its quick fund distribution, low administrative costs, and popularity among provider groups. The term \"continuum of care\" in the emergency services community addresses the needs of homeless individuals through various stages of assistance, including prevention, shelter, housing, and supportive services. Critics argue that the EFS program's focus on emergency services is a short-term solution to homelessness. Some advocate for all federal programs to prioritize transitional or permanent solutions, while others support the immediate needs approach. Some argue that meeting immediate needs of homeless individuals is crucial for progress, emphasizing the importance of providing federal assistance for emergency shelters. The EFS program aims to assist communities in addressing emergency needs and building capacity for local programs. Federal funding for emergency services helps build local capacity, but diverts resources from long-term solutions for homelessness. Shifting focus to long-term solutions could enhance collaborative efforts like the Continuum of Care. However, changing the program's focus may leave out smaller recipient organizations that provide basic emergency assistance. Changing the National Board's membership requires legislative action. Expanding the National Board's membership is advocated for greater inclusiveness and representation of local recipient organizations. Feeding America seeks membership to provide data through its Research Department on hunger across the country. Some argue for more representation for organizations assisting homeless veterans. Arguments against increasing the National Board's membership include the current size allowing for efficient program administration, the broad fund distribution formula, and potential challenges in selecting new members. The EFS program operates under limited administrative budget constraints and advocates highlight its low administrative costs. The EFS program has a substantial database with information on participating agencies and fund usage in over 2,500 communities. Despite its potential for in-depth research, limited administrative budget constraints have prevented the program from utilizing this data for analysis and improvement. FEMA also lacked an Office of Policy Development and Research until recently, hindering the analysis of EFS program data. The EFS program's database holds valuable data on participating agencies and fund usage in over 2,500 communities. Limited administrative budget constraints have hindered the program from utilizing this data for analysis and improvement. Increasing funds for administration could help the National Board seek and evaluate additional data from Local Boards, especially in large jurisdictions. The EFS program received an $820,000 direct award for FY2010, with limited administrative budget constraints hindering the ability to hire full-time staff for oversight. Additional administrative support could improve program spending transparency and oversight. However, the program's future is uncertain due to funding reductions, lack of advocacy, and differing opinions on the role of emergency services for the homeless. Some argue that reducing funding for the EFS program reflects a shift towards local funding for emergency assistance and federal focus on long-term solutions. Despite receiving temporary funding in 2009, the EFS program was overshadowed by HUD's HPRP, which prioritizes intervention over emergency services. However, emergency shelter assistance is still seen as crucial for those in immediate need, as a significant portion of the homeless population remains unsheltered. The unsheltered homeless population increased by 2% from 239,759 in 2009 to 243,701 in 2011. The approach to homelessness may involve a continuum from emergency services to transitional and permanent housing. The future importance of the EFS program in addressing homelessness is uncertain."
