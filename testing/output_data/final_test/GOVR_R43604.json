    "content": "The electric utility industry in the United States consists of over 9,000 generating units connected by 200,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. High voltage transformer substations play a crucial role in adjusting voltage and transmitting bulk electricity across the network. High voltage transformers, although less than 3% of transformers, carry 60% of the nation's electricity, making them critical elements of the power grid. The U.S. electric power grid is highly reliable but vulnerable to disruptions from various factors like weather, operational errors, or sabotage. Major outages can have significant negative impacts on business and daily life. Despite its overall reliability, the grid has experienced regional outages in the past, such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003 and outages after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. High voltage transformers are considered the most vulnerable to intentional damage, making their physical security a key concern. The report focuses on the security of HV transformers and associated policy issues, with recent incidents prompting new grid security initiatives and legislative proposals to strengthen federal efforts in preventing physical attacks on the U.S. grid. The main risk from a physical attack on the U.S. grid is a widespread power outage lasting for days or longer. While occasional blackouts occur from attacks on transmission towers, widespread or long-lasting outages have not occurred. Coordinated attacks on multiple HV transformers could severely impact reliable electric service over a large area. HV transformers play a crucial role in controlling electricity voltage for transmission and distribution. They range in size from small units serving a few homes to larger units powering entire cities. Regardless of size, they consist of copper wire wrapped around a metallic core within an insulated housing. A physical attack on these transformers could have severe implications for the electric grid, causing widespread blackouts and significant economic and social consequences. High-voltage transformers are crucial for controlling electricity voltage for transmission and distribution. They are large and heavy units located in network substations, often near urban centers or electric generation plants. These transformers are cooled by circulating oil and external radiators, similar to a car engine cooling system. They are connected to the power grid by bushings and can generate waste heat during operation. High-voltage transformers are essential for controlling electricity voltage in substations. They are large units, with some reaching 45 feet in height and occupying 2,200 square feet. These transformers are custom-made and can take 5 to 16 months for delivery. HV transformers are crucial for managing electricity voltage in substations. They are custom-made and can take over 20 months for foreign manufacturers. The manufacturing process involves engineering design, labor-intensive assembly, and extensive testing. The installed cost varies based on configuration, with new substations costing over $10 million. Factory prices for HV transformers typically start at $2 million for a 230 kV unit. After 1970, utility investment in transmission infrastructure in the United States declined due to various factors, leading to a reduction in domestic demand for large transformers, especially HV transformers. This was exacerbated by industry restructuring, competition introduction, and grid owners' reluctance to invest in new transmission. The United States and Canada accounted for only 20% of global large transformer sales by the late 1990s. However, demand in the United States has increased since then. Between 2005 and 2013, the total value of large transformers imported to the United States more than doubled. Foreign manufacturers entered the market, benefiting from lower labor costs and underbidding U.S. transformer makers. Some foreign manufacturers may have been protected by import barriers, limiting U.S. manufacturing in the market. Limited domestic manufacturing capacity for HV transformers in the United States, with only five facilities capable of producing units rated 345 kV or above. Canada and Mexico also have five HV manufacturing plants. Despite potential delivery delays, utilities have not reported difficulty in obtaining necessary equipment. There are thousands of HV transformers in the U.S., with approximately 2,100 units rated 345 kV and above owned by investor-owned and public utilities. HV transformer substations are crucial components of the electric grid, owned by utilities like the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Their destruction could severely impact transmission capacity and cause extended blackouts. Power grid planners prepare for the loss of a single substation but multiple simultaneous losses could overwhelm the system. The destruction of multiple HV transformers in a constrained transmission area could exceed the regional network's ability to reroute power. Studies have shown that the simultaneous destruction of two or three transmission substations could cause a serious blackout, while more than three substations could lead to long-term blackouts. In such emergencies, limited electric service could be restored through rolling blackouts, rerouting transmission, and using portable transformers. The loss of key HV substations would cripple the regional network, making it highly susceptible to further disturbance and cascading failure. Certain parts of the U.S. transmission network are vulnerable to HV substation disruption, with as few as nine critical substations being able to cause a coast-to-coast blackout during peak electricity demand. The risk of extended blackouts due to a deliberate attack on multiple HV transformers is a concern raised by experts and security analysts. The U.S. grid faces extended blackouts from a deliberate attack on HV transformers, sparking debate. An investigation by the Department of Energy's IG challenges FERC's risk analysis, citing unlikely assumptions. Industry experts differ on the severity of a blackout from a multi-transformer attack, but agree on the possibility of severe regional or national power outages. The Department of Energy's recent Quadrennial Energy Review highlights HV transformers as vulnerable components to intentional physical attacks. Despite their size and complexity, HV transformers can be easily disabled or destroyed by someone with basic knowledge of transformer design. This could lead to massive electrical short circuits and oil fires, causing severe regional or national power outages. HV transformers are vulnerable to intentional physical attacks, which can result in massive electrical short circuits and oil fires, destroying the transformer and surrounding infrastructure. Substations can also be disabled by damaging transmission lines or control centers on site. These transformers are easily identifiable along major transmission corridors and are usually housed in substations enclosed by a chain-link fence. Guards are not typically stationed at these facilities, making them easier to access compared to other critical electric facilities. HV transformers are vulnerable to intentional physical attacks, which can result in massive electrical short circuits and oil fires, destroying the transformer and surrounding infrastructure. Substations can also be disabled by damaging transmission lines or control centers on site. These transformers are easily identifiable along major transmission corridors and are usually housed in substations enclosed by a chain-link fence. Guards are not typically stationed at these facilities, making them easier to access compared to other critical electric facilities. Utilities use closed-circuit surveillance and other methods to detect intrusion, but access to the substation may be achieved by cutting or scaling the fence. Saboteurs could cause damage by accessing the control room, physically damaging the HV transformer, short-circuiting the windings, draining insulating oil, or igniting the oil to cause an explosion. Attackers could also disable transformers from a distance using conventional rifles. Successful attacks on individual transformer substations have been demonstrated in recent years. Recent successful attacks on individual transformer substations have raised concerns about their vulnerability. In one case, a rifle attack in 2013 caused a substation in California to overheat and become inoperative. Another incident involved a deliberate fire at a substation in Arkansas, but electrical service was not interrupted. In 2005, a rifle attack in Florida led to an explosion and blackout. While most incidents are attributed to vandals or hunters, the potential for sabotage remains a significant threat. HV transformer substations have been damaged with some regularity, often attributed to vandals or hunters. Restoration of damaged HV transformers is challenging and costly due to their custom design. Maintaining spare HV transformers is expensive, with limited extras available. One regional transmission control area reported maintaining 29 spares for 188 transformers rated 500 kV. Transportation of HV transformers within the United States is difficult due to their size and weight. Sharing programs for spare HV transformers among utilities are discussed in the report. Transporting HV transformers in the United States is challenging due to their size and weight. Special railcars with up to 36 axles are used, but there are limited options available. Older transformers may require alternative transportation methods like specialized flatbed trucks, which have route restrictions. Emergency transport of HV transformers can pose logistical challenges such as coordinating movement through ports and obtaining special permits. Malicious individuals could easily identify critical HV transformer locations and plan attacks with basic knowledge of transmission operations and publicly available data. A security services company identified 14 \"most critical\" transformer substations in the US in 2014. Terrorists could selectively target key equipment, especially large transformers, as described in a 2012 National Research Council report. A knowledgeable saboteur would be needed to identify and find the eight transmission substations spread along a 250-mile line in five States. A highly organized attack could cause enormous damage, blacking out a four-State region and impacting reliability and economy for months. In 1997, the Irish Republican Army planned a coordinated attack against six transmission substations in the UK, which could have caused widespread power outages for months in London and the South East of England. Learning about HV transformer vulnerabilities is relatively easy from experienced engineers and operators, as the same technology is used worldwide. The power grids worldwide are vulnerable to sabotage, with various methods such as arson, explosives, and rifle fire being used to disable substations and transformers. Attacks during peak consumption times can make power diversion impossible, causing widespread outages that are difficult to restore quickly. Repairing each broken link in the power grid is necessary to fully restore service. An individual with a silenced rifle or pistol could easily destroy power transformers, posing a significant threat to the power grid. Security measures are in place to prevent intentional physical attacks on transformer substations, with various measures employed for public safety and theft prevention. Security measures to protect critical HV substations include safeguarding information, surveillance with various technologies, restricting physical access, posting guards when necessary, using visual barriers, and modifying substation designs for increased resistance to physical damage. Measures to enhance the physical security of critical HV substations include strengthening transformer cooling systems, reconfiguring layouts to limit asset visibility, and promoting the deployment of security measures. Additionally, enhancing cybersecurity for substation information and control systems, such as SCADA systems, is crucial for power grid security. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) outlines how government and private sector work together to manage risks and achieve security outcomes. The Department of Energy (DOE) is designated as the lead coordinator for the Energy Sector under the NIPP and Presidential Policy Directive 21 on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. The Department of Energy (DOE) is designated as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA) for the Energy Sector, responsible for implementing national policy on critical infrastructure security and resilience in collaboration with other federal agencies, critical infrastructure owners, and independent regulators. The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) was established in 2004 to coordinate policy activities aimed at improving the reliability and resilience of the electricity subsector. The ESCC, chaired by NERC, ensures North American grid reliability. It has transitioned to new leadership but still includes NERC's CEO. The EGCC, chaired by DOE and DHS, collaborates with ESCC on security programs. Other organizations focus on specific grid security responsibilities. The Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC) is the primary communication channel for security-related information in the electricity sector. Members can share incident information anonymously through a secure Internet portal. NERC's Critical Infrastructure Protection Committee (CIPC) coordinates security initiatives and advises on security guidelines. The ES-ISAC is the main communication channel for security information in the electricity sector. NERC chartered the Physical Security Advisory Group (PSAG) in 2015 to analyze physical security threats and enhance grid physical security and reliability. The PSAG offers advice on security plans, policy, technology, training, incident response, and threat mitigation strategy. The DOE's Energy Sector-Specific Plan addresses electricity in collaboration with the sector. The Energy Sector-Specific Plan, developed in collaboration with the ESCC and EGCC, identifies high-voltage transformers as a vulnerability in the electric sector due to their criticality and difficulty of replacement. The plan aims to implement agreements for sharing transformers in case of a terrorist attack and calls for the deployment of emergency spare transformers for quick recovery from outages. The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council's Critical Infrastructure Strategic Roadmap report highlights risks to the grid and promotes actions to enhance reliability. The report focused on severe-impact risks to the grid, particularly physical attacks on key electricity system equipment. A coordinated attack could critically disable equipment in generating stations or substations, leading to a prolonged restoration period. Assessing capabilities to prevent and respond to such attacks was deemed a high priority. The report emphasized the importance of studying options to enhance physical protection of critical equipment, such as high-voltage transformers. The Edison Electric Institute initiated the Threat Scenario Project in 2011 to identify security threats and mitigation practices for utilities, including consideration of coordinated physical and cyberattacks. The project aims to establish common elements for each threat scenario to help utilities mitigate potential impacts. The ongoing project aims to help electric utilities identify security gaps and enhance measures to detect, protect against, respond to, and recover from potential threat scenarios, specifically focusing on the security of HV transformers. The DOE's Quadrennial Energy Review highlighted the importance of resilience, reliability, safety, and asset security for the electric grid, with a priority on working with industry to develop solutions for increasing grid security and resilience. The Administration is collaborating with trade associations and the private sector to enhance the resilience of the electric grid by developing a national plan to address challenges related to aging power transformers, cyber and physical security, and vulnerabilities of large power transformers. Recommendations include leading a multi-agency initiative to mitigate risks of HV transformer losses and implementing programs within the electric power sector to address operational issues arising from the scarcity of spare HV transformers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated a program in 2008 to develop a prototype \"Recovery Transformer\" (RecX) to address operational issues due to the scarcity of spare HV transformers. The RecX transformer was designed to be adaptable, smaller, lighter, and quicker to install than conventional HV transformers. In 2012, three single-phase RecX prototype units were installed in a Texas substation during a simulated emergency. The RecX transformers were successfully installed in a 345 kV substation in Texas during a simulated emergency drill and have met all service requirements. They have comparable reliability and efficiency to other 345 kV transformers and are priced at $7.5 million each. While there have been no commercial orders for these units, some utilities have shown interest in the concept. The DHS is no longer funding the RecX program, but the manufacturer is considering further development with higher kV ratings and \"hardened\" designs. The STEP program aims to enhance the nation's transmission system resilience in the event of a terrorist attack by requiring utilities to maintain a specific number of transformers up to 500 kV for sharing in case of a critical substation failure. FERC granted authorization for cost recovery of transmission equipment under the program in 2006, with state regulators also granting pre-approval for transfers. The program addresses terrorist events and allows for voluntary sharing. The EEI program, designed for terrorist events, also allows voluntary sharing of transformers in emergencies with additional approvals. NERC's Spare Equipment Database (SED) program, initiated in 2012, facilitates communication for sharing spare transformers rated at 100 kV or higher. Only NERC and equipment owners have access to the data. The Spare Equipment Database (SED) program by NERC allows for voluntary sharing of transformers rated at 100 kV or higher. Unlike EEI's program, SED does not have pre-approval for equipment transfers, potentially requiring additional approvals even in emergencies. The DOE's Quadrennial Energy Review suggests developing HV transformer reserves due to limitations in existing programs. A House bill (H.R. 2244) introduced in 2015 aims to establish a Strategic Transformer Reserve program for storing spare large power transformers. Implementation and funding would require congressional approval. Additionally, a private sector joint venture called Grid Assurance was announced by eight electric utilities and energy companies. Grid Assurance, a new private sector joint venture company, aims to provide improved responses to major events affecting the electric transmission grid by giving transmission-owning entities access to domestically warehoused critical equipment, including HV transformers. It will maintain an optimized inventory of spare transformers and related equipment, provide secure domestic warehousing, and release spare equipment to utility subscribers as needed in emergencies. Subscription to Grid Assurance's services will be voluntary and open to other transmission companies via a standardized agreement. Grid Assurance, a private sector joint venture company, offers a wider range of critical equipment, including transformers and long-lead time items, with logistical support. They have petitioned FERC for approval to be part of physical security plans and utility subscribers can acquire equipment without requiring authorization under the Federal Power Act. NERC and FERC have conducted grid security simulations, including GridEx 2011, to assess utilities' readiness for cyberattacks. The security exercise assessed utilities' readiness to respond to cyberattacks and recommended improvements in response protocols. NERC conducted GridEx II after the Metcalf attack in 2013, focusing on cyber and physical attacks on the grid. The GridEx II security exercise assessed utilities' readiness for cyber and physical attacks on the grid, including a coordinated physical attack on transmission and generation assets. NERC's after-action report highlighted challenges in restoring power after such attacks and emphasized the need to enhance mutual aid arrangements and spare equipment inventories. Details on grid impacts were not publicly disclosed due to sensitivity, but participants found the exercise useful for testing readiness against grid attacks. NERC is preparing for GridExIII in November 2015 to test utilities' readiness for grid attacks. FERC conducted an analysis identifying critical HV substations in the North American power grid, identifying 30 critical transformer substations. Details of the analysis have not been publicly released, but some findings have been discussed by federal officials. FERC's simulation found that losing nine critical HV substations could cause a nationwide blackout. However, DOE officials questioned the validity of the analysis. Congress criticized the release of sensitive information about grid vulnerability. An investigation by the DOE Inspector General concluded that FERC mishandled the study findings. Grid security guidelines have been developed to address physical security, including HV transformers. The NERC standards for grid physical security, including HV transformers, were initially voluntary best practices since 2002 but became mandatory after the Metcalf incident in 2014. The IEEE published standards in 2000 for substation security, focusing on human intrusion mitigation with security assessments and increased measures for high-risk areas. The IEEE and NERC have established standards for grid and substation security, including measures like motion detectors, security cameras, and physical barriers. NERC's guidance provides specific security measures for different threat levels, aligning with DHS's color-coded threat level system. NERC established security measures aligned with DHS threat levels, ranging from occasional awareness programs during low threat to continuous monitoring with armed guards during high threat. Guidelines for vulnerability assessment were published, with a focus on critical facilities and countermeasures. In 2005, NERC updated its physical security guidelines with 55 recommended measures for electricity sector organizations to consider in response to threat alerts. These measures were intended as recommendations rather than considerations, emphasizing the importance of security protocols. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated new electric grid reliability standards under FERC's authority, with NERC designated as the Electric Reliability Organization. Initial standards focused on cybersecurity for the transmission grid, not physical security. Subsequent NERC standards addressed both cybersecurity and physical security measures for critical infrastructure. NERC's physical security guidance, published in October 2013, provides actions for responding to threat alerts issued by DHS. The guidance outlines 77 security measures for three threat levels: Normal Operations/Best Practices, Elevated, and Imminent. FERC, FBI, DOE, DHS, and NERC staff held meetings with utilities in 2013 to discuss security measures. In response to the Metcalf substation attack, FERC, FBI, DOE, DHS, and NERC collaborated with utilities and law enforcement agencies to discuss security measures. FERC shared a list of best practices for physical security, including outward-facing video surveillance. In 2014, DHS, FERC, ES-ISAC, NERC, FBI, and industry experts conducted regional briefings on substation security. FERC later ordered NERC to propose reliability standards for transmission owners within 90 days. FERC ordered NERC to propose new reliability standards within 90 days to address physical security risks and vulnerabilities in the power grid. The standards required transmission owners to assess critical facilities, evaluate threats and vulnerabilities, and implement security plans verified by NERC or a qualified third party. On May 23, 2014, NERC proposed mandatory physical security standards for transmission owners with assets operating at 500 kV or higher. FERC approved the new standard, known as CIP-014-1, on November 20, 2014. The standard includes six principal requirements, such as risk assessments, third-party verification, and notification of critical facilities not under operational control. The CIP-014-1 physical security standard requires risk assessments, third-party verification, and notification of critical facilities not under operational control. It also mandates threat and vulnerability assessments, physical security plans, and independent third-party reviews. Compliance monitoring includes audits, self-certifications, spot checks, violation investigations, and handling complaints. Enforcement will be done by NERC or another Regional Entity under penalty review policies approved by FERC. The CIP-014-1 physical security standard has staggered enforcement dates starting on October 1, 2015. Electric utilities have been investing in physical security measures for at least the last 15 years, with some major transmission owners announcing new initiatives to improve security at critical transformer substations. Other utilities are also making security investments as part of broader company security initiatives. In February 2012, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced security enhancements at non-nuclear power facilities, focusing on critical infrastructure like HV substations. This included replacing uniformed patrols with security technology and contract guards stationed 24/7 for a more persistent security presence. TVA implemented security enhancements in 2012 to improve security at key locations with technologies like surveillance cameras, card readers, and automated gates. These initiatives were driven by concerns such as copper theft and potential terror attacks. After the Metcalf incident in 2014, TVA intensified efforts to educate law enforcement and residents about the importance of substations and to report any suspicious activities. Details of TVA's physical security measures have not been publicly disclosed. TVA has implemented security enhancements at key locations, including surveillance cameras and card readers. The authority reportedly takes significant steps to protect its transmission infrastructure with several layers of protection. TVA's Budget Proposal for FY2016 includes cybersecurity investments but does not specify investments for physical security. PG&E announced a $100 million investment in substation security after the attack on its Metcalf substation in 2014. Measures mentioned include new barriers, shielding, and more cameras. PG&E implemented new security measures such as perimeter barriers, shielding, and increased surveillance at critical facilities. Despite initial inadequacies, including a breach in August 2014, the company plans to study advanced detection technology. Dominion Virginia Power also announced a $500 million investment in security measures. Dominion, an operating company of Dominion, plans to invest $500 million over five to seven years to enhance security at transmission substations and critical infrastructure against threats and disasters. Security measures include physical barriers, access control, equipment hardening, and stockpiling crucial equipment. Measures also involve creating \"no man zones\" around substations and implementing key-card access systems. Dominion has started implementing new physical measures like risk assessment models and equipment modifications as of February 2015. In its 2014 draft Security Asset Management Strategy, the Bonneville Power Administration proposed $37 million for physical security measures at critical transformer substations. The administration's 2015 report includes $49.9 million for acquiring spares and relocating transformers strategically. BPA has 105 single-phase transformers rated at 500kV in service. The New York Power Authority requested $42.5 million for physical security upgrades at critical substations in its transmission system, including fence intrusion detection systems, key card access, surveillance cameras, and laser detection systems. Pepco Holdings announced a $40 million project for physical security upgrades at various substations, with a focus on collaboration and assessments for security improvement opportunities. Pepco focuses on improving physical security measures at substations, considering vulnerabilities to organized attacks. Efforts to enhance security include guarded facilities, communication upgrades, and evaluating new facilities for security. Congress may need to address key issues in overseeing the sector, such as defining critical transformers. The definition of critical infrastructure includes systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, public health, or safety. NERC and FERC have specific guidelines for identifying critical assets in the electricity sector, focusing on facilities that, if compromised, would impact the reliability of the bulk-power system. In the electricity sector, critical infrastructure includes systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, public health, or safety. NERC and FERC have guidelines for identifying critical assets that could impact the reliability of the bulk-power system in the event of cascading failures. Grid owners have flexibility in determining which assets are critical based on their own risk assessments and independent validation. Grid owners have flexibility in determining critical transformer substations based on their risk assessments and independent validation. FERC's 2013 analysis identified only 30 critical substations in the US, a small fraction of the total asset base. This aligns with FERC's expectation that the number of critical facilities under NERC's new standard will be relatively small. The NERC working group expected a small number of critical facilities on the Bulk-Power System, with some stakeholders disagreeing with specific requirements in the new physical security standards. Critics argue that the standards focus too narrowly on individual substations and fail to consider potential impacts from a multi-substation attack. FERC has rejected arguments that NERC's approach overlooks critical transformers in the context of a multi-substation attack. FERC prioritizes protecting individual critical facilities and remains open to a different approach in the future as industry gains more experience. Properly identifying critical HV transformer substations is crucial to avoid risks in the electricity sector. Properly identifying critical HV transformer substations is crucial to avoid risks in the electricity sector. Independent verification is necessary to validate utility assessments, as relying solely on company-by-company assessments may lead to inconsistent conclusions about transformer criticality. Hardening the wrong substations or hardening too few could increase costs to consumers without added security benefits. Top-down assessments like FERC's Electrically Significant Location analysis may provide a more comprehensive view of asset criticality. Congress may examine whether company-specific assessments of transformer criticality could differ from national-level assessments or assessments using other analytic approaches, and what implications, if any, such differences might have on overall grid security and company efforts to protect particular substations. Confidentiality of critical infrastructure information is a key concern, leading to the establishment of sector Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). FERC has established policies for the protection of critical energy infrastructure information (CEII) through a series of orders. FERC has established policies for the protection of critical energy infrastructure information (CEII) through a series of orders, beginning with Order 630 in 2003. The order defines CEII as information related to critical infrastructure, potentially useful to terrorists, and exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Procedures and responsibilities are established for determining CEII and handling requests. FERC's 2014 order mandates physical security standards and procedures for confidential treatment of sensitive information. Members of Congress and FERC officials have expressed concern about the release of FERC staff presentation details. FERC officials have expressed concern about the release of a presentation by FERC staff, which may have compromised grid security. The DOE Inspector General issued a management alert stating that the presentation should have been classified and protected. The Acting Chairman of FERC testified that the commission was adopting recommendations to improve handling of sensitive information. The DOE Inspector General found that FERC's controls for protecting nonpublic information, specifically regarding vulnerability of the electric grid, were severely lacking. FERC has taken some steps to address the lapses, but additional measures are recommended. NERC's new physical security regulations may pose challenges in safeguarding Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) despite efforts to address vulnerabilities highlighted by the Inspector General. The regulations would require independent risk assessments and third-party validation, potentially leading to the creation and sharing of new CEII among industry entities. Ensuring the security of this information may require special attention, as demonstrated by FERC's mishandling of sensitive data in the past. The effectiveness of CEII policies in the context of these regulations remains uncertain. The Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act (H.R. 2271 \u00a72(a)) aims to enhance federal protections for critical electric infrastructure information by exempting it from disclosure laws, requiring FERC to establish regulations and sanctions for sharing this information, and allowing temporary access to classified information during grid security emergencies. The electric power sector has long-standing physical security guidelines in place that are periodically updated to reflect industry standards. The electric power sector has physical security guidelines that are periodically updated to reflect industry standards. Prior to 2014, grid owners focused on preventing vandalism and theft rather than terrorist attacks. Recent substation attacks highlight the lack of implemented security measures, especially at critical HV substations. Investing in security against terrorism presents challenges in terms of costs and benefits. Security measures in the electric power sector are costly with no direct monetary return, making cost-justification difficult. Approval from utility management, FERC, and state public utility commissions is required for new grid security capital costs. Regulators must ensure that any expenses are necessary and prudent before allowing them to be passed on to ratepayers. The Metcalf incident and GridEx exercises have provided valuable information on the potential threat of coordinated attacks on HV transformers. The Metcalf incident and GridEx exercises have highlighted the risk of coordinated attacks on HV transformers, leading to increased security investments at critical substations by utilities like PG&E and Dominion. However, there is still uncertainty about the risk of terror attacks on the power grid and the necessary security measures. Some owners of critical HV transformers have not announced security plans due to incomplete security evaluations under NERC's new standards. NERC's proposed standards for power grid physical security aim to ensure consistency in identifying critical substations and developing security plans. However, differences in organization, ratemaking, and management capability among grid owners may lead to varied security implementations. The effectiveness of physical security programs can be influenced by how it is managed within a corporate structure, including differences in organization, ratemaking, accounting, and management capability. Capital allocation and accounting practices can also be barriers to physical security implementation. For example, not all security costs are contained within the Corporate Security budget, with some costs shared with operational business units. Difficulties exist in estimating total costs of physical security efforts as not all costs are budgeted and tracked separately. Congress may examine if company-specific security initiatives align with risk profiles and if additional security measures reflect national terrorism risk uniformly. Evaluating corporate structures and accounting functions supporting physical security programs is crucial as grid owners adapt to evolving threats. Physical security risk assessments in the power industry rely on information from the federal government and ISAC for security threats. The quality and timeliness of threat information from various sources, including the federal government and ISAC, is crucial for grid owners to determine security measures. Incomplete or ambiguous information may lead to inefficiencies in security spending and deployment of measures. Flexibility in dealing with varying risk profiles is essential for physical security standards in the North American grid. The varying risk profiles and circumstances across the North American grid can lead to inefficient regulatory burdens. Differences in threat information interpretation may explain why some utilities have initiated security measures while others have not. Concerns persist about the quality of federal threat information, especially regarding physical security for the power grid. Some organizations use probabilistic models to assess risks, but data limitations hinder the inclusion of physical attack assessments. The Metcalf incident is seen as a domestic threat by some federal officials. Some federal officials view the Metcalf incident as a potential domestic terrorist attack, while the FBI does not believe it was terrorism. The ambiguity surrounding the perpetrators has significant implications for HV substation security. Industry analysts debate the seriousness of the attack and whether FERC's security measures are an overreaction. Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff predicts future attacks will surpass the sophistication of the Metcalf incident. Concerns exist that FERC's security focus may be too narrow. FERC's physical security concerns may be too focused on another Metcalf-type scenario rather than a wider range of potential future threats. There is agreement that HV transformers in the US are vulnerable to terrorist attacks with catastrophic consequences. However, multi-transformer attacks would require operational information and sophistication from potential attackers. Without specific information on targets and attacker capabilities, the true vulnerability of the grid to such attacks remains uncertain. Congress is working to address HV transformer vulnerability in relation to other security priorities. Understanding the vulnerability of HV transformer substations is crucial for grid security. Congress is examining federal threat information usage by grid owners and its impact on physical security. The electric power industry focuses on defense-in-depth strategies to prevent and minimize the effects of successful attacks on critical assets within the power grid. Initiatives to enhance grid resiliency include incident response and recovery measures. Industry initiatives like the DHS recovery transformer program and EEI's spare transformer program aim to enhance grid resiliency against terrorist attacks. Despite calls for additional federal authorities to respond to incidents affecting grid critical infrastructure, some stakeholders argue that current grid reliability authority may not be sufficient for emergency action. A House bill to amend the Federal Power Act is being considered in response to these concerns. The House bill H.R. 2271 aims to amend the Federal Power Act to allow the President to authorize emergency measures to protect grid reliability during a \"grid security emergency.\" FERC and NERC officials support the bill, stating that current procedures are not effective in addressing urgent cyber or national security risks to the power system. Utility industry representatives also back the legislation, as long as it focuses on national catastrophic instances and does not conflict with existing grid protection measures. The utility industry supports industry-government coordination in protecting the grid during a security incident. Congress may focus on specific details of legislation like H.R. 2271 to align with industry needs. The DOE's Quadrennial Energy Review calls for critical HV transformer reserves, supported by H.R. 2244 for a DOE plan. Utility industry backs the policy intentions for HV transformer reserves.

Congress may focus on specific details of legislation like H.R. 2271 to align with industry needs. The DOE's Quadrennial Energy Review calls for critical HV transformer reserves, supported by H.R. 2244 for a DOE plan. Utility industry backs the policy intentions for HV transformer reserves. Stakeholders believe in a private sector-driven approach for transformer sparing services, questioning the cost-effectiveness of a new national HV transformer reserve program. Congress may consider the relationship of such a program to ongoing industry initiatives. The need for critical HV transformer reserves is supported by industry-government coordination. Congress is considering legislation like H.R. 2271 to align with industry needs. The DOE's Quadrennial Energy Review emphasizes the importance of HV transformer reserves, backed by H.R. 2244 for a DOE plan. Stakeholders advocate for a private sector-driven approach for transformer sparing services, questioning the cost-effectiveness of a national HV transformer reserve program. Resilience strategies for the electric power grid include hardening, advanced capabilities, and recovery/reconstitution, with a focus on improving grid flexibility and control. The electric power grid resilience initiatives include pole maintenance, vegetation management, use of mobile transformers, and participation in mutual assistance groups. Various federal, state, and industry efforts aim to improve grid resilience in response to weather-related events and potential physical attacks. Grid scale energy storage, distributed generation, and smart grid technologies are also key components in enhancing grid resilience. The Enhanced Grid Security Act of 2015 (S. 1241) and the Grid Modernization Act of 2015 (S. 1243) aim to increase grid resiliency and security through various measures such as vulnerability assessment, modeling, research, and investment in new technologies. These initiatives seek to enhance the functional preservation of the electric grid against natural and human-made threats. The legislation aims to enhance physical security in the power grid, with a focus on prevention, recovery, and resilience. Maintaining an integrated perspective may help balance industry investment, regulatory requirements, and federal oversight."
