    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5150 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 5150. When a person is a danger to others or themselves due to a mental health disorder, they can be taken into custody for up to 72 hours for assessment, evaluation, and crisis intervention in a designated facility approved by the State Department of Health Care Services. Crisis intervention, as defined in Section 5008, can be provided concurrently with assessment and evaluation on an ongoing basis. When determining if a person should be taken into custody, the individual making that decision must apply Section 5150.05 and consider more than just the risk of imminent harm. The professional in charge of a designated facility assesses individuals to determine if they can be served without detention. If deemed possible, voluntary services are provided, and peace officers can still bring individuals for assessment. The peace officers are not required to perform any additional duties beyond what is specified in Sections 5150.1 and 5150.2. Whenever a person evaluated by a professional for mental health services is not admitted to a designated facility, alternative services must be offered as determined by the county mental health director. If a person is deemed unable to be properly served without being detained, the admitting facility must require a written application stating the circumstances and probable cause for believing the person is a danger to others or themselves due to a mental health disorder. The application for detention must state the circumstances and probable cause for believing the person is a danger to others, themselves, or gravely disabled due to a mental health disorder. If the probable cause is based on a false statement, the person providing it may be liable in a civil action. At the time of custody for evaluation, precautions must be taken to preserve personal property. A report describing the property and its disposition must be provided to the court, unless a responsible relative or guardian has possession of the property. The responsibility for personal property of a person in custody terminates when taken by a responsible relative, defined as spouse, parent, adult child, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or adult sibling. When a person is taken into custody under this section, they must be provided with specific information orally or in writing, including the name and affiliation of the person taking them into custody, the purpose of the examination by mental health professionals, and the location where the examination will take place. If taken from their own residence, additional information must be provided. When taken into custody, you can bring personal items with approval. Notify if help is needed with appliances or water. Make a call and leave a note for family or friends about your whereabouts. The designated facility must keep a record of the advisement given to each evaluated patient, including the detainee's name, the officer or mental health professional's name, completion date, method of advisement, and reason if not completed. Each person admitted to a designated facility for evaluation and treatment must be informed orally and in writing about the reasons for their placement, including potential harm to themselves or others, and their inability to care for themselves. The information should be provided in a language accessible to the individual, with accommodations for disabilities affecting communication. During a 72-hour hold, individuals may be transferred to another facility and can request evaluation or treatment by a mental health professional of their choice, with no guarantee of availability. During a 72-hour hold, individuals may receive evaluation and treatment, including medications, by facility staff. They can be released early or held longer if deemed necessary. If held longer, they have the right to a lawyer, interpreter, and a hearing before a judge. Legal rights questions can be directed to the county Patients\u2019 Rights Advocate. The facility must keep a record of the advisement given to each patient, including the name of the person giving the advisement, date, completion status, communication method, and reason if not completed. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts."
