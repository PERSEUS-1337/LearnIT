    "content": "Federal executive branch agencies own approximately 295,000 buildings acquired over decades to support their missions. As missions change, some assets become less useful. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs has shifted to outpatient care, and the Department of Defense reduced its force after the Cold War. Agencies are required to dispose of unneeded real property, but many still hold onto it. The government spends billions on operating and maintaining unutilized buildings. Disposal efforts are hindered by legal and budgetary issues. Several real property reform bills have been introduced in Congress to address inefficiencies in the disposal process. The government has introduced bills like the Reform Act and Savings Act to address the issue of unneeded properties. Government Accountability Office reports highlight challenges in disposing of these properties, including statutory requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Agencies are mandated to regularly survey their properties for identification. Agencies must continuously survey and report excess property to GSA for disposal. Regulations set by GSA and statutory requirements dictate the process. Excess properties are offered to federal agencies first, then to state and local governments and qualified nonprofits for public use. The McKinney-Vento Act mandates that surplus properties must be screened for homeless use, which can prolong the disposal process by months or years. This requirement, along with other statutory obligations, can slow down the disposition process and result in agencies incurring operating costs for extended periods. The disposal process for surplus properties can be prolonged by months or years due to various statutory obligations, such as screening for homeless use, environmental remediation, and historic preservation requirements. This can add significant time and costs to the disposal process for agencies like the Army, even for properties that may only be suitable for demolition. The National Historic Preservation Act requires agencies to minimize harm to historic properties during disposal actions, including consulting with preservation groups. Agencies may need costly repairs for older unneeded buildings to meet standards and historic preservation requirements. For example, the VA may need $3 billion to repair poor-condition buildings, some of which are vacant and could be disposed of. Poor property conditions may deter potential buyers or lessees. Federal agencies face challenges in disposing of unneeded real property due to various factors such as the cost of required improvements, deconstruction and cleanup costs, and compliance with environmental regulations. Stakeholders with competing agendas, including local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and political factors, can complicate disposal efforts. Communities may also oppose disposals, making it difficult for agencies like the Department of the Interior and VA to dispose of their properties. Federal agencies, including the Department of State, face challenges in disposing of surplus real property due to disputes with host governments and conflicting stakeholder interests. Data on agency real property portfolios are inaccurate, hindering congressional oversight. Agencies often opt for leasing space instead of seeking funding for new construction. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA collects data on real property from executive branch agencies. The FRPP data could improve congressional oversight by providing information on excess properties and annual activities. The GSA manages the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) which collects data on real property from executive branch agencies. However, GSA does not allow direct access to the FRPP by Congress, citing proprietary data concerns. Limited FRPP data is made public through annual summary reports on GSA's website, but these reports are not detailed enough for congressional oversight. Congress cannot monitor individual agency performance effectively through these summary reports. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by the GSA lacks detailed data for congressional oversight. GAO audits reveal unreliable real property data, hindering agencies from making informed decisions. Key data elements like maintenance needs and utilization rates are not consistently captured, impacting agency performance evaluation and accountability. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by the GSA has unreliable data, leading to agencies making real property decisions using unreliable data. The FRPC stopped reporting data on underutilized and not utilized buildings in FY2011, resumed in FY2013 with different definitions, reporting a significant decrease in underutilized buildings. GAO concluded that the FRPC's data on underutilized federal real property is not reliable. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) contains unreliable data on excess and surplus properties, omitting key details that would enhance congressional oversight. Agencies provide estimates for repair needs, but these are not fully disclosed in the annual summary reports, hindering Congress's ability to make informed decisions about property disposition. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the government's reliance on costly leased space as a major obstacle in managing federal real property. GAO emphasized that leasing space is more expensive than owning, citing examples where leasing cost millions more than purchasing. This reliance on leased space has led to higher operating costs compared to government-owned buildings. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) pointed out that agencies often choose to lease space instead of purchasing it due to budget scoring rules, even if leasing is not the most cost-effective option. Leased space only requires annual lease payments and termination costs, unlike constructing or purchasing a building which requires upfront funding for the entire cost. Some agencies have independent leasing authority, exempting them from certain regulations. Some agencies with independent leasing authority, like USPS and VA, have in-house real property expertise. The SEC, granted independent leasing authority, made a costly leasing decision criticized by its inspector general for acquiring excessive space. The SEC bypassed closer and cheaper locations, showing poor decision-making by inexperienced senior management. CPRA, introduced in 2015, aims to reduce government-owned buildings through an independent commission's recommendations. It applies to all executive branch agencies and government corporations, excluding certain properties like those under DOD jurisdiction or owned by USPS. No further action has been taken since February 12, 2015. The CPRA legislation aims to reduce government-owned buildings through realigning actions, including consolidation, sale, and transfer of properties. Federal agencies must develop recommendations for realigning their real property portfolios and submit them to GSA and OMB within 120 days of each fiscal year. The data provided should include property age, condition, operating costs, and size. The CPRA legislation requires federal agencies to submit recommendations for realigning their real property portfolios to GSA and OMB. Recommendations may include selling, transferring, consolidating, relocating, or redeveloping properties to reduce operating costs. The GSA Administrator and OMB Director will develop criteria for determining realignment actions for each property. The CPRA legislation requires federal agencies to submit recommendations for realigning their real property portfolios to GSA and OMB. Criteria for determining realignment actions include maximizing utilization rate, reducing operating and maintenance costs, aligning with agency mission, and consolidating similar operations. The CPRA legislation requires federal agencies to submit recommendations for realigning their real property portfolios to GSA and OMB. The OMB Director would conduct an independent analysis of agency recommendations and submit them to a Civilian Property Realignment Commission composed of seven members appointed by the President and other officials. The CPRA legislation establishes a Civilian Property Realignment Commission with seven members appointed by key government officials. The commission includes members with expertise in various fields and has the authority to review, accept, modify, or add recommendations regarding real property portfolios. It will develop an accounting system to evaluate costs and returns, aim for consensus in recommendations, and submit a report within 10 years. The CPRA legislation establishes a Civilian Property Realignment Commission with seven members appointed by key government officials. The commission would submit final recommendations to the President, establish a website to post findings, and require GAO to publish a report on the recommendations. Additionally, the commission must recommend at least five high-value federal properties to sell, with a total estimated fair market value of at least $500 million. The President would review the recommendations and report to Congress within 30 days on approved recommendations. The CPRA legislation establishes a Civilian Property Realignment Commission with seven members appointed by key government officials. The commission would submit final recommendations to the President, who must review and report to Congress within 30 days on approved recommendations. If the President disapproves of some or all recommendations, a revised list can be submitted for approval. If no report is submitted within 30 days, the process terminates for the year. The CPRA process allows the President to approve or reject a complete list of recommendations from the Civilian Property Realignment Commission. Congress then has 45 days to review and debate the recommendations as a whole. If no joint resolution of disapproval is passed within the time limit, agencies must implement the recommendations within three years. The CPRA process allows the President to approve recommendations from the Civilian Property Realignment Commission. The GSA Administrator would have authority to implement the recommendations, with exemptions from certain statutory requirements. Agencies must use their existing authorities or work with GSA to implement the recommendations. The bill would establish new guidelines for screening and disposing of properties serving the homeless. The CPRA bill expands reporting requirements for construction proposals exceeding the prospectus threshold. It mandates a statement on consistency with CPRA, use of life-cycle cost analysis, and comparative cost analysis for leasing versus buying space. Two accounts would be established to fund administrative and personnel costs. The CPRA bill establishes two accounts to fund administrative and personnel costs: an expense account and an asset proceeds and space management fund (APSMF). The bill authorizes appropriations of $20 million for the salaries and expenses account and $62 million for the APSMF. The APSMF would receive proceeds from implementing recommendations and savings generated. Funds in the APSMF account can only be used for implementing the commission's recommendations. Net disposal proceeds under CPRA would be deposited in the Treasury's general fund, with excess proceeds distributed accordingly. The CPRA bill outlines the distribution of net proceeds over $50 million, with 80% going to the Treasury's general fund and 20% allocated at the discretion of the GSA Administrator. It also mandates that most executive agencies acquire leased space through GSA, except for certain exemptions. Additionally, the bill requires the consideration of a building's life-cycle cost for construction or leasing, applying to buildings meeting specific criteria. The CPRA bill mandates the consideration of a building's life-cycle cost for construction or leasing, defining it as the total sum of various costs over 50 years. GSA Administrator must include a statement on how life-cycle cost analysis was used in prospectus submissions. CPRA also requires GSA to provide access to the FRPP database. The CPRA bill mandates access to the FRPP database for congressional committees and agencies, requiring detailed property information such as age, size, location, utilization, and operating costs. The CPRA bill mandates access to detailed property information for congressional committees and agencies, including operating costs, capital expenditures, sustainability metrics, federal employees, and mission dependency. The FAST Act, similar to CPRA, establishes a board for disposal recommendations but lacks a mechanism for congressional review and approval. The FAST Act, introduced in December 2015 and February 2016 for S. 2375 and H.R. 4465 respectively, applies to federal executive branch agencies and government corporations, excluding BRAC properties and most Coast Guard properties. The OMB Director can exclude properties for national security reasons, as well as those controlled by Indian and Native Alaskan tribes. No further action had been taken on either bill as of February 12, 2016. H.R. 4465, like the FAST Act, excludes certain properties from realignment recommendations, such as those of national security interest, tribal control, postal service, and certain public lands. It also excludes properties outside the US operated by the Department of State or Agency for International Development. Agencies must submit realignment recommendations to GSA and OMB within 120 days of each fiscal year, including data on property age, condition, operating costs, sustainability metrics, and more. The FAST Act requires agencies to categorize federal properties for potential realignment to reduce operating costs. Criteria will be developed by the GSA Administrator and OMB Director, considering nine principles for determining which properties should be realigned. These principles include the potential for selling, redeveloping, or outleasing properties to reduce costs. The OMB Director would analyze agency recommendations for property realignment based on criteria such as cost reduction, alignment with agency mission, utilization rate, potential savings, energy consumption reduction, and economic impact on communities. The OMB Director would submit revised recommendations to a Federal Real Property Reform Board or Public Buildings Reform Board, composed of a chairperson and six members appointed by the President. The board would include members with expertise in commercial real estate, space optimization, and community development, serving six-year terms. The FAST Act proposes the establishment of a Federal Real Property Reform Board with members serving six-year terms. The board would review the OMB Director's recommendations, have the authority to accept, reject, or modify them, and develop an accounting system to evaluate costs and returns. Recommendations supported by a majority of members would be included in a report submitted to the OMB Director, with a requirement to establish a website for posting relevant information. The GAO would publish a report on the recommendations and methodology used. The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Real Property Reform Board to review OMB Director's recommendations on high-value federal properties for sale. The board's recommendations must include at least five properties with a total estimated fair market value of $500 million. The OMB Director has 30 days to review and report to Congress on the approval or disapproval of the recommendations. If approved, the Director must submit the recommendations to Congress with certification. If disapproved, a report must be submitted. The Federal Real Property Reform Board would review OMB Director's recommendations on high-value federal properties for sale. If the Director disapproves, a report must be submitted to Congress. Agencies must implement recommendations within six years, with the GSA Administrator having discretion to convey property below fair market value. The Federal Real Property Reform Board would review OMB Director's recommendations on high-value federal properties for sale. Agencies must implement recommendations within six years, with the GSA Administrator having discretion to convey property below fair market value. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act would still apply to properties suitable for services to the homeless, but with shortened screening and application processes. The FAST Act would establish accounts for administrative costs and asset proceeds, receiving funds from appropriations. H.R. 4465 would establish the APSMF with a $40 million appropriation and proceeds from property sales based on board recommendations. The APSMF would not receive agency savings, and funds could only be used for implementing board recommendations. The bill also requires the GSA Administrator to maintain a database of federal property details. The Federal Real Property Management Reform Act aims to establish a database of federal property details including excess, surplus, underutilized, or unutilized properties. It would expand existing real property management requirements, incentivize disposal of unneeded property, and allow agencies to retain proceeds from property transfers. Introduced in 2016, the Act does not create a new process for identifying and disposing of unneeded real property like the CPRA or FAST Act. The Property Reform Act, introduced in 2016, aims to establish a Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) to manage federal property. It would codify the FRPC established by Executive Order 13327 and add a representative from the U.S. Postal Service to the council. The Reform Act would add a U.S. Postal Service representative to the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) to develop property guidance for more efficient management, reducing costs. It requires performance measures and goals for surplus property reduction and increased federal building utilization, different from E.O. 13327. The FRPC must also develop utilization rates for federal buildings and a strategy to decrease government reliance on them. The Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) is tasked with developing strategies to reduce government reliance on long-term leases, eliminate inefficient leasing practices, identify suitable field offices for collocation, issue guidance on public-private partnerships, improve the State Agencies for Surplus Property program, and report on underutilized property. Consultation with various stakeholders is required. The Property Reform Act would require federal agencies to assess workforce capacity, establish goals to reduce excess property, and report on underutilized property. The Property Reform Act mandates federal agencies to reduce excess and underutilized property, report to the FRPC on increasing utilization rates, identify underutilized leased space, and adopt practices to boost productivity. Agencies must provide data on property holdings including address, size, utilization rate, operating costs, and sustainability metrics. Additionally, they must disclose capital expenditures, projected operational costs over five years, and the number of employees housed at each property. The Property Reform Act requires federal agencies to report on property utilization rates, leases, and real property data to the FRPC. The Act mandates the establishment of a comprehensive database of all federal agency-controlled real property. The Property Reform Act mandates a comprehensive database for federal agencies to report detailed information on property disposals, including disposal method, proceeds, and costs. Excluded properties are those subject to BRAC, certain public lands, and postal properties. The database must be accessible to specific Senate committees initially. The Property Reform Act mandates a database for federal agencies to report property disposals. Agencies can retain proceeds for specific purposes, and GSA can transfer surplus federal property to states. The Property Reform Act would allow GSA to transfer surplus federal property to states for donation to museums. The Act also requires the Postal Service to create an annual list of postal properties available for federal agency use, with agencies identifying opportunities for collocation. Additionally, the Postal Service must maintain inventory controls, develop accountability systems, and project workforce needs for managing its real property portfolio. The Postal Service would need to conduct regular inventory and assessments of its real property, including details like age, size, location, utilization rate, operating costs, and workforce housed in each property. The Inspector General would report on excess property and recommend collocation or reduction of excess space. The Property Reform Act would require the Postal Service to submit reports on designing mail delivery vehicles for rural areas and extreme weather conditions, as well as integrating collision-averting technology. Additionally, the Postal Service would need to report on efforts to replace and modernize its fleet. The Public Buildings Act establishes a streamlined leasing pilot program for GSA to acquire leases of $500,000 or less with simplified procedures. It allows GSA to consolidate projects into a single prospectus to reduce space and improve utilization rates. The bill also reduces the information required in lease prospectuses for leases meeting specific criteria. During the pilot program, GSA must report expiring leases to congressional committees and provide a final evaluation with recommendations for permanent changes. The Public Buildings Act requires new information in prospectuses, including cost comparisons and explanations for not consolidating space. The bill requires GSA to sell a portion of the Forrestal Complex to fund a new DOE headquarters. GSA must notify Congress of cost increases and seek approval for project scope changes. If an approved project is not started within five years, it is considered expired. The bill mandates the sale of a portion of the Forrestal Complex to finance the construction of the new DOE headquarters on government-owned land. Proceeds from the sale will be deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund for future appropriations. The Public Buildings Act limits discounted purchase options and requires GSA to consider bulk purchase of utilities for leased facilities. GAO will conduct biennial audits of GSA's National Broker Contract. The bill requires GAO to audit brokers selected under the program for lower lease rental rates compared to GSA staff, assess lease impact, and report findings to Congress. GSA must evaluate rental caps in the National Capitol Region for build-to-suit leased space competition. Additionally, federal buildings open to the public must have at least one lactation room. The bill requires federal buildings open to the public to have at least one lactation room. Agency heads may exclude a building if it does not already have a lactation room or if the cost of constructing one would be unfeasible. This requirement aims to provide a lactation room for employees and visitors, with potential cost savings by bypassing screening requirements for homeless use. The CPRA and FAST Act propose new entities to expedite the disposal process of federal properties, bypassing certain statutory requirements. The bills would establish a commission or board to make disposal recommendations, with the President seeking Senate confirmation for the chairperson. Delays in the nomination process could slow down the development of recommendations. The CPRA and FAST Act propose new entities to expedite federal property disposal, with a commission appointed by the President or House and Senate leaders. CPRA allows for a 45-day congressional review period, potentially reducing oversight of major consolidation projects requiring significant funding. Congress typically holds hearings on such proposals due to their complexity and long-term impact. The consolidation proposals for federal properties, such as the Department of Homeland Security and Food and Drug Administration headquarters, have raised concerns about costs, logistical challenges, and historic preservation. Congress holds hearings on these projects, with some questioning the proposed time constraints for approval. Requiring Congress to approve or disapprove of recommended actions could help reduce conflicts among stakeholders. The involvement of various stakeholders in property disposal efforts can complicate decision-making processes. In 2002, the USPS faced challenges in closing underutilized facilities due to political pressure from stakeholders. Moving decision-making away from executive branch agencies could reduce stakeholder pressure. The FAST Act may limit Congress's influence on property disposal recommendations compared to CPRA, giving more authority to the executive branch. Both bills aim to improve data transparency for excess properties. The CPRA and H.R. 4465 aim to enhance oversight of federal real property by providing detailed data on property characteristics, operating costs, and sustainability metrics. They would require reports to be posted online and grant access to comprehensive government-wide data to analysts and policymakers. Additionally, H.R. 4465 would establish a publicly accessible database with information on federal building costs and utilization levels. The Property Reform Act, including the Senate bill S. 2375, aims to improve oversight of federal buildings by providing detailed data on costs and utilization levels. However, there are concerns about the quality of data collected and access to information in the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP). The Property Reform Act would establish a publicly accessible database with a broader range of information on federal properties, but it does not address the quality of data in the FRPP or establish a new process for the disposition of surplus federal buildings. The Property Reform Act aims to improve oversight of federal buildings by providing detailed data on costs and proceeds from property disposal. This data can help identify delays in the disposal process and enhance revenue estimates. The Act also encourages federal agencies to lease space in underutilized Postal Service buildings, potentially increasing collocation and providing housing for agencies relocating or consolidating. The Public Buildings Act aims to establish a pilot program to address concerns about costly leasing in federal real property management. The program would reduce administrative burdens by setting criteria for leases, such as a minimum length of 10 years and a cost per square foot cap. Additionally, the bill would enhance Congress's oversight of space acquisition projects by requiring notification of cost increases of 5% or more. By setting a 5% threshold for notification, Congress can identify projects with potential cost overruns sooner, improving oversight of space acquisition projects."
