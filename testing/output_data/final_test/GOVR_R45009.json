    "content": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established by Congress in 1950 to support basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering. It is a major source of federal support for U.S. university research, particularly in fields like computer science. The NSF also plays a significant role in federal STEM education programs and student aid. This report discusses the Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request for NSF, legislative actions on FY2018 appropriations, and proposed measures in the 115th Congress to increase NSF appropriations limits. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established in 1950 to support basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering. It has six appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), National Science Board (NSB), and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Appropriations are generally provided at the account level, with program-specific direction included in appropriations acts or accompanying reports. NSF's primary mission activities are funded through RRA, EHR, and MREFC. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has six appropriations accounts and appropriations are generally provided at the account level. The Trump Administration is seeking a $819 million decrease in funding for NSF in FY2018 compared to FY2017 enacted levels. The Trump Administration is seeking a $819 million decrease in funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) in FY2018. The FY2018 budget request for NSF includes decreases in budget authority for several accounts, with the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 proposing a total of $7.340 billion for NSF, a decrease of $133 million from FY2017 enacted levels. The FY2018 budget proposal includes a decrease in funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF), with the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 proposing a total of $7.311 billion for NSF, a decrease of $161 million from FY2017 enacted levels. The bill would keep funding for some accounts the same and decrease funding for others. The FY2018 budget proposal includes a decrease in funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF). The bill would keep funding for the NSB and OIG accounts the same and decrease funding for four accounts: RRA by $116 million (-1.9%), MREFC by $26.2 million (-12.5%), EHR by $17.6 million (-2%), and AOAM by $1.5 million (-0.5%). The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-56, Division D) provided funding for NSF at the FY2017 level through December 8, 2017, subject to a 0.6791% across-the-board decrease. The Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-90, Division A) extends funding through December 22, 2017. The FY2018 NSF budget justification highlights ongoing agency-wide investments to address cross-disciplinary questions. A slight increase in funding is requested for the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES, $15 million requested, +6.5%). Decreases ranging from 12% to 70% from FY2016 actual amounts are requested for six other investments: Cyber-Enabled Materials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems (CEMMSS, $222 million requested, -18%); Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS, $24 million requested, -70%); Innovation Corps (I-Corps, $26 million requested, -12%); Risk and Resilience ($31 million requested, -27%); Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC, $114 million requested, -12%); and Understanding the Brain (UtB, $134 million requested, -22%). The committee reports provide direction for one of these programs, recommending no changes. The NSF's budget request for FY2017 includes recommendations for funding levels for various programs. Some programs, such as CIF21, BioMaPS, and SEES, are ending or seeing funding conclude due to achieving their goals. However, the I-Corps program is recommended to receive no less than the FY2017 level of $30 million. Additionally, three other multi-directorate programs are highlighted as ending in FY2017. The NSF's budget request for FY2017 includes funding for various programs, including the SEES program. The budget request also emphasizes NSF's 10 \"Big Ideas\" for future investment, with specific funding requested for the INCLUDES program. Research ideas include Harnessing the Data Revolution, Work at the Human Technology Frontier, and Understanding the Rules of Life. Process ideas include Mid-scale Research Infrastructure and NSF 2026: Seeding Innovation. The committee reports express support for scientific infrastructure investments, astronomy facilities, cybersecurity research, and broadening participation in STEM. The Trump Administration seeks $5.362 billion for RRA in FY2018, a $627 million decrease compared to FY2017. The FY2018 request includes decreases for all RRA subaccounts except for the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. The largest decrease would go to Mathematical and Physical Sciences. In FY2018, funding for Mathematical and Physical Sciences would decrease by $129 million (-9.6%), while Integrative Activities would see the largest percentage decrease of $111 million (-26%). The FY2018 request also includes a $60 million decrease (-37.5%) for the EPSCoR program compared to FY2017 enacted funding levels. The House and Senate bills would provide similar funding levels for RRA and EPSCoR as FY2017. The Committee supports strategic investments in physical science areas to maintain US leadership in innovation and economic growth. S. 1662 proposes $5.918 billion for RRA, a decrease of $115.8 million from FY2017. For EPSCoR, the House recommends $170.7 million, $70.7 million more than the FY2018 request. The Senate suggests at least $160 million for EPSCoR, directing NSF to limit administrative costs to 5%. Funding levels for RRA subaccounts are not specified in either report. The House report directs funding levels for certain divisions and programs within RRA directorates, including supporting programs at FY2017 levels for the Division of Astronomical Sciences. Additionally, $48 million is directed for the International Ocean Discovery Program within the Geosciences Directorate. H.Amdt. 382 to H.R. 3354 supports physical science funding by increasing research funding by $30.2 million within RRA. Total spending for RRA remains unchanged. The FY2018 budget request includes $761 million for EHR, a $119 million decrease (-13.6%) from the FY2016 estimate. This represents the largest percentage reduction requested among NSF's appropriations accounts. Both House and Senate committee reports support funding levels for specific programs within RRA, with a $30.2 million increase directed towards physical science research. Total spending for RRA remains unchanged. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $880 million for EHR, matching FY2017 levels and $119.4 million above the FY2018 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations suggested $862.4 million for EHR, a $17.6 million decrease from FY2017 and $101.8 million above the FY2018 request. The Division of Graduate Education (DGE) would see the largest decrease in funding at $57 million (-20.5%), while other divisions would also receive decreases in their requested amounts. The FY2018 budget request for EHR includes decreases in funding for various programs, such as the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) and those focusing on broadening participation in STEM. The requested amount for GRF is $246 million, a reduction of $86 million (-26%) from FY2016. The total funding for EHR programs under the broadening participation theme for FY2018 is $196 million. The budget request for the broadening participation and institutional capacity theme for FY2018 is $196 million, with decreases in funding for various programs. Specific allocations include: AISL ($62.5 million), STEM+C ($20 million), HBCU-UP ($35 million), TCUP ($13 million), LSAMP ($41 million), and IUSE: HSI ($15 million). House and Senate committee reports recommend different funding amounts for some programs. The Senate committee report recommends funding levels for various programs in FY2018, including $62.5 million for AISL, $52 million for STEM+C, $55 million for CyberCorps, and maintains funding for NSF Scholarships in STEM and other programs. The House committee report does not specify an amount for the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account. The Trump Administration is seeking just over $183 million for MREFC in FY2018, a decrease of $26 million (-12.5%) from the FY2017 enacted amount. The requested funding would support three main projects, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The majority of the funding ($105 million) would go towards the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV) program to build ships for science in U.S. coastal waters. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Congress directed NSF to provide $122 million to build three RCRVs, amounting to $41 million per ship. The budget request notes that this direction will impact current and future funding requirements. The House Committee on Appropriations would provide $77.8 million for MREFC in FY2018, $131 million below the FY2017 enacted level. The Senate Committee on Appropriations would provide $182.8 million for MREFC in FY2018, equal to the FY2018 request. The recommended amount for MREFC in FY2018 includes funding for DKIST and LSST, as well as construction of three RCRVs. The Senate committee report also urges the GAO to review programs funded within MREFC annually and report to Congress. The Trump Administration seeks $328.5 million for the AOAM account, a slight decrease from FY2017. Both the House and Senate bills recommend the requested amount for AOAM. The FY2018 budget request includes funding for AOAM, OIG, and NSB. The House and Senate bills recommend funding equal to FY2017 levels. The budget request also highlights funding for NSF activities under NNI, NITRD, and USGCRP, with requested decreases in funding compared to FY2016 levels. The Senate and House committee reports do not provide specific direction for NSF's investments in these initiatives. The FY2018 budget request includes funding for AOAM, OIG, and NSB, with House and Senate bills recommending funding equal to FY2017 levels. Various reauthorization measures have been introduced in Congress to address authorizations of appropriations for NSF, including the American Innovation Act (H.R. 1569 and S. 641) which would adjust spending limits for federal science agencies conducting basic research. The FY2018 budget request includes funding for AOAM, OIG, and NSB, with House and Senate bills recommending funding equal to FY2017 levels. Reauthorization measures have been introduced in Congress to address appropriations for NSF, including the American Innovation Act (H.R. 1569 and S. 641) adjusting spending limits for federal science agencies conducting basic research. Table 3 displays FY2013 authorization levels, appropriations to NSF in FY2016 and FY2017, FY2018 requested amounts, and proposed authorized maximum funding levels for NSF in FY2018 under selected measures from the 115th Congress. Trends in NSF authorizations, budget requests, and appropriations since the foundation's establishment in 1950 are shown in Table 4, Figure 1, and Figure 2. Appropriations to NSF grew rapidly between FY1951 and FY1966, fluctuating until about FY1988, with periods of sustained growth in current and constant dollar terms. Since FY1988, NSF has seen periods of sustained growth in appropriations between FY1989-1995 and FY1998-2003. However, growth has slowed since FY2003. Annual growth in appropriations was 8% from FY1997-2003, 4% from FY2004-2010, and 1% from FY2011-2017. NSF obligations have mainly increased in the main research account, RRA, by $1.890 billion (45.6%) between FY2003 and FY2017. Total NSF obligations rose by $2.103 billion (39%) during the same period. If funded at requested levels, NSF appropriations would be the lowest since FY2009 in current dollars and FY2002 in constant dollars. NSF leadership applied principles for funding reductions in the FY2018 budget request, prioritizing core research and reducing program budgets that have scaled up. The request aims to maintain cross-disciplinary programs and prioritize those leading to progress on Big Ideas. Policymakers are considering funding directives for specific scientific fields within NSF's RRA account. The FY2018 budget request for NSF prioritizes core research and reduces program budgets that have scaled up. Policymakers are considering funding directives for specific scientific fields within NSF's RRA account, emphasizing support for research in physical and biological sciences over other fields. Opponents argue that funding distribution should be determined by scientists managing NSF programs based on research merits and needs in each field. Continuing appropriations acts, known as CRs, provide short-term funding until appropriations decisions are finalized, causing uncertainty for agencies. CRs can lead to reductions or delays in agency operations, as they typically prohibit new activities not funded in the previous fiscal year. Since FY1997, CRs have been enacted almost six times per year, providing an average of almost five months of funding annually. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-56, Division D), funds NSF through December 8, 2017, at the FY2017 level with a 0.6791% across-the-board decrease. The House and Senate committee reports direct \"not less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level\" for multiple programs, including NSF. Inflation-adjusted appropriations for NSF have remained flat on average since FY2010, despite current dollar increases. Analysts warn that sustained federal science funding cuts could harm scientific research and innovation, especially in basic research with longer timelines for returns on investment. Some argue that NSF funding has remained strong despite budget constraints, suggesting seeking support from other sources for scientific research broadly."
