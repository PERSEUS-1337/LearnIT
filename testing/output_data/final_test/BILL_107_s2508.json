    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural animals can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it harder to treat infections. The World Health Organization recommended in 1997 and 2000 that antibiotics used for humans should not be used to promote animal growth. The use of antibiotics in animal production systems for growth promotion is restricted in most developed countries, except for the United States and Canada. The National Academy of Sciences linked the use of antibiotics in food animals to bacterial resistance and human disease. The European Union banned the use of human-use antibiotics for animal growth promotion in 1999. In October 2000, the FDA announced plans to withdraw approval for fluoroquinolone antibiotics in poultry due to increased resistance in bacteria. The agency stated that the use of these antibiotics in poultry is a significant cause of resistant infections in humans. In June 2001, medical organizations like the American Medical Association and the American College of Preventive Medicine opposed nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture. The New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial in October 2001 urging a ban on nontherapeutic use of medically important antibiotics in animals. The National Academy of Sciences has also highlighted concerns regarding this issue. The National Academy of Sciences found that eliminating antibiotics as feed additives would cost each American consumer $5 to $10 per year. A Federal task force warned about the growing threat of drug-resistant pathogens and the limited treatment options if action is not taken. Scientific studies have shown that resistance traits can be transferred among different bacteria species. Development of resistance to antibiotics could impair the US response to bioterrorist attacks and increase casualties. Preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics like Cipro is crucial to national security and public health. Prohibiting the use of fluoroquinolone drugs in poultry to prevent harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance. The amendment prohibits the use of fluoroquinolone drugs in poultry to prevent harm to human health. It clarifies that the term \"animal feed\" includes fluids administered to animals other than man, excluding those administered via hypodermic injection. SEC. 4 requires proof of safety for new animal drugs. Section 512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include requirements for critical antimicrobial drugs to demonstrate no harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance from nontherapeutic use. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to phase out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics important for human health in animals, specifically critical antimicrobial drugs, within 2 years unless determined safe by the Secretary based on sponsor information. The Secretary, based on sponsor information, must determine within 2 years if there is no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance due to nontherapeutic use of antibiotic drugs in animals. If an exemption is granted for an antibiotic drug, approvals for nontherapeutic use must be rescinded after 2 years, except in certain cases. The Secretary must rescind approvals for nontherapeutic use of antibiotic drugs in animals after 2 years, unless harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated. The Cosmetic Act is amended to define 'nontherapeutic use' and 'critical antimicrobial drug' in relation to animals. 'Nontherapeutic use' includes using critical antimicrobial drugs in animals without disease for purposes like growth promotion. 'Critical antimicrobial drug' refers to drugs intended for animals used for human food or breeding, composed of certain types of antibiotics. The Cosmetic Act is amended to define 'nontherapeutic use' and 'critical antimicrobial drug' in relation to animals, including certain types of antibiotics used for humans or intended for use in humans to inhibit or destroy micro-organisms. SEC. 5. Assistance provided to farmers to phase out nontherapeutic use of medically important antibiotics, with preference for family farms. The Secretary of Agriculture may provide payments to livestock or poultry producers who are reducing nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial drugs. Priority is given to family-owned farms. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose."
