    "content": "Long-term video prediction is a challenging task due to the need to capture spatial and temporal information across multiple frames. Standard recurrent models struggle with error propagation and higher-order correlations. To address this, a convolutional tensor-train LSTM (Conv-TT-LSTM) model is proposed, efficiently incorporating higher-order spatio-temporal information using low-rank tensor representations. This model shows improvements on Moving-MNIST and KTH datasets. Long-term video prediction is a challenging problem in various applications like autonomous driving and action recognition. Prior works focus on next or first few frames prediction due to the complexity of video contents. Many recent video models use Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for better results with fewer parameters. Long-term video prediction is a challenging problem in applications like autonomous driving and action recognition. Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) is commonly used in video models, but struggles with capturing higher-order temporal correlations for long-term prediction. Various approaches have been proposed to enhance ConvLSTM, such as explicitly modeling motion or integrating spatio-temporal interaction. Another direction is to incorporate higher-order RNNs inside each LSTM cell to update the hidden state using multiple past steps. In this work, a novel Convolutional Tensor-Train LSTM (Conv-TT-LSTM) is proposed as a modification of ConvLSTM to address the challenge of capturing higher-order temporal correlations in long-term video prediction. The approach involves Convolutional Tensor-Train Decomposition (CTTD) to factorize large convolutional kernels, allowing for a compact higher-order spatio-temporal model. The Conv-TT-LSTM model factorizes large convolutional kernels into a chain to capture higher-order temporal correlations in long-term video prediction. It outperforms PredRNN++ in LPIPS on Moving-MNIST-2 and KTH action datasets with fewer parameters. Training higher-order tensor models is challenging due to gradient instability, but approaches like good learning schedules and gradient clipping can help overcome this issue. Tensor decompositions like CP, Tucker, and tensor-train are used in machine learning for dimensionality reduction and learning probabilistic models. In deep learning, these decompositions are applied for model compression by factorizing parameter tensors into smaller tensors, used in compressing convolutional, recurrent networks, and transformers. Yang et al. (2017) showed improved accuracy using this technique. Video classification accuracy can be improved by compressing parameters in recurrent networks using tensor-train decomposition. This approach has been extended to higher-order ConvLSTM to encode spatial information in each step. Previous works on video prediction have focused on short-term video prediction, motion and content decomposition, improving objective functions, and handling future diversity. The curr_chunk discusses the use of ConvLSTM in video analysis, with modifications to capture spatio-temporal correlations and integrate 3D convolutions. Self-attention is used to recall historical information efficiently. Byeon et al. applied ConvLSTM in all directions for full context capture in videos. The goal of tensor decomposition is to represent data efficiently. The goal of tensor decomposition is to represent a higher-order tensor as smaller core tensors, reducing parameters while preserving essential information. In this paper, the standard tensor-train decomposition is extended to convolutional tensor-train decomposition (CTTD) for spatio-temporal recurrent models, reducing parameters and operations. Standard Tensor-train decomposition factorizes an m-order tensor into core tensors with tensor-train ranks controlling the number of parameters. This method is commonly used to approximate higher-order tensors with fewer parameters, making it suitable for sequence modeling. The computational complexity of higher-order tensors grows exponentially with the order m, but using a tensor-train format allows for efficient computation with linear growth in space and computational complexities. In neural networks, a convolutional layer is parameterized by a 4th order tensor, with the kernel size and number of channels determining the tensor dimensions. The kernel size K is defined as K = m(k \u2212 1) + 1, where K = 7, m = 3, and k = 3. A convolutional tensor-train decomposition (CTTD) factorizes T into core tensors and ranks that control complexity. This format reduces parameters and can compress higher-order spatio-temporal recurrent models with convolutional operations. The model in Eq. (5) can be computed sequentially without reconstructing the original W (l) 's using tensor-train format. Convolutional LSTM is a basic block for video forecasting models, where spatial information is encoded in LSTM cells. A convolutional tensor-train LSTM is proposed to model multi-step spatio-temporal correlation explicitly. The symbol * denotes convolution between higher-order tensors. Xingjian et al. (2015) extended FC-LSTM to ConvLSTM to model spatio-temporal structures within each recurrent unit. ConvLSTM cells use 4-th order tensors for parameters, replacing matrix multiplications with convolutions between tensors. Conv-TT-LSTM introduces a higher-order recurrent unit to capture multi-step spatio-temporal correlations in LSTM, updating the hidden state based on previous steps with a convolutional tensor-train. This method replaces equations in ConvLSTM with two new equations. Conv-TT-LSTM introduces a higher-order recurrent unit to capture multi-step spatio-temporal correlations in LSTM. It replaces equations in ConvLSTM with two new equations, one involving a fixed window strategy and the other a sliding window strategy for computing tensors. The model architecture for the ConvLSTM or Conv-TT-LSTM includes a stack of 12 layers with varying numbers of channels. Skip connections are added between specific layers, and parameters are initialized using Xavier's normalized initializer. The model architecture for ConvLSTM or Conv-TT-LSTM includes 12 layers with skip connections and parameters initialized by Xavier's normalized initializer. Evaluation metrics include MSE, SSIM, and LPIPS, with models trained using ADAM optimizer and L1 + L2 loss with learning rate decay and scheduled sampling. Scheduled sampling starts after 20 epochs of no improvement in validation loss. The model's sampling ratio decreases linearly from 1 to 0, learning rate decay is activated if loss doesn't drop, hyper-parameter search is done for Conv-TT-LSTM, and gradient clipping is set to 1 for all models. Moving-MNIST-2 dataset involves moving two digits within a black canvas. The Moving-MNIST-2 dataset consists of two digits moving within a black canvas. Videos are generated for training, validation, and testing. Models are trained to predict 10 frames using Conv-TT-LSTM-FW and Conv-TT-LSTM-SW with specific hyperparameters. Performance comparison is shown in MSE, SSIM, and PIPS. Our Conv-TT-LSTM models consistently outperform the 12-layer ConvLSTM baseline for both 10 and 30 frames prediction with fewer parameters. The Conv-TT-LSTMs also outperform previous approaches in terms of SSIM and LPIPS, especially on 30 frames prediction, with less than one fifth of the model parameters. The PredRNN++ model tends to output vague and blurry results in long-term prediction, while our Conv-TT-LSTMs produce sharp and realistic digits. Ablation studies show that our proposed model consistently improves upon ConvLSTM in various settings.

The experimental setup involves training on frames resized to 128x128 pixels and predicting 10 frames given 10 input frames. Training samples are randomly selected from videos and grouped into epochs for training.
