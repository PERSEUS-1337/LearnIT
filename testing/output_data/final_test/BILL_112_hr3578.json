    "content": "The \"Baseline Reform Act of 2012\" may be cited as the short title. Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to address the baseline. The \"Baseline Reform Act of 2012\" amends Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to establish baselines for budget projections annually. It outlines how estimates for direct spending in the baseline should be calculated for the budget year and outyears. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 states that programs with estimated outlays over $50,000,000 will expire in the budget year or outyears. New programs with similar outlays will be scored by the Committees on the Budget or OMB. Consultation will occur between OMB, CBO, and the Committees on the Budget for scoring discrepancies. If a provision of law is suspended and authorizes a program with outlays over $50,000,000, the program will continue to operate upon expiration of the suspension. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 stipulates that programs with estimated outlays exceeding $50,000,000 will expire in the budget year or outyears. Any program operating under a suspended law with outlays over $50,000,000 will continue to operate as before upon the expiration of the suspension. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund's receipts and disbursements be included in all calculations. Discretionary spending for the budget year and outyears will be based on estimated appropriations and current-year appropriations. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandates that current-year appropriations reflect the full fiscal year for accounts with partial continuing appropriations. Baseline calculations for the budget year and outyears must use up-to-date concepts and definitions. Amounts from asset sales are also included in the calculations. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires current-year appropriations to reflect the full fiscal year for accounts with partial continuing appropriations. Amounts from asset sales are included in budget calculations, except if the sale would result in a financial cost to the Government. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL CBO REPORT TO BUDGET COMMITTEES.
