Coal mining in the US has a long history, with gob piles containing materials that contribute to acid mine drainage. These piles also hold potential energy that can be used as an alternative power source, but high costs have hindered investment in the technology. Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) combustion is a clean coal technology that reduces emissions and allows for the use of waste coal as a fuel source. This helps reclaim waste coal sites, improve mine drainage, and utilize coal combustion byproducts. Developing alternate energy sources can lower costs, reduce reliance on foreign oil, and enhance American industry competitiveness. The Act aims to promote alternate fuel sources to meet energy demands, reduce production costs, create new jobs, and protect the environment by utilizing waste coal efficiently. The Act promotes energy production from waste coal to meet demands, reduce costs, create jobs, and protect the environment. The waste coal energy production credit under section 38 is $0.75 per million Btu of heat input used to produce energy from qualified waste coal in an eligible facility. The credit is reduced by grants received for the project. The waste coal energy production credit under section 38 is based on the amount of additions to the capital account for the project for the taxable year and all prior years. Qualified waste coal is defined as coal certified by the Secretary to be waste. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a facility with at least 75% heat input from qualified waste coal, with specific deadlines for certification based on the facility's service date. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a facility with a 15-year supply of qualified waste coal for new facilities or a 10-year supply for existing facilities, as determined by the Secretary for the allowance of the credit under this section. The section outlines the conditions for placing a facility in service to qualify for the credit, including timelines and private letter rulings. A private letter ruling must be requested within 30 days of coal certification to be considered. The section defines heat content, applicable rules, and force majeure events that can suspend performance time requirements. The termination of the credit is outlined, stating no credit will be allowed for an eligible facility. The section outlines the period of applicability for eligible facilities, with a 10-year period for facilities placed in service within 5 years of enactment, and a different period for facilities placed in service after 5 years. The facility must be certified as eligible and the credit can be transferred through sale agreements. The credit is part of the general business credit. The text discusses amendments to the tax code related to waste coal energy production credit, including the denial of double benefits and a clerical amendment to the table of sections. Amendment to tax code for waste coal energy production credit, inserting new item after section 45I. Amendment to tax code allows for energy production from waste coal. Waste coal processing facilities now qualify as exempt facility bonds. Effective date for amendments is after December 31, 2005."
