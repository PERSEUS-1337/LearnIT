    "content": "At the start of the 113th Congress, there is renewed interest in gun control legislation. Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced S. 150, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, which would prohibit the sale, transfer, possession, manufacturing, and importation of certain firearms and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced a similar measure, H.R. 437. S. 150 is comparable to the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. Congress is reviewing gun control measures, including the 1994 law and its relation to federal firearms law. The Gun Control Act of 1968 aims to prevent firearms from reaching individuals who are legally prohibited from possessing them due to age, criminal history, or mental incompetency. It establishes regulations on the manufacture, sale, transfer, and possession of firearms and ammunition, prohibiting certain individuals from owning them, such as those convicted of a felony, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, and aliens. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain individuals from owning firearms and ammunition, including those convicted of a felony, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, and aliens. The Act also imposes significant requirements on the transfer of firearms and ammunition, with specific prohibitions for individuals such as those who have been discharged dishonorably from the Armed Forces, renounced United States citizenship, or convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense. The Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986 repealed many regulations regarding ammunition, resulting in less strict regulation compared to firearms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain individuals from owning firearms and ammunition. It also imposes requirements on firearm transfers, such as the need for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL) to verify transferee identity, conduct background checks using NICS, maintain acquisition records, report multiple handgun sales, and respond to record requests promptly. The Gun Control Act of 1968 imposes requirements on firearm transfers, including background checks by FFLs. Private sellers are exempt but cannot transfer firearms to disqualified persons. Federal law also limits interstate weapon transfers. The Gun Control Act of 1968 imposes restrictions on interstate firearm transfers by FFLs, allowing in-person sales of long guns to qualified individuals regardless of residency, but limiting handgun sales to residents of the dealer's state. FFLs cannot ship firearms directly to consumers in other states and must transfer to a licensed FFL in the buyer's state for background checks before the sale. The Gun Control Act of 1968 regulates interstate firearm transfers by FFLs, allowing in-person sales of long guns to qualified individuals regardless of residency. Non-FFL sellers are prohibited from directly selling firearms to out-of-state residents, requiring the transfer to go through an FFL in the buyer's state. The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Act of 1994, known as the Assault Weapons Ban, imposed a 10-year prohibition on semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices, with exceptions like a grandfather clause for possession. The Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, defined assault weapons as military-style firearms capable of semiautomatic or fully automatic fire. Fully automatic firearms are classified as machine guns under federal law, while semiautomatic assault weapons only have semiautomatic fire capability. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban prohibited the manufacture, transfer, or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. It defined banned weapons by specific make or model and characteristics, and required LCAFDs to have markings showing they were manufactured after the date of the act. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban included a grandfather clause allowing the transfer of certain firearms lawfully possessed before the enactment date. Congress exempted around 650 types of firearms for sporting purposes. The ban did not apply to manually operated firearms, permanently inoperable guns, antique firearms, or semiautomatic rifles without detachable magazines. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban included exemptions for certain firearms, such as semiautomatic rifles and shotguns with limited magazine capacity, for law enforcement and testing purposes. It did not address the importation of semiautomatic assault weapons, which required authorization from the Attorney General under the Gun Control Act. The Gun Control Act requires authorization from the Attorney General for the importation of firearms not meeting the sporting purposes test. The ATF identified semiautomatic assault rifles that did not meet this standard before the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. The ATF prohibited the importation of certain rifles in 1989 due to their similarities to military assault rifles. Foreign manufacturers tried to bypass the ban by reconfiguring their weapons. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban partially addressed this issue, but in 1997, ATF further restricted the importation of certain semiautomatic assault rifles. In 1989, certain rifles were banned from importation by the ATF for resembling military assault rifles. Attempts were made to modify them to meet importation criteria. The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, S. 150, introduced regulations for \"semiautomatic assault weapons,\" banning specific firearms and defining them based on features like detachable magazines. The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, S. 150, defines \"semiautomatic assault weapons\" based on specific features and prohibits their importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, and possession. The bill includes exemptions for certain hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns, requires safe storage, and mandates background checks for transfers. The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 prohibits the importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, and possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. It includes exemptions for certain hunting and sporting firearms, requires safe storage, and mandates background checks for transfers. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban faced constitutional challenges, including claims related to the Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court in United States v. Lopez clarified Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, identifying three categories of activity it may regulate. The Court found that possession of a gun in a school zone did not fall under interstate commerce, limiting Congress's regulatory power to activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. The Supreme Court in United States v. Lopez limited Congress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause to activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. The Court found that the School Zone Act did not fall under this category as it was not part of a larger regulatory scheme for economic activity. Lower courts applied the Lopez framework to evaluate Commerce Clause challenges to the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. The Lopez decision established minimum constitutional requirements under the Commerce Clause. Lower courts, like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Navegar, Inc. v. United States, determined that the Assault Weapons Ban fell within the category of activities with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The D.C. Circuit analyzed the act's prohibitions on manufacture, transfer, and possession, stating that even goods manufactured within a state can still substantially affect interstate commerce. The court in Navegar v. United States held that the manufacture and transfer of 'semiautomatic assault weapons' for a national market can be regulated as activity substantially affecting interstate commerce. However, the question of whether mere possession of such weapons can substantially affect interstate commerce was raised following the Lopez decision. The court analyzed the purposes behind the act to determine if it aimed at regulating activities with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The court in Navegar v. United States held that the ban on possession of 'semiautomatic assault weapons' was aimed at regulating activities with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The D.C. Circuit stated that the ban on possession was necessary for law enforcement to effectively regulate the manufacture and transfers of these weapons. The court determined that the purpose of the ban on possession had an evident commercial nexus. The Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 faced challenges on Equal Protection Clause grounds, questioning its prohibition of certain semiautomatic assault weapons. Courts use different levels of scrutiny to analyze laws impacting suspect classes or fundamental rights, with strict scrutiny requiring a compelling governmental interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the provisions of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, stating that the law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court noted that while the Equal Protection Clause typically protects against inappropriate classifications of people, it can also apply to things. The Sixth Circuit upheld the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, stating that it meets equal protection requirements by targeting commonly used firearms in violent crimes and preventing manufacturers from circumventing the law. Exempted weapons were determined to be suited for sporting purposes. The Sixth Circuit upheld the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, stating that it was rational for Congress to ban weapons commonly used for criminal purposes while exempting those used for recreational purposes. The court also found that prohibiting weapons with two or more qualifying features was justified as each characteristic made the weapon potentially more dangerous and not commonly used for hunting. The Sixth Circuit upheld the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, stating that Congress could have determined that the more dangerous add-ons on a semi-automatic weapon, the greater the likelihood of it being used for dangerous purposes. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to show that the ban violated equal protection, as gun retailers and owners are not a suspect class and there is no recognized fundamental right to individual weapon ownership. The Second Amendment's full scope is yet to be determined by courts, including whether assault weapons are protected. An assault weapons ban could be challenged on Second Amendment grounds, as seen in District of Columbia v. Heller, where the Court recognized an individual right to bear arms for lawful purposes. The right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. The Court in District of Columbia v. Heller recognized an individual right to bear arms for lawful purposes, but this right is not unlimited. The Second Amendment does not protect weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. The historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of 'dangerous and unusual weapons' is supported by the sorts of weapons protected being those 'in common use at the time'. Cases evaluating state assault weapons bans have generally found them to be valid under the Second Amendment. In 2009, the California Court of Appeals ruled in People v. James that possession of assault weapons in California is unlawful and not protected by the Second Amendment. California's Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act defines \"assault weapons\" based on specific characteristics that make them more dangerous than ordinary weapons. The court stated that these prohibited weapons are not typically used for lawful purposes like sport hunting or self-defense, but are considered weapons of war. The California Court of Appeals ruled in People v. James that possession of assault weapons in California is unlawful and not protected by the Second Amendment. The court stated that these prohibited weapons are not typically used for lawful purposes like sport hunting or self-defense, but are considered weapons of war. The District of Columbia amended its firearms regulations after the Heller decision and enacted new firearms regulations including an assault weapons ban similar to California's. In 2011, the D.C. Circuit upheld the District's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles and LCAFDs in Heller II. The court acknowledged that certain semi-automatic rifles and magazines holding more than 10 rounds are indeed in 'common use,' but could not definitively conclude whether they are commonly used or useful. The court analyzed the bans on assault weapons under a two-stepped approach to determine their validity under the Second Amendment. If a provision impinges on a right protected by the Second Amendment, it is then reviewed under the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny. The court found that such regulations should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny because they do not effectively disarm individuals or substantially affect their ability to defend. The D.C. Circuit held that a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles and LCAFDs is likely to promote the government's interest in crime control. In 2012, the Supreme Court of Illinois evaluated the constitutionality of the Blair Holt Assault Weapons Ban of Cook County, finding that it did not violate Due Process and Equal Protection. The court upheld the Assault Weapons Ban, dismissing claims of violation of Due Process, Equal Protection, and the Second Amendment. The ordinance was deemed not unconstitutionally vague and did not arbitrarily differentiate between firearm owners. The court indicated it would follow a two-step approach similar to a previous court ruling. The court remanded the Second Amendment claim regarding assault weapons bans for further proceedings, citing the need for evidence to justify the ordinance's nexus with governmental interests. Courts have looked to the Heller decision and lower court frameworks for analyzing Second Amendment claims in similar cases. The Second Amendment protection for certain weapons is determined by whether they are in \"common use\" for lawful purposes or \"dangerous and unusual.\" If prohibited weapons do not meet these criteria, they may not be protected. Courts may apply heightened scrutiny to evaluate bans on certain weapons and firearm accessories. The connection between the \"common use\" and \"dangerous and unusual\" criteria in relation to the constitutionality of a ban under the Second Amendment remains unclear. The Wilson case highlights that constitutional claims under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses may still be raised by challengers despite being largely dismissed during the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban."
