    "content": "The \"Family Life Education Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that various medical associations support comprehensive sexuality education that includes information on abstinence and contraception to prevent teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other STDs. Research shows that comprehensive sexuality education, including contraception discussion, helps teenagers delay sexual activity and use contraceptives. These programs respect diverse values and beliefs, providing accurate information on puberty, marriage age, contraception, STD/HIV prevention, and abstinence for American teens. Teen pregnancy rates are decreasing but still nearly 900,000 teen pregnancies occur each year, with 80% being unintended. Improved contraceptive use contributed to 75% of the decrease in teen pregnancy between 1988 and 1995, while increased abstinence accounted for 25%. Over 80% of Americans believe young people should have information on protecting themselves from unplanned pregnancies and STDs. US teens acquire around 4,000,000 sexually transmitted infections annually, with at least one in three sexually active individuals contracting an STD by age 24. Young people in the United States are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, with African Americans and Hispanic youth being most impacted. Despite making up less than 16% of the adolescent population, nearly 50% of AIDS cases among 13- to 19-year olds were among African Americans. Hispanics, comprising 13% of the population, accounted for 20% of reported adolescent AIDS cases. Assistance is provided to reduce teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases, and to support healthy adolescent development. Each eligible State is entitled to receive a grant for family life education programs on abstinence and contraception to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The program must be age-appropriate, medically accurate, non-religious, emphasize abstinence as the best prevention method, and provide information on health benefits. The family life education program includes information on contraceptives, barrier methods, and the health benefits of preventing pregnancy and reducing the risk of STDs. It also promotes family communication about sexuality, teaches decision-making skills, and educates on the effects of alcohol and drug use on responsible decision-making. The State can use a grant for family life education to conduct activities that help young people gain knowledge about adolescence, sexual health, male responsibility in decision-making, and develop healthy attitudes towards various subjects. The grant for family life education aims to promote healthy life skills, self-esteem, interpersonal skills, and prepare young people for adult life through education and career success. Congress encourages states to provide matching funds for programs, but it is not mandatory. Additionally, programs will be evaluated. The effectiveness of family life education programs funded under section 3 will be evaluated nationally to determine their impact on delaying sexual initiation and preventing adolescent pregnancy. States are encouraged to provide matching funds for these programs, but it is not mandatory. The national evaluation of family life education programs funded under section 3 will assess their effectiveness in preventing adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, increasing contraceptive knowledge and behaviors, and identify best practices. A report on the evaluation results must be submitted to Congress by March 31, 2008, with yearly interim reports. Individual state evaluations are also required for grant receipt. The State must agree to evaluate family education programs funded under section 3 to determine their effectiveness in delaying sexual initiation, preventing adolescent pregnancy, and reducing sexually transmitted diseases. The evaluation must be conducted by an external, independent entity. The State must agree to evaluate family education programs funded under section 3 to determine their effectiveness in preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and increasing contraceptive knowledge and behaviors. Additionally, not more than 10 percent of the grant can be used for evaluation purposes. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.
