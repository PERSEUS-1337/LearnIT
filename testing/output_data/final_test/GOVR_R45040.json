    "content": "The United States distinguishes between temporary migration and settlement migration through the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Immigrants are admitted on a permanent basis as lawful permanent residents (LPRs), while nonimmigrants are admitted temporarily for specific purposes. Nonimmigrants include tourists, students, diplomats, agricultural workers, entertainers, and business personnel. Discussions about nonimmigrant admissions vary based on visa classes. The entry of nonimmigrants into the United States raises economic, cultural, and national security concerns. Temporary migrants such as tourists, students, and workers are viewed differently in terms of their impact on the economy. Cultural exchange programs aim to promote American values but face scrutiny for lack of protections. National security worries arise, especially with the Visa Waiver Program. Debates persist on tracking the exits of foreign nationals to address unauthorized stays. Achieving a balanced policy is crucial. Achieving a balanced policy is crucial as policymakers navigate the challenges of national security, trade, fair labor practices, public health, and international cooperation in managing nonimmigrant admissions to the United States. The report provides an overview of statutory and regulatory provisions governing nonimmigrant visas, trends in temporary migration, and estimates of nonimmigrants who establish residence or overstay their authorized period of admission. The report discusses key admissions requirements for nonimmigrant visas, with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Labor playing key roles in administration. Foreign nationals apply for visas at U.S. embassies or consulates, while DHS agencies handle admission procedures on U.S. soil. This includes Customs and Border Protection determining admission at ports of entry and USCIS handling applications for extending or changing nonimmigrant status. The process of obtaining a nonimmigrant visa involves employers submitting applications to the Department of Labor, who then petition USCIS on behalf of the worker. The Department of State conducts interviews and issues visas if requirements are met. The burden of proof lies with the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and the specific visa type. The duration of a visa includes how long the individual can stay in the U.S. and the validity period for entry. Nonimmigrant visas have specific lengths of stay, such as A-1 ambassadors for the duration of their service and F-1 students for the duration of their studies. Overstays occur when individuals remain past their lawful admission period. Visa validity periods determine the time a visa is valid for travel. The validity period of visas is negotiated country-by-country and category-by-category. For example, a B visitor visa from Germany is valid for 10 years, while a B visa from Indonesia is valid for five years. DOS publishes updates to reciprocity agreements affecting visa classes. Nonimmigrants in the United States, except for certain visa holders like A, G, and L visa holders, are generally not allowed to work. Working without authorization is illegal and can result in the termination of nonimmigrant status. Labor market tests are required for employers petitioning for workers under various visa classes, including H, E-3, and D visas. Employers must demonstrate that there are not enough qualified U.S. workers available and that hiring foreign workers will not negatively impact wages or working conditions. Employers must offer wages at specified levels and meet requirements for H-1 and E-3 workers. The labor market test, known as labor attestation, is required for these nonimmigrants. Employers must attest to paying the nonimmigrant the prevailing compensation, providing suitable working conditions, and ensuring no strike or lockout. The D visa is for crewmembers on sea vessels or airlines but typically does not allow longshore work. Employers requesting authorization for a D visa holder to perform longshore work must confirm prevailing practice, no strike or lockout, and notice to U.S. workers. No labor market tests for other employment-related visas. Consular officers, CBP inspectors, and USCIS adjudicators must ensure the alien is not ineligible under INA \u00a7212(a) grounds. These include health, criminal history, security, and terrorist concerns. The law provides grounds for ineligibility for nonimmigrants, including health, criminal history, security, and terrorist concerns. Waivers are available for some grounds on a case-by-case basis, except for security and terrorist-related grounds. Most foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas must prove they are not coming to settle permanently, with the \u00a7214(b) presumption being a common reason for visa rejections. Nonimmigrant visa holders can seek LPR status with three specific visas: H-1B, L, and V visas. Violating visa terms or overstaying can lead to removal. Nonimmigrant status can be terminated for various reasons, including national security or criminal convictions. Nonimmigrant visas encompass various categories with specific types for derivatives like spouses and children. Each visa type includes details on length of stay, employment authorization, and numerical limits. A visas are for foreign government officials and their families. Nonimmigrant visas in the United States include A visas for foreign government officials and their families, G visas for international organization representatives, and NATO visas for those under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. B-1 visas are for business visitors, while B-2 visas are for tourists. Business visitors must receive their salary from abroad and maintain a foreign residence. Tourists visiting the United States on a B-2 visa for pleasure activities like vacationing or seeking medical treatment. B visa holders are not allowed to work and can stay for up to six months. Some visitors enter through the Visa Waiver Program. The Visa Waiver Program allows visitors from certain countries to enter the US without a visa for up to 90 days. Canadian and Bermudian citizens can also visit for business or tourism without a visa. Mexican citizens can obtain a border crossing card (BCC) for short-term entry to the US border zone for business or tourism, valid for 10 years with multiple entries. The BCC holder is limited to visits of up to 30 days within designated border zones in Texas. The BCC holder is limited to visits of up to 30 days within designated border zones in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. The H-1 category includes workers in specialty occupations, with numerical restrictions on the number of visas issued annually. H-1B visa holders must have a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. Most H-1B workers are exempt from the annual visa cap, with exemptions for visa renewals or workers petitioned by certain institutions. Agricultural workers enter on H-2A visas, while nonagricultural workers enter on H-2B visas. The H-2A visa is for agricultural workers, while the H-2B visa is for nonagricultural workers. The H-3 visa is for job-related training, and the E-3 visa is for Australian citizens in specialty occupations. TN visas are for Canadian and Mexican professionals under NAFTA. TN visas are approved for professionals under NAFTA to work in prearranged business activities for U.S. or foreign employers. O visas are for individuals with extraordinary ability in various fields, while P visas are for internationally recognized athletes, entertainers, and performers. Foreign nationals can enter the US on I visas to work for foreign media companies, R visas for religious vocations, and Q visas for cultural exchange programs. Q visas require USCIS approval and employers must petition for nonimmigrants under this program. Additionally, a transitional worker visa category exists for foreign workers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The CW visa program in the CNMI allows employers to hire nonimmigrant workers ineligible for other visas. It is set to end on December 31, 2019, requiring foreign workers to find alternative immigration status. L visas are for international intracompany transferees in executive or managerial roles, allowing them to work in the US for five to seven years. To be eligible for an L-1 visa, a foreign national must have worked for a multinational firm abroad for one year before transferring to a U.S. location. Treaty traders and investors can enter the U.S. on E-1 or E-2 visas if they are citizens of a treaty country and engage in substantial trade or direct operations of an enterprise with a substantial investment. The E visa can be renewed indefinitely, and the E-2C visa is specifically for treaty traders in the CNMI. The E-2C visa is for treaty traders in the CNMI only, while the J visa, known as the Fulbright program, is for various exchange visitor programs approved by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. J visa holders participate in cultural exchange programs in fields like education, arts, and science, and may be required to return to their home country after completion. Foreign nationals on J-1 visas can work as part of their program, with F-1 visas being common for foreign students. The F-1 visa is the most common visa for foreign students entering the U.S. It is tailored for international students pursuing full-time academic education or language training. To obtain an F-1 visa, students must be accepted by a U.S. government-approved school, show sufficient funds to cover expenses, demonstrate scholastic preparation, and have knowledge of English. F-1 visa holders can work in practical training related to their degree program and engage in Optional Practical Training. Students on F-1 visas can work in practical training related to their degree program and engage in Optional Practical Training (OPT). Those pursuing non-academic courses apply for M visas and must show acceptance by an approved school, financial means, scholastic preparation, and language skills. Canadian and Mexican nationals commute on F-3 or M-3 visas and can work in practical training related to their degree program. Fianc\u00e9(e)s of U.S. citizens may obtain K-1 visas after demonstrating legal eligibility to marry. After demonstrating legal eligibility to marry, the fianc\u00e9(e) of a U.S. citizen can obtain a K-1 visa. The couple must marry within 90 days of the visa holder's admission to the U.S. Eligible children can immigrate under a K-2 visa. Spouses already married to U.S. citizens can apply for K-3 visas, allowing them to enter the U.S. and work while waiting for their immigrant petitions to be processed. V visas are similar to K-3 and K-4 visas but for LPR sponsors. No new V visas have been issued since 2007. S, T, U, and C visas are for informants, human trafficking victims, crime victims, and foreign nationals in transit, respectively. The D visa is for alien crew members on vessels or aircraft traveling to the United States. Data on nonimmigrant visa issuances and admissions are collected by DOS and CBP, respectively. CBP admissions data come from I-94 forms, counting arrivals multiple times. Nonimmigrant admissions data are collected through I-94 forms, but arrivals of Mexican and Canadian nationals with border crossing cards or traveling for business/tourism are not reflected. This leads to less than half of nonimmigrant admissions being included in the totals. Departure data for nonimmigrants is incomplete due to the lack of a comprehensive exit system, making it difficult to accurately count nonimmigrants in the country. However, recent improvements in data sharing have allowed for estimates of nonimmigrant populations. In FY2016, DHS produced estimates of nonimmigrants residing in the US and overstay rates for those who entered at air or sea ports. Visa issuance data shows a decrease in nonimmigrant visas issued by DOS consular officers, with visitor visas for tourism and business being the largest category. Temporary workers received 8.5% of all nonimmigrant visas issued. In FY2016, temporary workers received 8.5% of all nonimmigrant visas issued, with a 61% increase in visa issuances from FY2007 to FY2016. Despite a steady increase in visas issued until FY2015, there was a 5% decline in issuances from FY2015 to FY2016. Tourist and business visitor visas saw a 78% increase over the decade but also experienced a 5% drop from FY2015 to FY2016. The number of visas issued for temporary workers saw a sharp drop from FY2008 to FY2009, coinciding with the start of the Great Recession. Visas issued to diplomats and other representatives remained steady over the decade. Visas for temporary workers and students have seen significant increases since FY2009, with a 38% and 55% growth rate, respectively. However, there was a 25% drop in student visas from FY2015 to FY2016, mainly due to a decrease in F-1 visas issued to applicants from mainland China. During FY2015, CBP inspectors granted 181.3 million nonimmigrant admissions to the United States, with Mexican and Canadian nationals accounting for over half of these admissions. Total I-94 admissions more than doubled between FY2006 and FY2015. Mexico, Brazil, and India also saw steep drops in F-1 visas issued from FY2015 to FY2016. In FY2015, CBP granted 181.3 million nonimmigrant admissions to the US, with tourists and business visitors dominating the data. Over three-quarters were tourists, 10.4% were business visitors, and other categories included temporary workers, students, cultural exchange visitors, and diplomats. The number of Visa Waiver Program admissions has steadily increased since FY2009. The share of visitor admissions from the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) dropped from 53.2% in FY2006 to 32.5% in FY2015, with an increase in admissions from Asia. Temporary workers saw a 118% increase in admissions from FY2006 to FY2015, second only to student admissions which grew by 169%. Admissions of diplomats and exchange visitors also increased. Foreign nationals from Asia accounted for 45.3% of the 10.4 million nonimmigrant visas issued in FY2016. In FY2016, Asia accounted for 45.3% of the 10.4 million nonimmigrant visas issued, with 4.7 million visas. North America followed with 2.1 million visas, South America with 1.8 million, Europe with 1.2 million, Africa with half a million, and Oceania with less than 70,000 visas. Over the past decade, visas issued to Asian nationals increased by 78%, while South American visas also increased by 78% and African visas doubled. In FY2016, visas issued to South American and African nationals doubled and increased by 78% respectively. However, visa issuances to Asian and South American nationals decreased during this time. Chinese nationals saw a significant drop in B and F-1 visas in FY2016 compared to FY2015. Foreign nationals from Brazil contributed to the decrease in business and tourist visitor visas for South America. Citizens of North American countries accounted for almost half of I-94 nonimmigrant admissions in FY2015. In FY2015, European nationals accounted for 22.6% of nonimmigrant admissions, followed by Asian nationals at 18.3%. South American, Oceania, and African nationals each made up less than 10% of admissions. European countries in the Visa Waiver Program and proximity to the US explain the high admission rate. Asian nationals held 45.9% of visas issued but comprised 18.3% of admissions, possibly due to fewer VWP countries and distance from the US. Figure 10 shows the region of citizenship for I-94 admissions into the United States from FY2006 to FY2015. North American admissions saw a significant increase due to changes in data collection procedures, while admissions from South America and Africa had the fastest growth rates. European admissions grew the slowest, followed by Asian and Oceania admissions. In FY2015, nonimmigrant admissions to the United States saw significant growth, with California and Florida being the top destination states. Over 90% of these admissions were tourists and business travelers. States like Hawaii, Nevada, and Guam were primarily tourist destinations, while Massachusetts attracted a higher share of students and exchange visitors. In FY2015, Michigan and New Jersey received a disproportionate share of temporary workers compared to the national average. The District of Columbia had the highest share of nonimmigrant admissions classified as diplomats. Some nonimmigrant visas allow for longer stays, allowing individuals to establish residence in the United States. The most recent DHS estimates for FY2014 show that the resident nonimmigrant population in the United States was 1.7 million, with temporary workers and their families making up 45.6%, students and their families 38.7%, cultural exchange visitors and their families 11.6%, and diplomats and other representatives and their families 4.0%. The majority were males (57%) and ages 25 to 44 (50%). Foreign nationals from Asia accounted for 56% of resident nonimmigrants, with India and China being the top countries at 24% and 14% respectively. Europe and North America comprised 14% and 13% of the total. The U.S. immigration system is divided into temporary and permanent admissions. About half of those receiving lawful permanent residence each year adjust from another status within the United States, while the other half are new arrivals. Most foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas must show they are not coming to reside permanently. Three nonimmigrant visas allow holders to seek LPR status simultaneously. The connections between temporary and permanent immigration systems impact employment- and family-based immigration. Many individuals receiving employment-based LPR status adjust from another status, often from H-1B or L visa holders. The H-1B visa can lead foreign students to become employment-based LPRs. Some policymakers support a pathway for foreign students to transition from F-1 visa to H-1B visa to permanent residence, while others view it as an abuse of the system to displace U.S. workers. There are proposals to exempt Ph.D. holders in STEM fields from numerical limits on visas and green cards. Additionally, there are suggestions to restrict foreign students from gaining U.S. employment through the OPT program. In FY2014, USCIS reported an increase in F-1 foreign students approved for OPT, with 136,617 students approved. F-1 students with pending H-1B petitions can extend their F-1 status and employment authorization. DHS has made progress in identifying and quantifying overstays, issuing reports in 2016 and 2017 on the topic. According to the 2017 report, an estimated 1.47% of nonimmigrants entering the US through air or sea ports in FY2016 were overstays, totaling 739,478 individuals. Immigration scholars have used estimation techniques to study the overstay population due to historical lack of departure data. Reports show that from 2007 to 2014, more aliens became unauthorized by overstaying visas than by entering without inspection. In 2014, 42% of the 11 million unauthorized aliens in the US arrived legally and overstayed their visas."
