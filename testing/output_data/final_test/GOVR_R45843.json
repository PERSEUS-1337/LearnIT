    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a 2017 Washington Supreme Court decision defending a right-to-travel provision in an 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama tribe against a state attempt to impose a motor fuels tax on a Yakama member. The treaty guaranteed the Yakamas the \"right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\" Cougar Den, Inc., a business owned by a Yakama member, was exempt from paying a Washington State motor fuels tax on gasoline it transported and resold, impacting the interpretation of similar treaty provisions. The Supreme Court decision in Cougar Den upheld a state tax exemption for a Yakama member based on an 1855 treaty right-to-travel provision, impacting state taxation of off-reservation activities by Indian tribes. The ruling in Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones established that states can tax such activities unless federal law exempts them. Cougar Den clarified that tribal retailers selling goods to non-Indians off-reservation are subject to state law unless expressly exempted by federal law. The difficulty of collecting taxes on tribal retailers selling goods to non-Indians on Indian reservations is highlighted, with tribal sovereign immunity posing a challenge for states. Court cases like Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation have addressed the issue, with varying outcomes on state tax enforcement against tribes. Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma also discussed the states' rights to levy taxes on tribal sales. The Supreme Court suggested states could tax wholesalers, negotiate agreements with tribes for tax collection, or seek congressional legislation for tax remittance. In Washington, all tribes except the Yakamas had fuel tax agreements. The case of Cougar Den questioned if the 1855 Yakama Treaty prohibited a fuel tax on Yakama members' importation activities. The 1855 Yakama Treaty grants tribal members the right to travel off-reservation, including on public highways. Special canons of construction apply when interpreting Indian treaties, with courts required to consider how the terms would have been understood by the parties involved. The 1855 Yakama Treaty grants tribal members the right to travel off-reservation, including on public highways. The Supreme Court has stated that any doubtful expressions in treaties should be resolved in the Indians' favor. In a case involving the State of Washington and Cougar Den, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the State could not enforce its motor fuels tax against Yakama tribal members as it would infringe on the Tribe's treaty-protected right to travel. Specifically, the court found that Cougar Den could not import fuel without using the highway. The majority's view in the Cougar Den case held that the motor fuels tax burdened tribal members' use of highways, violating the 1855 Yakama Treaty. They relied on Ninth Circuit precedent that restricted the right to travel. The dissenting justices interpreted the precedent differently. The dissenting state court justices disagreed with the Ninth Circuit precedent, arguing that the fuel tax targeted trade, not travel itself. Washington appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted review in June 2018. The parties debated the interpretation of the 1855 Yakama Treaty, with Cougar Den asserting the right to transport goods without restriction, while Washington emphasized the absence of tax mention in the treaty's right-to-travel provision. The Supreme Court affirmed the Washington Supreme Court's decision, prohibiting the state from imposing its motor fuels tax on Cougar Den, a tribe member. The Court's 5-4 vote did not yield a majority opinion, with Justices Sotomayor and Kagan joining Justice Breyer's opinion highlighting the treaty's disadvantageous language for the Yakamas. Justice Breyer argued that the motor fuels tax imposed by Washington directly burdened Cougar Den's ability to travel with goods for trade, violating the 1855 Yakama Treaty. He also stated that the tax specifically burdened the type of travel the Yakamas had negotiated to protect: travel by public highway. Justices Gorsuch and Ginsburg supported the Yakamas' right to travel on public highways without being subject to licensing or permitting fees for transporting tribal goods, based on historical evidence. The Court's decision on the fuel tax's violation of the 1855 Yakama Treaty leaves uncertainty on how federal and state courts will interpret the issue. The Court's decision in Cougar Den raises questions on how federal and state courts will interpret treaty rights. Justice Gorsuch's opinion, supported by historical evidence, suggests that similar terms in other treaties could be interpreted differently based on tribal understanding. Chief Justice Roberts dissented, arguing that state laws affecting treaty rights may not necessarily burden those rights. The Court's decision in Cougar Den prompted concerns about the applicability of state laws on tribal treaty rights, particularly regarding possession of drugs or firearms on public highways. The case also raised questions about state tax enforcement on Indian tribes, with Washington assessing $3.6 million in taxes against Cougar Den. Similar right-to-travel provisions exist in treaties with other tribes. The Cougar Den decision raised concerns about state laws affecting tribal treaty rights, especially regarding possession of drugs or firearms on public highways. It also questioned state tax enforcement on Indian tribes, with Washington imposing $3.6 million in taxes on Cougar Den. Similar treaties with other tribes could lead to challenges to state taxing authority over tribe members, with Congress having the power to limit or eliminate treaty-granted rights. The case may also prompt reflection on differences between state and federal tax exemptions for tribes. The Ninth Circuit has held that tribal treaty rights must be explicit to exempt from federal taxes. The Yakama tribe is not currently exempt from federal taxes. In Herrera v. Wyoming, the Supreme Court reaffirmed Crow Tribe's treaty rights to hunt on unoccupied lands. This decision overturned a previous ruling. The Supreme Court overturned its 1896 ruling in Ward v. Race Horse in Herrera v. Wyoming, reaffirming Crow Tribe's treaty rights to hunt on unoccupied lands. This decision resolved tension with previous rulings and undermined cases relying on Race Horse. The Supreme Court reversed Wyoming state court decisions that denied the Crow Tribe's treaty hunting rights. The petitioner, a Crow Tribe member, hunted elk in Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest, citing subsistence hunting rights protected by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. According to Herrera, the 1868 Treaty provided him with hunting rights in the Bighorn National Forest, but Wyoming disagreed, claiming the treaty was no longer valid. The trial court sided with Wyoming based on a previous Tenth Circuit decision. The establishment of the Bighorn National Forest in 1897 rendered the lands \"occupied\" and no longer subject to access rights granted to Crow tribal members by the 1868 Treaty. Herrera sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court after being convicted and denied appeal in a higher Wyoming state court. The key issue in Herrera was the effect of statehood on treaties between the United States and Indian tribes within a newly acceded state's boundaries. The Supreme Court decision in Race Horse held that legislative action admitting a state to the Union abrogated earlier treaties conferring tribal rights to nonreservation lands within the state's territory. This was based on the equal footing doctrine, which states that newly admitted states must have sovereignty equal to existing states. The Court reasoned that Wyoming's admission to the Union impliedly abrogated a hunting right in a Shoshone-Bannock treaty, as it would limit Wyoming's power to regulate game compared to other states. The Supreme Court decision in Race Horse concluded that Wyoming's statehood abrogated a hunting right in a Shoshone-Bannock treaty due to the equal footing doctrine. The Court also suggested that the treaty's promise was temporary and limited. In a later case, United States v. Winans, tribal fishing rights under the Yakama Treaty were upheld despite Washington's statehood. The Winans Court upheld tribal fishing rights under the Yakama Treaty despite Washington's statehood, stating that Congress had the power to reserve fishing rights for tribes on nonreservation land. This decision did not explicitly overrule Race Horse's holding, which abrogated a hunting right in a Shoshone-Bannock treaty due to Wyoming's statehood. The Tenth Circuit ruled against the Crow Tribe in a case involving hunting rights in the Bighorn National Forest, citing the Race Horse decision which abrogated treaty rights due to statehood. The court emphasized that the treaty granted only \"temporary and precarious\" rights, not intended to be binding on a later-created state. The Supreme Court in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians rejected the reasoning of the Race Horse decision regarding treaty rights. The Court emphasized that Congress must clearly express its intent to abrogate Indian treaty rights, and since there was no clear evidence of intent in this case, the tribal fishing rights were not abrogated. Treaty rights are not impliedly terminated upon statehood. The Supreme Court in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians upheld treaty rights, stating that they are not terminated upon statehood. The Court did not expressly overrule the Race Horse decision, but there was disagreement on its impact in the Herrera case. Herrera argued that Mille Lacs supported the Tribe's treaty hunting rights, while Wyoming believed Race Horse still applied, recognizing treaty rights as temporary. The Supreme Court in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians upheld treaty rights, stating that they are not terminated upon statehood. Wyoming argued that Race Horse decision still applied, recognizing treaty rights as temporary. However, the Court rejected Wyoming's arguments by a 5-4 vote, with Justice Sotomayor writing for the majority, stating that Mille Lacs had undermined Race Horse's reasoning on treaty termination analysis. The Supreme Court's analysis in Mille Lacs focused on whether Congress had expressly abrogated an Indian treaty right or if a termination point in the treaty had been met. Statehood is irrelevant unless Congress clearly intended to end a treaty or if statehood is mentioned in the treaty itself. In Herrera's case, the Court found no evidence in the Wyoming Statehood Act or the treaty itself that Congress intended to end the Crow Tribe's hunting rights at statehood. The Supreme Court focused on issue preclusion in Herrera's case, as Wyoming argued that the question of Crow Tribe's hunting rights had already been decided in a previous case. Herrera and the United States argued that preclusion should not apply due to an intervening change in the law, but Wyoming disagreed. The Supreme Court rejected Wyoming's argument for issue preclusion in Herrera's case, citing the Mille Lacs decision as a \"change in law\" that justified an exception to preclusion. Wyoming contended that the Tenth Circuit's finding in Repsis regarding the temporary nature of the 1868 Treaty rights should preclude relitigation, but the Court disagreed, stating that a repudiated decision does not retain preclusive force. The Supreme Court rejected Wyoming's argument for issue preclusion in Herrera's case, stating that a repudiated decision does not retain preclusive force. The Court then needed to determine if the Bighorn National Forest should be considered \"unoccupied\" land under the terms of the 1868 Treaty, with Wyoming arguing that the establishment of the national forest constituted occupation by the federal government. The Supreme Court analyzed the 1868 Treaty to determine if the Bighorn National Forest should be considered \"unoccupied\" land. Herrera argued that \"occupied\" meant physical settlement by non-Indians, while the United States agreed. The Court concluded that the Crow Tribe would have understood \"unoccupied\" to mean free of non-Indian residence or settlement. The Supreme Court analyzed the 1868 Treaty to determine if the Bighorn National Forest should be considered \"unoccupied\" land. The Court concluded that the Crow Tribe would have understood \"unoccupied\" to mean free of non-Indian residence or settlement. President Cleveland's proclamation creating Bighorn National Forest did not 'occupy' that area within the treaty's meaning, but instead 'reserved' the lands 'from entry or settlement.' The majority opinion in Herrera noted that its scope was limited in two distinct ways. The Supreme Court declined to consider arguments that Wyoming could regulate hunting rights for conservation purposes, leaving open a potential avenue for Wyoming to limit tribal hunting rights. Justice Alito's dissent, joined by three other Justices, argued that the 1868 Treaty's hunting right is no longer in force, preventing any Tribe member from asserting that right. The dissent in the case argued that Herrera had no right to relitigate an issue already settled by a court, giving preclusive effect to a previous legal conclusion. Congress retains the authority to govern interactions with Indian tribes, including the ability to disavow or reaffirm provisions of the 1868 Treaty. Congress has the authority to disavow or reaffirm provisions of the 1868 Treaty, including clarifying the treatment of national forests for Indian treaty rights. In Carpenter v. Murphy, the Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving the conviction of a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation for murder within tribal boundaries. The Supreme Court is reviewing Carpenter v. Murphy, a case involving a murder conviction within the Muscogee (Creek) reservation boundaries. The Tenth Circuit ruled the crime occurred on reservation land, questioning Oklahoma's jurisdiction. The case could redefine \"Indian country\" under federal law, impacting Oklahoma's criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by Indians on such land. The Supreme Court is reviewing Carpenter v. Murphy, a case involving a murder conviction within the Muscogee (Creek) reservation boundaries. The Tenth Circuit ruled the crime occurred on reservation land, questioning Oklahoma's jurisdiction. The case could prompt additional litigation concerning the status of other tribal lands within Oklahoma. The parties have asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the land historically designated as belonging to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation constitutes \"Indian country,\" and if so, whether Oklahoma has criminal jurisdiction over crimes like Murphy's. Federal law establishes parameters for when states may prosecute certain crimes committed within Indian country. The Major Crimes Act reserves federal jurisdiction over serious crimes like murder and kidnapping when committed by an Indian within Indian country. Congress alone has the power to change or erase reservation boundaries, which generally stay in place until Congress eliminates or reduces them. Murphy appealed his state murder conviction to the Tenth Circuit, arguing that the land designated as a reservation should be considered Indian country. The Tenth Circuit agreed with Murphy's appeal, stating that the Muscogee (Creek) reservation had never been disestablished, making it \"Indian country\" and precluding state jurisdiction over his offense. The history of the reservation was briefly described, including the forced relocation of the tribe in the 1820s to present-day Oklahoma and subsequent treaty agreements. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation's boundaries remained unchanged until the early 1900s when Oklahoma transitioned towards statehood, merging Indian and non-Indian lands. The Tenth Circuit used a three-step analysis to determine if Congress disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) reservation land. The Tenth Circuit used the Solem framework to rule in favor of the tribes, stating that Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction over criminal conduct in Indian country. Despite Oklahoma's arguments, the court found that none of the federal acts referenced clearly disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) reservation. The Tenth Circuit did not find clear intent by Congress to disestablish the Muscogee (Creek) reservation, leading to Oklahoma lacking jurisdiction over a murder case on those lands. Oklahoma petitioned for Supreme Court review, arguing that the land hasn't been treated as a reservation since 1906. Oklahoma argued that Congress must have intended to disestablish the reservation due to broken promises in treaties. They also contended that Congress could not have intended the state to lack jurisdiction over major crimes in half its land mass. The federal government supported Oklahoma's arguments and claimed that Congress had granted Oklahoma broad criminal jurisdiction over Indian country. The United States argued that Congress had eliminated tribal jurisdiction in Oklahoma, intending for all crimes to be prosecuted by the same entity regardless of whether they were committed in Indian country. The Supreme Court ordered Oklahoma and Murphy to address criminal jurisdiction over cases like Murphy's if committed in Indian country and whether a reservation could ever not qualify as Indian country. In his supplemental brief, Murphy argued that Congress has never given Oklahoma jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by Indians, stating that none of the statutes mentioned by the United States clearly grant criminal jurisdiction over tribes and tribal members to the State of Oklahoma. Oklahoma asserts jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on Muscogee (Creek) land based on laws passed by Congress. The state argues against defining historical territories as Indian reservations to avoid impacting federal prisoners and tribal authority. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on this case in November 2018. Justice Gorsuch was not present. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a case regarding the Muscogee (Creek) reservation in November 2018. Justice Gorsuch did not participate due to prior involvement while on the Tenth Circuit. The Court ordered a reargument for the next term, with potential implications for jurisdiction in eastern Oklahoma. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the Muscogee (Creek) reservation case, with potential implications for jurisdiction in eastern Oklahoma. Oklahoma argues that if the reservation was never disestablished, it could affect prosecution of crimes in the eastern part of the state. This decision could potentially create the largest Indian reservation in America. The Tenth Circuit's decision on the Muscogee (Creek) reservation case could create the largest Indian reservation in America, potentially shifting prosecution jurisdiction to federal and tribal governments. Some argue that recognizing the reservation's existence would not significantly impact state and local functions on the land. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation argues that state and local governments retain civil jurisdiction on reservation land, including taxing and zoning authority. The Supreme Court may avoid deciding if the reservation still exists and could reassess the approach endorsed in Solem. Alternatively, they could adopt the federal government's argument that Oklahoma had jurisdiction to prosecute Murphy. Ultimately, the decision to disestablish a reservation lies with Congress. If the reservation is deemed to still exist, Congress would need to pass a statute to disestablish it. If the Supreme Court finds that the Muscogee (Creek) reservation still exists, Congress could pass a law to limit the case's future applicability. Alternatively, if the Court determines the reservation no longer exists, Congress could countermand the decision by reestablishing it."
