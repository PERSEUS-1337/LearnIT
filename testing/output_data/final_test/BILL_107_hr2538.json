    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Native American Small Business Development Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives live on or near Indian lands with a high unemployment rate. These individuals own over 197,000 businesses, generating more than $34 billion in revenue. The service industry is the largest sector, followed by construction and retail trade. Business ownership among Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives increased by 84 percent from 1992 to 1997. The Small Business Development Center program is cost effective, with clients generating additional tax revenues of $468,000,000 in 1998, six times the program's cost to the Federal Government. Small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians receiving services under the program have a higher survival rate than average small businesses. Business counseling and technical assistance are provided through the program. The Act aims to stimulate economies on Indian lands, foster economic development, assist in creating and expanding small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, and provide management and technical assistance to these businesses. Business counseling and technical assistance are crucial on Indian lands where such services are limited and costly. Increased counseling through the Small Business Development Center program has been proven to reduce default rates associated with Small Business Administration lending programs. The Act aims to provide business counseling and technical assistance to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to stimulate economies on Indian lands and support small business development. It seeks advice from relevant governing bodies and ensures full access to existing assistance programs. Small Business Development Center assistance is provided to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to stimulate economies on Indian lands and support small business development. The Small Business Act is amended to provide an additional grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states to assist Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians with small business startups and expansions in Alaska, Hawaii, or on Indian lands in the contiguous 48 states. The Small Business Act is amended to provide a grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states with a population of at least 1 percent Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Grant applicants must submit goals and objectives for services to be provided using the grant. The grant application for Small Business Development Centers must include details on the applicant's training and services for Native American populations, the proposed location of the center, the required grant funding, and consultation with relevant Native governing bodies. The grant application for Small Business Development Centers must comply with all requirements of the section, with a maximum grant amount of $300,000 per fiscal year. Regulations must be followed after consultation with relevant Native governing bodies. The Administrator will issue final regulations for Small Business Development Centers, including standards for educational, technical, and support services, as well as work plan requirements. Definitions for terms like \"Associate Administrator\" will apply. The term `Associate Administrator' refers to the Associate Administrator for Small Business Development Centers. The term `Indian lands' in the 48 contiguous States includes land designated as a `reservation' under specific laws. The term `Indian tribe' refers to a federally recognized Indian tribe. The term 'Alaska Native' refers to an individual who is a 'Native' as defined by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The term 'Native Hawaiian' refers to a descendant of the aboriginal people who exercised sovereignty in Hawaii before 1778. $7,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for this purpose. Funding under this paragraph is additional to program limitations specified in paragraph (4). The Administration can only carry out this paragraph with advance appropriations specifically for this purpose. State consultation with local tribal councils is required for states receiving grants under the Small Business Act. They must seek advice from governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native corporations, and Native Hawaiian organizations on how to best provide assistance to their members and where to locate satellite centers for this purpose. The clerk's name is Jeff Trandahl."
