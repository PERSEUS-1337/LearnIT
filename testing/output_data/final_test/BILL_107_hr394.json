    "content": "The \"Reserve Employer Tax Credit Act of 2001\" is also known as the \"Reserve Force Participation Credit\" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Reserve Force Participation Credit\" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides an employment credit for qualified employees and self-employed individuals participating in qualified reserve duty. The credit is equal to 50 percent of qualified compensation for periods of reserve duty, excluding normal employment duties. The employment credit for qualified employees participating in qualified reserve duty is equal to the sum of the employment credits for each employee. Qualified compensation refers to compensation normally contingent on the employee's presence for work and deductible from gross income under section 162(a)(1) if the employee were present. The employment credit for qualified employees participating in qualified reserve duty is for compensation not characterized as vacation, holiday, sick leave, or nonspecific leave, and does not reduce previously earned leave. A qualified employee is someone who has been employed for 21 days before participating in reserve duty and is a member of the Ready Reserve. The self-employment credit for qualified self-employed taxpayers participating in qualified reserve duty is 50% of the excess of their average daily self-employment income over the average daily military pay and allowances received during the duty days. The taxpayer's duties include participating in qualified reserve duty during the taxable year, with calculations based on average daily self-employment income and military pay. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' refers to the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in qualified reserve duty, divided by the total number of days spent in such duty. A 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' is someone with net earnings from self-employment and is a member of the Ready Reserve. The employment credit provided in this section is in addition to any deduction allowable for compensation paid to a qualified employee during reserve duty. The maximum credit for the taxable year is $7,500 in total and $2,000 per qualified employee. The limitations on the employment credit for controlled groups are allocated as prescribed by the Secretary. Failure to comply with employment rights of reserve components disallows the credit for taxpayers. The tax credit under subsection (a) is disallowed for taxpayers under a final order from a district court related to a violation of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code, and for the two succeeding taxable years. Additionally, the credit is not allowed for taxpayers when the individual eligible for the credit is called to active duty for training under title 10, United States Code. The term 'qualified reserve duty' includes active duty in support of a contingency. Military pay refers to pay defined in title 37, United States Code, and allowances are the allowances payable to members of the Armed Forces. The term 'qualified reserve duty' includes active duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in title 10, United States Code. Participants must refrain from engaging in normal employment or self-employment duties during qualified reserve duty, unless on authorized leave. The text discusses the rules for qualified reserve duty, stating that individuals are considered to have engaged in such activity for the entire period of duty unless on authorized leave. A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code to include the reserve force participation credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the reserve force participation credit under section 45E(a). A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allow deductions for certain expenses of members of reserve components of the armed forces of the United States, including travel, meals, lodging, and transportation. These deductions apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include a provision that exempts deductions for expenses incurred by members of the Reserve component of the Armed Forces in connection with their services. Additionally, there is a modification to the deduction limit for meal and entertainment expenses. The amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include a provision allowing deductions for expenses related to services performed by taxpayers as members of the Reserve component of the Armed Forces. Effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
