    "content": "To measure traffic safety, various methods include tracking highway fatalities, serious injuries, economic losses, and social costs of accidents. Rates are calculated per million miles traveled, registered drivers, and total population to provide context. The fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled is a commonly used measure due to its seriousness and clear identification of vehicle-related incidents. The fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled has improved significantly since the passage of the first federal highway safety legislation in 1966, with four periods of abrupt declines coinciding with recessions. The rate dropped rapidly in the first decade of federal oversight but has become more modest in recent years, dropping from around 1.8 to 1.1 over the past 20 years. The fatality rate from motor vehicle crashes has decreased significantly since 1966, with four periods of decline coinciding with recessions. Despite a drop in fatalities from around 55,000 in 1972 to 33,000 in 2013, other safety measures have stalled. Serious injuries from crashes increased in 2013 compared to 2008, and overall crash rates have been rising. Highway safety varies by state, with urbanized states generally having lower fatality rates. Some states have stricter safety laws, such as mandatory seat belt use enforcement. The fatal crash rate for motorcycles has not improved since 2007, with a slight increase in 2013 compared to 1996. Motorcyclists are more likely to be involved in a crash than other drivers, and the likelihood of a motorcyclist dying in a crash is over 26 times higher than that of a passenger car occupant. The fatality rate for motorcycle occupants has not improved since 2007, with a slight increase in 2013 compared to 1996. Motorcycle registrations increased during this period, but the fatality rate did not decrease proportionally. The median age of motorcyclists has increased from 27 in 1985 to 41 in 2003, but the average age of motorcyclists dying in crashes has also increased. The proportion of fatally injured motorcycle operators on a bike with an engine size greater than 1,400 cubic centimeters has risen from 1% in the mid-1990s to around 30% today. The fatality rate for motorcycle occupants has not improved since 2007, with a slight increase in 2013 compared to 1996. One factor contributing to rising fatality rates is the combination of older riders and larger, heavier bikes. Alcohol is also a significant factor in motorcycle deaths, with 27% of motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes being legally intoxicated in 2013. Large trucks, although only representing around 4% of registered vehicles, accounted for 9% of total vehicle miles traveled and 9% of vehicles involved in fatal crashes in 2013. Large trucks, including single-unit and combination trucks, have seen a significant decrease in crash involvement rates since 1988. Combination trucks, which make up 25% of all large trucks but account for 61% of total truck mileage, have a higher fatal crash rate of 1.7 per 100 million VMT compared to single-unit trucks at 1.1. Most fatal crashes involving large trucks result in fatalities for occupants of other vehicles rather than the large trucks themselves. The decline in fatalities in crashes involving large trucks is likely due to improved crashworthiness of cars and light trucks. Driver intoxication is less significant in large truck crashes compared to passenger vehicles, with fatigue being a major concern for commercial drivers. A survey found that 25% of commercial drivers reported falling asleep while driving, highlighting the risk of fatigue for both commercial and passenger vehicle drivers. During the annual \"Roadcheck\" event, roughly 70,000 commercial vehicles and drivers are inspected for compliance with regulations. 5% of drivers and 18% of vehicles were found with serious violations, leading to being placed out of service. The most common reasons for out-of-service orders were violations of hours-of-service regulations for drivers and brake problems for vehicles. Vehicle condition has been improving over time, with a decrease in violations since 1991. The pedestrian fatality rate has decreased significantly from 1975 to 2013, with 14% of those killed in 2013 being children under 15. The reasons for this reduction are unclear, as data on exposure and safety measures are not readily available. The number of bicyclists killed in traffic crashes has generally declined since 1975, but has risen following the Great Recession. Data indicate that 722 cyclists were killed in 2004, 628 in 2009, and 741 in 2013. The recent increase may be related to increased bicycle usage. The average age of bicyclists killed in crashes increased from 24 in 1988 to 44 in 2013. Three in five bicyclists killed were not wearing helmets. Intoxication is a factor in pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities; one-third of pedestrians and one-fifth of bicyclists killed in 2013 were legally intoxicated. Drivers under 25 have higher accident rates and rates of involvement in fatal crashes than drivers 25 or over. The number of licensed drivers under 25 has fallen since 1975. The proportion of licensed drivers under 25 has decreased from 22.6% in 1975 to 12.5% in 2013. Economic factors, stricter licensing requirements, and personal preferences contribute to this decline. The percentage of the U.S. population living in rural areas decreased from 26.4% to 19.3% between 1970 and 2010, impacting fatality rates. Interstate highways, with their safety design features, saw an increase in the share of total vehicle miles traveled from 17% in 1975 to 25% in 2014. The greater share of driving on Interstate highways is expected to lead to lower accident and fatality rates. Fuel price changes have a small effect on fatality rates, with a 10% decrease in gasoline price associated with a 1.6% increase in fatal crashes. Higher fuel prices may lead some drivers to shift to motorcycles, increasing the fatality rate. Economic recessions are linked to declines in traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths, with VMT also decreasing. During economic recessions, crashes, injuries, and deaths from vehicle accidents increase at greater rates than the increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Studies show that rising unemployment leads to reductions in both VMT and the number of crashes per 100 million VMT. The decline in fatal crashes per 100 million VMT during recessions is associated with a decrease in crashes involving a drunk driver. The Great Recession in the late 2000s saw a significant decrease in traffic deaths, attributed to DOT's safety improvement efforts. The Great Recession in the late 2000s saw a significant decrease in traffic deaths, attributed to DOT's safety improvement efforts. Questions arise about why the fatality rate dropped dramatically then stopped, and the extent of DOT's responsibility. Government tools like engineering, education, enforcement, and emergency response aim to reduce crashes, severity, and improve medical care for crash victims. Federal policy efforts focus on these areas. Federal policy efforts primarily focus on engineering and enforcement to improve traffic safety. State and local governments handle driver education and emergency response with minimal federal involvement. Congress uses funding incentives and penalties to influence state adoption and enforcement of safe driving practices. In recent years, incentives have been favored over penalties to encourage state enforcement efforts. Federal policy focuses on engineering standards for highway and vehicle designs, as well as funding safety improvements in highway infrastructure to enhance traffic safety. Road design plays a crucial role in safety, with features like the Interstate Highway System reducing crash risks through elements like the absence of intersections and physical separation of vehicles. Road design improvements, such as adding traffic-calming measures or additional lanes, have a lasting impact on safety and can be cost-effective in the long run. The Highway Safety Improvement Program provides federal funding for road design improvements to eliminate hazardous locations. Injury and fatality rates have decreased due to improvements in motor vehicle design mandated by the federal government since 1966. The NHTSA's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards mandate various vehicle design improvements such as airbags, brake lights, and stability control. These standards also include regulations on headlight placement. NHTSA oversees vehicle design with a budget of $130 million in FY2015. The impact of these standards on safety is difficult to measure due to various factors affecting crash and fatality rates. The effectiveness of safety belts in reducing crash injuries is significant, but their impact on reducing crash fatalities is not always consistent. One theory suggests that individuals who wear seat belts may also engage in less risky driving behavior. Studies have not found evidence supporting the idea that belted drivers are more likely to be in a crash. Automakers have been adding safety features beyond federal standards, influenced by safety rating programs. The safety impact of vehicle improvements is not simply cumulative, as some features may reduce the effectiveness of others. NHTSA estimates that vehicle safety technologies play a significant role in improving safety. NHTSA estimates that vehicle safety technologies have contributed to half of the reduction in the risk of death for vehicle occupants between 1960 and 2012. Initial safety improvements like collapsible steering columns, safety belts, and roof crush resistance standards protected occupants from crash effects. Recent advancements in electronic sensors and controls have enabled features to help avoid crashes altogether, such as electronic stability control, adaptive cruise control, automatic braking. In a study, researchers found that improvements in passenger vehicles post-2000 prevented 700,000 crashes, reduced injuries for 1 million occupants, and saved 2,000 lives in 2008. While educating road users is important for safety, there is little evidence that it reduces crashes due to driver behaviors like intoxication, speeding, and distractions. Motorcycle advocacy groups push for more education instead of mandatory helmet laws, but there is no proof of its effectiveness. The federal government's role in improving road safety is limited, as most safety-related education and enforcement of road rules are the responsibility of state governments. While efforts like mandatory helmet laws are debated, there is no evidence of their effectiveness in enhancing motorcycle safety. Congress lacks authority over certain road safety measures for drivers not involved in interstate commerce, as these fall under state jurisdiction. Federal spending on enforcement is primarily focused on commercial vehicles operating across state lines. In FY2015, NHTSA and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration allocated $1.3 billion for grants to states to support enforcement efforts. Congress uses penalties and incentives to influence states on traffic safety issues, with strong penalties being more effective. For example, a law in 1966 threatened states with the loss of federal highway funds if they did not require motorcyclists to wear helmets within 10 years, leading 48 states to adopt such laws between 1966 and 1975. Between 1966 and 1975, 48 states adopted laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets. In 1976, the threat of losing federal highway funding led 27 states to repeal these laws by 1979. The FY2001 DOT appropriations act mandated that states with a BAC of .08% or higher would lose federal highway funding starting in 2004. By the end of FY2004, all states had implemented this law. However, strong enforcement can lead to resistance, resulting in some laws being repealed. The transfer penalties for states not having specific highway safety laws have been in effect since FY2000, with no overall loss of federal highway funding. These penalties initially had a significant impact, but their influence on state legislatures has decreased over time. The transfer penalties for states without specific highway safety laws were effective initially, with almost half of states complying within three years. However, in the following 13 years, very few states made changes. Some states were motivated by penalties to comply, but others, like New York, found the penalties insufficient. As of FY2016, 13 states were not compliant with open container laws, and 16 states were not compliant with other requirements. The \"transfer of funding\" penalty for states without specific highway safety laws was initially effective, but compliance decreased over time. Congress has not implemented a new loss-of-funding penalty related to traffic safety since 2000, indicating a shift towards state discretion. The incentive approach has had inconsistent impacts on state compliance with traffic safety laws. In 2012, Congress created seven highway safety incentive grant programs, but they had little impact on states' legislation enactment. Seat belts are crucial for reducing traffic crash deaths, with over 10,000 lives saved annually. However, the effectiveness of seat belts relies on their usage. The occupant protection incentive grant program was established in 2000 to improve seat belt usage rates. Over $1 billion has been granted to states since then. The number of states with primary enforcement seat belt laws has increased, leading to a rise in nationwide seat belt use. Additionally, the proportion of drivers involved in fatal crashes impaired by alcohol has decreased from 35% in 1982 to 20% in 1997. The proportion of drivers impaired by alcohol declined from 35% in 1982 to 20% in 1997, remaining just above 20% since 1999. Various factors such as decreased alcohol consumption, fewer young drivers, increased female drivers, and activism against drunk driving may have contributed to this trend. However, the decline in alcohol-related crashes plateaued around 1996, suggesting other factors at play. Congress lacks direct authority to regulate public alcohol consumption. In 1984, Congress passed the Minimum Drinking Age Act to influence states to regulate alcohol consumption, particularly in connection with driving. States without a minimum drinking age risk losing federal transportation funding. The impact of this law on reducing drunk driving fatalities is significant but hard to measure accurately due to other supporting laws enacted by states. Studies suggest that stricter laws accounted for less than half of the reduction in drunk driving incidents. The introduction of stricter laws, including the .08% BAC threshold for driving while intoxicated, has contributed to a decrease in alcohol-impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes. However, other factors such as demographic changes also played a role in reducing drunk driving incidents. Additionally, the decline in alcohol-impaired crashes involving teens is attributed to graduated driver-licensing laws rather than policies targeting impaired driving. The decrease in alcohol-impaired crashes is attributed to graduated driver-licensing laws delaying teen driving age and the overall drop in crashes starting in 2007 due to the economic recession. Fatality rates vary by state and factors like rural/urban population, road conditions, and state laws impact DUI activity. Speeding is linked to crashes. Speeding is a key factor in crashes, with higher speeds leading to more severe injuries. Congress implemented a national speed limit of 55 mph in 1974, saving thousands of lives annually. However, in 1995, the law was repealed, leading to an increase in speed limits on Interstate highways and a rise in crashes. Studies suggest that eliminating the national maximum speed limit increased crashes and deaths, especially on Interstates. Reinstating the limit could save 1,000 to 3,000 lives yearly and reduce fuel consumption. However, the cost of additional travel time from a lower speed limit may outweigh the benefits. Congress restricts states from using federal funds for automated speed enforcement, despite its effectiveness. Driver distraction plays a role in 10% of fatal crashes but is hard to detect. Driver distraction, a significant factor in 10% of fatal crashes, is challenging to detect as drivers often do not admit to being distracted. Common distractions include eating, talking to passengers, and using cell phones. Studies show that cell phone use increases crash risk by four times, leading to laws prohibiting hand-held use but allowing hands-free usage. Cognitive distraction from phone conversations, rather than physical encumbrance, is the primary source of distraction while driving. Automakers are expanding sources of driver distraction with Internet-connected systems in new vehicles. Surveys show opposition to cell-phone use while driving, yet many still engage in it. Laws in 46 states and DC ban texting while driving, 38 ban cell-phone use by novice drivers, and 14 ban hand-held cell phone use for all drivers. Columbia bans drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. Intensive enforcement of such laws can be effective but costly. Graduated driver licensing is the most proven countermeasure. Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012 to encourage states to prohibit texting for all drivers and cell-phone use for drivers under 18. Only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015. Congress removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders in December 2015. Injuries to the head are the most common cause of fatalities among motorcyclists. The only effective policy approach to reduce motorcycle crash deaths is a universal helmet law. Congress repealed a penalty for states without this law in 1975, leading to an increase in fatalities. The motorcycle fatality rate has remained steady over the past 20 years despite the fluctuation in helmet laws. Currently, 19 states, the District of Columbia, and four territories have universal helmet laws, while 28 states and one territory require helmets for young riders. NHTSA estimates that implementing universal helmet laws in all states could prevent nearly 1,000 motorcyclist deaths annually. The NHTSA is working on a rule to restrict the sale and use of noncompliant motorcycle helmets, known as \"novelty helmets,\" which do not offer the same protection as DOT-compliant helmets. Congress has established a grant program to incentivize states to reduce motorcycle crashes and deaths, with specific criteria for eligibility. The NHTSA is working on a rule to restrict the sale and use of noncompliant motorcycle helmets. Congress has established a grant program to incentivize states to reduce motorcycle crashes and deaths, with specific criteria for eligibility, including policy measures like rider training courses and motorist awareness programs. However, there is no evidence that certain training programs are effective in reducing crash rates. The most effective safety policy, a universal helmet law, is not included in the options for the grant program. The key element in emergency response is reducing the time between a crash and medical assistance. U.S. highway safety programs do not focus on this aspect. While U.S. safety statistics have improved, there is still room for further progress. Traffic deaths increased by 9% in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Other industrialized nations have surpassed the U.S. in highway safety performance. Congress could consider low-cost, effective interventions recommended by safety advocates. Low-cost, effective interventions for highway safety include seat belt usage, motorcycle helmets, automated traffic enforcement, and new vehicle safety technologies. In 2014, 87% of front-seat occupants wore seat belts, with higher rates in states with primary enforcement laws. Other countries like Australia, England, and Canada have achieved even higher seat belt use rates. NHTSA estimated that in 2013, 2,800 lives could have been saved if all unrestrained passengers wore seat belts. By 2012, 34 states and the District of Columbia had adopted mandatory seat belt laws for front-seat passengers. Options available to Congress to increase the number of states with primary enforcement laws for seat belt use by all occupants include an incentive program with a much greater value of incentive, a program that would penalize states that do not adopt such laws, or a combination of the two. Ninety nations have universal mandatory helmet laws, with Australia reporting a 99% helmet use rate by motorcycle operators. Universal helmet laws have been effective in promoting helmet usage. Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia have universal helmet laws. Congress has restricted NHTSA from promoting universal helmet laws and using federal funding for helmet checks and targeted motorcycle checkpoints. Automated traffic enforcement is effective in ensuring compliance with traffic laws and reducing risks for officers. Automated traffic enforcement, such as red-light and speed cameras, has been proven to decrease violations and crashes at intersections. Speed cameras have reduced crashes by 14% to 25% and have been widely used in other countries like France and Australia. In 2001, 36% of light vehicles exceeded the speed limit by more than 10 km/h, dropping to 10% in 2009. Congress prohibited states from using federal highway funding for automated traffic enforcement, except in school zones, and required states with automated enforcement systems to use federal safety funding for biennial surveys. The potential to reduce crashes and deaths by reducing human driver error is recognized. The industry is rapidly developing driver-assistance technologies to replace human drivers, aiming to reduce crashes and fatalities. NHTSA is considering adding new safety standards based on the impact of these technologies. The turnover rate of the U.S. automobile fleet is around 17 years, with new vehicle technologies taking time to show effects. There is a concern about how quickly these technologies will reach high-risk drivers, particularly younger drivers. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is working with industry, states, and stakeholders to accelerate the deployment of autonomous vehicles. They have proposed a $4 billion program to test connected vehicles. An analysis of the costs and benefits of encouraging drivers to replace older cars with new ones equipped with collision-avoidance technologies may be worthwhile, drawing on the success of the \"Cash for Clunkers\" program in 2009."
