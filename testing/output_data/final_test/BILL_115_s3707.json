The definitions in this section include terms like \"appropriate information system,\" \"Department,\" \"information system,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"security vulnerability.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the vulnerability disclosure policy required by the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to establish a vulnerability disclosure policy for reporting security vulnerabilities on Department information systems. This policy will outline the systems for reporting vulnerabilities, the conditions for reporting, and the process for disclosing discovered vulnerabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish a vulnerability disclosure policy for reporting security vulnerabilities on Department information systems. This policy will cover communication methods with reporters, the public disclosure process, and a remediation process for addressing reported vulnerabilities. Consultation with the Attorney General is required in developing the policy. The policy developed under subsection (b) protects individuals from prosecution under specific laws for authorized activities. The Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General Services will discuss lessons from existing vulnerability disclosure policies, and non-governmental security researchers will be involved. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to consultations under this section. The policy developed under subsection (b) will be made publicly available by the Secretary. The Secretary will submit the policy and remediation process to Congress within 90 days of enactment. A report on the policy and remediation process will be submitted to Congress one year after its establishment, with annual briefings for the following three years. The Secretary will provide Congress with annual briefings on the policy and process for security vulnerabilities, including the number of reported vulnerabilities and those mitigated or remediated. The Secretary will report to Congress annually on security vulnerabilities, including the number of unique individuals, organizations, and companies reporting vulnerabilities, and the average time taken to mitigate or remediate them."
