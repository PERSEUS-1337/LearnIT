The \"Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001\" establishes a Rail Line Relocation Grant Program under Chapter 2 of title 23, United States Code. This program provides financial assistance for local rail line relocation projects aimed at mitigating adverse effects of rail traffic on safety, traffic flow, and economic development in municipalities. Eligible projects involve relocating portions of rail lines to avoid grade crossing closures or road construction. The Rail Line Relocation Grant Program provides financial assistance for local projects aimed at mitigating adverse effects of rail traffic on safety, traffic flow, and economic development. Grants are awarded for projects that meet the costs-benefits requirement, considering factors such as the impact on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, and area commerce. The Rail Line Relocation Grant Program considers factors like the effects of rail line relocation on freight and passenger operations, state capability to fund projects without federal grants, equitable treatment of regions, and allocation requirements for grant funds. The Rail Line Relocation Grant Program allocates funds for rail line relocation projects with estimated costs under $20,000,000 each. No more than 25% of the total funds for a fiscal year can be used for one project. The federal share of a grant is 90% of the project costs, with states required to contribute 10%. The federal Rail Line Relocation Grant Program funds projects under $20,000,000. States must contribute 10% of project costs, which can be paid in cash or in-kind contributions like property or employee services. The project must meet statutory requirements before applying for a grant under this section. In-kind contributions made before the application can be considered as shared costs, excluding funds or contributions from sources other than the municipality. The municipality must meet conditions for fund use, including using funds only for the project and making availability contingent on project execution. The Secretary determines shared costs, with final decisions. Multistate agreements can combine amounts. Two or more States can combine grant amounts for a project if it benefits each State and does not violate any laws. The Secretary will create regulations for this section, and the term 'State' includes political subdivisions. Funds are authorized for appropriation for this section for specific fiscal years. Funds are authorized for appropriation for specific fiscal years as follows: $250,000,000 for 2001, $500,000,000 for 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. The Secretary of Transportation will issue temporary regulations by December 31, 2001, and final regulations by October 1, 2002, for the grant program under section 207 of title 23, United States Code. Subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, does not apply to the temporary regulations."
