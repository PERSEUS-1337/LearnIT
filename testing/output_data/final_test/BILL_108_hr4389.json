    "content": "The definitions section clarifies that the \"District\" refers to Fallbrook Public Utility District in San Diego County, California, and the \"Project\" refers to the authorized construction, operation, and maintenance of impoundment, recharge, treatment, and other facilities. The Secretary is authorized to construct the Lower Santa Margarita Conjunctive Use Project for various uses in the District and surrounding lands. Construction can only proceed after specific conditions are met. The District has a contract to repay the United States for the costs of the Project. Permits for water appropriation have been granted to the Bureau of Reclamation. The District has agreed not to assert certain rights. The District has agreed not to assert any prior appropriative right to water exceeding the amount allocated under the Act. The Secretary of the Interior has confirmed the economic, environmental, and engineering feasibility of the Project. The Department of the Navy will only be responsible for costs related to the Project upon completion, based on its usage. Operation, yield allotment, and delivery will be regulated by agreements between the Secretary of the Navy and Secretary of the Interior. The Project's operation may be managed by the Secretary of the Interior or as agreed by the Secretaries of the Interior, Navy, and District. The Department of the Navy and the District will share impounded water equally, with 60% allotted to the Navy and 40% to the District. Contracts for water delivery will be based on the Navy's immediate needs. The Department of the Navy may enter into temporary contracts for excess water if not immediately needed. The Secretary of the Navy has the first right to demand water without charge after 30 days notice. Moneys paid under contracts will go to the general Treasury or the Secretary of the Navy. The District may provide services instead of payment for Project operation and maintenance, not reducing its debt to the United States. The United States and the District can modify their rights and obligations regarding Project water yield through an agreement. The District's repayment obligation to the United States will be determined by the Secretary of the Interior, with groundwater pumping and treatment considered equivalent to water storage project use. The rights and obligations regarding repayment can be modified by agreement. Additionally, the transfer of care, operation, and maintenance of the Project is addressed. SEC. 6. TRANSFER OF CARE, OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE. The Secretary may transfer the care, operation, and maintenance of the Project to the District or a third party under satisfactory conditions. The District will receive credit for the Secretary's share of operation and maintenance costs, which will be deducted from the District's indebtedness to the United States. SEC. 7. SCOPE OF ACT. The Act establishes that all rights of the United States regarding water use in California are based on state laws. It does not grant or relinquish any water rights acquired by the United States, create obligations to store water, or constitute recognition or admission of any rights. The Act does not recognize any water rights for the District in the Santa Margarita River, as any existing rights are based on California state laws. It also does not require the division of water to which the United States has rights. SEC. 8. LIMITATIONS ON OPERATION AND ADMINISTRATION. The Project must allow free passage of water to which the United States is entitled under California laws. It should not impair or deplete water quantities the United States would be entitled to without the Project. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $60,000,000 is authorized for the Project's construction costs, plus additional funds for operation and maintenance. SEC. 10. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.
