    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act\". It includes findings related to cardiovascular diseases in women. The Congress finds that cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in women, claiming more lives than cancer each year. More than 1 in 5 females have some form of cardiovascular disease, with heart attacks killing more women than breast cancer. African-American women have a higher death rate from cardiovascular diseases. African-American women, aged 35 to 74, have a 38% higher death rate from heart attacks compared to white women. Cardiovascular diseases have claimed more female lives than males since 1984, with women experiencing different clinical courses and less accurate diagnostics than men. Women are more likely to have ongoing health issues and die from cardiovascular diseases compared to men. About 44% of women die within 1 year of a heart attack, while 27% of men do. Women who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of death, especially within a few weeks. They are also more likely to have a stroke following a heart attack, with a higher mortality rate compared to men. Women have better long-term survivorship after a stroke than men. Additionally, women have unrecognized heart attacks more often than men. More than half of healthcare costs related to cardiovascular diseases are attributed to women. Hormone replacement therapy may reduce cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women and lower cardiovascular mortality by up to 50%. This contributes to the significant healthcare costs and lost productivity related to cardiovascular diseases in women. Expansion and intensification of activities regarding heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women. The Director of the Institute will expand, intensify, and coordinate research on heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases in women. This includes collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies to conduct research on causes and prevention methods for these diseases in women. The Director of the Institute will conduct and support research on heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases in women. This includes research on the reasons for the prevalence of these diseases in women, basic research on the causes, epidemiological studies on disease frequency and natural history, development of diagnostic approaches, and clinical research for treatment development. Research on new treatments for women, prevention of cardiovascular diseases, and education programs on risk factors and prevention strategies are key focus areas for the Institute. This includes rehabilitation, control of blood pressure, lipids, obesity, and promoting health-related behaviors like smoking cessation, weight management, and regular exercise. Activities under subsection (c) include education programs on hormone replacement therapy's benefits and risks in reducing cardiovascular disease risk in women. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998, with additional funding for 1999 and 2000."
