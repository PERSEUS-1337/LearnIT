    "content": "The \"Clean Energy Bonds Act of 2005\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a nonrefundable credit to holders of clean energy bonds. The \"Clean Energy Bonds Act of 2005\" allows taxpayers holding clean energy bonds to receive a credit against their taxes. The credit amount is 25 percent of the annual credit determined for the bond. The annual credit is calculated based on the credit rate determined by the Secretary. The Secretary determines a credit rate for clean energy bonds daily, based on a specified maturity date, to allow issuance without discount or interest cost to the issuer. The term 'credit allowance date' is defined as March 15. The term 'credit allowance date' includes specific dates and the last day the bond is outstanding. A special rule applies for bonds issued or redeemed close to a credit allowance date, allowing a prorated credit. The credit allowed is limited based on the amount of tax. The credit allowed for any taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under this part. Any excess credit can be carried over to the next taxable year. A clean energy bond is defined as any bond issued as part of an issue. A clean energy bond is a bond issued by a qualified issuer for capital expenditures on qualified projects. The bond must be designated for this purpose, in registered form, and meet specific requirements. A qualified project is any qualified facility owned by a qualified borrower. A clean energy bond can be used to refinance a qualified project if the original debt was incurred by a qualified borrower after the enactment of this section. The bond can also reimburse a qualified borrower for expenses related to a qualified project, as long as the borrower declared the expenditure beforehand.

The proceeds of the bond must be used for the qualified project, and regulations will be prescribed to prevent misuse of the funds. Maturity limitations also apply to clean energy bonds. Clean energy bonds have maturity limitations where the average maturity of bonds issued cannot exceed 120 percent of the average economic life of the financed facilities. The bonds must also include ratable principal amortization to be considered clean energy bonds. Clean energy bonds must have ratable principal amortization, with an equal amount of principal paid each year. Gross income includes the credit allowed under this section, treated as interest income. An issue must spend at least 95% of proceeds on qualified projects within 5 years of issuance to meet requirements. Clean energy bonds require a commitment to spend 10% of proceeds within 6 months of issuance on qualified projects. Projects must be completed diligently, and proceeds spent with due diligence. Requests for extension of the spending period can be submitted before expiration. The Secretary may extend the spending period for clean energy bonds if the issuer proves reasonable cause for not meeting the 5-year requirement. If less than 95% of proceeds are spent within 5 years, nonqualified bonds must be redeemed on the earliest call date after the period expires. If the call date is more than 90 days after the 5-year period, a yield-restricted defeasance must be established. The qualified issuer must establish a yield-restricted defeasance escrow within 90 days to retire nonqualified bonds either 10 years after the issue date or the first call date. Nonqualified bonds refer to the portion of outstanding bonds where at least 95% of the proceeds would be used for qualified projects if the remaining bonds were issued on the fifth anniversary of the original issuance. Additionally, to be considered a clean energy bond, the issuer must satisfy arbitrage rebate requirements. The issuer must satisfy arbitrage rebate requirements to be considered a clean energy bond.
