    "content": "In recent years, Congress has been interested in the time taken for lower court nominations to receive Senate confirmation. Debate has focused on whether President Obama's judicial nominees waited longer for confirmation compared to nominees of other Presidents. Senators have differing views on the waiting times for confirmation of uncontroversial nominees. Senator Patrick J. Leahy criticized the long wait times for President Obama's uncontroversial judicial nominees, stating that unnecessary delays and across-the-board stalling by the Senate minority led to backlogs and months of delays in confirmations. Senator Patrick J. Leahy criticized delays in confirming President Obama's judicial nominees, attributing the backlog to Senate minority stalling. In contrast, Senator Chuck Grassley argued that nominees were treated fairly and confirmed in line with past practices, citing the impact of nomination submission pace on confirmation timelines. The report analyzes Senate confirmation timelines for uncontroversial circuit and district court nominees from Reagan to Obama presidencies. It includes methodology, approval percentages, and average confirmation times for Obama's nominees compared to past presidents. The report compares average and median waiting times for uncontroversial judicial nominees from Reagan to Obama presidencies. It shows an increase in waiting times from one presidency to the next for circuit and district court nominees. Additionally, it analyzes the percentage of nominees who waited specific amounts of time for Senate confirmation. Less than 1 in 10 nominees of the earliest Presidents waited over 200 days for confirmation. The analysis shows an increase in waiting times for uncontroversial judicial nominees from Reagan to Obama presidencies. Over half of President Obama's nominees waited 200 or more days for Senate approval, compared to less than 1 in 10 nominees from Reagan and G.H.W. Bush. Various factors possibly influenced the longer waiting times, and implications are discussed. The analysis focused on uncontroversial judicial nominees and their level of support from Senators of both parties during the nomination process. Nominees were considered uncontroversial if they received favorable reports from the Senate Judiciary Committee and were approved by the full Senate with minimal opposition. Excluded nominees were those with confirmation delays exceeding 1,000 days. The analysis excluded nominees with confirmation delays over 1,000 days due to initial controversies involving opposition from home state Senators. Nominees were not considered uncontroversial if there were nay votes during committee roll call, indicating some level of controversy expected during the Senate confirmation process. The report defines an uncontroversial nominee as one approved by the Judiciary Committee in a voice vote, indicating little to no controversy. This does not mean there were no concerns voiced by Senators, but rather that formal nay votes were not recorded during the confirmation process. The report focuses on the time taken for uncontroversial judicial nominees to be confirmed by the Senate, excluding those who were not ultimately confirmed or reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The methodology used in the report to identify uncontroversial nominees is one possible approach. The report focuses on confirming uncontroversial judicial nominees by the Senate. Different criteria may yield varying findings. There is a strong link between committee votes and bipartisan support for nominees. President Obama's circuit court nominees confirmed by voice vote or unanimous roll call had high bipartisan support. Those with nay votes during committee confirmation faced more opposition during Senate approval. During the confirmation process, nominees who received nay votes in committee faced more opposition when confirmed by the Senate. The level of bipartisan support for nominees was strongly linked to the type of committee vote they received. Across different presidencies, a majority of judicial nominees were uncontroversial and approved by the Senate. The percentage of nominees approved with minimal opposition ranged from 97.6% under G.H.W. Bush to 68.9% under G.W. Bush. The percentage of confirmed district court nominees meeting the \"uncontroversial\" standard varied from 100% under President G.H.W. Bush to 84.1% under President Obama. This does not necessarily indicate that one President nominated a lower percentage of bipartisan nominees. Under President Obama, district court nominees with more than 5 nay votes faced opposition from a minority of Senators but still received support from both parties. 40% were reported out of committee by voice vote, and 35% had at least 1 Republican Senator voting to favorably report the nomination. These statistics were generated from an internal CRS judicial nominations database and only account for nominations to U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. The statistics provided in this report include the confirmation of all nominees to U.S. circuit and district court judgeships prior to September 14, 2012 under President Obama. The time from nomination to confirmation is measured in days, and some nominees had multiple nominations for the same judgeship. During the period from Reagan to Obama, the mean and median number of days from first nomination to confirmation for uncontroversial circuit court nominees increased from one President to the next. The average number of days from nomination to confirmation for uncontroversial circuit court nominees increased from 64.5 days during the Reagan presidency to 227.3 days under President Obama. The median number of days from nomination to confirmation also increased over the years. The median number of days from nomination to confirmation for uncontroversial nominees steadily increased from Presidents Reagan to Obama. The median increased by 41 days from Reagan to G.H.W. Bush, further increased under Clinton and G.W. Bush, reaching 169.5 days under G.W. Bush. The average number of days from nomination to confirmation for uncontroversial district court nominees increased from 69.9 days during the Reagan presidency to 204.8 days during the Obama presidency. The trend of increasing wait times continued from Reagan to G.H.W. Bush, Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama presidencies. The median number of days from nomination to confirmation for uncontroversial district court nominees increased from 41 days to 208 days from the Reagan to the Obama presidency. The trend of increasing wait times continued across successive presidencies. The percentage of uncontroversial judicial nominees waiting at least 200 days from nomination to confirmation has increased in recent years, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. This trend reveals a steady increase in the percentage of nominees waiting 200 or more days to be confirmed from Presidents Reagan to Obama. The percentage of uncontroversial judicial nominees waiting over 200 days for confirmation has increased over the years, with a decrease in nominees waiting less than 100 days. Reagan and G.H.W. Bush had a majority of nominees confirmed within 100 days, while Clinton had a plurality waiting less than 100 days. The percentage of uncontroversial circuit court nominees waiting over 200 days for confirmation has increased over the years. During the Clinton presidency, 22.2% of nominees waited 200 or more days, a threefold increase from the G.H.W. Bush presidency. President G.W. Bush saw 35.7% of his uncontroversial nominees waiting 200 or more days, a 15 percentage point increase from Clinton's nominees. Additionally, 28.6% of G.W. Bush's nominees waited fewer than 100 days for confirmation. President Obama is the only President from 1981-2012 with no uncontroversial circuit court nominees approved by the Senate in less than 100 days. This marks a 29% decrease from G.W. Bush's presidency. Additionally, 63.6% of Obama's uncontroversial nominees were approved after at least 200 days, a 28 percentage point increase from nominees waiting over 200 days during his term. President Obama's uncontroversial circuit court nominees had a higher percentage of waiting from 100 to 199 days compared to Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush. For uncontroversial district court nominees, a majority waited fewer than 100 days under Presidents Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, and Clinton. The percentage of district court nominees approved by the Senate from 100 to 199 days varied among these Presidents. Less than 10% of President Reagan's and President G.H.W. Bush's uncontroversial district court nominees waited over 200 days. Under President Reagan and President G.H.W. Bush, around 10% of uncontroversial district court nominees were confirmed after 200 days, compared to less than 20% under President Clinton. The approval time for nominees under President G.W. Bush varied, with a decrease in those confirmed under 100 days and an increase in those waiting 100 to 199 days. The percentage of nominees waiting over 200 days increased slightly from the Clinton presidency to the G.W. Bush presidency. The approval time for uncontroversial district court nominees has increased from the G.W. Bush presidency to the Obama presidency, with a majority waiting 200 or more days for confirmation. This trend of longer waiting times has been observed across the five most recent presidencies. The increase in waiting times for uncontroversial judicial nominees from the G.W. Bush presidency to the Obama presidency may be due to various factors such as ideological differences between Presidents and Senators, Judiciary Committee procedures, floor procedures, and the role of non-committee Senators in vetting nominees. Ideological conflicts between Presidents and opposition party Senators have been a recurring issue in the Senate, leading to delays in the confirmation process. Ideological conflicts between Presidents and opposition party Senators can lead to delays in the confirmation process for judicial nominees. This conflict may cause increases in wait times for both controversial and uncontroversial nominees, as ideological differences between the Senate's two parties can hinder prompt confirmation. The length of time uncontroversial judicial nominees are processed in the Senate Judiciary Committee may be influenced by ideological differences between the President and the opposition party. Factors such as the evaluation process by the American Bar Association can also impact the nomination process. The American Bar Association's evaluation of judicial nominees can affect the time it takes for nominations to be processed in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The evaluation may add to the total time a nomination is pending, depending on when it is conducted in relation to the nomination process. The increase in the mean and median number of days from nomination to confirmation for uncontroversial judicial nominees during the Bush presidency was partly due to waiting time for the ABA's report. The ABA's evaluation of nominees before formal selection by the President has resumed under Obama. Another factor affecting processing time is Senators' ability to delay consideration of nominations in the Judiciary Committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee's processing time for judicial nominees may be influenced by Senators' ability to delay nominations and the amount of information they need to review before deciding on a nomination. Increases in wait times for uncontroversial nominees across presidencies could be due to Senators exercising their right to delay nominations more frequently. The Senate Judiciary Committee's processing time for judicial nominees may be affected by various factors, including the amount of information needing review by the committee. Delays in confirming uncontroversial nominees could be influenced by Senators' ability to delay nominations and other political factors. Delays in Senate approval of judicial nominees can be caused by procedural factors such as holds or objections to unanimous consent agreements. Recent Congresses have seen delays even for uncontroversial nominees with bipartisan support. The emphasis on individual roll call votes for nominations has also contributed to delays in Senate consideration. In recent Congresses, delays in Senate approval of judicial nominees have increased, even for uncontroversial nominees with bipartisan support. Senators prioritize individual roll call votes for nominations to avoid \"rubber stamping\" a President's nominees, leading to longer confirmation times. Non-committee Senators also play a role in vetting nominees, contributing to the overall review process. Delays in Senate approval of judicial nominees have increased, even for uncontroversial nominees with bipartisan support. Keeping nominees on the Executive Calendar for extended periods allows the public to voice their opinions. Longer confirmation times may result in more vacancies qualifying as \"judicial emergencies,\" increased caseloads for judges, and delays in trial proceedings. Longer wait times for judicial nominees may have adverse effects on litigants, deter well-qualified individuals from accepting nominations, increase partisan tensions, and lead to conflicts between parties. However, some argue that longer scrutiny by the Senate could be appropriate. Longer wait times for judicial nominees may be appropriate for positions with lifetime tenure, allowing for greater scrutiny by the Senate and increased participation from interest groups and citizens in the confirmation process."
