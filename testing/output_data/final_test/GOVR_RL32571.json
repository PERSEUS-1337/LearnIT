    "content": "This report provides a description and status report on Brazil's challenge to certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program under the rules of the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement process in case DS267. The \"Brazil cotton case\" originated in 2002 and is still ongoing as of 2011, involving various phases such as panel and appeal, compliance dispute, and retaliation. For the current status and details, readers can refer to the section \"Recent Action Related to the WTO Brazil Cotton Case.\" The report outlines the U.S. cotton sector and domestic support programs, followed by a detailed history of the Brazil WTO dispute case in chronological phases. It discusses Congress's potential role in response to WTO rulings and implications for U.S. cotton programs. The phases include pre-case background, Brazil's specific charges, WTO panel findings, recommendations, compliance review, and arbitration. The report provides an economic and policy perspective on the Brazil WTO dispute case involving the U.S. cotton sector. It includes a timetable of the dispute settlement process and discusses the potential implications for U.S. cotton programs. The report also highlights the role of Congress in response to WTO rulings. The U.S. cotton industry is a significant part of the agricultural sector, with Texas being the largest cotton-producing state. The United States is the third-largest producer of cotton globally and the largest exporter. U.S. cash receipts from cotton production averaged $4.3 billion per year from 1991 to 2010, with export sales averaging nearly $3 billion. Since 2000, the U.S. has seen an increasing share of world cotton trade. Since 2000, the United States has accounted for an increasing share of world cotton trade, with U.S. exports averaging over 70% of domestic production. U.S. farm subsidies for cotton production have averaged $3.4 billion per year, while the harvest-time value of production has averaged $4.3 billion. The United States has accounted for a growing share of world cotton trade since 2000, with exports averaging over 70% of domestic production. Farm subsidies for cotton production have averaged $3.4 billion per year, while the harvest-time value of production has averaged $4.3 billion. Marketing loan program benefits and CCP payments are price-contingent, with triggers set to incentivize greater production and exports, leading to lower domestic and international prices. This \"price effect\" was found by the WTO to have adverse consequences. The WTO found that the \"price effect\" of U.S. farm subsidies for cotton production caused adverse effects in the international market. Cotton support prices were deemed too high compared to market conditions. In 2002, the U.S. operated export credit guarantee programs, including GSM-102 and GSM-103, to facilitate agricultural exports, including cotton. The GSM-102 export credit guarantee program, authorized under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, guarantees repayment of credit for agricultural commodity exports on credit terms between 90 days and three years. The program is backed by USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation and covers 98% of principal and part of interest. Exporters pay a fee based on guaranteed value for the guarantee. Brazil initiated a WTO dispute settlement case (DS267) against certain features of the U.S. cotton program, expressing concerns about U.S. cotton subsidies. The dispute settlement process has extended well beyond the expected 15-month timeframe, with the initial panel review taking 17 months. The dispute settlement process for the WTO case DS267 on U.S. cotton subsidies has been prolonged with additional review stages, including an Appellate Body review, a compliance panel review, and an arbitrator's review of proposed retaliation amounts by Brazil and the United States. The initial dispute covered various aspects of U.S. commodity programs, focusing on six principal claims. Brazil argued that the U.S. was no longer exempt from WTO dispute proceedings under the \"peace clause\" of the Agreement on Agriculture. The WTO case DS267 on U.S. cotton subsidies involved Brazil challenging the U.S. for exceeding its 1992 benchmark level of domestic and export subsidies. Brazil argued that U.S. subsidies had increased significantly from MY1992 to MY2001, making them ineligible for protection under the WTO's \"peace clause\" rule. U.S. officials defended the subsidies, stating that the peace clause recognized the gradual elimination of agricultural subsidies under certain conditions. The U.S. argued that agricultural subsidies, exempt from SCM Agreement and GATT 1994, were protected by the \"peace clause\" in the WTO case DS267 with Brazil over U.S. cotton subsidies. U.S. officials emphasized the importance of being exempt from legal actions and the burden of proof on the complaining party. Brazil successfully showed that U.S. domestic cotton support measures exceeded allowed levels. U.S. domestic cotton support measures exceeded WTO commitments during MY1999-MY2002, leading to the loss of protection under the \"Peace Clause.\" Brazil challenged U.S. payments, including Production Flexibility Contract and Direct Payments, for not meeting decoupled income support conditions. The U.S. considers these programs to be consistent. The United States considers Production Flexibility Contract and Direct Payments to be consistent with WTO language for exempt domestic support. However, the panel found that these payments do not qualify for the WTO's green box category and should be counted as domestic subsidies. Step 1 - The Step 2 payments under the U.S. cotton program are considered export subsidies and were authorized to keep U.S. upland cotton competitive on the world market by compensating exporters and domestic mill users for purchasing higher priced U.S. upland cotton.\n\nStep 2 - The United States considers Production Flexibility Contract and Direct Payments to be consistent with WTO language for exempt domestic support, but the panel found that these payments should be counted as domestic subsidies and not qualify for the WTO's green box category.\n\nStep 3 - The summarized chunk is: \"Step 2 payments under the U.S. cotton program function as export subsidies to keep U.S. upland cotton competitive by compensating exporters and domestic mill users for purchasing higher priced U.S. upland cotton.\"\n\nStep 4 - Summarized chunk: Step 2 payments under the U.S. cotton program function as export subsidies to keep U.S. upland cotton competitive by compensating exporters and domestic mill users for purchasing higher priced U.S. upland cotton. Step 4 - Summarized chunk: The United States argued that Step 2 payments were part of its domestic support program, notified to the WTO as \"amber\" box domestic support payments, not export subsidies. However, the panel found that payments to exporters were contingent upon export performance and qualified as prohibited export subsidies in violation of WTO commitments. The DS panel found that payments to domestic users were contingent on using domestic goods, qualifying as prohibited import substitution subsidies. Brazil argued that the U.S. GSM-102 program operated as a prohibited export subsidy under item (j) of Annex I of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Brazil claimed that the terms of U.S. export credit guarantee programs were effectively export subsidies inconsistent with WTO agreements. The U.S. argued that their programs were compliant with WTO obligations, deferring disciplines to the next negotiating round. The panel found that U.S. export credit guarantees functioned as export subsidies for all commodities benefiting from U.S. support programs, not just cotton. This included programs like the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program. Export credit guarantees for any recipient commodity were subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments. The panel found that U.S. export credit guarantees were in violation of previous WTO commitments for commodities supported under U.S. agricultural programs. Brazil argued that domestic farm subsidies to U.S. cotton growers led to overproduction and increased U.S. cotton exports, causing market disruptions. The rise in U.S. exports caused serious harm to Brazilian cotton exporters due to increased U.S. market share, displacement of Brazilian sales in third-country markets, and a decline in world cotton prices. Brazil claimed over $600 million in economic injury in 2001 alone. Brazil argued that these circumstances violated the SCM Agreement and would continue to harm them in the future. U.S. officials defended the subsidies provided to U.S. cotton growers as within WTO limits. The subsidies provided to U.S. cotton growers were defended as within WTO limits, with the argument that U.S. domestic use decline and international market forces played a larger role in determining weak price levels. The DS panel evaluated U.S. cotton support programs, separating them into two groups based on market price levels. The panel found that U.S. domestic support measures directly linked to market price levels caused market price suppression from 1999 to 2002. However, support measures not tied to market prices were not considered to have a significant impact. Brazil's claim of prejudice in international market share was also not supported. The panel ruled in Brazil's favor on the claim of serious prejudice during the 1999 to 2002 period, stating that certain prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn without delay to curtail the future threat posed by U.S. cotton support programs. The panel did not address Brazil's claims of threat going forward from 2003 to 2007. The panel ruled in Brazil's favor on the claim of serious prejudice during the 1999 to 2002 period, stating that certain prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn without delay. Brazil claimed that the ETI Act of 2000 constitutes an export subsidy for U.S. upland cotton exporters, but the panel agreed with the United States that Brazil failed to present new arguments or evidence regarding the effects on upland cotton. The panel ruled in Brazil's favor on the claim of serious prejudice during the 1999 to 2002 period, stating that certain prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn without delay. The United States appealed the ruling to the WTO Appellate Body, which upheld most of the initial panel's rulings. The AB recommended that the US withdraw identified prohibited subsidies within six months of the adoption of the panel report by the Dispute Settlement Body, with a deadline of July 1, 2005. The list of prohibited subsidies subject to withdrawal \"without delay\" included export credit guarantees for upland cotton and other unscheduled agricultural products, as well as excess rice exports. Step 2 program payments for upland cotton exporters and domestic users were also mentioned. Unscheduled agricultural products and scheduled agricultural product exports within their schedules were not subject to trade remedy actions. The United States was recommended to take appropriate steps by September 21, 2005, to remove these subsidies. The United States was recommended to remove adverse effects of certain subsidy measures by September 21, 2005, including marketing loan provisions, Step 2 payments, and CCP payments identified as \"actionable\" subsidies causing harm to Brazil during 1999-2002. Compliance with recommendations on prohibited subsidies could transform the measures significantly, addressing Brazil's claims of threat of serious prejudice. The implementation phase following the actionable subsidies recommendation aimed to address Brazil's claims of serious prejudice. If the United States failed to comply, Brazil could request negotiations for compensation, such as tariff reductions. The United States had the opportunity to delay compliance steps for imposing sanctions if Brazil did not want to proceed full force. The time track for compliance with panel and AB recommendations could vary depending on how the United States responded to rulings on prohibited subsidies and actionable subsidies. Prohibited subsidies were to be removed by July 1, 2005, as recommended by the AB. The United States intended to implement WTO recommendations by respecting obligations, but needed time to determine acceptable options. If no compensation agreement is reached by July 1, 2005, Brazil may request permission to impose limited trade sanctions. If no compensation agreement is reached by July 1, 2005, Brazil may request permission to impose limited trade sanctions up to the level of nullification or impairment of benefits. The DSB must authorize this within 15 days unless there is a consensus against it. If the US objects, arbitration will determine the level of suspension. No sanctions can be imposed during arbitration. Brazil can choose to wait after obtaining authorization, as seen in a previous WTO case involving the EC and the US. The EC refrained from immediate retaliatory measures against the US on May 7, 2003, opting to review US actions first. Additional duties on US products were imposed by the EC in March 2004. The panel recommended the US remove identified subsidies by September 21, 2005, following a similar timeline as prohibited subsidies. The U.S. Trade Representative expressed disappointment in the AB ruling on prohibited subsidies, but stated they would study the report carefully and work with Congress and farmers on next steps. The National Cotton Council of America also expressed disappointment and planned to coordinate a response with USTR and USDA. On July 1, 2005, USDA implemented a temporary fix for its export credit guarantee programs in response to a WTO finding that fees should be risk-based. The 1% cap on user fees for the GSM-102 program was cited as contributing to the subsidy component. USDA could not remove the cap due to statutory requirements. Additionally, the CCC stopped accepting applications for payment guarantees under GSM-103. The Step 2 cotton program authorized by the 2002 farm act was eliminated by a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The 2008 farm bill removed the GSM-103 and SCGP programs, and removed the 1% cap on fees under the GSM-102 program. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to ensure that risk-based fees cover operating costs and losses over the long-term, defined as 10 or more years. The WTO panel indicated that the \"long-term\" period is likely around two years, with a net loss in one year needing to be offset by a net gain in the following year. The Administration believed it had made enough program changes to comply with prohibited and actionable subsidies. Brazil requested authorization from the WTO to impose $3 billion in countermeasures against prohibited U.S. subsidies. Trade sanctions are limited under WTO rules. The WTO panel indicated a two-year \"long-term\" period for offsetting losses and gains. Brazil requested $3 billion in countermeasures against U.S. subsidies, later reduced to $1.155 billion. The U.S. and Brazil temporarily suspended arbitration over the sanctions. Brazil requested authorization from the WTO to impose $1.037 billion in countermeasures against U.S. price-contingent programs. Brazil argued that limiting retaliation to punitive tariffs on U.S. goods alone would have a more negative impact on the Brazilian economy and consumers than on U.S. exporters due to economic disparities. Brazil proposed suspending tariff concessions and obligations under WTO rules. Brazil proposed to suspend tariff concessions and obligations under WTO rules in the amount of $1.307 billion until the United States withdrew four domestic subsidies or removed their adverse effects. This \"cross-retaliation\" has precedent in WTO cases and could impact copyrights, trademarks, patents, and services related to communication, construction, finance, tourism, and transport. The United States objected to Brazil's proposal. The United States objected to Brazil's proposed request for WTO arbitration over sanctions related to domestic subsidies. A procedural agreement was reached in December 2005, suspending further retaliation proceedings. Brazil initially showed willingness to allow U.S. farm programs to come into compliance with WTO rulings through the legislative process. Brazil requested a WTO compliance panel to review the U.S. GSM-102 program, citing below-market premium rates as the reason for non-compliance. The panel upheld Brazil's claim, showing that the program continued to operate at a net loss. The GSM-102 premium rates were found to be below-market rates due to inadequate consideration of country risk. The Compliance Panel used OECD measures to compare rates, revealing significant undervaluation. Brazil raised concerns about U.S. farm programs supporting cotton producers, leading to a compliance panel review by the WTO. The WTO compliance panel reviewed U.S. farm program changes related to cotton support programs. The panel's final ruling, upheld by the WTO Appellate Body, found that the United States had not fully complied with the March 2005 WTO ruling. The AB report on the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body was adopted on June 25, 2008. Brazil requested a review of proposed retaliatory countermeasures in August 2008. Brazil and the United States agreed on arbitration panelists in October 2008. The arbitration review extended into 2009, with Brazil revising its retaliation request to $2.5 billion in March 2009. Brazil sought two countermeasures: a one-time payment of $350 million related to the Step 2 program and annual countermeasures of $1.155 billion for export transactions involving rice, pork, and poultry. Brazil requested countermeasures valued at $1.037 billion annually for export sales to noncreditworthy foreign obligors, and the right to engage in cross-retaliation in sectors outside of trade in goods, such as U.S. copyrights and patents. The United States argued that it had removed the prohibited subsidy component of its export credit program and operated its remaining GSM-102 program at \"no net cost\" to the government since 2005. They asked arbitrators to dismiss claims related to prohibited subsidies as they currently operate at no cost. The US also pointed out that Brazil's countermeasure request included a program that no longer exists. The United States argued that Brazil's countermeasure request included a calculation for the global adverse effect, not just Brazil's. The arbitrator ruled on Brazil's retaliation requests for prohibited and actionable subsidies, with decisions being final. The arbitrator's decisions on Brazil's countermeasure requests were final and not subject to appeal. Brazil was not entitled to a $350 million retaliation award for previous Step 2 injury. The arbitrator found that Brazil could only retaliate for the effects of \"prohibited\" subsidies on Brazilian products. The arbitrator estimated Brazil's countermeasure at $147.4 million in FY2006, based on the effects of subsidies on Brazilian products. The retaliatory amount would vary annually based on exporter applications under the GSM 102 program. The WTO arbitrator determined that Brazil should be entitled to an annual countermeasure amount of $147.3 million, based on the adverse effects of U.S. subsidies on the world price of cotton. The WTO arbitrator determined that Brazil should be entitled to an annual retaliation amount of $147.3 million, based on Brazil's share of cotton production in the ROW in marketing year 2005. This fixed amount will not vary annually and is part of the overall permissible retaliation amount for 2006, which was $294.7 million. Brazil also requested the right to engage in cross-retaliation in sectors outside of trade. The WTO arbitrator ruled that Brazil could engage in cross-retaliation, particularly in intellectual property rights like copyrights and patents. Brazil argued that retaliatory action in consumer goods with the US would harm its economy, but the panel found that some imports could be subject to countermeasures without causing harm. As a result, Brazil was entitled to retaliate. The WTO panel ruled that Brazil could engage in cross-retaliation if the retaliation amount exceeds a set threshold. An initial threshold amount of $409.7 million was established based on Brazil's imports of consumer goods in 2007. This amount represents the value of goods where the U.S. share is less than 20%, excluding essential items like books and automotive parts. The WTO panel ruled that Brazil could engage in cross-retaliation if the retaliation amount exceeds a set threshold of $409.7 million, based on Brazil's imports of consumer goods in 2007. Brazil claimed that applying the panel's countermeasure determination formulas to preliminary 2009 data would allow for $800 million in total retaliation, including $147.3 million of actionable subsidy countermeasures and $650 million of prohibited subsidy countermeasures due to expanded use of GSM 102 credit guarantees by the United States. According to Brazil, using 2009 data to calculate the threshold for cross-retaliation would result in an amount of $460 million. This would authorize Brazil to engage in cross-retaliation up to $340 million by suspending commitments made under the WTO regarding intellectual property and services. USTR spokeswoman Carol Guthrie expressed disappointment with the dispute outcome but noted that Brazil was awarded far less than the requested countermeasures. Initially, Brazil requested over $4 billion annually, but during arbitration, they argued for more than $2 billion annually. The Arbitrators denied Brazil's request for unlimited ability to suspend concessions on intellectual property or services and an additional one-time $350 million in countermeasures for cotton. The U.S. industry groups argued that the GSM 102 program now operates in a fully WTO-compliant manner. The Administration will consult on how to move forward. The NCC argued that changes to the marketing loan and CCP programs had made them more WTO-compliant. They complained that the WTO arbitration ruling was based on outdated data and called for a new compliance panel. Brazil could still proceed with WTO-authorized retaliation even if the US initiated a new compliance panel. Brazil had approval to initiate sanctions against the United States following a WTO arbitrator's ruling. The decisions were final, and Brazil could choose products for retaliatory tariffs and target IP and services rights. Brazil requested authorization from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body before proceeding with retaliation. Approval is decided by reverse consensus, requiring WTO members to decide. On November 19, 2009, the WTO agreed to grant Brazil authorization to impose countermeasures against the United States. Brazil was authorized to impose trade retaliation of up to $829.3 million in U.S. goods in 2010. Brazil was granted authorization by the WTO to impose countermeasures against the United States in 2010, totaling $829.3 million. This included $147.3 million for U.S. price-contingent subsidies and $682 million for U.S. export credit guarantees. A threshold value of $561 million was set for permissible cross-retaliatory countermeasures, leaving $268.3 million for eligible countermeasures. Brazil released a final list of U.S. goods subject to import tariffs. Brazil released a preliminary list of U.S. patents and intellectual property rights it could restrict, including the temporary suspension of U.S. patents on pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and biotechnology, and the restriction of copyrights in the music and audiovisual industry. The United States and Brazil sought a last-minute negotiated settlement to avoid retaliatory measures, with Brazil stating it would only apply sanctions if the U.S. refused to eliminate its cotton subsidies. The United States and Brazil were in negotiations regarding Brazil's threat to restrict U.S. patents and intellectual property rights in response to U.S. cotton subsidies. Brazil proposed compensation for damages until a reform bill was approved, including U.S. investments in cotton research and increased imports of Brazilian products. There were concerns that the U.S. could retaliate by suspending trade privileges under its Generalized System of Preferences. The Brazil-U.S. Business Council and other organizations expressed concerns about Brazil's potential trade retaliation. Steven Bipes suggested a two-stage settlement process involving U.S. government action on trade issues and changes to U.S. cotton subsidies. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative and USDA Under Secretary met to discuss the matter on April 1, 2010. On April 5, 2010, the United States proposed a settlement to Brazil regarding a trade dispute over U.S. cotton subsidies. Brazil's Foreign Trade Council approved a resolution postponing WTO-approved countermeasures until April 22. The U.S. proposed a $147.3 million fund annually for technical assistance to Brazil's cotton sector until a solution is reached or the next U.S. farm bill is passed. The United States agreed to make modifications to the GSM-102 Export Credit Guarantee Program and engage in technical discussions with Brazil. USDA cancelled unutilized balances from the program for FY2010 and announced a new guarantee fee rate schedule. The U.S. also agreed to recognize Santa Catarina as free of certain diseases by April 16, 2010. The USDA is evaluating the risk of importing fresh beef from Brazil to prevent the introduction of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) into the United States. Brazil extended negotiations for 60 days following the conclusion of an MOU and proposed rule on meat imports from Santa Catarina. Brazil extended negotiations for 60 days to resolve U.S. compliance with WTO ruling on farm subsidies. The U.S. proposal received mixed reactions, with supporters of farm programs in favor and critics opposed. The establishment of a $147.3 million fund for Brazil's cotton sector was a point of contention. The annual fund to support Brazil's cotton sector was described as subsidy payments needed to allow subsidy payments to U.S. cotton farmers. U.S. and Brazilian trade negotiators reached a framework agreement in the WTO to resolve the Cotton Dispute, avoiding trade retaliation by Brazil. Brazil has suspended trade retaliation pending U.S. compliance with the agreement, which includes quarterly discussions on trade-distorting measures. The framework agreement with Brazil includes discussions on limits to U.S. cotton subsidies and changes to the GSM-102 program. The annual limit on U.S. domestic support for upland cotton will be significantly lower than past levels. Semi-annual reviews will evaluate changes to the GSM-102 program, including reducing the contract length to 16 months by the end of 2012. The GSM-102 contract length will be reduced to 16 months by the end of 2012, with benchmarks set for changes in premiums based on performance. The $5.5 billion annual export credit guarantee value remains, split into two six-month tranches. Operational reviews every six months will determine premium adjustments based on usage compared to $2.7 billion limit. If usage exceeds $1.3 billion, premiums increase by 11%, and if it exceeds $1.5 billion, premiums increase by 15% for the following period. The United States has agreed to pay $147.3 million annually into a Brazilian fund for technical assistance and capacity building for Brazil's cotton sector. Both parties to the dispute have said that a final mutually agreed solution would not be possible until after the 2012 farm bill. The GSM-102 semi-annual operational reviews will coincide with the relevant quarterly cotton program discussions. The United States began making payments to the Brazilian Cotton Institute (BCI) in June 2010, starting with $34.3 million followed by monthly payments of $12.275 million. The BCI's board of directors includes private-sector and government representatives, with Harold Cunha as the first executive director. They are limited by a negotiated list of \"acceptable uses\" for the funds. The United States provides funding to the Brazilian Cotton Institute for activities like pest control and equipment purchase, with restrictions on direct subsidies for cotton production. Regular meetings are held to review the U.S. GSM-102 program, with the latest review in October 2010 evaluating credit guarantee usage against a $1.3 billion threshold. Despite $1.39 billion in applications, officials agreed on actual usage levels. The officials agreed that the actual usage of GSM-102 was close to the $1.3 billion threshold but did not exceed it due to cancellations. The average loan tenor exceeded the target of 16 months, prompting the United States to make changes to the program to lower the weighted-average tenor. One suggestion was to raise fees for longer tenors to incentivize the use of shorter ones. In February 2011, USDA raised fees for credit guarantees with longer tenors to promote shorter tenors. The second review in April 2011 showed GSM-102 usage exceeded $1.5 billion, leading to a 15% fee increase. The fee hikes aim to reduce the average tenor length for transactions. USDA increased fees more for longer loan tenors than shorter ones, with a goal to lower annual spending on domestic cotton support. During meetings in October, discussions were held on U.S. domestic cotton support, aiming to cap annual spending on trade-distorting programs. Brazilian officials expressed interest in future talks with U.S. Agricultural Committees. An agreement in April led to expedited publication of a rule on animal disease status in Brazil. In November 2010, USDA published a final rule amending regulations for importing animals and animal products. The United States is modifying disease status for the Brazilian State of Santa Catarina, making it easier for pork and live swine to enter the U.S. Brazil inquired about a proposed rule for increased meat imports from 14 additional states, but U.S. officials did not provide a timeline. The issue of U.S. cotton programs complying with WTO rulings was also discussed. Several Members of Congress have criticized the terms imposed on the United States in the MOU negotiated with Brazil to avoid trade retaliation. Bills and amendments have been introduced to alter or prevent U.S. compliance with the MOU, particularly regarding the annual payment to the Brazilian Cotton Institute. Representative Kind introduced an amendment to prevent payments to the BCI, which would bring the United States into compliance. The Kind amendment, aimed at preventing payments to the Brazil Cotton Institute, failed in a floor vote. Two amendments during the House Appropriations Committee's markup of the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill also addressed the issue of funds for the BCI, with one provision prohibiting payments in FY2012 and another reducing outlays to U.S. upland cotton producers. During the House floor debate on H.R. 2112, Representative Flake's amendment to reduce payments to U.S. upland cotton producers by $147.3 million was removed due to a point of order. However, Representative Kind's amendment to prohibit payments to the Brazil Cotton Institute passed with a vote of 223-197. Another amendment by Representative Flake aimed to prohibit any funds from being used for price-contingent payments. The Kind amendment, which aimed to prohibit payments to the Brazil Cotton Institute, passed during the House debate on H.R. 2112. However, a second amendment to ban funds for price-contingent cotton programs failed to pass. The final version of H.R. 2112, signed into law in November 2011, did not include the Kind amendment. Congress is expected to address the next farm bill in 2012. The National Cotton Council (NCC) recommends changes to the U.S. cotton program in the 2012 farm bill, proposing to replace direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and ACRE programs with a revenue-based crop insurance program. This program would involve modest enhancements to existing crop insurance products and adjustments to the upland cotton marketing loan program. The NCC suggests using a modified Group Risk Income Protection (GRIP) type of insurance program at the county level. The NCC proposes a revenue-based crop insurance program for U.S. cotton farms, with a fixed reference price and marketing loan adjustments based on a two-year moving average of USDA's Adjusted World Price. If the average AWP falls below 47 cents/lb, the marketing loan rate would be set at 47 cents/lb. Brazil retains privileges under the MOU with the U.S. Brazil retains significant privileges in determining if proposed changes to the U.S. cotton program comply with WTO commitments. The arbitration ruling in favor of Brazil could lead to cross-retaliation measures expanding into TRIPS and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Developing countries, including African cotton producers, are closely monitoring the U.S. response to the WTO cotton ruling. The proposal to the WTO calls for a global agreement to end production-related support for cotton growers of all WTO-member countries. Trade experts are concerned about potential implications for other field crops and export credit guarantees. Brazil argued that fees for the GSM program did not cover the U.S. government's costs, which was confirmed by the WTO panel. This could require legislative changes to the U.S. farm bill. The GSM-102 program needs to set higher premium rates to cover operating costs and comply with WTO regulations. Adjusting fees based on OECD minimum rates could save $302 million annually. Price-contingent cotton programs must be adjusted to avoid program losses. Adjusting price-contingent cotton programs to align with market prices is necessary to comply with regulations. By setting trigger prices based on market averages, payments could decrease significantly. CCC outlays to cotton producers have accounted for a significant portion of payments, averaging over $1.8 billion annually since 2003. During the 2007-2009 period, cotton receipts surged to a 66% share of total CCC outlays due to high world commodity prices. In 2010, cotton prices have moved above program trigger levels, raising concerns about reclassification of PFC and direct payments. The panel found that U.S. direct payments do not qualify for WTO exemptions as fully decoupled income support. This does not involve compliance measures or reclassification of payments as \"amber box.\" The panel did not recommend reclassifying PFC and DP payments as \"amber box,\" which could impact future dispute settlement cases and the US's ability to meet WTO commitments. Concerns were raised about the failure of US \"decoupled\" payments to meet green box criteria, potentially leaving them open to charges and emboldening other countries. The EU may also be concerned about this finding. The EU's agricultural program, like the U.S., relies on \"decoupled\" payments. Canada and Brazil have initiated a WTO dispute against the U.S. for incorrectly categorizing payments, leading to the U.S. exceeding its WTO-agreed spending limit. U.S. cotton subsidies are also under challenge at the WTO. The Doha Development Agenda aims for reductions in trade-distorting domestic program support. A new round of domestic spending limitations could potentially cap U.S. commodity spending, leading to lower program outlays. Four African cotton-producing countries have proposed a global agreement to end production-related support for cotton growers. The United States, while not fully agreeing with the proposal, collaborated with the African countries in the WTO's Doha Round framework to address concerns. Cotton is the only commodity specifically mentioned in the framework. Cotton is the only commodity singled out for special mention in the framework. Congress will closely monitor developments in the WTO cotton case and the Doha Round of trade negotiations. Congressional hearings and consultations with the Administration will be key in expressing views on the dispute and negotiating issues. Countries have five options when faced with a negative WTO dispute settlement ruling. Congress is responsible for passing farm program legislation that complies with U.S. commitments in international trade agreements. The United States has already made changes to comply with the AB's recommendations on \"prohibited subsidies\" by eliminating certain programs and components in the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill provision requires the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the industry to ensure risk-based fees cover operating costs and losses. Questions remain about addressing adverse effects charges related to price-contingent subsidies. The bill offers higher levels of price and income support, potentially aggravating adverse effects in the marketplace. Several proposed changes are relevant to the Brazil cotton industry. The 2008 farm bill extends counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan provisions, raises target prices and loan rates for commodities, offers a revenue-based support option under the ACRE program, and creates a new cotton-user payment. These changes are relevant to the Brazil cotton case and program vulnerability to WTO challenge. The 2008 farm bill introduces a new cotton-user payment that is similar to the WTO-illegal Step 2 payment but allows cotton from all origins to be eligible. This loophole may face a WTO challenge in the future. The bill also extends direct payments without addressing disqualification issues related to planting restrictions. This has implications for the AMS case against the United States by Canada and other countries. The U.S. faces a WTO case from Canada and Brazil regarding its AMS exceeding limits. The outcome of the Doha negotiations could impact Brazil's interest in the case. The 112th Congress will monitor the WTO cotton case and Doha negotiations closely."
