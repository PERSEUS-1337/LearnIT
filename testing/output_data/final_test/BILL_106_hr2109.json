    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Northern Ireland Peace Act\". It includes findings related to the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Congress finds that since the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland started using plastic bullets as weapons, thousands have been injured and 17 individuals, including seven children, have been killed. Over 54,000 rounds of plastic bullets have been fired since 1973, replacing rubber bullets. Plastic bullets are often used in a sectarian manner, as seen during the Drumcree standoff where 5,942 rounds were fired, with 5,500 targeted at Catholic Nationalists. Before the Drumcree standoff, civil liberties groups urged the chief constable in Northern Ireland to permanently stop using plastic bullets due to their harmful effects, including maimings and loss of eyesight. The United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets claims that their use has led to further alienation. The use of plastic bullets in Northern Ireland has increased distrust of the UK security forces and contributed to destabilization. Efforts to acquire dangerous weapons endanger Catholics. The Committee on the Administration of Justice reported that plastic bullets exacerbate riots. The European Parliament has called for a ban on plastic bullets due to their intimidating use. The UK government has banned the use of plastic bullets during riots in Great Britain due to their dangerous and lethal nature. The United States policy is to prevent the United Kingdom from supporting violence in Northern Ireland by restricting the import, manufacture, and transport of plastic bullets for use against predominantly Catholic areas. Additionally, the sale or export of plastic bullets to the United Kingdom is prohibited. The sale or export of plastic bullets to the United Kingdom, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary, is prohibited. The President has the authority to enforce this prohibition under the Arms Export Control Act. Bilateral and multilateral initiatives are in place to limit the sale or export of plastic bullets to the United Kingdom. The President is required to establish diplomatic initiatives to limit the sale of plastic bullets to the United Kingdom, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Reports on the success of these efforts must be submitted to Congress every 6 months. The Secretary of State must include incidents involving the use of plastic bullets in Northern Ireland in the annual human rights report. Plastic bullets are defined as rock-hard polyvinyl chloride projectiles that are 4 inches long, 1.5 inches in diameter, weigh 4.75 ounces, and are usually off-white in color."
