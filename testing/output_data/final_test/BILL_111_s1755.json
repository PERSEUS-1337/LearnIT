    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Enhancement Act of 2009\". Congress acknowledges the valuable public service provided by nearly 700,000 licensed amateur radio operators in the US, especially in disaster communications. These operators have consistently offered emergency and disaster relief communications services during various crises. Amateur Radio Service has formal agreements for volunteer emergency communications with various agencies and disaster relief organizations. These agreements have been utilized in significant events such as hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Hugo, and Andrew, the 2001 terrorist attacks, and the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directs coordination between emergency organizations and amateur radio operators to facilitate effective communication during emergencies. The Amateur Radio Service provides technical self-training in modern telecommunications, electronic technology, and emergency communications. There is a strong Federal interest in supporting and protecting Amateur Radio stations against unreasonable regulation to ensure valuable communications during emergencies. The Amateur Radio Service is being studied for enhanced emergency and disaster relief communication and to relieve restrictions. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to conduct a study on the uses of Amateur Radio Service communications in emergencies and disaster relief within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The study will review the importance of amateur radio emergency communications for homeland security missions and make recommendations for enhancing the voluntary deployment of amateur radio licensees in disaster and emergency communications efforts. The Secretary of Homeland Security is mandated to conduct a study on the use of Amateur Radio Service communications in emergencies and disaster relief. The study aims to identify obstacles to improved communication, such as private land use regulations affecting antenna installations, and make recommendations to enhance the involvement of amateur radio operators in disaster response efforts. Expertise from stakeholder entities, including amateur radio, emergency response, and disaster communications communities, will be utilized in the study. The Senate passed the bill on December 14, 2009. Attest: NANCY ERICKSON, Secretary."
