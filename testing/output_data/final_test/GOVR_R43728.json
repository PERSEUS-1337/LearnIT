    "content": "This report addresses Common Core State Standards and federal involvement in education. States were required to develop standards and assessments in math, reading, and science under the No Child Left Behind Act. States were mandated to adopt assessments in science at three grade levels by the end of the 2007-2008 school year, with standards including three levels of performance. Title VI-A of the ESEA provides grants for states to develop and administer these assessments, allowing flexibility in selecting content and performance standards. This has led to diverse accountability systems across states. The Common Core State Standards Initiative was developed in response to the need for consistent expectations in student education to prepare them for global competition and employment. Led by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, these standards aim to define the knowledge and skills students should have from K-12 to succeed in college and workforce training programs. Adoption of the Common Core State Standards is optional, with 43 states, the District of Columbia, 4 outlying areas, and the Department of Defense Education Activity having adopted them. Indiana and Oklahoma were the first states to adopt and discontinue use of the standards. South Carolina plans to fully implement the standards for the 2014-2015 school year before replacing them with new, high-level standards. South Carolina plans to fully implement the Common Core State Standards for the 2014-2015 school year but will be replaced by new, high-level College and Career Ready standards in the 2015-2016 school year. Minnesota has adopted ELA Common Core State Standards but not for mathematics. Alaska, Nebraska, Texas, Virginia, and Puerto Rico have not adopted the Common Core State Standards. The Obama Administration incentivized adoption through Race to the Top State Grants, RTT Assessment Grants, and ESEA flexibility package. Under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, over $4 billion in grants were awarded to 18 states and the District of Columbia for implementing education reforms, including internationally-benchmarked standards and assessments to prepare students for college and the workplace. States received additional points for participating in a consortium developing common K-12 standards. States were awarded points for adopting common K-12 standards by specified deadlines. As of August 2, 2010, 30 states and the District of Columbia had adopted such standards. States were evaluated based on their commitment to improving assessment quality through participation in a consortium of states working on common, high-quality assessments aligned with K-12 standards. States could earn the highest points by joining a consortium with a majority of states. As of July 30, 2014, 34 states and the District of Columbia were still participating in consortia to develop assessments aligned with common standards under the RTT State Grant program. The RTT State Grants program incentivized states to adopt and implement the Common Core State Standards for assessments. Federal funding supported the development of these assessments, which may have otherwise lacked funding. States could potentially use federal funds from State Assessment Grants to support joint development efforts. The ESEA flexibility package announced by President Obama and the Secretary of Education in 2011 provides waivers for states from NCLB requirements. States approved for ESEA flexibility in 2012-2013 can apply for a one-year extension. The waivers exempt states from academic accountability, teacher qualifications, and funding flexibility requirements. State educational agencies must meet four principles established by ED to receive the waivers. To receive waivers from NCLB requirements, state educational agencies must adhere to four principles set by the Department of Education. These principles focus on improving student academic achievement and instruction quality, including adopting college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and mathematics, implementing state-developed recognition and support systems, promoting effective instruction and leadership, and reducing unnecessary burdens. States applying for ESEA flexibility must choose between common standards or state-approved college- and career-ready standards in their application. Nearly every state approved for ESEA flexibility has chosen to implement Common Core State Standards in reading/language arts and mathematics, with some states opting for their own standards approved by state institutions of higher education. For example, Minnesota uses Common Core for ELA but not for math, which is based on Minnesota's own standards. Virginia, Texas, and Alaska are using their own standards instead of Common Core for math. States must develop high-quality assessments for grades 3-8 and high school to receive waivers. There are three options for meeting assessment requirements. The SEA has developed and begun administering \"high-quality assessments\" independent of the state consortia funded by RTT. RTT program and ESEA waivers incentivized the adoption of Common Core, but did not explicitly require it. Critics have raised concerns about the financial and regulatory incentives provided under these programs. The financial and regulatory incentives under the RTT program and flexibility waivers are seen as unconstitutionally coercive as they made it difficult for states to reject the Common Core State Standards. While participation in such programs is typically viewed as voluntary, some states have chosen not to adopt the standards or seek waivers. The Supreme Court has generally considered participation in grant programs with federal requirements as voluntary, with rare instances of coercion being deemed unconstitutional. States are required to adopt academic standards to receive Title I-A funding, including content and performance standards. Content standards specify what students should know, while performance standards define proficiency. Achievement standards connect content standards to student knowledge and skills. Standards are not the same as curriculum or instructional methods. The development and use of curriculum is essential for operationalizing state standards, according to the ED. While standards and curriculum are different concepts, alignment is necessary for students to demonstrate proficiency on state assessments. Critics of the Common Core State Standards fear national standards and assessments. Despite efforts by the Obama Administration to support standards and assessments aligned with the Common Core State Standards, each state can still add their own standards. This results in each state having a unique set of standards that share common elements with other states. As a result, there will be at least two different assessments linked to the Common Core State Standards, with some states planning to use assessments other than those being developed by PARCC and Smarter Balanced. The Common Core State Standards are not a national curriculum, but rather guidelines for what needs to be taught. States can choose how to teach these standards and prepare students for assessments. Collaboration among states could lead to shared teaching materials aligned with the standards. The use of developed materials aligned with the Common Core State Standards could lead to multiple states using similar materials in the classroom. RTT State Grant and ESEA flexibility waiver requirements aim to increase states implementing teacher and school leader evaluation systems based on student achievement. Student assessments under ESEA Title I-A could determine student achievement for evaluation systems. RTT State Grants incentivize states to develop evaluation systems based on student growth. The RTT application defines student growth as the change in student achievement over time, based on state assessments and other rigorous measures. Teacher and principal effectiveness will be determined in part by student growth on assessments, including those aligned with the Common Core State Standards. To receive ESEA flexibility, educational agencies must develop evaluation systems using multiple valid measures, including student growth data. The implementation of new state ELA and mathematics standards, assessments, and teacher evaluations is moving quickly, causing concerns among educators. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers support the Common Core State Standards but criticize the timeline for implementing associated curriculum and evaluations. In the last year, the Department of Education has announced flexibility for states in using student growth data for teacher and principal evaluations. States without laws meeting ESEA requirements may not receive additional flexibility. Congress may address federal involvement in state standards and accountability during ESEA reauthorization. Congress could amend the ESEA to require states to use Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments, or allow states to choose their own standards. Another option is for Congress to maintain current law, which permits states to select their own standards. Additionally, Congress could eliminate incentives for using Common Core State Standards. The Administration incentivizes the use of Common Core State Standards by prohibiting conditioning grants on their adoption. Congress may consider changing the requirement to \"college- and career-ready standards,\" potentially including Common Core."
