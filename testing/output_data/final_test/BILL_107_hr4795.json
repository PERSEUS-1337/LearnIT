    "content": "The Act titled \"Chronic Wasting Disease Support for States Act of 2002\" defines chronic wasting disease as a transmissible nervous system disease affecting deer and elk. It belongs to a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The term \"Indian tribe\" is defined as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Congress acknowledges the States' authority in wildlife management, particularly in addressing chronic wasting disease in cervids. The increasing threat of this fatal neurological disease requires intensified research, surveillance, and management efforts to contain its spread. The Federal Government should provide financial and technical support to States managing chronic wasting disease in cervid populations. Federal agencies should offer consistent support structures for State wildlife and agricultural administrators to prevent the disease from spreading between captive and wild cervids. The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and other Federal authorities can provide integrated support systems under existing legal authorities. SEC. 101. NATIONAL DATABASE REGARDING CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE. The Secretary of the Interior will establish and maintain the official national database for surveillance and monitoring data on chronic wasting disease in wild and captive cervid populations. The database will also include relevant information from other sources, such as foreign governments, and will be available for use by Federal and State agencies, Indian tribes, and foreign entities. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a national database for chronic wasting disease data, to be used by Federal and State agencies, research institutions, and international wildlife authorities. The Department of Agriculture will collect data for the database, and $1,500,000 is authorized for its establishment and maintenance. SEC. 102. Surveillance and monitoring program for chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds. The Secretary of the Interior will develop a national surveillance program to monitor chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds, including identifying infection rates, spread causes, and potential reservoirs. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to States and Indian tribes for program implementation. Cooperation with State and tribal agencies will be sought in developing the program. The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will establish uniform standards for collecting and assessing samples for the surveillance program on chronic wasting disease. $3,000,000 is authorized for the program, with funds remaining available until expended. Support for state efforts to manage and control chronic wasting disease is authorized with $3,000,000 allocated for a surveillance program. The Secretary of the Interior will allocate funds to States or tribes for managing chronic wasting disease based on the incidence of the disease on their lands. Priority will be given to those with the highest incidence. The Secretary of the Interior will allocate funds to States or tribes for managing chronic wasting disease based on the incidence of the disease on their lands, with priority given to those with the highest incidence. This includes state or tribal expenditures on management, monitoring, surveillance, and research, as well as comprehensive and integrated policies and programs focused on chronic wasting disease management. Rapid response to new outbreaks is also emphasized. Authorization of $10,000,000 to support State and tribal efforts in managing chronic wasting disease, with funds remaining available until expended. Expansion of research on chronic wasting disease by the United States Geological Survey, including detection, genetic resistance, tissue, and environmental studies, with an authorization of $3,000,000. Additionally, a surveillance and monitoring program is established for captive herds of deer and elk. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop a surveillance program to identify chronic wasting disease infection rates in captive deer and elk herds, determine the spread causes, and identify potential infection reservoirs. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to States and Indian tribes for program implementation. Cooperation with State and tribal agencies managing the disease is required. The Secretary of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, will establish uniform standards for collecting and assessing samples for chronic wasting disease surveillance. $2,000,000 is authorized for the surveillance program, with funds remaining available until expended. SEC. 202. EXPANSION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING CAPACITY. Expansion of diagnostic testing capacity includes upgrading federal and certified laboratories to handle the anticipated sample load from surveillance programs for chronic wasting disease. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories will continue to conduct testing, but current capacity is insufficient. The Secretary of Agriculture will oversee the upgrading of federal facilities to ensure timely processing of samples. The Secretary of Agriculture will make grants to upgrade certified laboratories for timely processing of samples from surveillance programs. $2,500,000 is authorized for this purpose. Expansion of Agricultural Research Service Research to focus on chronic wasting disease, including detection, genetic resistance, tissue studies, and environmental research. $1,000,000 authorized for this purpose. Additionally, expansion of Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service supported research and education. The Secretary of Agriculture will expand research and educational efforts on chronic wasting disease. $4,000,000 is authorized for this purpose, with 75% for research and 25% for education. To ensure compatibility of surveillance and monitoring programs required by the Act, the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture will jointly create rules. Prompt implementation is necessary due to the serious consequences of chronic wasting disease. The rules will be promulgated without following certain procedures. The Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture will jointly create rules for surveillance and monitoring programs related to chronic wasting disease. The rules will be promulgated without delay, using authority provided under section 808 of title 5, United States Code."
