    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Transparency in Assertion of Patents Act\" and aims to promote transparency in the assertion of patents. The Federal Trade Commission will create rules to prevent deceptive acts in written communication alleging patent infringement. The rules will require detailed disclosures including patent numbers and product descriptions. The rules created by the Federal Trade Commission will mandate detailed disclosures in written communication alleging patent infringement, including the manufacturer and model number of the product, a description of how the product infringes, notice of the right to defend against infringement, and contact information for identifying individuals with a financial interest in the patent. The Federal Trade Commission rules require detailed disclosures in written communication alleging patent infringement, including information about individuals with a financial interest in the patent, licensing commitments, compensation calculation methods, and patent reexamination instances. The Federal Trade Commission rules mandate disclosures in written communication regarding patent infringement allegations, including details about patent review, litigation history, and any determinations of patent invalidity. The Commission may exempt certain written communications from disclosure requirements if they are deemed unnecessary for consumer protection or the Act's purposes. Rules will be established to prevent unfair or deceptive assertions in written communications. The Federal Trade Commission will promulgate rules to prohibit unfair or deceptive assertions in written communication related to patent infringement. This includes false threats of legal action, assertions lacking factual basis, and those likely to mislead recipients. The Commission will also provide consumer education on unfair patent assertions and enforce these rules accordingly. Enforcement of the Act will be carried out by the Commission and State Attorneys General, with penalties and privileges aligned with the Federal Trade Commission Act. The State Attorney General, as parens patriae, may bring a civil action in federal court on behalf of residents if their interests are threatened by a violation of a rule under the Act. This action can seek to stop the violation, ensure compliance, obtain damages or compensation, and impose civil penalties. The State Attorney General can bring a civil action in federal court on behalf of residents to address violations of rules under the Act. Civil penalties may be imposed for each violation, with the amount calculated based on the number of violations and adjusted for inflation annually. The State can bring a civil action in federal court for violations of rules under the Act, with penalties based on the number of violations and adjusted for inflation annually. The Consumer Price Index was published the previous year. The Commission has the right to intervene in the civil action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. The State can bring a civil action in federal court for violations of rules under the Act, with penalties based on the number of violations and adjusted for inflation annually. The Commission has the right to intervene in the civil action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. If the Commission has initiated a civil action, no State attorney general or official may bring a similar action during that time. State attorney generals can still conduct investigations under their state laws. The Act allows the State to conduct investigations, administer oaths, compel witnesses, and produce evidence. It does not limit the Commission's authority or affect patent laws."
