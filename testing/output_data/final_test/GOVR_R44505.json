    "content": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designated 8 of its 11 operating divisions as components of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), including agencies like CDC, FDA, and NIH. These PHS agencies provide essential public health services with varying missions, such as research conducted by NIH and AHRQ. AHRQ conducts research on healthcare quality and effectiveness. IHS supports healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives. HRSA funds programs to improve healthcare access for low-income populations. SAMHSA funds mental health and substance abuse services. CDC develops community-based public health programs. The ATSDR, headed by the CDC director, identifies health effects from hazardous substances. FDA ensures safety of foods, drugs, and tobacco products to protect public health. PHS agencies like AHRQ, CDC, and NIH operate under the Public Health Service Act. The PHS agencies derive their authority from various acts such as the FFDCA, SSA, and Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Funding for these agencies comes from the annual appropriations process through different appropriations acts. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations act funds FDA, while the Agriculture appropriations act funds HHS. The HHS Secretary has limited authority to transfer funds within the department, with restrictions on the amount that can be transferred and notification requirements to Congress. This transfer authority was used in FY2013 and FY2014 to provide additional funding to CMS for ACA implementation, with NIH being a primary source of transfers. In FY2013 and FY2014, funds were transferred within HHS to support ACA implementation, with NIH being a primary source of transfers. The HHS Secretary has limited authority to transfer funds within the department, with restrictions on the amount that can be transferred and notification requirements to Congress. Additionally, Section 241 of the PHSA authorizes the HHS Secretary to use a portion of funds appropriated for programs authorized by the PHSA for evaluation purposes. The HHS Budget Office assesses appropriations of various programs, with a set-aside limit of 1% under the PHSA. However, recent LHHS appropriations acts have set the cap higher, at 2.5% since FY2010. After the LHHS appropriations act is passed, funds are calculated and transferred to recipient agencies for evaluation purposes. Table 1 displays the total assessments and transfers for FY2013, showing which agencies were net donors or recipients of set-aside funds. In FY2013, NIH and HRSA were net donors of set-aside funds, while AHRQ, CDC, and SAMHSA were net recipients. ACF and various offices within the OS also received set-aside funds. In FY2016, significant changes were made to set-aside funds, with NIH becoming a net recipient of funding, while AHRQ and CDC became net donors. AHRQ received a discretionary appropriation in FY2015 for the first time in over a decade, instead of set-aside funding. In FY2016, PHS agencies received funding through various sources including mandatory funding, user fees, and third-party collections. The ACA allocated billions in mandatory spending for grant programs and established trust funds to support agency programs. The Community Health Center Fund received $11 billion annually from FY2011-FY2015 to support PHS activities. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) received $11 billion annually from FY2011-FY2015 to support federal health centers and the National Health Service Corps. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) provided additional funding of $3.910 billion for each of FY2016 and FY2017. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) supports prevention and public health programs, with CDC receiving the majority of funds. The HHS Secretary transferred almost half of the FY2013 PPHF funds to CMS for ACA implementation. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports comparative effectiveness research over a 10-year period with a mix of appropriations and transfers from Medicare trust funds. ACA funding also supports HRSA, CDC, and IHS, with each receiving mandatory funds from other sources. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports comparative effectiveness research over a 10-year period with a mix of appropriations and transfers from Medicare trust funds. ACA funding also supports HRSA, CDC, and IHS, with each receiving mandatory funds from other sources. Additionally, PHS agencies assess user fees on third parties to help fund their programs and activities, with FDA collecting industry user fees to finance regulatory activities and expedite the review process for new product applications. FDA's user fee programs support the agency's regulation of various products and account for 43% of its funding in FY2016. User fees are collected to expedite the review process for new product applications and finance regulatory activities. Indians and Alaska Natives receive healthcare from IHS and tribes, with reimbursements from private insurers. Recent congressional actions have aimed to reduce federal spending, impacting discretionary funding for PHS agencies. AHRQ has seen a decrease in discretionary funding but has received more mandatory funding. CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA have experienced fluctuations in funding levels. In recent years, funding for PHS agencies like CDC, HRSA, FDA, and IHS has fluctuated due to various factors such as sequestration and negotiations on discretionary spending cuts. Mandatory funding has increased for some agencies since FY2010, leading to overall higher funding levels. Additionally, user fees at FDA and third-party collections at IHS have contributed to their funding growth. Congress and the President enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 to address the rising debt ceiling, impacting funding for various agencies and programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending limits for defense and nondefense categories, with reductions starting in FY2013. The reductions are achieved through sequestration and lowering discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget calculates the amounts and percentages for these reductions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for calculating mandatory spending reductions each year through sequestration. Certain exemptions apply, such as Medicaid funding for the Vaccines for Children program and CDC funding for specific programs. The sequestration special rules include cuts in CHCF funding for community health centers and migrant health centers, as well as cuts in mandatory diabetes funding for IHS, capped at 2%. Some nonexempt PHS programs avoided sequestration in FY2015 and/or FY2016 due to lack of budgetary resources when the sequester was ordered. For example, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program funded through FY2014 under the ACA was not sequestered in FY2015. For FY2013, discretionary spending was reduced through sequestration under the BCA. From FY2014 to FY2021, reductions in discretionary spending are achieved by lowering spending caps. PHS agency discretionary appropriations in FY2013 were sequestrable, leading to funding cuts. FDA user fees for FY2013 were also sequestrable, while IHS's third-party collections were exempt. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015 amended the Budget Control Act by setting new levels for NDD spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, eliminating the requirement for reductions. The caps were lower than the original BCA caps but higher than the lowered caps they replaced. The BBA15 caps were set below the original BCA caps for FY2014 and FY2015, but higher than the lowered caps they replaced. The revised NDD caps allowed an additional $26 billion for nondefense programs in FY2016. However, there is virtually no increase in NDD appropriations for FY2017. The President's FY2017 budget includes $2.940 billion in proposed new mandatory funding for PHS agencies. The use of mandatory funding, including amounts provided by the ACA, has become an important component of PHS agency budgeting in recent years. Mandatory funds are not controlled by the annual appropriations process and do not count toward the discretionary spending caps. Congress will decide whether to pass legislation to provide funds for new initiatives. The report consists of sections for each PHS agency, detailing their statutory authority, activities, and funding trends. Funding tables show FY2015 and FY2016 levels, along with the FY2017 budget request. The funding tables in agency budget documents show post-sequestration amounts for FY2015 and FY2016, with the FY2017 request not reflecting sequestration. The tables display funding for all agency budget accounts and selected programs, with amounts summed to give total funding. User fees and other nondiscretionary amounts are subtracted to determine discretionary budget authority. The funding tables in agency budget documents display funding for all agency budget accounts and selected programs, with amounts summed to give total funding. Non-add entries indicate funding from sources other than discretionary appropriations. The use of a dash in the tables generally means \"not applicable,\" while a zero indicates no discretionary funds were appropriated or requested. The tables in budget documents and reports only show evaluation set-aside funds received, not the assessed funding on agency accounts. This can distort the view of available budgetary resources, especially for CDC, HRSA, and NIH, which are subject to significant assessments. For example, NIH is assessed around $700 million annually, making it appear to have more funding than it actually does. The NIH appears to have about $700 million more than it actually does. AHRQ supports research to improve healthcare quality, efficiency, and access. They disseminate research findings and collect data on healthcare expenditures. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has evolved from previous agencies focused on health services research and technology assessment. It was established in 1989 and reauthorized in 1992. In 1999, it was renamed AHRQ and reauthorized through FY2005. Despite expired funding authorization, AHRQ continues to receive annual funding, organized into three program areas. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is organized into three program areas: Healthcare Costs, Quality, and Outcomes (HCQO) Research, MEPS, and program support. HCQO research focuses on four priority areas. AHRQ's funding has evolved over the years, with discretionary appropriations increasing since FY2015. Budget has grown from $403 million to $428 million, with transfers from PCORTF increasing as well. Transfers from PCORTF to AHRQ increased from $8 million in FY2011 to $94 million in FY2016. Discretionary funding shifted to the agency's own appropriation in FY2015 and FY2016. ACA mandatory funds have been a significant funding source since FY2010. AHRQ's program level increased steadily from FY2011 to FY2015, with PCORTF funds offsetting decreases in discretionary funding. However, in FY2016, the total program level decreased for the first time since FY2011. CDC's mission is to protect America from health threats, organized into various centers and offices focusing on public health challenges. The CDC's activities include chronic disease prevention, injury prevention, surveillance, and laboratory services. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is under the CDC Director's authority. Four CDC operating divisions are explicitly authorized, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD), the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and ATSDR. The CDC provides grants to various entities and has limited regulatory responsibilities. Funding for CDC/ATSDR programs increased from $10.88 billion to $11.78 billion between FY2010 and FY2016, with a 3% decrease in budget authority. Funding levels for CDC programs from FY2015 to FY2017 are detailed in Table 5, including both discretionary and mandatory appropriations. In recent years, CDC funding has come from four mandatory appropriations: the Vaccines for Children program, NIOSH activities for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, the World Trade Center Health Program, and appropriations under the ACA, mainly through the PPHF. CDC also receives funds from user fees, PHS set-aside, supplemental appropriations, and transfers. The total operating budget for CDC/ATSDR in FY2016 was $11.78 billion, with 53% from discretionary funds and 46% from mandatory funds. In FY2016, CDC funding consisted of mandatory funds for CDC and ATSDR programs, including the VCF, EEOICPA, and WTCHP, as well as discretionary funds for ATSDR from the Interior/Environment appropriations act. Additionally, authorized user fees and other transfers contributed to the funding. In December 2014, Congress provided $1.771 billion in FY2015 emergency supplemental appropriations to CDC for response to the Ebola outbreak, available through FY2019 for domestic and international activities. The CDC received $30 million for its Global Health Program from an earlier Ebola supplemental. The FDA regulates the safety of various products including human foods, drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and tobacco products to protect public health. Seven centers within the FDA oversee different program areas. The FDA is responsible for regulating the safety of human foods, drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and tobacco products to protect public health. It consists of several centers, including the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The FDA's statutory authority comes from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and it also administers provisions in other laws like the Public Health Service Act. Its authorizing committees in Congress are the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The FDA's budget is overseen by House appropriations subcommittees and consists of annual appropriations and industry user fees. Congress determines the total funds and user fees for the agency each fiscal year. User fees contribute to the Salaries and Expenses account, with the largest being authorized by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) authorized specific program user fees in 1992. Congress added user fee authorities for various medical products, including medical devices, animal drugs, tobacco products, and more. Each authority requires reauthorization every five years, with some indefinite authorities for specific fees. FDA's funding increased from $3.1 billion in FY2010 to FY2016. Between FY2010 and FY2016, FDA's funding increased from $3.1 billion to $4.7 billion, with user fees accounting for 43% of total funding in FY2016 compared to 24% in FY2010. The President's FY2017 budget request included $2.743 billion for budget authority and $2.084 billion for user fees, with an additional $202 million requested for as yet unauthorized fees. The President's FY2017 budget request included $202 million in unauthorized fees for various activities, bringing the total user fee request to $2.286 billion. Additionally, $75 million was requested for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. HRSA is responsible for improving access to healthcare for the uninsured and vulnerable populations, awarding funding to various organizations for health services projects. HRSA administers the health centers program, providing grants to non-profit entities for primary care services to underserved populations. The agency is organized into five bureaus and 10 offices, focusing on specific populations or health care issues. Some programs are authorized by the PHSA, SSA, and the Black Lung Program supports clinics for retired coal miners. HRSA funding increased from $8.1 billion in FY2010 to $10.8 billion in FY2016 despite a 17% decline in discretionary appropriations. The growth in funding was driven by increasing amounts from the CHCF, which replaced discretionary funding for the NHSC program. The NHSC program has not received annual discretionary funding since FY2011, with CHCF funding set to expire in FY2015. Congress extended CHCF funding for two more years in MACRA, which also extended funding for other HRSA programs established by the ACA. IHS provides healthcare for eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs and facilities on or near reservations. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates programs through self-determination contracts and compacts authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. IHS receives appropriations through the Interior/Environment appropriations act and is authorized by the Snyder Act of 1921, Indian Sanitation Facilities Act of 1959, and Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for various healthcare programs. IHCIA allows IHS to receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, and third-party insurers. IHS funding, including discretionary appropriations and collections from third-party payers, increased from $5.1 billion to $6.2 billion between FY2010 and FY2016. The increase supported clinical services, with a rise in discretionary appropriations for purchased/referred care and contract support costs since FY2014. Support costs have increased since FY2014 for Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations operating under ISDEAA contracts or compacts. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that these costs must be fully funded, even if Congress does not appropriate enough funds. Starting in FY2016, the allocated amount for contract support costs is deemed sufficient by IHS. The President's Budget proposes reclassifying these costs as a mandatory three-year appropriation. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts a wide range of research and training programs through 27 institutes and centers. The majority of NIH's budget supports extramural research conducted by over 30,000 individuals at various research institutions. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research programs at universities, hospitals, and research institutions. A smaller portion of the budget supports intramural research programs, while 6% funds research management and facilities' needs. NIH derives its authority from the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), granting the HHS Secretary broad authority to conduct and sponsor research. The PHSA also details the activities and responsibilities of the NIH Director and the institutes and centers. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) underwent a reorganization in FY2012, creating the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and eliminating the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR). NCATS now consolidates activities related to translational sciences from various institutes, while NCRR's other programs were distributed among other institutes and the Office of the Director. NIH receives almost all of its funding from annual discretionary appropriations, with separate appropriations provided to 24 institutes, the OD, and the Buildings and Facilities account. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) received a mandatory annual appropriation of $150 million for type 1 diabetes research. Funding for NIH increased from $11.0 billion in FY1994 to $13.7 billion in FY1998, doubling to $27.2 billion in FY2003. Since then, funding has increased more gradually, peaking in FY2010 before declining in FY2011 through FY2013. The NIH program level in FY2016 is $32.311 billion, with a requested increase to $33.136 billion in FY2017. The FY2017 budget includes $755 million for the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot, with $680 million allocated for the National Cancer Institute. SAMHSA is the lead agency for increasing access to behavioral health services, supporting mental health and substance abuse treatment through grants and competitive programs. SAMHSA operates under Title V of the PHSA, organizing its activities in three centers. SAMHSA operates under Title V of the PHSA, organizing its activities in three centers: Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), and Mental Health Services (CMHS). Each center has general statutory authority to establish grant programs for states and communities to address substance abuse and mental health needs. SAMHSA's budget includes a fourth category for activities like health surveillance and program support. SAMHSA's budget includes a category for activities like health surveillance and program support, which involves collecting data, providing statistical and analytic support, raising public awareness, developing the behavioral health workforce, and maintaining the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. The last comprehensive reauthorization of SAMHSA and its programs occurred in 2000 as part of the Children's Health Act, which added \"charitable choice\" provisions allowing religious organizations to receive funding for substance abuse prevention and treatment services without altering their religious character. Despite authorizations of appropriations for most of SAMHSA's grant programs expiring in FY2003, many programs continue to receive annual discretionary appropriations. SAMHSA's program-level funding has increased by 12% over the past 10 years, reaching $3.7 billion in FY2016. Funding fluctuated due to sequestration in FY2012 and rebounded in FY2014. The FY2017 request would increase funding by 16% to $4.3 billion, with a decrease in discretionary budget authority. New mandatory funding is proposed to support programs addressing opioid addiction treatment barriers and providing early interventions. The ACA Section 10503 established the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) to provide supplemental funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps. The CHCF received $11 billion in total appropriations over five years, with $9.5 billion for health center operations and $1.5 billion for the NHSC. Additional funding was provided by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) for FY2016 and FY2017, totaling $3.6 billion for health center operations. The CHCF received $3.6 billion for health center operations and $310 million for the NHSC in FY2016 and FY2017. CHCF funding has replaced discretionary funding for the NHSC and partially supplanted discretionary funding for health center operations. Funds are awarded to various types of health centers, including community health centers, migrant health centers, facilities for the homeless, and public housing residents. Sequestration for community and migrant health centers is capped at 2%. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under the ACA with a permanent annual appropriation. The PPHF's annual appropriation was initially set to increase from $500 million in FY2010 to $2 billion in FY2015, but was reduced to $1 billion through FY2017 due to amendments. Funding for health centers for the homeless and public housing residents, as well as the NHSC, is sequestrable at the applicable rate for nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under the ACA with a permanent annual appropriation. The PPHF's funding increases to $2 billion for FY2022 and subsequent years. The HHS Secretary transfers funds to agencies for prevention, wellness, and public health activities at the beginning of each fiscal year. The distribution of PPHF funds is determined by the Secretary annually. Sequestration is applied to the entire appropriation before funds are transferred to agencies. The Secretary transfers PPHF funds to HHS agencies annually for prevention and public health activities. In FY2013, almost half of the funds were transferred to CMS for ACA implementation, reducing funds initially allocated to CDC and other agencies. This, along with sequestration in FY2013, significantly impacted CDC's budget. Funds were used for pre-existing and newly authorized ACA programs from FY2010 to FY2013. Distribution of funds for FY2014 to FY2016 was directed annually. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) was established under the ACA to support comparative clinical effectiveness research. Funding for the PCORTF was provided annually from FY2010 to FY2019 from various sources. In some cases, the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) contributed more than 50% of a program's total funding, such as CDC immunization grants and tobacco prevention activities. Additionally, the CDC Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant and lead poisoning prevention program received 100% of their FY2016 funding from the PPHF. The ACA allocated funding to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) from FY2010 to FY2019 through annual appropriations, fees on health insurance and self-insured plans, and transfers from Medicare trust funds. The amounts appropriated ranged from $10 million in FY2010 to $150 million in FY2012 through FY2019. Additionally, a new fee imposed by the ACA on health insurance policies and self-insured plans contributed to the PCORTF funding from FY2013 to FY2019. Transfers from Medicare trust funds were also calculated based on the number of individuals entitled to benefits. The ACA allocated funds to the PCORTF from FY2010 to FY2019 through appropriations, fees, and transfers from Medicare trust funds. Funds are calculated based on the number of individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B. 80% of funds are allocated to PCORI, 20% to the HHS Secretary for PHSA Section 937. 80% of the amount transferred to HHS is distributed to AHRQ."
