    "content": "The BSA is the primary U.S. anti-money laundering law regulating financial institutions, imposing reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and establishing AML programs. It provides for civil and criminal penalties for violations, with enforcement authority held by FinCEN. Penalties vary based on entity type, violation type, and intent level. The BSA imposes reporting and recordkeeping requirements on financial institutions, with enforcement authority held by FinCEN. Other agencies like OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve, SEC, FINRA, and NCUA also enforce BSA requirements. The DOJ brings criminal charges for BSA violations, with an increase in monetary penalties assessed by federal regulators. A study by NERA found that nearly 90% of BSA/AML enforcement actions from 2012-2015 involved monetary penalties, compared to less than half from 2002-2011. Penalties have significantly increased in size over the years. NERA found that BSA/AML penalties have significantly increased in size, with over 80% imposed after 2012. Nearly one-third of penalties since October 2009 exceeded 10% of a defendant institution's capital. Two notable enforcement actions include HSBC being fined $665 million in 2012 for AML program failures. The HSBC enforcement action involved violations of the BSA and associated regulations from 2006 to 2010, leading to $881 million in drug trafficking proceeds being laundered through HSBC Bank USA. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also faced penalties for its involvement in the Bernard L. Madoff Ponzi scheme in January 2014. In 2014, JPMorgan faced penalties for its role in the Bernard L. Madoff Ponzi scheme, admitting to BSA violations and agreeing to forfeit $1.7 billion. The OCC and FinCEN also imposed civil money penalties on JPMorgan. Regulators are emphasizing institutions' acceptance of responsibility for BSA violations. In 2013, FinCEN changed its approach to settlements with financial institutions charged with BSA violations, now requiring them to admit to the facts alleged in penalty assessments. This shift reflects a new emphasis on corporate responsibility. In 2016, NERA's study found that major BSA/AML violations between 2010 and 2015 often required defendants to admit to the violations. Between 2010 and 2015, four of the six largest BSA/AML violations required financial institutions to admit government claims and accept responsibility for violations. There is an increased risk of individual liability for BSA violations, as seen in the case of Thomas Haider, former Chief Compliance Officer of MoneyGram International, who was fined $1 million for willful violations. A federal court ruled in 2016 that individuals can be held liable for BSA violations. The court ruled that individuals can be held liable for violations of the BSA's AML program requirements, as seen in the case of Thomas Haider, former Chief Compliance Officer of MoneyGram International, who was fined $1 million for willful violations. Regulators have pursued other BSA enforcement actions against individual compliance. The DOJ has recently focused on individual prosecutions in BSA enforcement actions, following the Yates Memo's emphasis on individual accountability for corporate wrongdoing. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has indicated that the memo is under review, raising questions about the future emphasis on individual responsibility in white-collar enforcement actions under the Trump administration."
