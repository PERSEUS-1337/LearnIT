    "content": "Congress passed a $555 billion omnibus spending bill through H.R. 2764, including funding for domestic agencies. The bill, signed into law on December 26, 2007, included emergency supplemental funding for State Department operations and foreign aid programs totaling $35 billion. The FY2008 budget request for foreign affairs programs includes economic and military assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. The focus has shifted from anti-communism to anti-terrorism post 9/11. Foreign aid and diplomatic programs in the past also aimed at reducing population growth, promoting economic development, advancing trade interests, improving education and healthcare, and protecting the environment. In the 1990s, U.S. foreign aid goals included stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing illegal drug production, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting human rights, and countering trafficking in persons. After the September 11 attacks, foreign aid programs focused more on contributing to the war on terrorism. President Bush's National Security Strategy in 2002 established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security. In 2002, foreign aid priorities shifted to focus on combating terrorism, with an emphasis on assisting \"front-line\" states. The State Department also worked on building coalitions and promoting American views through public diplomacy. The Bush Administration announced new initiatives in diplomacy and foreign aid, including a transformational diplomacy initiative in 2006. In 2006, a diplomacy initiative was announced to reposition diplomats, create regional public diplomacy centers, and train diplomats in new skills. A new position, the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), was created at the State Department to provide more coordination and accountability for aid programs. Other presidential initiatives focus on development and global health concerns, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation proposed in 2002. The President's initiatives, established in 2002 and 2004, focus on providing higher resources to low-income countries committed to reforms. This includes the $15 billion commitment to combat HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR and the President's Malaria Initiative pledging $1.2 billion. These initiatives have primarily benefitted African countries. The Administration has committed $1.2 billion in additional resources through 2010 to fulfill the pledge to double aid to Africa. In May 2007, an additional $30 billion was announced for the period through FY2013. Other foreign policy goals include supporting peace in the Middle East, fostering democratization and stability in crisis countries, promoting free market economies, and combating international narcotics production and trafficking. The international affairs budget includes assistance to Colombia and the Andean region, addressing famine and refugee situations globally. It consists of two components - State Department/Diplomacy/Broadcasting and Foreign Operations. The budget has fluctuated in response to global events, with the FY2008 request for the Department of State at $10.014 billion, a 10.5% increase from FY2007. For international broadcasting, the FY2008 request is $668.2 million, a 3.8% increase from FY2007. The FY2008 request of $668.2 million represents a 3.8% increase over FY2007, but a 1.7% decline from FY2006. It includes funding for related agencies like the Broadcasting Board of Governors, U.S. contributions to the United Nations, and resources for international commissions. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced a vision for U.S. diplomacy in the 21st Century in 2006. President Bush's mission of supporting democracy worldwide and ending tyranny is emphasized by Secretary Rice's concept of \"transformational diplomacy.\" This approach involves global repositioning of diplomatic positions to key regions like Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, with a focus on regional public diplomacy efforts. The Department is creating regional public diplomacy centers in Europe and the Middle East, as well as regional centers for information technology to support management activities. American Presence Posts (APP) and Virtual Presence Posts (VPP) will enhance U.S. public diplomacy mission. IT Centralization will provide real-time information to State Department workforce. Creative use of the Internet will enhance America's presence through interactive online discussions. Plans for new skills challenges and enhanced training are in place. The Department of State is implementing plans for new skills challenges and enhanced training for diplomats, including multi-region expertise and post assignment criteria. The Administration is requesting $124.8 million for Transformational Diplomacy in the FY2008 budget, with allocations for job repositioning, language training, public diplomacy, and technology training. Diplomats are being empowered to work with other federal agencies, especially the U.S. military deployed abroad. The State Department's FY2007 budget request included $102.8 million for Transformational Diplomacy, with funding allocated for language, public diplomacy, and technology training, Foreign Service modernization, and public diplomacy. The department's mission is to advance and protect U.S. interests worldwide through overseas missions, foreign policy, passport and visa issuance. Currently, the State Department coordinates with 50 U.S. government agencies in over 180 countries, employing approximately 30,000 people, with 60% working abroad. The State Department's Diplomatic and Consular Program account includes activities related to foreign policy, passport and visa applications, regional bureaus, and post assignment travel. The FY2008 budget request is $4,942.7 million, with $964.8 million designated for worldwide security upgrades. This account supports facility maintenance and security enhancements. The Security and Maintenance account supports upgrades for U.S. diplomatic missions abroad. Following the embassy bombings in Africa in 1998, Congress allocated over $1 billion for security upgrades. The Administration seeks $792.5 million for regular ESCM and $806.9 million for worldwide security upgrades in FY2008, totaling $1,599.4 million. This account also funds programs like the Fulbright Academic Exchange Program. The Bush Administration is requesting $486.4 million for exchanges in FY2008, representing a 9.1% increase over the FY2007 estimate. Congress designated $329.7 million in the D&CP funds for public diplomacy in FY2006. The CIF was established to provide for purchasing information technology and capital equipment. The FY2008 budget request includes $70.7 million for CIF, a 21.7% increase from previous years. No funding is requested for the Centralized Information Technology Modernization Program. U.S. contributions to the United Nations and its affiliated agencies have been a recent focus. In recent years, U.S. contributions to the United Nations and its affiliated agencies have been affected by various issues including funding withholding, Iraq Oil for Food Program, sexual exploitation allegations, and U.N. reform efforts. Congressional attention has been focused on comprehensive U.N. reform through legislative proposals. The current legislative issues include oversight of reforms initiated by the United Nations in 2005 and the possibility of increasing the U.S. cap on contributions to U.N. peacekeeping assessments. The Administration argues that maintaining membership in international organizations benefits the U.S. by advancing its interests and sharing costs with other countries. The President's FY2008 request for this account is $1,354.4 million. The President's FY2008 request for the International Commissions account is $113.5 million, which includes various commissions such as the U.S.-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. The U.S. supports multilateral peacekeeping efforts through payment of its share of the U.N. assessed peacekeeping budget, with a requested total of $1,107.0 million for FY2008. The FY2008 request for the International Commissions account is $113.5 million, a significant increase from previous years due to a water treatment project near San Diego. The Asia Foundation, a nonprofit organization supporting democratic processes in Asia, receives government and private sector contributions. The Administration's FY2008 request for the Foundation is $10 million, lower than previous levels. The FY2007 budget for the Asia Foundation is $13.8 million. A trust fund was established for the International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue in FY2004, with $6.9 million provided for perpetual operations. The Center received $18.75 million as seed money from FY2004 to FY2006. The Administration requested to spend $750,000 from the Trust Fund for programming activities and conferences in FY2007. The FY2008 budget includes a request for $875,000 from the Trust for the program account. The FY2008 budget includes a request for $875,000 from the Trust for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a private nonprofit organization supporting democratic institutions in over 90 countries. Critics argue NED duplicates US government programs and could operate with private funding. The Administration's FY2008 budget request of $80 million for NED is an 8.1% increase over FY2006, with additional funding from the Democracy Fund created by the 109th Congress. The FY2008 budget includes a request for $875,000 from the Trust for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange between East and West (East-West Center) in Honolulu, Hawaii, and the North-South Center in Miami, Florida, promote understanding and cooperation among nations. Congress has not funded the North-South Center since FY2001, suggesting it should be funded by the private sector. The Administration's FY2008 request is for $10 million for the East-West Center, a decrease of 47.4% from the FY2006 funding level of $19.0 million. The U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was established in 1984 to promote international peace through various activities. USIP's funding was transferred to a different appropriation in the FY2005 budget process for relevancy reasons. The Administration's FY2008 request for Justice, State, and related agencies appropriation is $30 million, up nearly $8 million from FY2007. The United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 reorganized U.S. government international broadcasting, including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia. The Broadcasting Board of Governors oversees all U.S. government broadcasting. In 1999, the 106th Congress decided to maintain the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) as an independent agency for U.S. international broadcasting. The President's FY2008 request for international broadcasting activities is $668.2 million, with $618.8 million for broadcasting operations, $10.7 million for Capital Improvements, and $38.7 million for Broadcasting to Cuba. The BBG plans to eliminate some VOA services and reduce others. BBG plans to reduce VOA services and other broadcasts in Ukrainian, Tibetan, and Romanian. The FY2008 budget request includes an increase in funds for the Middle East Broadcasting network by $20 million. The White House sent two supplemental funding requests to Congress for U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq has over 1,000 American and locally engaged staff. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request from the Bush Administration increased funding for State Department operations in Iraq, Embassy security in Kabul, and humanitarian assistance in Darfur. Additionally, funds for Iraqi refugees and Palestinian refugees were also increased. The FY2007 Supplemental provided $1.275 billion for State Department operations, with $871 million for U.S. operations in Iraq. After the President's veto, Congress passed H.R. 2206, allocating $1.27 billion, including funds for State Department operations in Iraq and contributions to international organizations. The FY2007 Supplemental allocated $1.275 billion for State Department operations, including $871 million for U.S. operations in Iraq. The Bush Administration had previously requested $1.497 billion for FY2006 Emergency Supplemental for Iraq operations and security. The final measure signed into law included $1.529 billion for D&CP in Iraq, $25.3 million for State's Inspector General, $5 million for exchanges in Iran, $178 million for U.N. peacekeeping, and $36.1 million for international broadcasting in Iran. The annual Foreign Operations Appropriations bill funds U.S. bilateral development assistance programs managed by USAID and the State Department, along with other foreign aid agencies. It also includes funding for the Export-Import Bank and food aid programs. The FY2008 request for food aid programs totals $1.319 billion, while the foreign operations budget request for FY2008 totals $24.4 billion, representing a 12% increase from the previous year's enacted budget. The FY2008 foreign operations budget request totals $24.4 billion, a 12% increase from the previous year. A new State Department position of Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) has been created to oversee foreign assistance programs. Randall Tobias served as the DFA and USAID Administrator until April 27, 2007. The Global AIDS Coordinator, who also served as the DFA and USAID Administrator until April 27, 2007, presented a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance linking aid programs to U.S. strategic objectives. The FY2008 budget evaluates the effects of the reform plan on funding levels for accounts, sectors, and specific countries, categorizing countries into five groups based on development challenges. The categorization of countries for aid programs includes Developing countries, Sustaining Partnership countries, Restrictive countries, and a category for global or regional programs. Each category represents common development challenges for aid program coordination. The categorization of countries for aid programs includes Developing countries, Sustaining Partnership countries, Restrictive countries, and a category for global or regional programs. Strategic objectives have been created and linked to country categories, including peace and security, governing justly and democratically, investing in people, economic growth, and humanitarian assistance. Despite a proposed 12% increase in the foreign aid budget, most of the additional funds are concentrated in specific areas such as the war on terrorism, reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, and assistance to front-line states. In FY2008, there was a shift in funding from Development Assistance (DA) to Economic Support Fund (ESF) in strategic alignment with new objectives. ESF saw a 35% increase while DA decreased by 31%. Similar changes occurred in the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) with funds being transferred to ESF. Millennium Challenge Corporation also saw significant increases in funding. The FY2008 budget saw shifts in funding, with increases in programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, but decreases in others like Child Survival and Health. The U.S. contribution to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria is set to decrease by 58%. The Administration proposes a $300 million budget for the Child Survival and Health program, with $247.5 million coming from HHS. Excluding funds from Millennium Challenge Compacts, Africa would see a 37% increase in HIV/AIDS funds but cuts in other programs. South and Central Asia would have a 7% increase, mainly for Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the Near East would receive a 5% increase for Iraq assistance. Other regions would see varying levels of funding. In FY2008, funding for different regions varied, with East Asia and the Pacific receiving a 2% increase, Europe and Eurasia seeing a 12% decrease due to countries graduating from aid programs, and Latin America experiencing a 4% decrease affecting basic education, environment, and humanitarian assistance. The focus of the budget was on addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, with PEPFAR focus countries being the main beneficiaries. Most regions received slight increases or decreases from FY2006 levels, except for Africa which received a significant increase in funding. The focus of the budget in FY2008 was on addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, with PEPFAR focus countries being the main beneficiaries. Excluding GHAI funds would result in a 2% decrease in aid to Africa instead of a 37% increase. Two Latin American and Caribbean countries benefit from PEPFAR, with aid to the region decreasing by 5% if these funds are excluded. Vietnam's AIDS funding also impacts aid levels to East Asia and the Pacific, leading to a nearly 5% decrease. The debate in the foreign assistance community revolves around the appropriate ratio of \"core\" development assistance to security and economic assistance. The focus is on poverty alleviation and health concerns, funded by Development Assistance (DA), Child Survival and Health (CSH), and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI). Some observers also include the Millennium Challenge Account and contingency accounts for emergencies. Non-governmental organizations tend to exclude Economic Support Funds (ESF) due to perceptions of being given to strategic allies regardless of need and used for budget support rather than development projects. The FY2008 budget request proposes transferring some programs funded by Development Assistance (DA) into the Economic Support Funds (ESF) account, complicating the analysis of development assistance. Development assistance is proposed to increase in FY2008 by 4.5% from FY2007, with the largest portion of the increase in the HIV/AIDS initiative. The FY2008 budget request proposes transferring some programs funded by Development Assistance (DA) into the Economic Support Funds (ESF) account. The increase in development assistance for FY2008 is 4.5%, with a focus on the HIV/AIDS initiative. The increase in funds for the Millennium Challenge Corporation accounts for most of the overall increase in funding. The Administration emphasizes strategic objectives over specific accounts. Table 6 breaks down funding for each objective, with Investing in People, Economic Growth, and Humanitarian Assistance seen as core programs. There is debate over including Economic Growth due to ESF funding. Congress has shown interest in aid sectors like education, democracy, human rights, and health programs. Funding levels for various sectors in FY2006 and FY2008 show significant cuts in some areas and increases in health-related programs, particularly in HIV/AIDS, malaria, and avian flu programs. The Bush Administration has made pledges for multi-year increases in foreign aid affecting the FY2008 budget, with a focus on health issues like HIV/AIDS and malaria. The Millennium Challenge Corporation administers performance-based aid to countries with strong economic policies and governance. Funding for maternal and child health, family planning, and reproductive health has decreased, while funds for Peace and Security objectives, particularly counter-terrorism and rule of law programs, have increased. President Bush announced a plan to provide $30 billion through FY2013, with a focus on malaria and an additional $1.2 billion for the United States over a five-year period. Congress appropriated funds in FY2006 and FY2007, with a request for $388 million in FY2008 to keep the pledge on target. The Administration also pledged to double U.S. assistance to Africa by 2010, with a 37% increase in bilateral assistance in 2008 driven by HIV/AIDS funds. The President pledged $5 billion annual funding for the new Millennium Challenge Corporation, but requests never exceeded $3 billion a year. Congress has consistently cut MCC funding due to slow implementation. Increased funding for HIV/AIDS and TB programs is driving the overall increase in foreign aid budget. HIV/AIDS funding is managed through various accounts including PEPFAR-focus countries. The Administration's budget requests include funding for various health programs such as the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and TB. Congress has provided additional resources beyond the requested amount, with previous contributions totaling $544.5 million in FY2006 and $625 million in recent years. The Administration's budget requests include funding for the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) and other HIV/AIDS programs. The GHAI funding would increase to $4.15 billion, with additional funds for tuberculosis programs. Total foreign operations funding for AIDS and TB programs would exceed $4.5 billion. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was initially seen as a supplement to existing U.S. aid programs, but it became apparent that Compact countries were experiencing cuts in other types of aid programs. The FY2008 budget request highlighted the correlation between MCC and other forms of assistance, with officials acknowledging that the promise of MCC being additive did not apply at the country level. The new budgeting process aimed to coordinate all foreign aid programs within State, USAID, and related agencies, including MCC. USAID and related agencies, including MCC, have seen cuts in aid programs for compact countries. Armenia and Georgia were already scheduled for reduced assistance as FSA countries graduate from aid. Supplemental resources for Foreign Operations programs have become significant for U.S. international activities, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan. Supplemental appropriations bills are used for emergencies or natural disasters. The Administration relies on supplemental funding for emergencies and unforeseen expenses, with a growing reliance on Foreign Operations supplementals. In FY2007, a supplemental request totaled $5.99 billion, including $350 million in food aid. Congress approved a bill providing $6.146 million in international affairs spending, including $460 million in food assistance. The Administration also presented an FY2008 GWOT emergency budget to Congress. In FY2008, the Administration requested a total of $3.328 billion in supplemental funds, with $1.367 billion allocated for foreign operations. The request included funds for Iraq and Afghanistan, with Iraq receiving $772 million and Afghanistan $339 million in ESF funds. Additionally, Iraq would receive $159 million for various programs, including human rights and anti-corruption efforts. Operating expenses for USAID in Iraq and Afghanistan would total $61.8 million. In FY2008, the Administration requested $3.328 billion in supplemental funds, with $1.367 billion allocated for foreign operations. Iraq and Afghanistan were proposed to receive additional funds, with Iraq getting $265 million and Afghanistan $500 million. Other allocations included $500 million for Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts, $350 million for the Palestinian Authority, $106 million for North Korea's denuclearization talks, $70 million for elections in Sudan and Southern Sudan stabilization. The share of U.S. foreign assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan has increased significantly since FY2002. In FY2008, the Administration requested $3.328 billion in supplemental funds, with $1.367 billion allocated for foreign operations. Iraq and Afghanistan were proposed to receive additional funds, with Iraq getting $265 million and Afghanistan $500 million. Other allocations included $500 million for Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts, $350 million for the Palestinian Authority, $106 million for North Korea's denuclearization talks, $70 million for elections in Sudan and Southern Sudan stabilization. The share of U.S. foreign assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan has increased significantly since FY2002. Funding for Iraq and Afghanistan peaked in FY2004 at over $17 billion, then decreased to $1.6 billion in FY2006 and roughly $2.5 billion in FY2007. Total foreign aid spending for Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2007 was about 16% and would be just under 13% in FY2008. Congress passed a $555 billion omnibus spending bill in December 2007, which included funding for domestic agencies and some of the FY2008 emergency supplemental funding requested by the White House. In December 2007, Congress passed a bill (P.L. 110-161) signed by the President, allocating $33.1 billion for the international affairs budget. $10.3 billion was for State Department Operations, $22.9 billion for Foreign Operations, and $2.385 billion in emergency FY2008 supplemental funds. The bill ended a series of continuing resolutions and provided guidance for spending limits. The Senate and House passed FY2008 Budget Resolutions with different amounts allocated for international affairs. The Senate matched the President's request of $39.8 billion, including $3.3 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. The House allocated $35.3 billion, $1.2 billion less than the President's request. The conference report approved $33.1 billion for international affairs in December 2007. The House and Senate approved the conference report on May 17, 2007, adopting the lower House figure for international affairs. The total discretionary budget is $954 billion, with allocations guiding the Appropriations Committees for FY2008 spending measures. The State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies allocation is $34.243 billion, 9.5% above FY2007 levels and 2% below the President's request. The House Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the FY2008 spending measure, providing a total of $34.243 billion, with $10.76 billion for the State Department.

This is $2.95 billion higher than last year's level and $700 million less than the President's request. Within this total, $10.04 billion is allocated for the Department of State, which is slightly less than the President's request but higher than the previous year's funding. For international broadcasting, the committee recommended $682.3 million for FY2008, a slight increase from the previous year.

Concerns were expressed about the backlog in passport processing and the need to right-size U.S. overseas posts. Additionally, there was language to increase diplomatic resources in Central and East Africa and encouragement for the interagency cost-sharing system ICASS.
