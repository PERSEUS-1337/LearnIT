    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) with provisions affecting military personnel. Differences between the versions are resolved in a conference committee. The report focuses on personnel-related issues in the FY2014 NDAA. The FY2014 NDAA process was atypical, with the House passing H.R. 1960 and the Senate introducing S. 1197 but not passing it. A second bill, H.R. 3304, was negotiated between the House and Senate, passed by the House on October 28, 2013, and agreed to by the Senate on December 19, 2013, before being signed into law on December 26, 2013. No reports or explanatory statements were issued for the enacted bill. The FY2014 NDAA process resulted in H.R. 3304 being signed into law on December 26 (P.L. 113-66). No reports or explanatory statements were approved for the enacted bill. The entries under the \"House\" heading are based on H.R. 1960, unless stated otherwise. Related CRS products offer detailed background information and analysis. Some issues were addressed in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. In response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps after FY2006. However, these increases were reversed after the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and the drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan starting in 2012. The Army's authorized end strength was 552,100 in FY2013, with a proposed reduction to 490,000 by FY2015. The Marine Corps had an authorized end strength of 197,300 in FY2013, with a proposed reduction to 175,000 by FY2017. The authorized end strength for the Air Force and Navy has decreased since 2001, with reductions in Army and Marine Corps end strengths in comparison to FY2013 levels. The final bill stipulates a total active duty end strength 40,160 lower than FY2013, mainly due to reductions in the Army and Marine Corps sizes. The Army and Marine Corps ended FY2013 below authorized levels, with required reductions of around 18,000 for FY2014. Reference(s): CRS Report R42651, FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Policy Issues. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 3% over the past 12 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves in FY2001 were provided for comparative purposes. Between FY2001 and FY2013, there were notable shifts in authorized end strength for various reserve components, with the largest changes seen in the Army National Guard, Coast Guard Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Navy Reserve. The final bill for FY2014 maintained the same authorized end strengths for the Army Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve as FY2013, while the Navy Reserve saw a decrease in authorized end strength. The final bill for FY2014 approved decreases in authorized end strength for the Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve as requested by the Administration. Concerns over military personnel costs and ongoing operations in Afghanistan have led to a focus on military pay raises. The increase in basic pay for 2014 is indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The increase in basic pay for 2014 is indexed to the Employment Cost Index. Congress can pass a law to provide otherwise, and the President has authority to specify an alternative pay adjustment. The President requested a 1.0% military pay raise for FY2014, saving $540 million in FY2014 and nearly $3.5 billion through FY2018. The President exercised his authority to set the 2014 monthly basic pay increase at 1.0 percent. The House-passed bill contained no provision to specify the rate of increase. The final bill for 2014 did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay for military personnel, leaving the statutory pay raise formula in place which equated to a 1.8% increase. However, the President directed a 1% pay raise under his authority, resulting in a 1% increase in basic pay for military personnel on January 1, 2014. Congress sets limits on the number of general and flag officers on active duty as of October 1, 2013: 231 for the Army, 162 for the Navy, 198 for the Air Force, and 61 for the Marine Corps. The Secretary of Defense may designate up to 310 officers for joint duty positions. The House bill aims to reduce the number of generals and admirals in the Armed Forces from 962 to 937 on active duty by October 1, 2014. This reduction is in response to the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, ongoing drawdown in Afghanistan, and the decreasing Army and Marine Corps strength. The House bill aims to reduce the number of generals and admirals in the Armed Forces from 962 to 937 on active duty by October 1, 2014. The final bill includes a provision requiring DOD to notify Congress of any proposed increase in general or flag officers above specified baselines, with a 60-day waiting period before the proposed action can take effect. Annual reporting on the number of general and flag officers is also mandated. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181) requires advance notice to reservists ordered to active duty for more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation. The Secretary of Defense can waive or reduce the 30-day notice requirement with a report to Congress. DOD policy allows for mobilization orders to be approved 180 days before mobilization, but exceptions can be made for emergent requirements and special capabilities. The DOD policy allows for mobilization orders to be approved in advance, with exceptions for emergent requirements. In crisis situations, mobilizations can be approved with less than 30 days' notice. Reservists can volunteer for duty in support of a contingency operation and waive the 30-day notification requirement. The DOD policy allows for mobilization orders to be approved in advance, with exceptions for emergent requirements. Reservists can volunteer for duty in support of a contingency operation and waive the 30-day notification requirement. The House provision aimed to provide greater advance notice to reservists of deployments, while the Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision to prohibit cancelling the deployment of certain reserve units. The provision (Section 508) prohibits canceling the deployment of certain reserve units without approval from the Secretary of Defense. It affects reserve units within 180 days of their scheduled deployment if an active component unit is deployed instead. Section 513 requires notifying congressional defense committees and governors of approved cancellations. The final provision combines Senate and House versions. The Establishment Clause prevents the government from endorsing a national religion or favoring one religion over another. Actions must be balanced to avoid violating this Clause. Title 10 addresses chaplains' duties, and a provision in a House-passed bill would have amended these sections. DOD Instruction 1300.17 accommodates religious practices in the military services. DOD Instruction 1300.17 emphasizes the importance of accommodating religious practices in the military. There have been concerns about religious remarks during mandatory ceremonies, leading to potential legal threats. Religious proselytizing is seen as a divisive issue that could impact the unity of soldiers and national security. Some believe that allowing chaplains to close prayers outside of religious services could create tension among soldiers, potentially impacting national security. Others argue against restricting chaplains' activities. Military personnel, including single parents, are subject to the same assignment and deployment requirements. Military personnel, including single parents, are subject to the same assignment and deployment requirements. Deployments to areas that do not allow dependents require contingency plans for child custody. Concerns have been raised about custody changes occurring while a military member is deployed. The House language proposed amending the law to allow courts to assign temporary custody of a child for deployment without it being prejudicial in custody hearings, but the enacted bill did not change current law. This issue was previously discussed in CRS reports. The eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart medal have sparked debate following shootings on U.S. soil. Some argue for modifications to the criteria, while others believe it would diminish the medal's value and the sacrifices it represents. Authorities considered specific acts as crimes, not enemy actions, involving Muslim perpetrators angered by U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Concerns exist that awarding the Purple Heart in these cases could have anti-Muslim implications. The issue of sexual assault in the military has been a persistent problem, with a 6% increase in reported cases in 2011. Legislative efforts are underway to address prevention, reporting, victim protection, judicial proceedings, and victim support. Congressional attention is focused on improving measures to combat sexual assault in the military. Injured military personnel face long delays in the disability evaluation process, leading to extended waits for benefits. Efforts to expedite the process have often resulted in longer wait times, with some individuals waiting over a year. In early 2013, then-Secretary of Defense Panetta lifted the restriction on women serving in combat units. The report mandated by Section 535 of P.L. 111-383 to assess women's opportunities in the Armed Forces has not been submitted. Concerns exist about the review of policies affecting female servicemembers and the distinction between \"equitable\" and \"equal\" opportunities. Service leadership is evaluating occupational requirements. The safety of military personnel and their families on bases is a concern due to incidents like sexual assaults at Lackland Air Base and shootings at Ft. Hood. Changes are being made to increase safety and welfare at military facilities. The District of Columbia's restrictive gun laws were impacted by the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The House provision expressed displeasure with the District of Columbia's gun control laws affecting members of the Armed Forces. Military veterans face challenges transitioning to civilian jobs, addressed by the Transition Assistance Program (TAP). The provision aims to integrate with TAP by providing information on civilian credentialing opportunities. The provision aims to integrate with the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), providing information on civilian credentialing opportunities for military personnel to evaluate their training's correlation with civilian certifications and licenses. This is in line with Section 1433(b)(1) of P.L. 103-160, which provided transitional assistance to dependents of military members. The provision aims to provide compensation and benefits to family members of servicemembers convicted of abuse, ensuring they have access to military stores. This helps alleviate fears of losing support and encourages reporting of abuse. The Stolen Valor Act of 2005 was broadened to make it a crime to falsely claim military decorations. However, the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 2012. A revision is proposed to narrow the claims to those made for personal gain. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) was authorized by Congress in 1990 to assist separating military servicemembers and their families in transitioning to civilian life. TAP provides pre-separation services and counseling on various transition-related topics such as employment, relocation, education, health insurance, finances, entrepreneurship, disability benefits, and retirement. The program is available to servicemembers 12 months before separation and 24 months before retirement, supported by interagency efforts from multiple government departments. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) was redesigned in 2012 as Transition GPS, initiated by the Veterans' Employment Initiative Task Force. The redesign aimed to comply with the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, making TAP participation mandatory for most separating military personnel. Transition GPS provides individualized assessments for civilian employment opportunities based on military training. The core program was implemented in November 2012, with optional tracks expected by the end of 2013. Section 524 of the House bill would amend Section 1144 of Title 10, United States Code, to require the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to provide information on disability-related employment and education protections for servicemembers. It also adds a new program requirement to educate participants on veterans' educational benefits, post-secondary education options, financing education, and other veterans' benefits by April 1, 2015. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a feasibility study on providing pre-separation counseling overseas within 270 days of the act's enactment. The enacted bill includes provisions for providing information on disability-related employment and education protections for servicemembers deployed overseas. Many servicemembers in Afghanistan have access to Internet cafes on bases for communication with family and friends. The Department of Defense provides Internet access to service-members in remote locations through the Cheetah Program using satellite units and laptops. Despite efforts, there have been complaints about Internet availability in Afghanistan. Section 569 of H.R. 1960 mandates free Internet service for military members in combat zones, added by Representative Gene Green. Representative Green introduced an amendment in response to concerns from servicemembers in Afghanistan. The amendment aimed to extend the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) for an additional 180 days for medical treatment after separation from active duty. The provision authorizes DOD to extend telemedicine medical treatment for servicemembers under the Transitional Assistance Management Program for 180 days. Telemedicine involves using electronic communications to improve patient health. The goal is to support servicemembers transitioning to civilian life, especially those with mental or physical injuries. The mandate will end on December 31, 2018, if suicide rates decrease by 50% compared to 2012. Under Section 101 of Title 38, United States Code, a veteran is defined as a person who served in active military, naval, or air service and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Reservists who were disabled or died while on active duty are considered veterans, but those who only serve on active duty for training without suffering injuries are not technically veterans. Reservists who are entitled to reserve retired pay or would be entitled to it but are too young to receive it may be honored as \"veterans\" under a proposed House bill. This honorary designation would not grant any additional benefits, and the provision is considered cost-neutral by the Congressional Budget Office. The proposed House bill would honor reservists entitled to reserve retired pay as \"veterans\" without providing additional benefits, deemed cost-neutral by the Congressional Budget Office. The TRICARE health care program serves uniformed servicemembers, retirees, dependents, and survivors, with no premium increases for military retirees in H.R. 1960 or Senate bill S. 1197. The 2014 budget proposals aimed to raise premiums for military retirees based on retirement pay brackets and index the TRICARE catastrophic cap to the National Health Expenditure. The enacted bill did not adopt the Administration's proposals to increase health care costs for military retirees, but allowed for an increase in TRICARE Prime non-mental health office visit co-pay. Policy Issues related to military personnel have been a longstanding concern for Congress, with a focus on mental health issues among servicemembers. Various reports have been coordinated by different authors over the years, addressing these issues in relation to the National Defense Authorization Acts of FY2009, FY2010, and FY2012. Congress has taken steps to study and address these concerns through hearings and reports. Contact information for further details is available through the CRS Point of Contact, Don Jansen. In H.R. 1960, Congress addresses servicemember mental health with provisions related to PTSD and TBI. The bill aims to expand mental health assessments, evaluate the role of mental health disorders in military encounters, and improve access to psychological health resources for active duty personnel. The DOD announced changes to TRICARE Prime availability for beneficiaries in certain areas in the United States, affecting Prime Service Areas (PSAs) not close to military treatment facilities. This change impacts access to psychological health resources for active duty personnel. The DOD announced changes to TRICARE Prime availability for beneficiaries in certain areas in the United States, affecting Prime Service Areas (PSAs) not close to military treatment facilities. Approximately 171,000 military retirees will be affected by the elimination of the TRICARE Prime option in these areas. DOD had planned PSA reductions since 2007, keeping existing PSAs in place until October 1, 2013. Beneficiaries in these areas must now use TRICARE Standard/Extra, obtain a waiver for TRICARE Prime, or seek alternative health coverage. The DOD announced changes to TRICARE Prime availability for beneficiaries in certain areas in the United States, affecting Prime Service Areas (PSAs) not close to military treatment facilities. Approximately 171,000 military retirees will be affected by the elimination of the TRICARE Prime option in these areas. Beneficiaries who live outside a T-3 PSA but within 100 miles of a Primary Care Manager can apply for Prime enrollment with a drive time waiver. Section 701 of the enacted bill guarantees affected beneficiaries within 100 miles of a Military Treatment Facility the right to continue their enrollment in Prime. DOD ensures affected beneficiaries within 100 miles of an MTF can stay enrolled in TRICARE Prime. Beneficiaries can apply for Prime enrollment with a drive-time waiver if they live outside a T-3 PSA. Contractors are not required to establish network capacity for those outside the PSA. Plans to eliminate TRICARE Prime coverage for certain areas are in place. The House-passed bill overrides DOD's plans to eliminate TRICARE Prime coverage for certain PSAs. Individuals within 100 miles of a military treatment facility can elect to remain in TRICARE Prime. The Senate bill does not have a similar provision. Previously, individuals could waive access standards to enroll in the Prime Service Area associated with the military treatment facility. The FY2013 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the future availability of TRICARE Prime for eligible beneficiaries. The report was submitted on March 22, 2013. In 2011, a commitment was made to implement a single electronic health record system, but in February 2013, it was announced that the departments would acquire EHRs separately for cost savings and meeting needs sooner. Since 2011, there has been a commitment to implement a single electronic health record system for the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. However, in February 2013, it was decided to acquire EHRs separately for cost savings and quicker implementation. Various initiatives have been undertaken to achieve greater EHR interoperability, but full capabilities have not been met as required by previous legislation. Status of the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) is being reviewed by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. Contact CRS Point of Contact Don Jansen at x[phone number scrubbed]."
