The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define a \"specified social security number\" as one issued by the Social Security Administration, excluding certain exceptions. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define a \"specified social security number\" as one issued by the Social Security Administration, excluding exceptions related to work authorization obtained through specific memorandums from the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum on November 20, 2014, regarding prosecutorial discretion for individuals who came to the US as children or are parents of US citizens. This includes deferred action programs not established by law. States deferred action on removal for certain beneficiaries of deferred action. Social security numbers issued for work authorization cease upon becoming a US citizen, with no retroactive effect. The text discusses the treatment of social security numbers for individuals becoming US citizens and coordination between the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration. The document issued to individuals under a specific program must have a notation indicating it was provided under that program. Additionally, actions must be taken to coordinate with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Social Security in carrying out the relevant section of the Internal Revenue Code. The Commissioner of Social Security is required to maintain records of social security account numbers and names, as described in section 32(m)(2)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to any tax return filed after the enactment of this Act."
