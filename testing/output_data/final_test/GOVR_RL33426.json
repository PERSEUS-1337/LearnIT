    "content": "Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 1980 to establish the Superfund program for hazardous substance cleanup. The program was funded by taxes on petroleum products and chemicals. CERCLA granted the federal government authority to respond to uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances that could harm public health or the environment. CERCLA, enacted in 1980, allows the EPA to compel responsible parties to clean up contaminated sites. The Superfund program, funded by taxes, can be used if PRPs are unable to clean up. Amendments have provided liability exemptions for military bases, financial institutions, and recycling facilities. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act added further liability relief. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) outlines procedures for the Superfund program. EPA leads responses to land and inland water releases, while the Coast Guard handles coastal waters. Superfund actions are triggered by hazardous substance releases into the environment, including water, soil, and air. CERCLA defines hazardous substances based on other environmental laws and authorizes EPA to respond to releases. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) authorizes EPA to respond to releases of pollutants or contaminants, excluding petroleum. The Superfund cleanup process begins with site discovery or notification of a hazardous substance release. CERCLA requires release notification if a hazardous substance is released above a certain threshold. Since the inception of the Superfund program, EPA has identified over 47,000 potentially contaminated sites in the CERCLIS database. Sites undergo a preliminary assessment to determine hazards, followed by screening with the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to assess contamination and risk. Sites scoring high on the HRS may be placed on the National Priorities List (NPL), with only a small percentage making the list. As of October 1, 2007, EPA has listed 1,569 sites on the NPL. The EPA has placed 1,569 sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) as of October 1, 2007. 321 sites have met cleanup goals and been removed from the NPL, while 1,030 sites have completed physical construction activities and are undergoing operation and maintenance. The NPL is a focal point for Superfund criticism, with ongoing debate about the expense and pace of cleaning up these sites. Despite some sites being addressed and immediate risks mitigated, many sites on the NPL still lack full cleanup implementation. The listing process and slow cleanup pace have raised concerns among interest groups. Factors like state support, community input, and budget issues influence site listing. The NPL's significance is limited as it doesn't assign liability or mandate actions. Response activities in the Superfund program include short-term removal and long-term remedial actions. The Superfund program includes short-term removal and long-term remedial actions. Trust fund monies can support removal actions at NPL or non-NPL sites, but remedial activities are only funded for NPL sites. Removal actions aim to stabilize sites quickly, with a limit of one year and $2 million in expenditures. Most removal actions occur at non-NPL sites, and not all actions are equally urgent. EPA categorizes removal actions into three groups. The EPA categorizes removal actions into three groups based on urgency: Classic emergencies, Time-Critical Actions, and Non-Time-Critical Actions. These actions may include repairing hazardous waste storage units, transporting leaking drums, and erecting security fences. The removal program typically receives about one-third of the funding allocated for remedial actions. The remedial program, core of the Superfund program, receives about one-third of the funding allocated. It involves a comprehensive investigation and analysis of cleanup alternatives, taking months to complete. EPA selects a remedy after the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. After completing the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), EPA selects a remedy for site contamination, involving public comment and state participation. The preferred option is a permanent remedy, with periodic reviews for effectiveness. Once a formal Record of Decision (ROD) is issued, the remedial design (RD) phase begins, lasting around two years. Subsequently, the cleanup process (Remedial Action) is initiated. The cleanup process under CERCLA begins after the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. It takes 8 to 11 years on average to complete, with EPA ensuring that cleanups protect human health and the environment. CERCLA imposes stringent liability on potentially responsible parties for hazardous substance releases. EPA may waive cleanup standards if necessary for balancing health and environmental protection with available funds. Potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA may include owners, operators, generators, and transporters who contributed to contamination at a Superfund site. CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability on PRPs, allowing EPA strong enforcement authority. CERCLA's liability scheme gives EPA enforcement authority over PRPs to address site contamination, with joint and several liability incentivizing PRPs to share cleanup costs. PRPs are also required to restore natural resources and pay for damage assessment. Federal, state, and tribal authorities serve as natural resource trustees under CERCLA. CERCLA designates federal, state, and tribal authorities as natural resource trustees. Only trustees can claim natural resource damages under CERCLA, with liability more narrow than cleanup costs. Natural resource injuries before 1980 are excluded, and claims must be made within three years of discovery. SARA in 1986 subjected federal facilities to CERCLA, leading to 172 federal facilities on the NPL, mostly defense sites. The Superfund Trust Fund cannot be used for cleanup at federal facilities, which are responsible for their own cleanup funding. EPA oversees remedy selection and remedial action at federal sites on the National Priorities List (NPL), while state laws apply to federal sites not on the NPL. States oversee cleanup at these sites, of which there are nearly 800 nationwide. SARA encourages state involvement in cleanup activities. SARA encourages state involvement at Superfund sites, outlining minimum requirements for state participation in decision-making and cost-sharing for cleanup. States may be hesitant to add Fund-led sites to the NPL due to budgetary reasons. EPA typically does not propose new sites to the NPL without a state's agreement. Of the roughly 10,000 sites in the CERCLIS database, about 90% are not on the NPL. State cleanup programs have authority to assess and clean up non-NPL sites. The report discusses Superfund issues including program funding and CERCLA interaction at specific site types. The Bush Administration's decision not to renew Superfund taxes led to controversy in 2002. Congress has supported this decision, resulting in the use of general revenues for cleanup funds. Efforts to reinstate the taxes have not been successful, despite the establishment of the Superfund program in 1980. Since its inception, Treasury revenues have supported the Superfund program, with the trust fund traditionally providing most funding through dedicated taxes on petroleum and chemical industries. However, the taxing authority expired in 1995, leading to a decline in the trust fund balance to zero by 2003. Congress has since funded the program through general Treasury revenues, with efforts to reinstate dedicated taxes unsuccessful. The Superfund program has traditionally been funded by dedicated taxes on industries, but since 1995, Congress has used General Treasury revenues to support it. Most cleanups are paid for by responsible parties, but for sites where PRPs are not found or lack financial resources (orphan sites), EPA uses trust fund money for cleanup. The ongoing funding debate focuses on whether a dedicated tax or General Treasury revenues should support the trust fund. Proponents of reinstating Superfund taxes argue for the \"polluter pays\" principle, stating that cleanup should be funded by industries responsible for contamination. Opponents argue the tax is unfair and overreaching, applying to all industry sectors. Maintaining needed cleanup levels without dedicated taxes may be challenging due to federal budget deficits. Amendments to CERCLA have addressed claims of unfairness by limiting banks' and lenders' exposure to Superfund liability. Businesses engaged in genuine recycling were absolved of liability under certain criteria. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act exempted contributors of small amounts of hazardous substances at NPL sites from liability. Residential property owners were also exempted. Legislation introduced in the 107th Congress aimed to reinstate Superfund taxes, but these efforts failed. In the 110th Congress, there were discussions about restoring the taxes, with bills introduced by Representative Maurice Hinchey and Senator Robert Casey to increase taxes by 50% for the first five years to fund cleanup at \"megasites.\" Members like Barbara Boxer and Hillary Clinton supported these efforts. Legislation introduced in the 107th Congress aimed to reinstate Superfund taxes, but efforts failed. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to increase taxes by 50% to fund cleanup at \"megasites.\" Concerns arise about insufficient funding for the Superfund program, with evidence showing appropriations falling short of program needs. If Congress increases annual appropriations without reinstating taxes, General Treasury revenues contribution may conflict with deficit reduction goals. In July 2001, Resources for the Future (RFF) released a study estimating future Superfund program needs for fiscal years 2000-2009. RFF projected base case program needs for FY2008 at $1.7 billion, with high and low cases at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion per year. Funding needs were expected to remain above $1.6 billion annually through FY2009. The report highlighted that recent Superfund appropriations have consistently fallen short of projected funding needs, with factors like the cost of remedial action at \"mega sites\" contributing to increased funding requirements. The Superfund program's funding needs were projected to remain above historic levels through FY2007, with costs expected to stay high through at least FY2009. The EPA's Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the financial impact of hardrock mining sites, identifying 156 sites nationwide that could cost between $7 billion and $24 billion to clean up. Funding shortfalls have been reported in recent years, with some EPA regional offices receiving no funds for requested construction at certain sites in FY2002. In FY2003, the EPA faced funding shortfalls for construction at multiple sites, with 11 sites unable to begin construction due to lack of funds. Additionally, in FY2004, 19 sites were ready for construction but did not receive funding. The House Energy and Commerce Committee reported a shortfall of $263.1 million, prompting calls for increased appropriations to meet funding needs. The Administration had requested funding increases in both FY2004 and FY2005, but construction delays persisted due to insufficient funding. In FY2004 and FY2005, Congress cut EPA's funding requests by $132 million and $134 million, respectively. In FY2006, the Administration requested $1.28 billion, but Congress reduced it by $40 million to $1.24 billion. The FY2007 request was $1.26 billion, $20 million less than before, but $20 million more than the previous year's enacted amount. The 109th Congress adjourned without finalizing FY2007 appropriations for EPA, enacting a continuing resolution instead. For FY2008, the Administration requested $1.24 billion. The Administration has requested $1.24 billion for FY2008 for the Superfund program. RFF estimates that up to $1.5 billion per year from General Treasury revenue would be needed to finance Superfund through the decade without Superfund taxes. CERCLA liability can drive cleanup but may disincentivize cleanup at abandoned hardrock mines. There are thousands of inactive hardrock mines in the US. The interaction between CERCLA and contaminated hardrock mines is examined in this section. Hardrock mining generates essential raw materials but also produces large amounts of waste. EPA data shows that the metal mining industry leads in annual releases of TRI chemicals. Many mines in the American West have been abandoned, with the exact number unknown. EPA estimates there are numerous inactive or abandoned mines. The EPA estimates that there are 200,000 inactive or abandoned mines in the country, with a varying number posing threats to water quality and public safety. While only a small percentage of these mines significantly contribute to health or environmental risks, the aggregate impact is substantial, leading to serious environmental impacts in localized areas. EPA has the authority under CERCLA to address environmental contamination at abandoned mine lands. The EPA has completed removal actions at 74 hardrock mining sites due to contamination like acid mine drainage. There are at least 88 hardrock mining sites listed on the NPL, with 17 considered mega sites costing over $50 million each for cleanup. Factors unique to the mining industry, such as complex ownership structures and high cleanup costs averaging $22 million for non-mega sites, contribute to the low percentage of sites listed on the NPL. The EPA faces challenges in cleanup efforts at mining sites due to high costs and state resistance. Factors like population growth and CWA requirements may increase the number of sites listed on the NPL for remediation. The federal government owns a significant amount of land in western states, including many abandoned mines. CERCLA prohibits the use of trust fund dollars at federally owned facilities, so federal land managers may need to clean up sites using their own budget. \"Good samaritans\" are parties that voluntarily clean up abandoned mines without legal responsibility, often with a vested interest in the cleanup. Some stakeholders believe that CERCLA liability deters good samaritan groups from offering cleanup assistance. EPA can hold one PRP responsible for entire site cleanup under joint and several liability. Good samaritans could potentially be liable as site owners, operators, or persons arranging disposal of hazardous substances. The threat of liability discourages volunteer cleanup at abandoned mining sites, leading to calls for federal legislation to protect good samaritans from Superfund's liability scheme. Some stakeholders support encouraging good samaritan assistance at AMLs, but environmental groups are concerned about exemptions from CERCLA's liability. The \"good samaritan provision\" in CERCLA \u00a7 107(d) allows cleanup assistance without liability. The BFPP exemption added by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 provides liability protection for parties purchasing contaminated property. The BFPP exemption provides liability protection for parties purchasing contaminated property, but it is conditional. BFPPs must take reasonable steps to address releases and prevent exposure to hazardous substances. Congress did not intend to create the same response obligations as CERCLA liable parties, but landowners cannot ignore potential dangers on their property. The threat of Superfund liability remains for parties dealing with hazardous substances on their property. Good samaritans may be uncertain about EPA's application of BFPP provisions at mining sites, especially with the possibility of citizen suits. Despite four good samaritan bills introduced in the 109th Congress, none received committee action. No bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress. In the United States, there are approximately 238,000 animal feeding operations (AFO) that generate hazardous substances like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and phosphorous. CERCLA requires reporting of releases above certain quantities, raising questions about how it applies to AFOs. The EPA is considering exempting concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) from reporting air emissions under CERCLA. This exemption would treat the entire site as a facility, potentially leading to more breaches of reportable quantity levels due to aggregated release locations. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson testified before a House Subcommittee about the development of this regulation, which he described as \"very narrow.\" The EPA is considering exempting CAFOs from reporting air emissions under CERCLA, with concerns about manure reaching water bodies. Recent court cases have raised issues about the applicability of CERCLA to manure application on land. Settlements in previous cases have not provided a formal ruling on the matter, but a third case is currently in the federal system, causing concern in the agricultural community about potential legal actions. Recent congressional interest in exempting manure from CERCLA requirements has led to legislative proposals in the 109th and 110th Congress, but none were enacted. Senator Blanche Lincoln also proposed an exemption for manure in an energy bill, but the amendment was not offered during debate. The Senate passed H.R. 6 on June 21, 2007, addressing Superfund issues. The topics discussed in the report are interconnected, with actions like adding mining sites to the NPL potentially impacting Superfund program funding debates. CERCLA's application to animal feeding operations could strain agency resources, sparking further discussions on Superfund taxes and funding levels."
