    "content": "Establishment of Nondeductible Tax-Free Individual Retirement Accounts under section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A special individual retirement account is treated similarly to an individual retirement plan, with no deduction allowed for contributions and a limit on the total amount that can be contributed in a taxable year. The tax treatment of distributions from a special individual retirement account is subject to specific rules, including limitations on rollover contributions and qualified transfers. Any amount distributed from a special individual retirement account is not included in the gross income of the recipient, except for earnings on contributions held less than 5 years, which are taxable. When distributing from a retirement account, the amount is taken first from the earliest contribution and earnings, then from other contributions in order. Allocations between contributions and earnings are first to earnings, then to the contribution. Earnings are allocated to contributions as prescribed by the Secretary. Contributions made in the same year can be treated as one contribution. \"For additional tax for early withdrawal, refer to section 72(t).\" \"Qualified transfers to another special individual retirement account are exempt from distribution rules. Contributions transferred to another account are treated as held during the contribution period.\" \"In the case of a qualified transfer to a special individual retirement account from an individual retirement plan, any amount that would be included in gross income is exempt from section 72(t) if the transfer occurs before January 1, 1994. The amount includible in gross income is spread out over 4 taxable years.\" The term 'qualified transfer' refers to a transfer to a special individual retirement account from another account or plan, subject to certain conditions. If the taxpayer's income exceeds a specified amount plus $10,000, the transfer is not considered qualified. The paragraph discusses rules related to special individual retirement accounts, including definitions of terms and exceptions for transfers between such accounts. Additionally, it mentions amendments to the early withdrawal penalty rules for special individual retirement accounts. The text discusses distributions from special individual retirement accounts and amendments related to excess contributions and deductions. The amendments related to special individual retirement accounts apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1993, with exceptions for qualified transfers in 1993."
