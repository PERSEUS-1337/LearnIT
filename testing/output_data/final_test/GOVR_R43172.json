    "content": "The Obama Administration proposed a strategic review of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in its FY2014 budget proposal. TVA, established in the 1930s, is a federally owned corporation that provides low-cost electricity to the Southeastern United States. It covers a large territory and serves over nine million people, operating as a self-financing Government corporation. TVA is looking to modernize its generation system to meet future capacity needs and environmental responsibilities. TVA's capital investment plan includes over $25 billion in expenditures over the next decade, but its anticipated needs may surpass the $30 billion statutory cap on debt. The Administration is considering options, including divestiture, due to TVA's debt constraints and impact on the Federal deficit. Some believe TVA has achieved its goals and no longer requires federal participation. The Administration is considering options, including divestiture, due to TVA's debt constraints and impact on the Federal deficit. Some believe TVA has achieved its goals and no longer requires federal participation. The strategic review may consider divestiture of TVA as a potential alternative. TVA is cooperating with the review, which will discuss its history and role mostly from an energy standpoint. Congress may need to consider if a federal role is still necessary to achieve the TVA Act's objectives. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established by Congress in response to the Great Depression with a mission to improve navigation, minimize flood damage, and promote agricultural and industrial development in the Tennessee Valley. The TVA Act of 1933 outlines flood control, reforestation, and national defense as key considerations. The current strategic review may consider divestiture of TVA due to debt constraints and its impact on the Federal deficit. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) manages the Tennessee River system for navigation, flood control, power generation, and economic development in the Tennessee Valley region. TVA also generates and sells electricity, promotes economic development, preserves assets and federal lands, and conducts research and technology. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) primarily focuses on managing the Tennessee River system for navigation, flood control, and power generation. While originally focused on flood control and economic development, TVA now operates as a power generation company, aiming to provide electricity at the lowest feasible rates to its wholesale customers in the Tennessee Valley region. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operates as a power generation company, providing electricity at low rates to wholesale customers in the multi-state Tennessee Valley region. TVA is self-financing through electricity sales and bond financing, overseen by a Board of Directors setting electric power rates without regulatory approval. TVA's service territory covers parts of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) provides electricity in a region with limited competition, governed by federal laws like the \"fence\" and \"anti-cherrypicking\" provision. TVA owns coal and natural gas power stations with a total capacity of 14,573 MegaWatts. Efforts to modify the anti-cherrypicking provision have been unsuccessful. TVA operates various power stations including natural gas, coal, nuclear, and hydropower with a total capacity of over 14,573 MW. This includes combustion turbines, combined cycle units, nuclear units, conventional hydropower, and pumped storage hydropower. Additionally, TVA sells hydropower from other dams. TVA owns dams and buys renewable energy through a Standard Offer program. They purchase renewable energy at fixed rates and offer power purchase agreements for projects within their footprint. The Standard Offer resulted in four renewable projects with a potential generating capacity of eight MegaWatts. TVA's transmission system consists of approximately 15,940 circuit miles of transmission lines. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) owns a transmission system with approximately 15,940 circuit miles of transmission lines operating at 500 kV and 161 kV levels. The sale of electric power by TVA is governed by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, which requires electricity rates to cover operating costs, debt service, and other expenses at low rates. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) sells power at wholesale rates to distribution utilities, with rates set by the TVA Board in accordance with the TVA Act. There are 155 distribution companies that resell TVA power to end-use consumers, including municipal utility companies and cooperatives. Rates aim to be as low as feasible, with a focus on the primary objectives of the Act. Municipal and cooperative customer-owned companies in the TVA region account for 85% of total revenue. TVA also sells power to large industrial customers, federal government installations, and utilities outside its service territory. Electricity rates can vary due to local factors like regulatory regime, power generation plants, fuel costs, and geography. TVA provides retail rate data for comparison with other states. TVA aims to have competitive residential and commercial rates, benchmarked against top utilities. They compare their rates to surrounding states and aim to be in the top quartile by 2020. This helps with economic development goals. The TVA aims to have competitive residential and commercial rates, benchmarked against top utilities. Residential electricity rates for TVA are lower in the early years compared to most states, rising to mid-range later on. TVA's non-residential average effective rate is the lowest among compared states. The TVA Act directs TVA to focus on economic and agricultural development, environmental stewardship, and technological innovation in electric power use. TVA's technology innovation mission, as directed by the TVA Act, includes promoting the wider and better use of electric power for various sectors. Current initiatives focus on grid modernization, Smart Grid, energy utilization, clean energy, and transportation sector efficiency. TVA is investigating clean energy technologies, electric vehicles, and preparing for the deployment of small modular nuclear reactors at its Clinch River site. Past initiatives include development of synchronous compensators and an environmental research program at the TVA Environmental Research Center in Muscle Shoals, AL. The electric power industry in the United States is undergoing a period of transition. The electric power industry in the United States is transitioning with aging power plants and transmission systems. New environmental regulations from the EPA and competition from natural gas are impacting power generation choices. Proposed regulations would impose new requirements on fossil fuel-fired power plants at both federal and state levels. The EPA has introduced various regulations at the state level, including the Utility MACT rule to reduce emissions. President Obama's climate change initiative directed the EPA to develop GHG standards for existing power plants by June 2015. Electric power generation accounts for about 37% of U.S. emissions. The TVA, like other utilities, is facing decisions on retiring or replacing older power plants due to aging and new environmental regulations. TVA uses the integrated resource plan methodology to select energy resources and set electricity rates based on system costs. The TVA's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) sets the cost of service used for electricity rates, allowing flexibility to make sound choices amid economic and regulatory uncertainty. The 2011 IRP anticipates growth in electricity demand but identifies a need for additional resources due to increasing competition, technological change, fuel costs, and environmental concerns. TVA faces challenges with fuel costs, compliance with environmental laws, and emissions reduction requirements. This may lead to the removal of aging coal-fired units from service. To meet regulations, TVA plans to install clean air equipment on coal units and replace them with cleaner nuclear and gas-fired units, requiring significant capital expenditures. The goal is to create a flexible plan that allows for adjustments in response to changing circumstances. The 2011 IRP developed a \"recommended planning direction\" accepted by TVA, including idling coal-fired capacity and adding pumped-storage hydropower. TVA's current estimate of costs and planned expenditures for environmental requirements related to coal-fired power plants are listed in Table 4. The Obama Administration's 2014 budget projects that the capital costs to fulfill TVA's environmental responsibilities and modernize its aging generation system will likely cause TVA to exceed its $30 billion statutory cap on indebtedness. TVA recorded provisions for almost $11 billion in regulatory assets, including funds for decommissioning nuclear plants, clean-up of coal ash spill, and unrealized losses on derivatives. The curr_chunk discusses how TVA accounts for over $5 billion in deferred pension and post-retirement benefits costs as regulatory assets. TVA assesses the probability of recovering these costs based on factors like regulatory changes and technology advancements. If accounting rules change, TVA may need to write off these assets, impacting net income. TVA, a government corporation, faces potential financial risk if privatized due to large deferred regulatory assets. It is required to be self-supported through the sale of electric power and can issue up to $30 billion in bonds for financing power plant construction. TVA can issue up to $30 billion in bonds to finance its power program and refund existing bonds. The corporation faces challenges with environmental compliance and modernizing power plants due to funding limitations. TVA may need alternative financing for environmental compliance and modernizing power plants due to funding limitations set by the TVA Act, which authorizes up to $30 billion in bonds. TVA may seek alternative financing options for environmental compliance and power plant modernization due to funding limitations set by the TVA Act, which allows up to $30 billion in bonds. TVA's revenues were $11.2 billion in FY2012, with net income of $60 million. Fuel costs and purchased power were the largest expenses. TVA currently has $24.1 billion in outstanding debts, which count towards the statutory cap. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) generates revenue through the sale of electricity, with debts not guaranteed by the federal government. Despite using bonds for debt payment, the federal government includes TVA's debt in the federal deficit. TVA's main mission is flood damage minimization and navigation stewardship, with hydropower as a secondary opportunity. Revenues from electricity sales now fund TVA water resource programs previously supported by federal appropriations. In 2011, TVA earned nearly $12 billion from electricity sales. Multiple purpose dams and reservoirs help manage water flows. The operation of multiple use dams involves balancing water flows to prevent downstream flooding and accommodate various water resource needs. This includes maintaining water volumes for drinking water, navigation, fish habitats, and downstream water quality. If hydropower assets were sold to private owners, ensuring the safe and legal accomplishment of navigation, flood damage mitigation, water quality, recreation, water supply, and land use missions would be a concern. Maximizing water flows for power generation may not always align with other demands. The Obama Administration proposed a strategic review of the TVA in its FY2014 budget, concerned about future costs for modernization and meeting environmental requirements. Most TVA stakeholders prefer keeping it as a federal government corporation to avoid higher electricity rates. Implementation of the current or revised IRP may lead to increased electricity rates. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated TVA to implement a least cost planning program, reflected in its current IRP process. TVA's 2011 IRP projected over $25 billion in capital investments over the next decade, potentially exceeding its $30 billion statutory limit due to existing debt. Funding concerns for environmental compliance and power plant modernization could lead to cost reductions, higher rates, or raising the statutory cap on indebtedness. Sale of TVA assets has been suggested as a possible solution. Congress may need to address TVA's indebtedness and consider raising the statutory limit to fund capital investments. Another option is to allow competition within TVA's service territory, potentially requiring a revision to the TVA Act. Maintaining the current limit may result in a reduced power generation mission. A new IRP focused on reduced capital investment plan may require a revision of the TVA Act to allow competition in TVA's service territory. This could lead to a federal plan to restructure TVA's indebtedness and potentially reduce its power generation mission. Funding for TVA's other missions may need to come from federal government appropriations. The TVA Act may need to be amended to allow TVA to sell wholesale power at market-based rates, potentially reducing the need for future financing and TVA's indebtedness. The Administration believes TVA has achieved its original objectives, but most stakeholders prefer to keep TVA as a federal government corporation. Congress may need to consider these factors when deciding on the future of TVA. Congress may want to consider allowing TVA to continue funding its needs from operating revenues and creative financing approaches. A potential redefinition of TVA's status as a government corporation could remove its indebtedness from the federal budget. The entity may be designed to remove TVA's indebtedness from the federal government's balance sheets, potentially increasing TVA's financing costs. Modifying TVA's missions by separating navigation, flood control, and funding from economic development and power generation could be considered. Revising or repealing the TVA Act may be necessary for this option, and evaluating TVA's missions to determine if federal participation is still warranted is recommended. Ending the federal role could result in a significant portion of TVA's debt being removed from federal accounting. If privatization of TVA occurs, a market-based valuation of assets would be needed, with possible write-downs. Some nuclear or fossil power generation may remain under federal ownership due to decommissioning obligations. Selling hydropower assets to private owners raises questions about fulfilling missions like navigation and water quality. The management of water flows for power generation may conflict with other river and reservoir system demands."
