    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000\" and requires modifications to low-power FM regulations. The \"Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000\" mandates modifications to low-power FM regulations, including prescribing minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels and prohibiting applicants with a history of unlicensed station operation. The \"Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000\" mandates changes to low-power FM regulations, including reducing distance separations for third-adjacent channels and expanding eligibility for low-power FM stations. Any license issued before the rule modifications will be invalid if it does not comply. Further evaluation of third-adjacent channel protections is required through a pilot program. The Federal Communications Commission will conduct a pilot program to test low-power FM radio stations' interference with existing FM stations by waiving minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels in nine markets. The program will evaluate the need for these separations for FM translator stations. The Commission may waive minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels for stations in the experimental program if it is in the public interest. An independent testing entity will conduct field tests in markets of the stations, including public comment on interference and audience listening tests to determine harmful interference. Results of the program and field tests will be published for Congress. The Federal Communications Commission will submit a report on the experimental program and field tests to Congress by February 1, 2001. The report will include an analysis of the program, evaluation of the impact of minimum distance separations on listening audiences and FM radio broadcasters. The Federal Communications Commission will submit a report to Congress including analysis on FM radio broadcasters, minority and small market broadcasters, digital radio transition, reading services for the blind, FM radio translator stations, recommendations to reduce minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels, and other relevant information."
