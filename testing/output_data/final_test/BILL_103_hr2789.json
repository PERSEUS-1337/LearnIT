The \"Medicaid Health Allowance Act of 1993\" allows states to include expenditures under health allowance programs as medical assistance under the State plan for federal payment, with restrictions on acute care services. The \"Medicaid Health Allowance Act of 1993\" permits states to count expenses from health allowance programs as medical assistance in the State plan for federal reimbursement, with limitations on acute care services. States must meet specific criteria regarding the sale and marketing of health plans to be eligible for federal funding. The \"Medicaid Health Allowance Act of 1993\" allows states to include health allowance program expenses in the State plan for federal reimbursement, with restrictions on acute care services. States must meet criteria on health insurance plan regulations, quality assurance standards, and reporting requirements to qualify for federal funding. The \"Medicaid Health Allowance Act of 1993\" allows states to include health allowance program expenses in the State plan for federal reimbursement. This includes criteria on health insurance plan regulations, quality assurance standards, and reporting requirements. The act also mandates the collection of clinical data, patient satisfaction data, and other information for comparison of plan quality. Additionally, it requires the establishment of a State entity to collect and report this data to the Secretary. The act also includes requirements for rating bands for premiums under community rating standards. The Secretary sets limits on premium rate variations for carriers based on demographic characteristics, not claims experience or health status, ensuring rates do not exceed 15 percent of the index rate. The term 'carrier' refers to any entity providing health insurance in a State, including insurance companies, prepaid hospital plans, and health maintenance organizations. Rates are set based on demographic characteristics, not claims experience or health status, to ensure fairness among employers with similar characteristics. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"class of business\" in relation to a carrier and small employers. It explains how a carrier can establish distinct groups of employers based on health benefit plans. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for health benefit plans to be considered distinct groups, including being marketed separately, acquired from another carrier, or provided through an association with a minimum membership of 100. The curr_chunk specifies that a carrier cannot establish more than 2 groupings under each class of business based on managed-care techniques that significantly affect healthcare costs, except with approval from a State Insurance Commissioner. Insurance of a State may approve additional distinct groups to enhance efficiency and fairness in the employer marketplace based on demographic characteristics like age, gender, industry, geographic area, family composition, and group size. The term \"index rate\" refers to the average of the base premium rate and the highest applicable rate for a class of business. The Secretary will establish standards if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners fails to do so within 9 months of the Act's enactment. A State health allowance program involves the State making payments to the individual's insurer. The State makes payments to the individual's insurer as an allowance towards the costs of providing benefits under an approved health benefit plan, subject to state-established standards. The State plan provides medical assistance under specific conditions, with annual adjustments based on actuarial value comparisons. The State plan must include a health maintenance organization or capitated plan for providing medical assistance. Individuals enrolled in the State plan should not have to pay more in cost-sharing than they would under the previous State plan. The State may request a waiver from the Secretary to exempt certain political subdivisions from the requirement of having the State health allowance program. Individuals can participate in the program if they meet State-imposed criteria, with automatic enrollment for those with income at or below a certain level. The State can enroll individuals in the health benefit program based on income levels, with automatic enrollment for those at or below 100 percent of the official poverty line. For individuals above this threshold, the State may require additional cost-sharing based on a sliding scale. The State can enroll individuals in the health benefit program based on income levels, with automatic enrollment for those at or below 100 percent of the official poverty line. Individuals with income equal to or greater than 200 percent of the poverty line can also be enrolled, but their expenses are not counted as medical assistance. Those entitled to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act are not eligible to participate in the program. Under the State criteria, eligible individuals can participate in the State health allowance program without meeting resource standards approved by the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate the program's effectiveness every three years. The Secretary will evaluate the State health allowance programs' effectiveness in increasing insurance coverage and controlling healthcare costs. Reports will be submitted to Congress every three years. Additionally, there will be a reduction in payment adjustments for states participating in the program. The Secretary will reduce payment adjustments for states with health allowance programs to ensure total payments do not exceed what would have been paid without the program. The amendments made by section 2 will be effective for calendar quarters starting on or after January 1, 1994."
