    "content": "In 2006, the United States provided $2.1 billion in international food aid, delivering over 3 million metric tons of agricultural commodities to 65 countries, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the aid was for emergencies, benefiting 50-70 million people annually through programs administered by USAID and the World Food Program. The US is the largest contributor to the WFP, providing about 40% of total donor contributions in 2006. The United States has been a significant contributor to international food aid programs, providing about 50% of the food aid distributed by the World Food Program since 1995. Legislative authority for these programs expires in 2007, with the 110th Congress considering extension and reauthorization as part of the 2007 farm bill. The US provides aid through various programs such as P.L. 480, Food for Progress, Farmer-to-Farmer, McGovern-Dole, and others. The food aid reauthorization debate in Congress focuses on P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations and food aid for school feeding and child nutrition in the McGovern-Dole program. P.L. 480 Title II provides for the donation of U.S. agricultural commodities to foreign countries for humanitarian needs. USAID administers the program, with a minimum of 2.5 million metric tons of commodities to be provided each year. In recent years, emergency food aid has become the largest component of Title II, while the use of food aid in development projects has declined substantially. P.L. 480 Title I uses long term, low interest loans to finance government-to-government purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities by developing countries and emerging markets. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers the Title I program and has been phasing out funding for it. No funding was requested for Title I in FY2007 or FY2008 budget requests. Title III of P.L. 480, administered by USAID, provides government-to-government grants for economic development in least developed countries. Funding for Title III has not been requested or appropriated since FY2001. The John Ogonowski Farmer-to-Farmer Program, under Title V of P.L. 480, aims to improve global food production through technical assistance without using commodities. It receives 0.5% of P.L. 480 funds for its activities. The Emerson Trust, authorized under the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust Act of 1998, is a reserve of commodities and cash to meet humanitarian food needs in developing countries. It can hold up to four million metric tons of grains, with wheat being the only commodity ever held. Funds from P.L. 480 can be used to purchase grain to replace supplies released from the reserve, limited to $20 million per fiscal year. The Emerson Trust, established in 1998, holds commodities and cash to address food needs in developing countries. It can store up to four million metric tons of grains, mainly wheat. Emergency funds can replenish the Trust, but it's not mandatory. Currently, it holds 915,000 metric tons of wheat and $107 million. The McGovern-Dole program, authorized in 2002, provides U.S. agricultural commodities and assistance for school feeding and nutrition programs in foreign countries. Administered by USDA, the program is flexible in combining food, cash, and technical aid to achieve its goals. Food For Progress (FFP) provides U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries and emerging democracies committed to free enterprise in their agricultural economies. Authorized in the 1985 farm bill (P.L. 99-198) and administered by USDA, FFP can be funded through appropriations for P.L. 480 Title I or Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds. Section 416(b) of the Agriculture Act of 1949 allows donations of surplus U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries, administered by USDA and operating similarly to Title II. The USDA administers Section 416(b) of the 2002 farm bill, providing commodities for emergency and non-emergency assistance through PVOs, cooperatives, and the WFP. Food aid from Section 416(b) is dependent on surplus CCC inventories. Proponents argue for food aid due to the large number of chronically hungry people globally, estimated at over 850 million by the FAO. However, the average annual food aid of 10 million metric tons from all donors is insufficient to address global hunger. The average annual total volume of food aid is equivalent to about 2% of world grain trade and less than 0.5% of world grain production. FAO calculates that distributing all food aid evenly among the 850 million hungry people would only provide about 12 kilograms of grain per person per year. Emergency food aid is crucial for basic nutritional needs during humanitarian crises, saving millions of lives. USAID reports that over 70% of U.S. food aid in FY2006 was provided as emergency aid. In FY2006, over 70% of U.S. food aid was provided as emergency aid, with the timely delivery of food aid in crisis situations relieving pressure on the poor to sell assets. However, other methods like cash vouchers may be more effective than in-kind food aid. USAID emphasizes that combining food aid with non-food resources is essential for reducing food insecurity. The United States provides all its food aid in the form of commodities, while other major donors like the European Union and Canada have different policies. The EU focuses on purchasing food aid in developing countries and has shifted towards a food security policy. Canada allows up to 50% of its food aid to be purchased locally. Most donors provide cash donations for the World Food Program to purchase commodities for emergency food aid distribution. The United States provides food aid in the form of commodities, distributed by the WFP primarily for emergency situations. Time delays in shipping from the U.S. can hinder rapid responses to emergencies, taking 3-5 months for commodities to reach their destination. To expedite arrivals, USAID pre-positions commodities in ports closer to emergencies. However, current legislation limits funds for pre-positioning, affecting cost-efficiency of food delivery. The cost-efficiency of delivering food commodities is impacted by transportation costs, with a significant portion of funds allocated to cover these costs. The Administration has proposed allocating funds to purchase commodities closer to where they are needed to reduce transportation expenses. The Cargo Preference Act contains legislation related to transportation of U.S. food aid on U.S. flag vessels. The Cargo Preference Act (P.L. 83-644, August 26, 1954 as amended) requires 75% of U.S. agricultural commodities financed under P.L. 480 to be shipped on U.S.-registered vessels. While maritime interests support cargo preference, opponents argue it increases shipping costs and reduces food aid volume. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that food aid shipments on U.S.-flag vessels do little to maintain the U.S. merchant marine and raise transportation costs, affecting food aid programs. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) reimburses food aid agencies for cargo preference costs, stating it has minimal impact on food aid availability. P.L. 480 allows PVOs to sell a percentage of donated commodities to finance internal operations or development projects. Under Section 203 of P.L. 480, PVOs and cooperatives can sell a portion of donated commodities to fund development projects. Nearly 70% of food aid commodities provided to PVOs and cooperatives are monetized, indicating a significant need for cash to support development projects. Under Section 203 of P.L. 480, PVOs and cooperatives can sell a portion of donated commodities to fund development projects. Not less than 5% nor more than 10% of funds in a fiscal year to Title II are available for eligible organizations to establish new programs or cover specific administrative costs. Some PVOs are questioning the use of monetization as CARE plans to transition out of it due to its management-intensive, costly, and economically inefficient nature. Monetization of food aid programs is criticized for being less cost-effective than providing cash directly for food security. It can harm local markets, traders, and farmers, undermining long-term food security goals. While some organizations like CARE are phasing out monetization, others, like Catholic Relief Services, still support it for its perceived benefits in low-income countries reliant on food imports. Monetization of food aid programs is supported by some for compensating limited liquidity or credit for food imports, increasing small-scale traders' participation in local markets, controlling urban price spikes, and integrating commodities into agricultural processing operations. Proponents emphasize the need for market analysis to prevent interference with local production and ensure adequate storage. The current World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has unresolved issues regarding food aid. Some U.S. trading partners accuse the United States of using food aid to bypass export subsidy reduction commitments and displace commercial sales. The EU proposes subjecting food aid to rules applying to other export subsidies and offers to eliminate its agricultural export subsidies worth $3 billion if the U.S. reduces food aid and export credit guarantees. U.S. PVOs monetizing food aid commodities for projects in developing countries are concerned about new WTO regulations. Some U.S. PVOs using food aid to fund projects in developing countries are worried about new WTO rules limiting their work. Negotiators agreed on establishing disciplines for in-kind food aid and monetization to prevent displacement of commercial sales. Safe box for emergency food aid was agreed upon in a Doha Round negotiating session in December 2005. The chairperson of the agriculture negotiations in the Doha Round circulated a draft of possible modalities for food aid programs by WTO member countries. The draft includes provisions for needs-driven and grant-based food aid, prohibiting commercial re-exportation of food aid commodities. The draft modalities report outlines provisions for emergency and non-emergency food aid, including the establishment of a safe box for emergency aid. Emergency aid is not subject to challenge if there is a declaration of emergency or an appeal for aid from relevant UN agencies. Non-emergency aid must be based on need assessment by a third-party organization, targeted to vulnerable populations, and aligned with specific developmental objectives or nutritional requirements. Monetization is only permissible under certain conditions. The report outlines provisions for emergency and non-emergency food aid, including the establishment of a safe box for emergency aid. Monetization is only permissible under certain conditions, such as funding activities directly related to food aid delivery or agricultural inputs procurement. Legislative proposals for increased funding of the McGovern-Dole International School Feeding and Child Nutrition Program were introduced in the 110th Congress. Transportation costs and delays in emergency situations prompted the Administration to propose changes. The Administration proposed giving USAID the authority to use up to 25% of funds for P.L. 480 Title II to purchase commodities closer to where they are needed in emergency situations. This would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of food aid response by eliminating the need for ocean transport. Savings in transportation costs could be used for additional commodity purchases, enhancing the overall U.S. response to emergencies. Local or regional purchases would also expedite food supply delivery. The President's FY2006 budget proposed shifting $300 million from P.L. 480 Title II to USAID's International Disaster and Famine Assistance account for local or regional food purchases. This plan faced opposition from farm groups, agribusinesses, and PVOs concerned about reduced commodities for development projects. The report accompanying the FY2006 agriculture appropriations act addressed the issue of converting P.L. 480 commodity food aid into cash. The President's budget requests for FY2007 and FY2008 proposed allowing the use of up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchases of commodities in food crises. The Senate report rejected this proposal, stating that the Committee does not agree with the Administration's plan to shift funds for direct cash purchases. Proponents of local or regional purchase argue that it would mean quicker and lower-cost delivery of food and be less likely to disrupt receiving country markets. There are risks if local markets are unable to absorb large increases in food demand, but studies show that these risks are manageable. Local food aid procurement was found to be 66% less expensive than shipments directly from donor countries, and an estimated 60% of all food aid is locally or regionally procured. The Alliance for Food Aid, representing 15 PVOs and cooperatives, proposes legislative changes in U.S. food aid programs. They recommend establishing a \"safe box\" for non-emergency food aid to provide 1.2 million metric tons of commodities annually to carry out development projects. The Alliance for Food Aid recommends legislative changes in U.S. food aid programs, including eliminating the requirement that 75% of Title II commodities be allocated to non-emergency food aid programs. This mandate has not been met in recent years, causing concern for PVOs/cooperatives relying on food aid for development projects. They also suggest increasing cash availability under Section 202(e) of P.L. 107-171 to 10% and allowing PVOs/cooperatives to use it. The Alliance for Food Aid recommends increasing cash availability under Section 202(e) of P.L. 107-171 to 10% and allowing PVOs/cooperatives to use it for development projects, needs assessments, and monitoring. This would enable organizations to substitute cash for monetization in non-emergency programs. The Alliance for Food Aid supports monetization for non-emergency programs based on market analysis. They advocate for changes in the Emerson Trust to improve its response time to emergencies and prevent shifting of non-emergency food aid. The Alliance proposes increasing funds for BEHT reimbursements from $20 million to $60 million annually until the Trust reaches its maximum level. The Alliance for Food Aid advocates for replenishing the Trust with funds instead of commodities to ensure the most appropriate items can be procured during emergencies. They do not support the Administration's proposal for local or regional purchase of commodities but suggest a pilot project for future program improvements. The Alliance calls for an annual appropriation of at least $100 million for multi-year programs, rather than a substantial increase in funding for the McGovern-Dole program. The group of four PVOs, formerly part of the Coalition for Food Aid, recommends legislative changes in U.S. food aid programs. They propose phasing out monetization in favor of increasing cash availability for P.L. 480 Title II programs. Their main recommendations focus on this shift away from monetization. PVOs recommend legislative changes in U.S. food aid programs, including utilizing the Emerson Trust more effectively for emergency food needs and increasing resources for emergency food aid to 50% of Title II. They suggest liquidating current stocks in the Trust for cash, allowing the CCC to invest the cash, and requiring the Administration to use the Trust once Title II emergency funding is exhausted. The group of four PVOs recommends legislative changes to U.S. food aid programs, including utilizing the Emerson Trust more effectively for emergency food needs and establishing a \"bridging mechanism\" to prevent funding breaks in the food aid pipeline. This mechanism would allow the Administrator of USAID to draw on CCC funds for commodities and freight before the enactment of an appropriation, with reimbursement from the Title II appropriation when available. The group of four PVOs proposes using CCC funds to finance operations of the BEHT or establish a bridging mechanism to minimize harm to participants in food aid programs. They also suggest making more cash available through Title II for greater flexibility in fighting world hunger. The group of four PVOs proposes increasing cash resources for addressing hunger, focusing on Section 202(e) cash and advocating for a minimum of 25% of funds available to Title II. They suggest using authorizing language similar to the McGovern-Dole program to allow for a mix of commodities, cash, and technical assistance. This approach aims to discourage monetizing commodities and promote the more cost-effective use of cash. Title III of the House and Senate farm bill reauthorizes and amends U.S. international food aid programs, extending them through 2012. The bills incorporate recommendations from PVOs/cooperatives for program changes. The House bill extends P.L. 480 food aid programs through 2012 and authorizes $2.5 billion annually for humanitarian donations. The Senate bill includes a pilot program for local or regional purchase of emergency food aid commodities using P.L. 480 Title II funds. The House and Senate farm bill reauthorizes and amends U.S. international food aid programs, extending them through 2012. The House bill authorizes $2.5 billion annually for humanitarian donations, while the Senate bill includes a pilot program for local or regional purchase of emergency food aid commodities using P.L. 480 Title II funds. H.R. 2419 increases cash support for project-related expenses for PVOs under Title II. The Senate version also reauthorizes P.L. 480 food aid programs and extends minimum tonnage requirements through 2012. The Senate bill extends P.L. 480 food aid programs through 2012 without increasing the appropriation for Title II. It raises the share of funds for project-related expenses of PVOs to at least 7.5%. The bill sets a minimum of $600 million for development food aid, which cannot be waived. The House bill provision in H.R. 2419 opposes the Administration's ability to quickly waive emergency food aid, resulting in a $100 million decrease. The bill allocates $40 million for famine prevention and relief through USAID's IDFA program, allowing for local or regional commodity purchases. The Senate bill establishes a $25 million annual pilot program for exploring local or regional food procurement in emergencies. Both the House and Senate bills extend provisions for the Food Aid Consultative Group (FACG) to review the effectiveness of the Title II program. The Senate bill adds a representative from the maritime transport sector to the FACG. Both bills also extend authorization for USAID grants for stockpiling and distributing shelf-stable foods, with the House bill increasing the appropriation amount to $7 million and the Senate bill to $8 million. Additionally, both bills extend authorization for the use of P.L. 480 funds for prepositioning agricultural commodities overseas, with the House bill increasing the amount for overseas storage to $8 million and the Senate bill increasing the amount for overseas storage as well. The House bill authorizes $10 million for sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries and $5 million for all other countries for the Farmer-to-Farmer Program. The Senate bill increases spending on transporting commodities from $40 million to $48 million annually for FY2008-FY2010. The House bill reauthorizes the Food for Progress program through FY2012 without change, while the Senate bill reauthorizes it and increases spending. The House-passed bill changes the funding basis of the McGovern-Dole program from discretionary to mandatory and increases spending from $140 million in FY2009 to $300 million. The Senate bill reauthorizes the McGovern-Dole program, increasing funding to $300 million annually and making it mandatory. The bill also reauthorizes the Trust through 2012 and allows for a combination of commodities and cash not exceeding 4 million tons. Funding for the program would be offset by changes in the federal crop insurance program. The bill reauthorizes the Emerson Trust through FY2012, allowing for a combination of commodities and cash not exceeding 4 million tons. Funds in the trust can be exchanged for P.L. 480 Title II, McGovern-Dole program, or the market, if approved by the Secretary of Agriculture. The trust funds can be invested in low-risk short-term securities."
