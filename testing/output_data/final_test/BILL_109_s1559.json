Congress finds that a significant number of military service members and their families face economic hardships due to injuries sustained during service.

The purpose of the Act is to raise awareness of the personal and financial struggles of military members. The Act aims to raise awareness and provide a way for taxpayers to help alleviate the personal and financial hardships faced by members of the Armed Forces, military retirees, veterans, and their families as they serve the nation.
