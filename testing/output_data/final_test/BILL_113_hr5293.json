Congress finds that the Russian Federation is no longer in compliance with the INF Treaty, as reported by the New York Times in 2014. Concerns about Russian compliance were raised by Acting Assistant Secretary of State Anita E. Friedt in testimony before the House of Representatives. The US is seeking clear answers from Russia regarding concerns about the INF Treaty's importance to Euro-Atlantic security. They are coordinating with NATO allies and keeping Congress informed. Efforts are being made to work with Russia to address concerns and improve security relations. Ms. Elaine Bunn expressed concerns about Russian activities violating the INF Treaty, stating that the issue is not closed and will continue to be raised. General Breedlove emphasized the need to address any INF-violating weapon capabilities introduced into Europe. The Russian Federation succeeded to the INF Treaty obligations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1992. The INF Treaty has no verification to detect violations since 2001, posing a challenge for new missile applications. President Obama has not utilized INF Treaty mechanisms to address Russian noncompliance, such as convening the Special Verification Commission. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee highlighted the need for Congress to be informed of any Soviet actions contradicting treaty obligations. The Administration has failed to address Russian violations of the INF Treaty, leading to its ineffective verification. The Russian Federation's actions have undermined the purpose of the treaty. The Russian Federation's noncompliance with the INF Treaty jeopardizes the interests of the United States and NATO. Additionally, Russia's violations of the Budapest Memorandum and NATO-Russia Founding Act have nullified their effects and assurances. The sense of Congress is that Russia's actions in testing prohibited missiles violate the INF Treaty, and the President should take necessary actions to counter Russia's noncompliance. The President must certify to Congress whether Russia has conducted a prohibited ballistic missile test before funds can be used for U.S.-Russia programs. Additionally, a program is established to research ground-launched cruise and ballistic missile capabilities. The President is required to establish a program for researching ground-launched cruise and ballistic missile capabilities with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. A study must be conducted to identify potential sites for these capabilities, including overseas military bases and sites offered by allies, with a report due to congressional committees within one year. The President may waive the program requirement if Russia complies with INF Treaty obligations and eliminates any violating military systems. $100,000,000 is authorized for the program in fiscal year 2015. The Secretary of Defense will deploy Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland to defend against Russian ballistic missiles. Sanctions will be imposed as a response to Russia's violation of the INF Treaty. If the President does not certify within 180 days that Russia is not violating the INF Treaty, sanctions will be imposed. These sanctions include suspending cooperation on missile defense and denying licenses under the Atomic Energy Act. The President shall terminate the US-Russia nuclear cooperation agreement and prohibit awarding government contracts to entities in Russia. The President may waive sanctions if certifying Russia's compliance with the INF Treaty to Congress. The President must certify to Congress that Russia has provided a list of all new intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles, launchers, and support structures developed since June 1, 2001. Additionally, Russia must disclose all deployment bases for these missiles, including any new bases for road-mobile ballistic and cruise missiles. The Russian Federation must provide a list of all flight tests for new ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles within specific ranges, production facilities for prohibited missiles, and reasons for developing prohibited missiles under the INF Treaty. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"INF Treaty\" or \"Treaty\" refers to the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was signed in Washington on December 8, 1987, and came into effect on June 1, 1988."
