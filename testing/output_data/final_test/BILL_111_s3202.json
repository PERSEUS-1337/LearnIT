The 7.3-magnitude earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010 was the country's worst natural disaster in 200 years, resulting in over 200,000 deaths and extensive destruction of homes, hospitals, schools, and government buildings in Port-au-Prince. Haiti, already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, had 80% of its population living below the poverty line before the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Haiti had 80% of its population living below the poverty line. After the earthquake, 54% of the population was in abject poverty, and more than 2/3 of the labor force lacked formal employment. Despite having one of the lowest per capita GDPs, Haiti was showing positive economic growth trends before the disaster. In a meeting in March 2010, Haitian leaders identified modernizing policies and infrastructure as critical catalysts for creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Before the earthquake, Haiti had a high poverty rate, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. Post-earthquake, the poverty rate increased, and a large percentage of the labor force was unemployed. Despite its low GDP, Haiti was experiencing economic growth before the disaster. Haitian leaders recognized the importance of modernizing policies and infrastructure to create job opportunities. Congress authorized USAID to provide a grant to the Polish-American Enterprise Fund, which raised private funds for investment in Poland and established the Polish-American Freedom Foundation. The success of Enterprise Funds in attracting private investment and creating legacy foundations in countries like Poland and Albania has been a useful model for other funds. These funds have played a pivotal role in developing various sectors, privatizing assets, and expanding international trade. Countries like Albania, the Baltic States, Hungary, Poland, and Russia have benefited from programs supported by Enterprise Funds, contributing to the growth of an entrepreneurial middle class. A Haitian-American Enterprise Fund, leveraging the success of prior Enterprise Funds, could implement programs such as microloans, mortgage programs, and small business loans to foster an entrepreneurial middle class in Haiti. The purposes of this Act are to promote the Haitian private sector, including small businesses, agriculture, and joint ventures with the United States. It aims to support the private sector in Haiti through various measures like loans, grants, equity investments, and technical assistance. The President can designate a private organization to receive funds under this Act, known as the \"Haitian-American Enterprise Fund\". The organization will have a Board of Directors with 7 members appointed by the President, with qualifications specified. The Board of Directors for the Haitian-American Enterprise Fund must have successful business careers in private equity, banking, or finance similar to previous members. The President can appoint up to 2 additional members, with restrictions on citizenship. Amounts appropriated will be granted to the Fund. The Haitian-American Enterprise Fund will receive grants from the United States Agency for International Development to support specified programs and projects, with compliance requirements outlined in the grant agreement. The Haitian-American Enterprise Fund will liquidate its assets and dissolve by December 31, 2020, unless the USAID Administrator decides to extend it. All assets will be used to establish a new United States-Haitian legacy foundation. The President must notify 15 days before designating an organization to operate the Fund. The President must provide information to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the organization designated to operate the Haitian-American Enterprise Fund and the qualifications of the Initial Board members. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The President must inform specific congressional committees about the organization running the Haitian-American Enterprise Fund and the qualifications of the Initial Board members, including the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.
