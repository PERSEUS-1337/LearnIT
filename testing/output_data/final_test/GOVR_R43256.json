    "content": "The electromagnetic spectrum, also known as the radio frequency spectrum, consists of various types of electromagnetic waves used for transmitting voice, text, and video communications. The allocation of radio frequency spectrum is managed by the FCC for commercial and nonfederal uses and by the NTIA for federal government use. Wireless broadband requires new spectrum capacity to support high-speed communications for consumers, businesses, and industries using spectrum-dependent technologies. The FCC manages the allocation of radio frequency spectrum for commercial and nonfederal uses. Spectrum policy involves decisions on allocating frequencies and access. Auctions are used to assign licenses for specific frequencies, replacing older methods like comparative hearings and lotteries. Spectrum is also allocated for designated purposes like Wi-Fi without specific ownership. Spectrum is segmented into bands of radio frequencies measured in hertz for allocation and assignment. Licenses are issued on a geographic basis, with frequencies below 3 GHz being most efficient for commercial mobile services. Frequencies up to 5 GHz are now desirable for commercial network deployment. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) focuses on spectrum assignment within the existing regulatory framework, including expediting auctions for mobile broadband licenses and authorizing incentive auctions for television broadcasters. Wider bandwidths up to 5 GHz are now desirable for commercial network deployment, reducing interference and improving spectrum efficiency. The Spectrum Act of 2012 allows television broadcasters to receive compensation for releasing airwaves for mobile broadband, auctions federal holdings for commercial use, and provides spectrum for unlicensed use. Major provisions include deficit reduction, directed and incentive auctions, reallocation of spectrum, and unlicensed spectrum. Other provisions simplify zoning requests for cell towers and facilitate antenna placement on federal property. The act also establishes a public safety broadband network (FirstNet) and improves emergency communications. The Spectrum Act of 2012 addresses spectrum access and deficit reduction by extending the FCC's auction authority until FY2022. This authority was initially authorized in 1993 and has been extended multiple times, with revenue from auctions considered new revenue. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and the DTV Delay Act extended auction authority until 2012, with proceeds directed to deficit reduction and new spending. Spectrum revenue is allocated to a Public Safety Trust Fund, with excess funds going towards deficit reduction. The Spectrum Act of 2012 directs proceeds from license sales to the Spectrum Relocation Fund and the Public Safety Trust Fund. The Spectrum Act of 2012 directs wireless service licenses to the Public Safety Trust Fund and auction proceeds to cover specified costs, with any excess going towards deficit reduction. FirstNet is a major beneficiary of the funding for developing a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. The Spectrum Act of 2012 allocates funds from auction proceeds to various entities: NTIA for FirstNet establishment, State and Local Implementation Fund, Network Construction Fund for FirstNet, NIST for public safety research, Treasury for deficit reduction, and grants for 911 services improvement. The Spectrum Act of 2012 mandates spectrum license auctions for specific frequency bands for commercial advanced wireless services and federal use. The Secretary of Commerce recommended reallocating 15 MHz of spectrum for nonfederal use. The NTIA recommended reassigning 1695-1710 MHz for commercial use. These auctions must be completed within three years. The FCC reallocated the band for commercial use through auctions mandated by the Spectrum Act of 2012. Auction 96 for the H Block frequencies was completed in February 2014 with a winning bid of $1.564 billion. Auction 97 for AWS spectrum licenses was completed in January 2015, fulfilling the congressional mandate for certain auctions by 2015. The FCC conducted Auction 97 for AWS spectrum licenses in January 2015, grossing almost $44.9 billion. The auction included frequencies covering 1695-1710 MHz, paired licenses at 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz. AT&T acquired 251 licenses for nearly $18.2 billion, Verizon Wireless acquired 181 licenses for approximately $10.4 billion, and T-Mobile received 151 licenses for bids totaling nearly $1.8 billion. Sprint did not participate in the auction. Dish Network acquired $13.3 billion in licenses through two joint ventures in Auction 97 for AWS spectrum licenses. The results of the auction have sparked debates on how it will affect interest in the Broadcast Incentive Auction program. Some predict higher prices for the incentive auction, while others are concerned about limited lending prospects for future spectrum acquisition. Wireless carriers may need to generate additional revenue to cover the cost of the auctioned licenses. The Spectrum Act allows the FCC to conduct incentive auctions for spectrum capacity relinquishment. This rewards license-holders, like television broadcasters, who repurpose their spectrum for different uses. The act established procedures for reallocating television broadcasting spectrum licenses through a reverse auction process. The Spectrum Act allows broadcasters to voluntarily release spectrum for commercial auction through a reverse auction process. Broadcasters may receive compensation for relinquishing spectrum rights or incurring relocation costs. Cash payments or regulatory relief can be offered as compensation. The repurposed spectrum is for commercial broadband communications, with licenses sold through a forward auction. Minimum prices for the forward auction are set based on successful reverse auctions. The outcome of the forward auction depends on the results of the reverse auction where broadcasters agree on the price to release spectrum. The Spectrum Act allows broadcasters to voluntarily release spectrum for commercial auction through a reverse auction process. The forward auction results must cover payments to broadcasters, FCC auction costs, and relocation costs. If revenues do not cover costs, new licenses may not be assigned. The FCC may make reassignments of television channels (repacking) based on certain conditions. The Broadcast Incentive Auctions, known as Auction 1000, consist of two parts: Auction 1001 (reverse) and Auction 1002 (forward). The FCC established bidding procedures for the auctions on August 11, 2015, with the auctions scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The process includes reassigning licenses to frequencies in the 600 MHz band and creating a market-based spectrum reserve to enhance competitive bidding. The FCC established bidding procedures for the Broadcast Incentive Auctions on August 11, 2015. A block of spectrum will be set aside in each market for competitive bidding by Sprint, T-Mobile, and other eligible bidders. Verizon and AT&T may also bid on reserved licenses if there is insufficient activity. Other actions include creating smaller license coverage areas and assigning licenses for paired spectrum. The Spectrum Act addressed spectrum ownership measurements to limit Verizon and AT&T, reconsidered Designated Entities qualifications, required interoperability in the 600 MHz band, and applied technical rules from the 700 MHz band. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 was amended to facilitate spectrum rights transfer to commercial purchasers. The Spectrum Act allows for planning costs to be reimbursed for spectrum transfer to the commercial sector, including spectrum sharing. The NTIA prioritizes reallocating spectrum for exclusive, nonfederal use through competitive bidding. A Technical Panel within the NTIA reviews federal agency transition plans, with members required to be radio engineers or technical experts appointed by key officials. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 established rules for federal agencies to recover relocation costs from auction proceeds. Successful bidders cover the costs of relocating wireless communications facilities to new spectrum assignments. Key provisions include recouping at least 110% of projected costs and unused funds reverting to the Treasury. The NTIA has published details on the technical panel and dispute resolution process related to the act. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 established rules for federal agencies to recover relocation costs from auction proceeds, ensuring at least 110% of projected costs are recouped. The NTIA, with input from the PPSG, has produced a 10-year plan identifying spectrum bands for commercial wireless broadband service. Recommendations include making 100 MHz of spectrum available within bands 3550-3650 MHz. The FCC is considering the 3.4GHz band for small cell networks. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, concluding it would cost $18 billion to clear federal users. Recommendations included sharing frequencies between federal and commercial users, with some frequencies cleared for auction. DOD estimated a $12 billion cost to relocate its users from the band. Industry values licenses at up to $12 billion. The NTIA estimated it would cost $18 billion to clear federal users from the 1755-1850 MHz band, with industry valuing licenses at up to $12 billion. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce challenged these estimates, leading to a request for the GAO to examine the process. GAO's preliminary findings indicated undeveloped spectrum sharing technology and policies. The GAO identified options to encourage spectrum sharing, including usage fees, more unlicensed spectrum, technology development, and regulatory process improvements. Further study by the NTIA and FCC was deemed necessary. In a Senate hearing, the GAO presented DOD's $12 billion cost estimate for reallocating frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz, meeting best practices. The GAO identified best practices for reallocating federal frequencies at 1695-1710 MHz and 1755-1780 MHz for commercial use through Auction 97. The frequencies are to be shared with federal incumbents, with some systems migrating to other frequencies. The auction of 2155-2180 MHz frequencies is required by the Spectrum Act. Successful commercial bidders will share the released federal frequencies indefinitely. Unpaired spectrum at 1695-1710 MHz was auctioned for shared use with weather satellite systems. Licensees must coordinate with federal users to prevent interference and follow transition plans on the NTIA website. Unlicensed spectrum is open for use by anyone with FCC-certified wireless equipment, serving various monitoring and communication needs. WiFi, garage door openers, and other devices operate on unlicensed frequencies. New technologies are being developed to expand the usefulness of unlicensed spectrum, such as using white spaces between digital television signals. Geolocation database technology is being used to identify available airwaves for unlicensed use at 5 GHz. Commercial providers currently share parts of the spectrum at 5 GHz with federal users, with efforts to improve future WiFi capacity. The Spectrum Act required new studies and evaluations of frequencies at 5 GHz to improve WiFi capacity. The FCC and NTIA were mandated to assess spectrum-sharing technologies in specific bands. The FCC has added 100 MHz of spectrum for unlicensed use in the 5.15-5.85 GHz range, with potential for more releases. Policy issues include structuring incentive auctions and maximizing federal spectrum use. Competitive access to spectrum is a key consideration in these debates. The FCC has taken actions to improve competitive access to spectrum by modifying auction rules, encouraging participation by designated entities, and establishing limitations on licenses available to top carriers like Verizon and AT&T. Spectrum caps may restrict the amount of spectrum available in key auctions. Requests have been made to include licenses for Cellular Market Areas in auction rules to benefit smaller carriers. For example, in Auction 96, the FCC created 176 licenses for the H Block auction compared to a potential 700 CMAs. The FCC has implemented spectrum caps to promote competition by limiting the amount of spectrum any one company can control in a designated market. This decision was based on the economic and foreclosure values of spectrum licenses. The FCC created 176 licenses for the H Block auction (Auction 96) compared to a potential 700 CMA licenses. In the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the FCC proposes creating Partial Economic Area licenses within Economic Areas to offer bidders a choice between urban and rural coverage. The FCC implemented spectrum caps to promote competition and prevent foreclosure bidding. Spectrum caps were eliminated in 2003 to encourage spectral efficiency and scale economies. Auction rules requiring timely network build-out were used to deter hoarding, and spectrum holdings were evaluated on a market-by-market basis through spectrum screening. Current proposals to reinstate spectrum caps reflect different perspectives on competition and the role of spectrum license auctions. Some argue for excluding Verizon and AT&T from the Broadcast Incentive Auction, but the Spectrum Act prohibits this. The debate centers on how spectrum caps could impact auction revenue, with some believing they would depress revenue while others argue they would have no effect or even enhance it. The Department of Justice emphasizes the importance of spectrum access for competition and innovation in their comments to the FCC. The FCC is urged to establish auction rules to prevent bids based on foreclosure value of spectrum and enhance opportunities for smaller carriers. New guidelines on spectrum ownership will be set, with restrictions planned to limit Verizon and AT&T's ability to acquire licenses. Verizon and AT&T currently hold the majority of commercial spectrum licenses below 1000 MHz, while Sprint and T-Mobile own 15%. Sprint is majority-controlled by SoftBank, Corp., and T-Mobile is majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, AG. The FCC rules aim to provide opportunities for smaller carriers to bid successfully in the auction for spectrum licenses below 1000 MHz. Sprint, T-Mobile, and smaller carriers have pushed for an increase in the amount of spectrum reserved for priority bidding. The FCC establishes bidding credits for smaller wireless network providers known as Designated Entities based on size and revenue criteria. Small businesses with average gross revenue of $40 million or less receive a 15% credit, while very small businesses with revenue of $15 million or less receive a 25% credit. Rules limit the leasing of spectrum assets acquired with bidding credits to larger partners with an attributable material relationship. The FCC is reconsidering rules for Designated Entities, particularly the rules regarding Attributable Material Relationships (AMR). A waiver has been granted to a private equity company exceeding income limits, potentially widening the pool of bidders for the Broadcast Incentive Auction. The Minority Media & Telecom Council (MMTC) details the history and benefits of Designated Entity status, especially for minority ownership. The Spectrum Act utilizes policy tools to increase radio frequency spectrum availability for wireless broadband. Policies for increasing radio frequency spectrum availability for wireless broadband include allocating additional spectrum, reassigning spectrum to new users, and opening up spectrum for unlicensed use. Other options include sharing wireless network infrastructure, changing the cost structure of spectrum access, adopting more spectrum-efficient technologies, and facilitating the adoption of new wireless technologies for spectrum sharing. While auctioning licenses for exclusive spectrum use is still common, emerging industries like advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine communications may not be well served by current policies. The 114th Congress took actions on spectrum policy, introducing the Wireless Innovation Act of 2015 to reallocate 200 MHz of federal spectrum for commercial use. This includes 120 MHz for exclusive-use commercial licenses, up to 20 MHz for unlicensed use, and a maximum of 40 MHz for sharing with federal installations. In addition to hearings, resolutions were introduced in the 114th Congress calling for a national strategy for the Internet of Things. S.Res. 110 was agreed to in the Senate, and a similar resolution, H.Res. 195, was introduced in the House."
