The Department of the Interior (DOI) manages U.S. public lands, natural resources, and cultural heritage. DOI's organizational structure and functions undergo congressional and administrative scrutiny. The department has evolved over its 170-year history in response to national needs and government directives. DOI reorganization proposals by the Trump Administration have sparked renewed attention to its structure. The Trump Administration's proposals for DOI's reorganization have brought focus to the department's structure. President Trump signed an executive order in March 2017, leading to a reorganization proposal by then-Secretary Ryan Zinke in September 2017. A government-wide reorganization proposal was issued in June 2018, with smaller interagency changes implemented or proposed for FY2019. The report provides a timeline of congressional and executive actions that have shaped the structure and function of DOI since its establishment, along with an overview of its history, mission, and current structure. It also includes employment figures, maps of regional office structures, and an overview of annual funding and appropriations. The report summarizes proposed reorganization efforts as of December 2018. The report outlines the history and structure of the Department of the Interior (DOI) since its establishment in 1849.

The headquarters office in Washington, DC, and Falls Church, VA, is responsible for policy formulation and budgeting. FWS has roughly 9,000 employees nationwide. In 1878, the National Academy of Sciences recommended Congress to survey and map the western territories, leading to the establishment of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for land classification and examination. The US Geological Survey (USGS) was established to oversee the classification of public lands and examine geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain. It serves as the science agency of the Department of the Interior (DOI) across seven interdisciplinary areas. USGS has no regulatory or land management mandate and is organized into seven programmatic areas and seven geographic regions. Regional directors report to a presidentially appointed director at the agency's headquarters. The US Geological Survey (USGS) operates science centers, laboratories, and field offices in various regions. USGS had around 8,000 employees as of June 2018.

The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) was established in 1994 to oversee tribal assets held in trust by the federal government. In 2016, Congress passed the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act (ITARA) requiring a transition plan for the termination of OST within two years. The 2019 Budget Justification proposes transferring some OST functions to other DOI agencies to comply with reorganization requirements. The 2019 Budget Justification proposes transferring some functions of the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) to other DOI agencies to comply with reorganization requirements mandated by Congress in ITARA. The proposal includes having OST report directly to the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs starting in FY2019. The United States acquired its first insular territories in 1898 with the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the acquisition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines from Spain following the Spanish-American War. The Office of Insular Affairs, under the Department of the Interior, oversees American Samoa, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands for their development. It also manages federal assistance to the Freely Associated States. The DOI had 69,563 employees as of June 2018.

OPM data includes full-time, part-time, and seasonal staff, with employment spiking in summer months for agencies like NPS, BLM, and FWS. OPM figures differ from DOI Budget Office data, which calculates employment by full-time equivalents (FTEs). Fedscope data in Table 1 show employment by location, while Table 2 displays DOI employment figures within and outside the DC core-based statistical area. A Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) is an area with at least one urban area of population and adjacent territory with high social and economic integration. CBSAs differ from Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in geographic coverage. Discretionary funding for the Department of the Interior (DOI) primarily comes from Title I of the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, with exceptions like the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project funded through the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. The Interior and Energy and Water appropriations bills provide discretionary funding to agencies, in addition to mandatory funding from authorizing statutes. Total DOI appropriations increased by 29% from FY2014 to FY2018, with a 23% increase excluding supplemental appropriations. Enacted FY2018 appropriations for DOI bureaus, offices, and programs are detailed in Figure 4. The Department of Interior's budget for FY2018 was $15.2 billion, with supplemental emergency appropriations shown separately. Congressional interest in executive branch reorganization is ongoing, with changes to DOI's structure starting in FY2019. Some changes were authorized in appropriations and/or authorizing legislation, while broader reorganization proposals by the Trump Administration are pending for FY2019. The 115th Congress approved internal office transfers and realignments within the Department of Interior for FY2018 and FY2019. This included transferring appropriations for the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and reorganizing the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians. The 2019 Interior Budget in Brief reflects the transfer of DOI's Oceans Program and the Office of International Affairs to different offices within the department. The FY2019 budget request includes transferring the Office of Appraisal Services within OST to the Office of the Secretary's Appraisal and Valuation Services Office, consolidating all appraisal activities within a single entity. Additionally, there is a proposed shift in the reporting relationship of OST to report through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs. President Trump issued Executive Order 13781 to improve DOI's efficiency and effectiveness. President Trump issued Executive Order 13781 in 2017 to improve the efficiency of the executive branch. Then-Secretary of the Interior Zinke submitted a reorganization proposal to consolidate regional boundaries and shift resources to the field. In June 2018, President Trump issued additional reorganization recommendations. In June 2018, reorganization recommendations were made to consolidate the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Division within DOI and transfer NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service to DOI, merging it with the FWS. These proposals could lead to changes in DOI's structure and operations, potentially sparking interest from the 116th Congress for oversight and new initiatives. The 116th Congress may consider additional oversight or propose new initiatives for the organization and administration of DOI and its bureaus."
