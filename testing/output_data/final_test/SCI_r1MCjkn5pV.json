    "content": "The SuperTML method, inspired by the Super Characters approach, utilizes two-dimensional embedding to improve classification on tabular data. By projecting features into an image-like format and using fine-tuned ImageNet CNN models, this method has achieved state-of-the-art results on both large and small datasets in data science. In data science, structured data is categorized as tabular data. DNN models are commonly used for unstructured data like images, speech, and text. CNNs and RNNs are preferred for unstructured data analysis. ResNet's CNN model has excelled in image classification tasks since 2015. Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting Trees are also used in machine learning models. Machine learning models like SVM, GBT, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are used for processing structured data, with XGBoost being popular in competitions. Recent research explores using embedding, RNNs, and CNNs for TML tasks and categorical features in tabular data. Recent research has shown that the Super Characters method, a two-dimensional embedding approach, achieves state-of-the-art results on large dataset benchmarks. This method involves drawing characters onto a blank image and feeding it into two-dimensional CNN models for classification. A new method called SuperTML borrows this concept to address TML problems by projecting tabular features onto a two-dimensional embedding and using fine-tuned two-dimensional CNN models for classification. The SuperTML method automatically handles categorical type and missing values in tabular data by projecting it onto a two-dimensional embedding and using fine-tuned CNN models for classification. This approach is inspired by the analogy between TML problems and text classification tasks, where tabular samples are treated as stringified tokens of data. By extending existing CNN models from the Super Characters method, SuperTML achieves state-of-the-art results on TML problems. SuperTML achieves state-of-the-art results on tabular data classification tasks by projecting features onto two-dimensional SuperTML images and fine-tuning CNN models. The process involves sorting tabular features and using pretrained CNN models for classification. The SuperTML method involves preprocessing testing data to generate SuperTML images before inputting them into a CNN classification model. Two algorithms, SuperTML VF and SuperTML EF, are used to enhance the autonomy of SuperTML. SuperTML EF allocates the same size to every feature, allowing direct embedding of tabular data into SuperTML images without calculating feature importance. The algorithm shows improved results and is based on data statistics from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Iris dataset is widely used in machine learning courses and tutorials. Experimental results using SEnet-154 and SuperTML VF on the dataset show slightly better accuracy than XGBoost. The SuperTML method involves generating SuperTML images with features of varying sizes based on importance scores obtained using the XGBoost package. The Adult dataset aims to predict income levels based on surveyed data. The SuperTML method outperforms XGBoost by 0.32% in accuracy on this dataset. The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge on Kaggle involved binary classification of quantum events as signal or background. The challenge data is available on opendata BID1 with 25,000 training samples and 55,000 testing samples. Each example has 30 features stored as real numbers. The AMS score is used as the performance metric, with SuperTML EF method giving the best score of 3.979. The proposed SuperTML method, inspired by Super Characters, achieves state-of-the-art results on tabular dataset TAB2 without the need for importance score calculations. It utilizes two-dimensional embedding and transfers knowledge from computer vision to structured data, outperforming SuperTME VF results."
