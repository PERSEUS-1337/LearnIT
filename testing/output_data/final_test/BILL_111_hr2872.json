Congress finds that Medicare must transform the payment system for quality, cost-efficient medical care based on evidence-based guidelines. An Institute of Medicine report outlines essential components for quality cancer care delivery, including an agreed-upon treatment plan, access to clinical trials, full disclosure of information to patients, and coordination of services. The report also emphasizes the importance of ensuring quality care at the end of life. The quality of cancer care must be measured using a core set of quality measures to hold providers accountable for providing and improving care, including managing cancer-related pain and timely referral to palliative and hospice care. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' quality measures do not address overall treatment planning or end-of-life care for cancer patients. The medical literature suggests that adherence to quality metrics and evidence-based guidelines can help lower costs for cancer patients by reducing the use of physician services, hospitalizations, and expensive drugs. The Medicare Quality Cancer Care Demonstration Project is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a quality cancer care demonstration project to improve Medicare payment incentives for treatment planning and end-of-life care for cancer patients. The project will identify and address gaps in current quality measures through refining performance measures for clinician-level reporting. The quality cancer care demonstration project aims to improve Medicare payment incentives for treatment planning and end-of-life care for cancer patients. It includes exploring reporting quality data through registries or electronic means, testing and validating treatment planning and end-of-life quality measures through a pay-for-reporting program with oncologists. The Quality Cancer Care Demonstration Project involves improving Medicare payment incentives for treatment planning and end-of-life care for cancer patients. It includes testing processes for submitting treatment planning and end-of-life measures through registries or electronic means. The project provides separate payments under the Social Security Act, totaling $300,000,000 each year, to physicians who meet baseline mandatory measures. To receive payment under the QCCD project for treatment planning or end-of-life care, physicians must report satisfaction of baseline mandatory measures. Additional payment requires reporting satisfaction of all measures for treatment planning or end-of-life care. Measures include specific treatment planning measures. The QCCD project requires physicians to report satisfaction of baseline mandatory measures for treatment planning, including pathology report, clinical staging, treatment education, and written care plan for patients. Additional payment is contingent on meeting all treatment planning measures. The QCCD project mandates physicians to adhere to evidence-based guidelines and discuss clinical trials with patients. End-of-life care measures include advanced care planning, symptom assessment, and hospice program recommendations. The QCCD project requires physicians to follow evidence-based guidelines and discuss clinical trials with patients. End-of-life care measures include advanced care planning, symptom assessment, and hospice program recommendations. Patients must have no acute care hospital admissions within 30 days of death, have an advanced directive discussion documented, and not receive chemotherapy within 30 days of death. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project for at least 2 years to refine metrics and reporting methodologies. The project will continue until a new payment system for professional oncology services is implemented under the Medicare program. A 2-year transition period will allow oncologists to switch to the new payment system. The Secretary will evaluate the QCCD project to assess oncologist participation, cost effectiveness, patient outcomes, satisfaction, and other relevant matters. The Secretary will evaluate the QCCD project and submit a report to Congress with recommendations for legislation or administrative action."
