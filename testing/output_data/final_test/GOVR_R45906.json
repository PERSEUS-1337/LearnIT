    "content": "Congress annually considers 12 regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year starting on October 1, along with supplemental and continuing appropriations. The process begins after the President's budget submission, with hearings held by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to review agency details. Congressional consideration of a budget resolution may follow, setting spending limits. Committee and floor discussions on the appropriations bills take place in spring and summer, extending into fall and winter until final appropriations are made. The report discusses FY2019 congressional appropriations actions impacted by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. It includes a chronological discussion and timeline of these actions, which adjusted statutory caps on spending for defense and nondefense. Congress has made adjustments through various Bipartisan Budget Acts. In 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act capped FY2019 discretionary spending for defense at $647 billion and for nondefense at $597 billion. The Budget Committees in the House and Senate could set enforceable limits under Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act in the absence of a budget resolution for FY2019. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees completed drafting and consideration of all 12 regular appropriations bills by July 2018. The House and Senate completed drafting and considering all 12 regular appropriations bills by July 2018. The House passed half of the bills, while the Senate passed 9 bills. Appropriations bills were combined into \"minibuses\" for floor consideration and resolving differences between the chambers. Three bills were combined in the House and passed on June 8, 2018, with the Senate agreeing on June 25. The Senate and House passed multiple appropriations bills in 2018, which were combined into \"minibuses\" for consideration. The final measures were negotiated in conference committees and enacted into law in September 2018. The Senate passed a combined measure of the Agriculture and Transportation/HUD appropriations bills on August 1, 2018. FY2019 began on October 1, 2018, with five appropriations bills enacted. Funding for the remaining seven bills was extended through multiple continuing resolutions until February 8, 2019. On December 21, 2018, the House amended a continuing resolution to include $5.7 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and $7.8 billion for disaster relief. The amended CR passed the House and was sent to the Senate for further consideration. The Senate agreed to proceed to the House amendment with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Pence. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emphasized the need for bipartisan support to reach a solution. The Senate voted to proceed to legislation in order to maintain flexibility for negotiations with the White House and Democrats. Senate Democrats are urged to collaborate on an agreement that can pass both Houses of Congress. Failure to reach an agreement led to a partial government shutdown when funding expired on December 21. Further votes were not taken on the House amendment in subsequent Senate sessions. The 115th Congress adjourned on January 3, 2019, with no further votes on appropriations. The 116th Congress, now controlled by the Democratic Party, needed to introduce new measures for FY2019 appropriations. In January 2019, the House passed H.J.Res. 1, a CR for Homeland Security funding until February 8, 2019. The House passed several bills in January 2019 to provide full-year FY2019 funding for various appropriations bills, but no further action was taken in the Senate. In January 2019, the House passed bills for full-year FY2019 funding for Agriculture, Interior, Environment, disaster relief, and a CR for remaining appropriations bills. However, no further action was taken in the Senate. On January 24, 2019, the Senate considered two separate amendments to a House-passed bill but failed to invoke cloture. On January 17, 2019, a CR for FY2019 appropriations passed the House and later the Senate with an amendment for continuing appropriations through February 15. On January 23, 2019, H.R. 648 passed the House to provide full-year FY2019 funding for six appropriations measures. On January 24, 2019, H.J.Res. 31 passed the House to provide FY2019 appropriations for Homeland Security through February 28, later amended in the Senate for full-year funding for seven remaining appropriations bills. A conference committee was convened to negotiate a final version of the bills, resulting in the passage of H.J.Res. 31 with overwhelming support in both the Senate and the House. The bill was signed into law on February 15, marking the end of action on regular appropriations bills for FY2019.
