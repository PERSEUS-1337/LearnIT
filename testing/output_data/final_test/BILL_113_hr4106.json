    "content": "The \"Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act\" aims to provide physicians who adhere to evidence-based clinical guidelines with protection from medical malpractice lawsuits, reduce defensive medicine practices and healthcare costs, standardize healthcare practices, enhance quality of care and patient safety, involve experts in selecting guidelines, and allow professionals to benefit from liability reform. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTION OF CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES. Eligible professional organizations must submit clinical practice guidelines to the Secretary within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will select one or more organizations to maintain these guidelines. Maintenance includes periodic review every 5 years. The Secretary shall review clinical practice guidelines every 5 years and collaborate with eligible professional organizations for updates as needed. Amendments to guidelines can be submitted by collaborating organizations at any time for review. The update requirement does not apply unless notification is provided to eligible professionals. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT. Guideline standards for developing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines include transparency, a multidisciplinary panel of experts, consideration of patient subgroups and preferences, systematic evidence review, clear explanation of care options and outcomes, quality of evidence and strength of recommendation ratings, regular revision based on new evidence. Clinical practice guidelines should be regularly revised with new evidence and clearly identify any exceptions. Affiliated individuals must disclose conflicts of interest related to guideline development, including scientific methodology and evidence supporting it. Scientific methodology, evidence, outside collaborators, and endorsements support clinical practice guidelines. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to publish clinical practice guidelines on the Internet, including data and methodology used in compliance with data disclosure standards. Additionally, there is a provision for state flexibility and protection of states' rights. State Flexibility and Protection of States' Rights: This Act does not override any State or Federal laws that offer greater protections for health care providers. It also allows for the preservation of defenses in health care liability actions under existing laws. SEC. 7. RIGHT OF REMOVAL. Section 1441 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to allow for the removal of health care liability actions against medical professionals to the district court of the United States. The terms are defined in the Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act of 2014. SEC. 8. MANDATORY REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PANEL. In health care liability actions, if the professional claims adherence to clinical guidelines, proceedings are suspended for an independent medical review panel to assess the case. The panel consists of 3 experts in the relevant field. Members must meet eligibility requirements to serve on the panel. To serve on an independent medical review panel, a member must be an experienced physician certified by a recognized board, have recent medical practice or teaching experience, and be approved by their specialty society. Ideally, panel members should be from the region where the case originates to consider geographical practice variations. Members are not liable for civil actions. The independent medical review panel members are not liable for civil actions related to their duties. Panel members must acknowledge physicians' ability to deviate from clinical guidelines when necessary. Members are jointly selected by the parties involved. The court appoints members if not selected by parties in a care liability action. Compensation for panel members is split equally between parties. The independent medical review panel follows clinical practice guidelines as the standard of conduct. The review panel in a care liability action makes preliminary findings based on pre-discovery evidence and clinical practice guidelines. They do not find negligence solely based on unsuccessful treatment outcomes or patient deaths. Preliminary findings of breaching the standard of care do not automatically constitute negligence or conclusive evidence at trial. The review panel in a health care liability action completes a review within 60 days of selection, determining if there are relevant clinical practice guidelines related to the claimant's injury. The panel's findings are admissible as evidence in court proceedings. The review panel in a health care liability action assesses the claimant's injury and the adherence to guidelines by the professional. The panel determines if there is a reasonable probability of the professional violating the standard of care, causing the injury, and resulting in damages to the claimant. The findings can be used as evidence in court proceedings. In a health care liability action, if the review panel finds no reasonable probability of the professional violating the standard of care, the court may issue summary judgment in favor of the professional. If the panel finds that the defendant adhered to clinical practice guidelines, summary judgment will be issued unless the claimant can prove otherwise. Preliminary findings that the professional did not breach the standard of care or that their failure to conform was not the cause can also lead to summary judgment. In a health care liability action, if the review panel determines that the defendant did not breach the standard of care or that their failure to conform was not the cause of the plaintiff's injury, the court may grant summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff must provide clear and convincing evidence of error by the panel and a genuine issue of material fact to avoid summary judgment. In a health care liability action, if the defendant prevails after a preliminary finding by the independent medical review panel, they can recover costs and attorneys' fees from the plaintiff. Definitions are provided in Section 10. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"applicable eligible professional,\" \"appropriate use criteria,\" and \"clinical practice guideline.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the guidelines and standards set forth by eligible professional organizations in determining appropriate healthcare practices. The curr_chunk defines terms like \"eligible professional organization,\" \"Federal payor,\" and \"health care goods or services\" in specific clinical circumstances. The curr_chunk defines terms related to health care, including \"health care goods or services\" and \"health care liability action.\" These terms are crucial in legal actions involving health care providers and organizations. The curr_chunk defines \"health care liability claim\" as a claim against a health care provider or organization based on the provision, use, or payment for health care goods or services. It also defines \"health care organization\" as any entity obligated to provide or pay for health benefits under a health plan. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to health care providers, performance period, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
