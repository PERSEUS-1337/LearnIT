    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2019 defense appropriations act (P.L. 115-245) and access to other CRS products for detailed analysis. It covers the legislative history, strategic context, and budgetary information. The Trump Administration requested $668.4 billion for defense programs in FY2019, including $67.9 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The FY2019 defense appropriations act (P.L. 115-245) provided $667.3 billion for DOD's base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), with a net reduction of $1.09 billion. The Senate adopted amendments to H.R. 6157, increasing the total amount by 2.3% compared to FY2018. The Senate made several amendments to H.R. 6157, including substituting the Senate committee bill for the House-passed text and adding the text of S. 3158, the FY2019 appropriations bill for Labor, Health, and Education. The bill was passed by the Senate on August 23, 2018, and signed into law by President Trump on September 28, 2018. The defense appropriations bill in P.L. 115-245 closely aligns with the amounts provided, but there are differences in specific elements within the DOD budget. Congressional judgements and patterns of differences reflect views on policy and budgetary questions. Title I of the act funds Military Personnel accounts with $2.2 billion less for pay and benefits than requested, justified by revised estimates of the budgetary impact of changes in the military retirement system. Other reductions totaling $430 million were also made. The defense appropriations bill in P.L. 115-245 closely aligns with the amounts provided, but there are differences in specific elements within the DOD budget. Title I of the act funds Military Personnel accounts with $2.2 billion less for pay and benefits than requested, justified by revised estimates of the budgetary impact of changes in the military retirement system. Other reductions totaling $430 million were justified by conferees on the basis of \"historical unobligated balances.\" Base budget funding provided by the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) title of the act amounts to a net reduction of $5.2 billion from the request, with additional reductions justified on the basis of unobligated balances or \"historical underexecution.\" Total procurement funding for the base budget is $4.8 billion higher than the request. The defense appropriations bill in P.L. 115-245 aligns closely with the amounts provided, with differences in specific elements within the DOD budget. The act adds funding for aircraft, ships, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, as well as research and development programs. The Trump Administration presented its FY2019 defense budget. The Trump Administration's FY2019 defense budget request is primarily funded by the annual defense appropriations bill, responding to a more contentious international security environment. Events like China's military base construction in the South China Sea and Russia's Crimea seizure mark the end of the post-Cold War era. Observers believe the U.S. and its allies are entering a period of increased strategic complexity. During the Cold War, national security challenges were simpler to manage compared to the current era. During the Cold War, U.S. national security policies focused on strategic competition with the Soviet Union and containing communism globally. Post-Cold War policies aimed at curbing genocide in the Balkans and Iraq, while addressing regional threats from Iran and North Korea. The 9/11 attacks shifted focus to countering terrorism in the Middle East and preventing nuclear proliferation by North Korea and Iran. Military superiority in the Middle East and Balkans allowed for successful operations. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea highlighted the need for the US to address threats from other great powers. Meanwhile, challenges like fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation continue to pose serious risks to US interests. Conceptualizing and managing these issues remains a key priority in national security. The December 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy and January 2018 National Defense Strategy highlight the increasingly dangerous global environment with intensified threats. The strategies focus on great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to address complex security challenges. The 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy and 2018 National Defense Strategy prioritize countering Chinese and Russian military capabilities, emphasizing the erosion of U.S. forces' competitive advantage. The new strategy also acknowledges the need for U.S. forces to expect vigorous contestation in approaching military objectives. This strategy, known as the \"2+3\" strategy, focuses on countering two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Congressional action on FY2019 appropriations bills aimed to reduce federal spending due to concerns about increasing government debt. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits to cut discretionary spending by $1.0 trillion through FY2021, with separate caps for defense and non-defense activities enforced by sequestration. Sequestration enforces spending caps on defense-related activities, including DOD, to reduce discretionary spending to the BCA cap. Congress has raised the caps multiple times, most recently setting the national defense funding cap for FY2019 at $647 billion. The caps do not apply to emergency or OCO spending. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill is approximately $600 billion, consistent with the spending cap. DOD funding has been increasing since FY2016, with a peak in FY2010. The bill includes a proposal to increase the size of the armed forces by 15,600 personnel. The Senate-passed version of the bill funded less than half of the proposed increase in active-duty personnel and none of the proposed increase in the reserve component. The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not provide a reason for this decision, aligning with the Senate version of the companion NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019. The Senate Armed Services Committee report expressed concern about recruiting enough personnel to fill a larger force while maintaining enlistment standards due to low unemployment levels. The FY2019 NDAA authorized a 2.6% increase in military basic pay, costing $1.8 billion. The Defense Health Program received $34.0 billion in funding for FY2019, a slight increase over the Administration's request. The enacted bill for the Defense Health Program for FY2019 includes cuts in funding for various reasons, such as excess growth in pharmaceutical costs and historical underexecution. It also adds funding for training therapeutic service dogs and studying the health effects of open burning pits at military sites in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Health Program for FY2019 includes cuts in funding for various reasons, such as excess growth in pharmaceutical costs and historical underexecution. The bill adds funding for training therapeutic service dogs and studying the health effects of open burning pits at military sites in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, Congress has consistently allocated funds for medical research and development in the DOD budget, with the Administration's DHP budget request including $710.6 million for research and development. The enacted version of the bill appropriates a total of $2.18 billion for DHP-funded medical research, an increase of $1.47 billion over the request that covers specific medical conditions and treatments. The largest amounts for particular diseases in both versions of the bill are aimed at breast cancer, prostate cancer, and traumatic brain injury. The act cuts $4.8 billion from the Administration's request for base budget O&M funds, making the final appropriation $194.7 billion. The House-Senate conferees made cuts totaling $1.3 billion from the base budget O&M request, citing reasons such as underspending assumptions, lack of justification for funds, and unrealistic increases. Additionally, $343 million in cuts were justified due to excessive requests compared to the prior year's appropriation. The House-passed bill aimed to add $1.0 billion to enhance readiness across the armed forces. The House-Senate conferees made cuts totaling $1.3 billion from the base budget O&M request, citing reasons such as underspending assumptions, lack of justification for funds, and unrealistic increases. The funds were intended to be spent on training, depot maintenance, and base operations according to a plan DOD was to submit to Congress 30 days in advance of expenditure. The Administration's FY2019 budget request continued the modernization of the U.S. strategic arsenal. The enacted version of the bill adds more than $300 million to develop three new long-range weapons. The House-Senate conferees made cuts totaling $1.3 billion from the base budget O&M request, citing reasons such as underspending assumptions, lack of justification for funds, and unrealistic increases. The enacted version of the bill adds more than $300 million to develop three new long-range weapons, including a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile, a Conventional Prompt Global Strike weapon, and a Long-Range Stand-Off weapon. The funding adjustments support the administration's ballistic missile defense funding request. The Administration's program aims to expand the fleet of interceptor missiles for mid-course defense and deploy shorter-range missiles for terminal defense. $301.7 million was cut from mid-course defense projects due to duplicate funding from a previous defense appropriations act. The FY2019 budget request includes over $400 million for missile defense development in South Korea and for U.S. forces. This funding will be used to develop a network linking THAAD and Patriot missiles in South Korea and Japan to track North Korean missiles. Additionally, $140 million will be used to procure THAAD interceptors deployed in Guam, the Middle East, and South Korea. The debate over creating a Space Force was not mentioned in the House and Senate discussions. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill did not mention the debate over creating a Space Force. The bill largely funded the Administration's requests for defense-related space programs, with a notable increase of $200 million for R&D funding for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. The bill also supported the Administration's efforts to enhance the combat capabilities of Army and Marine Corps units against near-peer adversaries. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill funded the Administration's requests for defense-related space programs and supported efforts to enhance combat capabilities against near-peer adversaries like Russia and China. The bill included increased investments in mobile defenses against cruise missiles and drone aircraft, as well as improved firepower and mobility for infantry units. Funding was provided above the requested level to accelerate certain programs. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill funded upgrades for the Army's fleet of M-1 tanks and Bradley armored troop carriers. Additional funds were allocated to accelerate modernization of the M-109 Paladin self-propelled and Stryker wheeled combat vehicles. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill funded programs to replace older tracked vehicles with V-shaped bottoms to deflect explosive force from landmines. $447.5 million was allocated for the Advanced Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and $167.5 million for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). An additional $449 million was requested for developing and purchasing vehicles to enhance the lethality and mobility of Army infantry units, including the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) tank. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill funded programs to replace older tracked vehicles with V-shaped bottoms to deflect explosive force from landmines. $447.5 million was allocated for the Advanced Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and $167.5 million for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). An additional $449 million was requested for developing and purchasing vehicles to enhance the lethality and mobility of Army infantry units, including the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) tank. The act also includes funding for four-wheel-drive vehicles for reconnaissance missions and troop transport, designated Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) and Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV). Additionally, the budget request includes funds to strengthen mobile Army defenses against aircraft, including unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles, through programs like the Stryker combat vehicle equipped with Stinger missiles (IM-SHORAD) and a truck-mounted missile launcher (IFPC). The total R&D request for these programs was reduced by nearly 25% due to development program delays. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill allocated $2.35 billion for procurement of equipment for National Guard and reserve units, in addition to the $3.64 billion in the Administration's budget request. The funds are directed towards priority equipment for combat and domestic response missions, with $1.30 billion in the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account (NGREA) distributed among the six reserve force components. The amounts are not earmarked for specific purchases, but are intended for critical equipment needs. The defense bill allocates funds for specific equipment purchases, with priority consideration given to 18 categories ranging from radar receivers to cold-weather gear. Congress also increases funding for National Guard equipment, including cargo planes, attack helicopters, and Black Hawk helicopters. The bill aims to modernize the Navy's fleet to respond to China's military operations and maintain the technological edge of U.S. forces. The defense bill includes a $1.60 billion request to fund a Ford-class aircraft carrier, intended for the third ship of the Ford class, CVN-80 named Enterprise, slated for delivery in FY2027. The funds could also be used for a block buy contract to accelerate the delivery of the fourth ship, CVN-81, and reduce overall costs. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to certify to Congress that a block buy approach would save money before funds can be used. The act includes $1.1 billion to accelerate ship production for amphibious landings and air-cushion craft, including funds for a helicopter carrier, amphibious landing transport, Expeditionary Fast Transport, and air-cushion landing craft. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act includes increased funds for military aircraft acquisition, with a focus on accelerating production of the F-35 Joint Strike fighter. An additional $1.70 billion is allocated to acquire 16 F-35s, providing eight more aircraft for the Air Force, two for the Marine Corps, and four for the Navy. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act includes increased funds for military aircraft acquisition, with a focus on accelerating production of the F-35 Joint Strike fighter. The bill also includes funding for the procurement of combat aircraft such as A-10 ground-attack planes and a low-tech ground-attack plane designated OA-X.
