    "content": "The Public Buildings Cost Reduction Act of 2007 may be cited as the Cost-Effective Technology Acceleration Program. The Administrator of General Services is required to establish a program to promote cost-effective technologies and practices at GSA facilities. This program includes centralized coordination of cost reduction efforts, providing assistance to tenants, and tracking the success of departments and agencies in achieving goals. The Administrator will review current use and availability of cost-effective lighting technologies in GSA facilities as part of the program to promote cost-effective practices. The Administrator will establish a cost-effective lighting technology acceleration program to replace existing lighting technologies with more efficient ones in GSA facilities. The Administrator will establish a timetable to replace existing lighting technologies with more cost-effective options in GSA facilities within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The goal is to complete this replacement at each facility as quickly as possible. The Administrator will ensure the replacement of existing lighting technologies with more cost-effective options in GSA facilities within 5 years of the Act's enactment. A manager will be designated for each facility to accelerate the use of cost-effective technologies and practices. The Administrator will ensure a 20-percent reduction in operational costs at GSA facilities through cost-effective technologies and practices within 5 years of the Act's enactment. Activities to estimate necessary funds and implement these technologies will be described. The report will assess the implementation of programs under the Act, funding status, and identify barriers hindering cost-effective technologies in GSA facilities. It will also propose uniform standards for federal agencies and coordinate with the Office of Management. The report, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, reviews the budget process for capital programs to achieve cost savings through cost-effective technologies and practices within 5 years. Authorization of appropriations is granted for necessary funds to implement recommendations for cost savings in capital programs within 5 years of installation. The Environmental Protection Agency Demonstration Grant Program for local governments is established. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a grant program to assist local governments in deploying cost-effective technologies and practices for local government buildings, with a 40 percent federal cost share requirement. The Administrator may waive up to 100 percent of the local share of the grant cost if the community is economically distressed. The maximum grant amount is $1,000,000. Guidelines for the grant program will be issued within a year of the Act's enactment. The guidelines for the grant program establish standards for monitoring cost savings, implementing training programs, and achieving facility-wide savings of at least 40% through building retrofits using cost-effective technologies and practices. The grant program aims to achieve cost savings of at least 40% through building retrofits using cost-effective technologies and practices. Compliance with state and local laws is maintained, and $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. Annual reports on cost savings achieved and actions taken are required. The program aims to achieve cost savings of at least 40% through building retrofits. A final report with findings, cost savings summary, and recommendations will be issued at the program's conclusion on September 30, 2012. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Cost-effective lighting technology refers to lighting technologies that result in operational cost savings by consuming not more than 1 watt per square foot or are listed in specific regulations. This includes lamps, ballasts, and luminaires. Cost-effective lighting technologies include ballasts, luminaires, lighting controls, daylighting, and other cost-effective technologies. These technologies result in substantial operational cost savings by reducing utility costs and comply with specific regulations. Operational cost savings refer to a reduction in end-use operational expenses. The term \"savings\" refers to a reduction in operational costs achieved through cost-effective technologies and practices, including a decrease in electricity consumption. This should result in cost savings that cover the additional costs of using these technologies within 5 years of installation. Operational cost savings can be achieved through the installation or use of these technologies at a facility. The term \"GSA facility\" refers to any building, structure, or facility that includes support systems and can achieve operational cost savings through cost-effective technologies or vegetation planting. The term \"GSA facility\" refers to a building, structure, or facility constructed, renovated, purchased, or leased by the Administrator for use by the Federal Government, with specific lease terms outlined. The term \"GSA facility\" includes buildings, structures, or facilities with associated energy-consuming support systems. The Administrator may exempt certain buildings that meet specific requirements."
