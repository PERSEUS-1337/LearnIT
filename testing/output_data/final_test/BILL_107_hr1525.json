The Public Libraries Enhancement Act of 2001, under Section 213 of the Library Services and Technology Act, includes definitions for construction activities like building new structures, remodeling existing buildings, acquiring equipment, and meeting standards. This covers renovations for safety, energy conservation, technology integration, and historic building conversions. The term 'equipment' includes various technologies and necessary items for library functioning, while 'reference materials' encompass books, media, and other materials available for public use. 'Rural area' refers to the location of libraries in non-urban areas. The definition of 'rural area' for libraries specifies that they are located in non-metropolitan counties, with exceptions for certain urban areas identified as rural 'pocket' areas within larger metropolitan counties. SEC. 3. INCREASE IN AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Amends the Library Services and Technology Act to authorize $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and additional funds for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 for construction, acquisition, and operations. Chapter 2 of the Library Services and Technology Act is amended to include conducting library construction, acquiring reference materials, and operating public libraries during hours of service to the public, subject to limitations in section 232(a). Chapter 2 of the Library Services and Technology Act is amended to include conducting library construction, acquiring reference materials, and operating public libraries during hours of service to the public, subject to limitations in section 232(a). Additionally, a new section is added at the end. \"Section 232 allows for the use of funds for construction, acquisition, and operation.\" The Secretary shall identify the portion of the State's allotment for library construction, acquisition of reference materials, and operation of public libraries. Any unused funds shall be used for other specified purposes. The Federal share of costs for these activities shall not exceed a certain percentage of the total cost. The State must revise its plan to use funds for construction, including setting goals, describing activities, and outlining grant award procedures. The Director must approve these revisions. Minimum and maximum awards will be determined for the funds provided. The State must revise its plan for using funds for construction, with minimum and maximum awards set for library projects. At least 35% of funds must be used in rural areas, and no more than $1,000,000 can be used for a single library facility. Labor standards require contractors to pay workers prevailing wages on construction projects funded under this section. The Secretary of Labor determines prevailing wages for construction projects funded under this section. After 20 years, if a library facility ceases to be used as such, the Secretary must assess the situation. The United States may recover an amount from a recipient if the institution is not released from its obligation, based on the value of the facility at that time compared to the Federal grant received for the project. The value will be determined by the parties or through legal action in the district court where the facility is located."
