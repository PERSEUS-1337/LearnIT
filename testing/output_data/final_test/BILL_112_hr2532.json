The lump sum payment required under the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act can be made by directing a withdrawal from the Thrift Savings Fund. Upon direction from a covered employee, the Executive Director transfers the withdrawal amount to the United States Secret Service for deposit into the Contributions for Annuity Benefits account. The transfer is treated as a direct transfer under the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code defines a \"covered employee\" as an individual described in the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act. SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF REEMPLOYED ANNUITANTS. Section 8468 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to define a 'covered District of Columbia retiree' as an individual receiving benefits under the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act based on service in the Secret Service and who transferred to that retirement system. If a covered retiree takes an appointive or elective position, their retirement benefits may be affected. The Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act benefits will be deducted from the pay of reemployed retirees, as if they were an annuity under this chapter. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for this process, including accepting certification from the District of Columbia government regarding the retiree's benefits during employment. SEC. 4. PAYGO COMPLIANCE. The budgetary effects of this Act must comply with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, as determined by the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee before the vote on passage."
