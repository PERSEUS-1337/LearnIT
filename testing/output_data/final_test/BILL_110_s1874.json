    "content": "The \"Containing and Managing Climate Change Costs Efficiently Act\" aims to establish a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to maintain a stable and efficient market for tradeable permits to emit greenhouse gases without harming the US economy. The \"Carbon Market Efficiency Board\" is established to promote environmental objectives and monitor the national greenhouse gas emission market for potential economic harm. It will provide temporary relief if the cost of permits under Federal law poses a significant threat to the economy. The \"Carbon Market Efficiency Board\" will monitor greenhouse gas emission markets established under Federal law and provide reports to the President and Congress quarterly. The Board, composed of 7 members, will assess market status, economic effects, responses, corrective measures, and compensation plans independently. The Board, consisting of 7 members appointed by the President with Senate approval, must ensure fair representation of various sectors and regions in the US. Members will be compensated at a rate equivalent to level II of the Executive Schedule. The Board members will be compensated based on the Executive Schedule, with the Chairperson receiving a rate equal to level I.

The Board is responsible for collecting and analyzing market information for greenhouse gas emission markets under Federal law. This includes details on permit allocation, permit prices, economic effects, and environmental objectives. During the initial 2-year period, information gathering is considered a primary activity. During the initial 2-year period, the Board will focus on gathering information on greenhouse gas emission markets. After this period, the Board will have the authority to implement cost-relief measures. Additionally, a study will be conducted on other tradeable permit markets in the US, with a report to Congress on market status and permit prices. During the initial 2-year period, the Board will gather information on greenhouse gas emission markets. If the average daily closing price of greenhouse gas permits exceeds the upper range estimate, cost relief measures will be implemented. The Board may increase permits for covered entities and take subsequent actions as required. Any actions taken must adhere to specific requirements. The Board will provide quarterly reports to the President and Congress on greenhouse gas emission markets, including economic effects, responses, corrective measures, and compensation plans.

Cost relief measures may be implemented by the Board to ensure efficient markets for tradeable permits to emit greenhouse gases. These measures include increasing permit quantities, extending repayment periods, lowering interest rates, and expanding total permit quantities. The Board can implement cost relief measures by expanding permit quantities for covered entities, allowing incremental use to avoid economic harm, and specifying terms for compensation at entity or market levels during the applicable allocation year.

Limitations exist on the Board's authority, including not being able to consider entity-level petitions for relief from permit allocation costs, conduct investigative or punitive processes, interfere with permit allocation schemes, or modify greenhouse gas emission limits. The Congressional Budget Office will provide a report on the projected price range of greenhouse gas permits in the initial 2-year period of the emission market. Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of this Act."
