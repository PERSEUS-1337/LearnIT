    "content": "Congress has been considering changes to income and rent calculation policies for federal rental assistance programs. Eligibility is currently based on income and rent is calculated as a share of adjusted income to ensure subsidies go to those most in need. The system aims to make rent \"affordable\" at 30% of family income through a complex process of income calculation. The report answers common questions about income and rent policies in federal rental assistance programs, including their origins and comparisons to other assistance programs. It focuses on the five main HUD programs that subsidize rents for low-income families, serving over 4 million families and comprising a significant portion of HUD's budget. The report focuses on HUD's rental assistance programs, including Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, Section 8 project-based rental assistance, Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities. These programs make up a significant portion of HUD's budget. Three of the five programs\u2014Section 8 project-based rental assistance, Section 202, and Section 811\u2014provide project-based rental assistance to private owners of multifamily housing properties. Project-based rental assistance subsidizes tenant rents in specific rental units. Each program is governed by the same statute and regulations regarding tenant eligibility and rent. The curr_chunk discusses eligibility and rent determination for HUD programs, including Section 8 project-based rental assistance, Section 202, and Section 811. It mentions that other HUD programs and non-HUD programs have different eligibility rules and assistance policies. Eligibility for HUD's five main rent assistance programs is based on family income, citizenship or immigration status, and other characteristics. Housing assistance programs are not entitlements and serve only roughly one in four eligible households due to funding limitations. Families may be placed on waiting lists for assistance. The HUD rent assistance programs define \"family\" broadly to include single persons, groups of persons residing together (such as elderly, near-elderly, disabled families), and families with two or more elderly or disabled individuals living together. The HUD rent assistance programs define \"family\" broadly to include elderly, near-elderly, and disabled individuals living together. Unlike other federal assistance programs, eligibility for housing assistance is based on a percentage of local area median income, not the federal poverty level. The HUD rent assistance programs determine eligibility based on a percentage of local area median income. Three income limits are established: Low-Income (80% of AMI), Very Low-Income (50% of AMI), and Extremely Low-Income (30% of AMI or federal poverty level). Families must be low-income to qualify initially, and for Section 8 HCV program, they must also be very low-income or meet specific criteria. The Section 202 and Section 811 properties funded after 1990 are available to elderly residents and persons with disabilities who are very low-income. Owners may admit some families with incomes above the low-income limit with HUD's permission if they are having difficulty leasing all units. Various housing assistance programs require a share of assistance to be targeted to families with the lowest incomes, such as providing 75% of Section 8 HCV vouchers to extremely low-income families. PHAs and owners must allocate 40% of public housing and Section 8 project-based rent-assisted units to extremely low-income families each year. For Section 8 project-based rent-assisted properties, assistance is mainly for very low-income families, with only a limited percentage of units available for higher income families. Families becoming \"over-income\" may not be directly addressed by HUD's rental assistance programs. PHAs administering public housing are not required to evict over-income families but have the option to do so. In the Section 8 HCV program, families no longer qualify if their incomes increase. In the Section 8 HCV program, families no longer qualify for assistance when their incomes increase to the point that they no longer mathematically qualify for a subsidy. Owners must terminate assistance to those families with an increased ability to pay, although a family's assistance may be reinstated if their income declines again. Residents living in Section 202 and Section 811 developments funded by HUD have an exception to this rule. Residents living in Section 202 and Section 811 developments funded after 1990 have an exception to assistance termination. To qualify for HUD rental assistance programs, household members must be citizens or eligible noncitizens. Mixed families can receive prorated assistance. Special populations are eligible for certain programs: Section 202 for elderly families and Section 811 for persons with disabilities. While public housing and Section 8 rental assistance programs are generally available to all families, some properties and vouchers are designated for elderly, disabled, homeless veterans, or families involved with child welfare. Income for HUD-assisted housing is defined by exclusions rather than inclusions. HUD regulations define income for HUD-assisted housing as \"income from all sources of each member of the household.\" Certain items are excluded from income, as determined by HUD in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture. Examples of included income are earnings from employment, Social Security payments, and pensions. HUD regulations define income for HUD-assisted housing as including various sources such as overtime pay, tips, bonuses, Social Security payments, pensions, disability income, unemployment compensation, alimony, child support, and military pay. Veterans' benefits are generally included as income, except for lump-sum disability payments. Certain items are excluded from income, as specified in the housing assistance statute. The HUD regulations define income for HUD-assisted housing, including various sources like overtime pay, tips, bonuses, Social Security payments, pensions, disability income, and more. Certain items are excluded from income, such as lump sum deferred payments for SSI, Social Security, or veterans disability, as well as other items listed in HUD regulation at 24 C.F.R. Section 5.609(c). Items excluded in other federal statutes: HUD regulation excludes 17 items, including amounts excluded by other federal statutes. There are 26 categories of federal payments excluded from income, with new categories announced in Federal Register notices. Excluded benefits include SNAP, LIHEAP, CCDBG, WIA programs, and disaster assistance. No asset limit for eligibility in discussed programs. PHAs and owners of multifamily housing must consider actual or imputed income from assets, such as real property, savings accounts, stocks, and bonds, when determining eligibility and rent. Net assets below $5,000 result in actual income inclusion, while assets exceeding $5,000 have the greater of actual or imputed income attributed to the family. Imputed income is a percentage of asset value, currently set below 1% for most programs. The current passbook savings rate for HUD rental assistance programs is set below 1%. Families may have their income adjusted based on assets like non-interest-bearing checking accounts or market value of owned property. HUD rental assistance recipients are required to contribute towards rent, with the subsidy covering the difference between the tenant's contribution and the actual housing costs. Contributions are based on a percentage of adjusted income or gross income. The tenant's rent contributions for HUD rental assistance programs are set at 30% of adjusted income, 10% of gross income, welfare rent, or the minimum rent set by the PHA. Families in Section 8 HCV program can choose to pay the difference if their subsidy doesn't cover the full rent, with a maximum contribution of 40% of income in the first year. Public housing residents can opt for a market-comparable flat rent. Utilities are tenant-paid if not included in rent. Adjusted income is used to determine a family's contribution towards rent in assisted housing. PHAs and property owners calculate adjusted income by deducting certain expenses from total annual income, such as $400 for elderly or disabled families and unreimbursed medical expenses. Utility allowances are provided to cover tenant-paid utilities, deducted from the monthly rental contribution or reimbursed if it exceeds the contribution. Certain unreimbursed medical expenses can be deducted if they exceed 3% of a family's income, including expenses for elderly and disabled family members. Reasonable child care expenses that enable a family member to work or further their education are also deductible. Dependents under 18, full-time students, or those with disabilities can have $480 deducted. Certain public housing and Section 8 voucher residents have an earned income disregard. The law allows for certain residents of public housing and Section 8 HCV holders to have a portion of their increased earnings disregarded in the first and second year of employment. This also applies to disabled Section 8 HCV holders. Deductions for child support and spousal support payments are included, but currently not funded by Congress. Family income must be reviewed upon selection for assistance and annually thereafter. HUD regulations require annual recertification of tenant income and rent, with guidance on interim recertification. Families must report any changes in composition and income, with mid-year reexamination possible for income decreases. Owners must reexamine income if it increases by $200 or more per month in project-based rental assistance programs. Public housing and Section 8 HCV programs leave the discretion to the PHA for income increase reexamination thresholds. The introduction of income limits based on area median income in the 1970s replaced previous rules set by individual Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for determining \"low income\" eligibility. Other housing programs in the 1960s used different income eligibility measures. In the 1970s, HUD proposed standardizing income eligibility for FHA-insured multifamily housing programs by tying it to area median income instead of local public housing income limits. This was to address regional disparities in eligibility for assistance. The Administration's proposals were not adopted, but the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 later incorporated area median income measures. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-383) incorporated area median income into the Section 8 program eligibility guidelines, setting eligibility at 80% of AMI. It introduced the term \"very low-income\" as income not exceeding 50% of AMI. P.L. 93-383 also changed public housing law to make at least 20% of new units available to very low-income families. Minimum tenant contribution standards for federal rental assistance programs have been set at 30% of adjusted income since 1981. The Brooke Amendment in 1969 established income-based rent standards, capping tenant contributions at 25% of family income in public housing. This standard was based on pre-Great Depression mortgage qualification criteria. The Section 8 program, created in 1974, also included income-based guidelines. The Section 8 program, established in 1974, set income-based rents at 15-20% of family income. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 standardized rents at 30% of adjusted gross income, increasing families' contributions towards rent to achieve budget savings for the federal government. HUD operates various rental assistance programs, with additional programs administered by the Departments of Agriculture and the Treasury for low-income individuals. The Departments of Agriculture and the Treasury administer housing programs for low-income families, similar to HUD's rental assistance programs. Changes in HUD's policies may also impact these other programs. HUD administers various programs where funds are distributed to state and local governments or community providers for rental assistance. The Homeless Assistance Grants, HOPWA program, and HOME Investment Partnerships program provide rental assistance to low-income families in permanent housing. These programs differ from other rental assistance programs by leaving eligibility and subsidy decisions to local grantees. Homeless Assistance Grants fund permanent and transitional housing for homeless individuals through three separate grant programs. Eligibility for Homeless Assistance Grants is not based on income requirements. The CoC program is the primary source of assistance for permanent and transitional housing for homeless individuals. Income may be considered for determining a family's contribution to housing costs, with grant recipients having the option to impose an \"occupancy charge.\" Regulations govern income calculations for determining the occupancy charge, which cannot exceed a certain percentage of adjusted income or gross income. Homeless clients living in units receiving rental assistance must contribute towards rent. The HOPWA program provides funds for short-term and permanent housing assistance, including supportive services. Residents must be low-income, defined as income at or below 80% of area median income. Rental assistance recipients must pay rent, and general income regulations apply. The HOME program funds can be used for tenant-based rental assistance and property construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation for rental housing. Families in HOME-funded housing must also be low-income. Under HOME regulations, families in HOME-funded rental housing must be low-income, with 90% at or below 60% of area median income. Income can be determined in three ways, including adjusted gross income reported to the IRS. Rent for HOME-funded housing cannot exceed 30% of adjusted income for families at 65% of area median income. There is no maximum rent contribution for tenants receiving rental assistance, but local jurisdictions must set a minimum rent level. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service funds affordable rental housing in rural areas through its Section 515 program and ongoing rent subsidies through its Section 521 program. Families with low or very low incomes are eligible for these programs, with some cases allowing moderate-income families. The USDA uses HUD's standards for determining family income, adjusted income, and rent. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program provides federal tax credits for constructing multifamily properties with below-market rents for lower-income families. The LIHTC program offers tax credits for properties with below-market rents for low-income families. Income eligibility is determined at the property level, with either 20% of units for families at or below 50% of AMI, or 40% for families at or below 60% of AMI. Rent for LIHTC units is set at 30% of either 50% or 60% of AMI. The HUD rental assistance programs discussed in this report may qualify low-income families for other public assistance programs like TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid. These programs have different eligibility standards and are administered at the state level, unlike HUD's rental assistance programs which are administered locally. TANF provides block grants to states, giving them more decision-making power. TANF provides block grants to states, giving them decision-making power over assistance programs like SNAP. Eligibility and benefits for SNAP are set by federal law, unlike HUD rental assistance programs where states determine these aspects. Family income eligibility for SNAP is based on federal poverty guidelines, not local area median income limits used in HUD programs. The income eligibility standards for SNAP are determined based on federal poverty guidelines, unlike HUD rental assistance programs which use local area median income limits. SNAP also has \"categorical eligibility\" rules that allow some families to qualify based on participation in other programs, a feature not present in HUD programs. Additionally, Medicaid uses a mix of federal and state standards for income eligibility, different from both SNAP and HUD programs. The Medicaid program requires states to use Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibility for most nonelderly populations. MAGI includes adjusted gross income plus certain additional income sources. States deduct 5% of the Federal Poverty Level from MAGI and compare it to income standards to assess eligibility. The Medicaid program uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibility for most nonelderly populations. MAGI includes adjusted gross income plus additional income sources, with specific inclusions and exclusions depending on the program. Certain groups are exempt from income eligibility determinations based on MAGI. Medicaid eligibility for MAGI-exempted groups is determined using existing rules. Generalizations about eligibility policies are challenging due to federal requirements, state choices, and definitions."
