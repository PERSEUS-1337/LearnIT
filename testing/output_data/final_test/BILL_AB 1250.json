    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 35554 of the Vehicle Code sets the maximum gross weight on any one axle of a bus at 20,500 pounds, with exceptions for transit buses procured before January 1, 2016. Transit buses are not subject to another section of the code. The maximum curb weight on any one axle of a transit bus procured between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, is 23,000 pounds, while for buses procured after January 1, 2019, it is 22,000 pounds. For articulated or zero-emission transit buses procured between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, the curb weight on any one axle should not exceed 25,000 pounds. The maximum curb weight on any one axle of an articulated or zero-emission transit bus procured through different solicitation processes has been specified: 24,000 pounds for buses procured between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019, 23,000 pounds for buses procured between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, and 22,000 pounds for buses procured on or after January 1, 2022. This regulation does not permit the operation of specified vehicles in violation of Section 35753. A transit operator must notify cities and counties of the routes an articulated bus will operate on by July 1 each year, including any changes or new routes. The notice must also include the weight of the bus as provided by the manufacturer. The term \"curb weight\" for transit buses is defined as the total weight of a fully loaded bus excluding passengers or a driver. Transit buses cannot exceed weight limits on interstate highways. Axles exceeding 20,000 pounds must be supported by four wheels. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code and California Constitution."
