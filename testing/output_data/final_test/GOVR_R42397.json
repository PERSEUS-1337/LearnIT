Costing $621 million, the center covers five acres and integrates with the Capitol Grounds. The Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) opened in 2008 beneath the East Front Plaza to enhance visitor experience at the U.S. Capitol. The square footage of the three levels of the center (580,000 square feet) is nearly two-thirds that of the Capitol itself (780,000 square feet). Factors such as wet weather, asbestos discovery, and design changes delayed the project's completion and increased costs. The report discusses the rationale, planning, construction, and funding of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), along with legislation related to its operations and design. The idea for the CVC dates back to the mid-1970s, but gained momentum in the early 2000s due to increased visitor numbers and security concerns following a tragic incident involving U.S. Capitol Police officers. In July 1998, a gunman with a history of mental illness killed two U.S. Capitol Police officers near a public entrance to the Capitol. Security concerns were further highlighted after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the discovery of anthrax in congressional office buildings. Architect of the Capitol Alan M. Hantman testified about the need for improved security measures at the Capitol Visitor Center, which was designed to provide a secure environment for managing visitors and protecting the Capitol building and its occupants. The Capitol Visitor Center was designed to improve accessibility for disabled persons and provide visitor services and educational exhibits. It houses historic documents, statues, and works of art. Funding was allocated in 1993 to develop a formal design, which was prepared by RTKL Associates Inc. The Architect of the Capitol published a report in 1995 reflecting the work done by RTKL. The 1995 report by the Architect emphasized three main goals for the Capitol Visitor Center: enhancing visitor experience, strengthening security, and integrating design concepts with improvements to the East Front Plaza. Construction was authorized in 1998 after multiple attempts in Congress. In the 105th Congress, bills were introduced for the Capitol Visitor Center, with concerns raised during FY2000 appropriations hearings. A CVC bill was introduced in March 1999, and a revalidation study in October 1999 reiterated goals for security, visitor education, comfort, and functional improvements. In November 1999, the United States Capitol Preservation Commission approved a revised conceptual design for the Capitol Visitor Center. Design development work began in January 2000, with GAO serving as a consultant for the project. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in June 2000, and the final design plan was approved in October 2000. In June 2001, Gilbane Building Company was selected to monitor the construction process of the Capitol Visitor Center. In November 2001, William V. Walsh Construction Company was awarded an $8 million contract to relocate utility lines. The relocation task proved more difficult than anticipated due to poorly documented lines. In June 2002, a $99.9 million contract was awarded for Sequence 1 construction, covering site demolition, foundation construction, and roof completion. In May 2004, the Sequence 1 contractor handed over the project to the Sequence 2 contractor for interior buildout and installation of systems. Architect Hantman faced budget issues with bids for Sequence 2, leading to concerns from House Appropriations Committee members about exceeding budget guidelines. The House appropriators had concerns about exceeding budget guidelines for Sequence 2. The Architect awarded a $144.2 million contract for Sequence 2 in April 2003, leading to the removal of historic landscape features to clear the area for excavation. A report was prepared in 2001 on how the construction would impact the trees on the East Front Plaza. The Architect's report in 2001 detailed the impact of construction on trees at the East Front, including those planted as part of historical plans and memorial plantings. Preparation work for the center began in December 2001, with the removal of memorial trees. Measures were taken to minimize disruption to Congress, such as installing soundproof windows and using auger drills instead of pile drivers. Capitol tour operations were temporarily shifted in May 2002. Capitol tour operations were moved to temporary screening facilities on the north and south sides of the Capitol during the construction of the Capitol Visitor Center. Temporary sites for television correspondents were also established in other locations. Issues discussed at hearings of various committees during the construction included a Senate proposal to transfer approval authority for the center to the United States Capitol Preservation Commission. The bipartisan United States Capitol Preservation Commission was established in the FY2000 legislative branch appropriations bill. Architect Hantman testified at a Senate hearing in 2005 that 75% of the increased costs of the Capitol Visitor Center were beyond his control, citing factors such as design changes, security enhancements, and rising building material costs. The Capitol Visitor Center project faced challenges such as construction delays, security checks for workers and vehicles, high-quality materials commitment, and a Buy America requirement. Senator Wayne Allard chaired hearings on construction progress and cost estimates in 2005. Representative David Obey expressed opposition to the project due to unfinished House office space in the CVC. The FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act required approval from House Appropriations Committee for AOC to fund House expansion space. The requirement was removed in P.L. 109-13 signed into law on May 11, 2005. Senate Appropriations Committee held hearings on CVC progress and cost from February to November 2006, discussing delays in stone delivery and installation. The House Appropriations Committee discussed the completion of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), including interior stone work, fire and life-safety systems testing, and a new utility tunnel impacted by asbestos concerns. Hearings in 2007 focused on construction oversight, visitor planning, and staff-led tours. Committees held hearings on the CVC visitor experience in June and October 2007, with witnesses including Terrie S. Rouse, CEO of Visitor Services at the CVC. At House Appropriations Committee hearings in 2007, discussions were held regarding the delayed opening of the Capitol Visitor Center. Acting Architect Steven T. Ayers explained reasons for the delay, including testing of fire, security, and life-safety systems. Chief Morse testified about the need for new officers to patrol the CVC. In 2008, discussions at House Appropriations Committee hearings focused on construction oversight, operations planning, and \"green\" building design elements of the Capitol Visitor Center. Topics included visitor access, website design, staffing, reservation system, safety recommendations, tunnel leaks, and East Front Plaza restoration. In 2008, Acting Architect Ayers testified about \"green\" building design elements for the Capitol Visitor Center, including storm water management, energy-efficient fixtures, and low-emission materials. Architect Hantman discussed the original budget of $265 million in 1999, which later increased to $517 million due to design changes and scope alterations. In April 2005, Architect Hantman testified that the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) cost could reach $517 million. By November 2005, GAO estimated the project to cost at least $542.9 million, with potential for further increases up to $584 million at completion. In September 2007, the estimated cost of the Capitol Visitor Center project rose to $621 million, with additional private funding approved by Congress in 1999. The United States Capitol Preservation Commission secured $65 million in private funds for the Capitol Visitor Center project. This was achieved through the sale of commemorative coins and additional appropriations from Congress in 1999. The United States Capitol Preservation Commission secured $65 million in private funds for the Capitol Visitor Center project, with the Pew Charitable Trusts establishing a nonprofit foundation to solicit and receive donations. By early 2002, the fundraising goal of $39 million was reached, and the remaining private sector funds were contributed to the commission for construction. The Capitol Visitor Center project received funding from the Capitol Preservation Fund after a shooting at the Capitol in 1998. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY1999 allocated $100 million for the planning and construction of the CVC to enhance security and provide information about Congress. The Capitol Visitor Center project received funding for security enhancements and construction. President Bush authorized $290.4 million for the project, with $100 million allocated for the completion of the center. The Capitol Visitor Center project received funding for security enhancements and construction following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act provided an additional $70 million for the project. The FY2004 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act allocated $48.622 million for the CVC after a rescission of 0.59%. The FY2004 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-199, 118 Stat. 457) reduced funding for the Capitol Visitor Center project to $48.622 million. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-279) included mechanisms for monitoring expenditures, such as directing GAO to perform quarterly reviews and limiting federal funds for the tunnel connecting the center to the Library of Congress. The FY2005 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill (S. 2666) also addressed funding and oversight for the project. The FY2005 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill included $7.6 million for Capitol Visitor Center care and maintenance, with additional funds authorized in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Conferees expressed concerns about cost estimates and delivery schedules for the project. The bill was enacted on December 8, 2004. The FY2005 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill included $7.6 million for Capitol Visitor Center care and maintenance. The FY2006 funding bill (H.R. 2985) allocated $36.9 million for the CVC project, with an additional $3.4 million for House expenses related to the CVC. The Senate version of the bill provided $41.9 million for the project, stating that the Architect's requested amount may not be enough to complete the CVC. The Committee added $5,000,000 to the budget for the Capitol Visitor Center based on GAO's recommendation. They also reduced the budget request for operations to $2,300,000. The Senate amended and passed H.R. 2985 with CVC funding and language by unanimous consent, including $41.9 million for the project and $2.3 million for operations. The FY2006 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-55) included $41.9 million for the Capitol Visitor Center project and $2.3 million for operations. The House Appropriations Committee marked up a FY2007 funding bill (H.R. 5521) on May 25, 2006, with amendments transferring authorities to the Comptroller General. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $46.2 million for the Capitol Visitor Center project in FY2007, $5 million more than requested to address cost estimates. Concerns were raised about schedule delays, cost overruns, water leaks, security issues, and life safety problems. The Senate approved $25.6 million for project completion and $14 million for fit-out and operation costs in their version of the funding bill. The Senate bill approved $25.6 million for the completion of the Capitol Visitor Center project in FY2007, along with $14 million for fit-out and operation costs. The FY2007 Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 110-5) provided funding for the legislative branch at FY2006 levels, with the ability to transfer funds among specified accounts. Acting Architect Ayers discussed the FY2008 appropriations request with the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Legislative Branch in a March 1, 2007 hearing.
