    "content": "The Congressional Budget Act establishes the budget resolution as a coordinating mechanism for budget decisions. It sets parameters for spending, revenue, and debt legislation, but is not a law and cannot be vetoed. The resolution provides a framework for Congress to consider legislation on spending and revenue, with details to be included in subsequent committee-reported legislation. All spending and revenue legislation must align with the budget resolution's agreed levels and priorities. The budget resolution sets parameters for spending and revenue legislation, encompassing discretionary and direct spending. Discretionary spending is controlled annually through appropriations legislation, funding activities like national defense and education. Direct spending programs are established in permanent law and their costs are determined by formulas within the legislation. The House and Senate Budget Committees marked up and voted on the FY2010 budget resolution, with amendments being considered and voted on. The overall cost of a program depends on eligibility requirements and benefits set forth in legislation, which can be adjusted by altering formulas. During markup, the House and Senate Budget Committees voted on the FY2010 budget resolution, with 15 amendments adopted and 12 rejected. The House considered H.Con.Res. 85 under special rules limiting debate and allowing only a few amendments. The House ultimately agreed to H.Con.Res. 85 by a vote of 13-10. The House and Senate Budget Committees voted on the FY2010 budget resolution, with amendments adopted and rejected. The Senate considered its version of the budget resolution over four days, with 121 amendments considered and ultimately agreed to the resolution by a vote of 55-43. The House and Senate agreed to the conference report on the FY2010 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13, H.Rept. 111-89) by votes of 233-193 and 53-43, respectively, on April 29. The budget resolution sets levels for new budget authority, outlays, revenue, and public debt for the budget year and four outyears, dealing with aggregates rather than programmatic spending details. The House budget resolution had revenue levels of $2,328 billion and outlays of $3,550 billion for FY2010, slightly different from the Senate's levels of $2,288 billion in revenues and $3,534 billion in outlays. The budget resolution included reconciliation instructions for health care and education initiatives. Differences between the House and Senate resolutions included assumptions on estate tax rates, AMT patching, and reserve funds. The conference agreement passed in April 2009 with $2,322 billion in revenues and $3,555 billion in outlays for FY2010, reducing the projected deficit to $523 billion by FY2014. The budget resolution passed in April 2009 includes programmatic totals for 21 functional categories. $130 billion is allocated for overseas deployment and other activities. Committees submit their views and estimates to help develop appropriate spending levels. The resolution does not allocate funds to specific agencies or programs. The budget resolution passed in April 2009 includes programmatic totals for 21 functional categories, with allocations for overseas deployment and other activities. Report language in the budget resolution expresses assumptions and desires for certain programs to receive priority in funding, but it is not binding on spending committees. S.Con.Res. 13 includes \"Policy\" and \"Sense of the Congress\" language supporting specific policies like middle-class tax relief and extensions of tax provisions. The budget resolution passed in April 2009 includes programmatic totals for 21 functional categories, with allocations for overseas deployment and other activities. S.Con.Res. 13 supports the permanent extension of tax relief for middle-income taxpayers and current estate tax rates. It also includes provisions related to defense priorities, veterans' healthcare, homeland security, economic competitiveness, college affordability, and child support enforcement. These provisions are not binding on spending committees. The budget resolution sets congressional priorities by dividing spending among 21 functional categories of the federal budget. These categories are then allocated to the appropriate House and Senate committees for discretionary and direct spending. The committees must adhere to these spending limits, known as 302(a) allocations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are accountable for staying within the spending limits established by the budget resolution. Sec. 401 of S.Con.Res. 13 places a restraint on discretionary spending limits in the Senate. Each committee has 12 subcommittees responsible for reporting one regular appropriations bill. The Appropriations Committees are responsible for dividing their allocation among subcommittees in 302(b) subdivisions. These subdivisions must be reported before any appropriations measures can be considered. The committees can adjust these subdivisions during the appropriations process to reflect spending legislation actions. The Appropriations Committees adjust subdivisions among subcommittees for spending legislation. They must inform their chamber of new levels with a 302(b) report. Amendments causing spending to exceed allocations are ruled out of order. House and Senate committees must adhere to 302(a) allocations for direct spending programs. The budget resolution sets limits on new budget authority for direct spending, with mandatory spending for FY2010 totaling $2,218 billion in key functional categories. Points of order can restrict spending from appropriations acts or new entitlement legislation to align with the budget resolution. The reconciliation process is used by Congress to develop legislation that changes current revenue or direct spending laws to conform with budget resolution policies. The reconciliation process is a two-stage process with instructions in the budget resolution for committees to recommend legislative changes. Instructions are specific, including the responsible committee, dollar amount, and timeframe for changes. S.Con.Res. 13 provides reconciliation instructions for health care and education reform initiatives. The reconciliation process involves committees in the House and Senate submitting legislative language to their Budget Committees by October 15, 2009. The Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions are tasked with reporting changes to reduce the deficit by $1,000,000,000 for fiscal years 2009 through 2014. Submissions must be made by the specified deadline for the Budget Committee to compile a reconciliation bill. The House committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor are required to report changes in laws to reduce the deficit by $1,000,000,000 for fiscal years 2009 through 2014. The submissions must be made by October 15, 2009. The House committees must submit recommendations to the House Committee on the Budget by October 15, 2009. The recommendations will be included in a reconciliation bill without substantive changes. Spending allocations can be adjusted after the budget resolution adoption through reserve funds included in the resolution. The House and Senate Budget Committees have the authority to adjust spending allocations through reserve funds in the budget resolution. Title III of S.Con.Res. 13 includes 34 reserve funds for policies like education, energy, healthcare, and tax relief. These reserve funds require legislation to be deficit neutral. The Budget Committee can report legislation with spending exceeding its allocations, as long as the excess amounts are offset. The chairman can adjust the committee's spending allocations to prevent a point of order under the Budget Act. Title IV of S.Con.Res. 13 includes provisions on budget enforcement, such as limits on advance appropriations, emergency spending, and legislation affecting the short-term deficit and surface transportation funds."
