    "content": "The \"Fuel Supply Improvement Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows the short title. The Congress finds that Hurricane Katrina disrupted petroleum production and refining in the Gulf Coast, leading to a reduction in US refining capacity and a significant increase in gasoline prices nationwide. Several refineries remain offline due to major damage from the hurricane. Before Hurricane Katrina, the United States already had strained refining capacity, with utilization rates at 95% or higher. Since 1976, no new refineries have been built, leading to a reliance on imports for meeting the growing demand for refined petroleum products. This dependence on foreign sources poses a threat to national security interests. Increasing refinery capacity would serve the national interest. (7) Increasing refinery capacity within the United States is crucial to meet the demand for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. This will benefit the American people by bringing more supply to the markets. The production and use of refined petroleum products have a significant impact on interstate commerce.\n(8) Refiners face strict environmental regulations and upcoming Clean Air Act requirements, which will require substantial investments and government permits. While these requirements may benefit the environment, they also pose challenges for refinery owners.\n(9) To encourage investment in increased refinery capacity, there is a need for more regulatory certainty for refinery owners. Streamlining regulatory approval procedures is essential to stimulate investment in this sector. To facilitate the development of increased refinery capacity, regulatory approval procedures must be streamlined for safe, timely, and cost-effective operations. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED FEDERAL PERMITTING. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED FEDERAL PERMITTING. An application for a permit to construct or expand a petroleum refining facility in the United States must be approved within 90 days of receiving a complete application, or the Secretary of Energy will issue the permit. The President can deny a permit if the benefits of increased refinery capacity are outweighed by the costs, and this decision is not subject to judicial review. This section applies to permits under various environmental laws for refinery repair or reconstruction in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Judicial review is not allowed for determinations made under this section. The curr_chunk discusses serving the needs of the United States in various scenarios such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires, routine maintenance, and unique fuel blends. SEC. 4. LITIGATION. (a) Direct Legal Representation.--The Secretary of Energy will provide legal representation for applicants facing lawsuits related to permit approval or facility construction if the lawsuit is deemed meritless or intended to cause delays. (b) Attorneys' Fees--Parties involved in such lawsuits will be awarded attorneys' fees in proportion to the amount. Parties involved in lawsuits related to permit approval or facility construction shall be awarded attorneys' fees in proportion to the amount of the original claim awarded or denied by the court. The Secretary of Energy will establish an office to assist in permit applications and planning for petroleum refining facilities in the US. This office will advocate for applicants, ensure agencies are responsive, and consult on permits for agencies that miss deadlines. Additionally, standby support will be provided for delays in certain petroleum refining facilities. The Secretary of Energy may enter contracts with sponsors of new petroleum refining facilities to increase domestic capacity, giving preference to those that enhance geographic diversity. Loan cost definitions and account establishment are required for these contracts. The Department of Energy has established two separate accounts for the Refinery Standby Support Program: the Refinery Standby Support Program Account and the Refinery Standby Support Grant Account. The Secretary must deposit funds in advance to cover loan costs before entering into a contract under this section. The Refinery Standby Support Program includes two accounts: the Program Account and the Grant Account. Funds must be deposited in advance to cover costs before entering into a contract under this section. The Secretary will pay specified costs if the petroleum refining facility's full operation is delayed. The Refinery Standby Support Program has two accounts: the Program Account and the Grant Account. Funds must be deposited in advance to cover costs before entering into a contract under this section. The Secretary will pay specified costs if the petroleum refining facility's full operation is delayed due to factors like agency delays, litigation, or exclusions related to sponsor actions, control, or business risks. The Secretary will pay costs resulting from delays covered by the contract for construction of facilities, with specific payment conditions based on the number of facilities and the timing of delays. The Secretary will pay covered costs for delays in construction of a petroleum refining facility, subject to receiving sufficient funds from appropriations or non-Federal sources. The Secretary will cover costs resulting from delays in construction and gaining approval for full operation of a petroleum refining facility owned by a non-Federal entity, including interest on debt obligations and the difference in prices of refined petroleum products. Any contract between a sponsor and the Secretary must meet requirements. The contract between a sponsor and the Secretary for a petroleum refining facility must ensure due diligence to shorten delays. Quarterly reports on regulatory actions must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will issue necessary regulations, including an interim final rule within 270 days. The Secretary will issue a final rule regulating contracts authorized by this section within 1 year of enactment. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section. SEC. 132 NEW SOURCE REVIEW is added to Part A of title I of the Clean Air Act. In SEC. 132 NEW SOURCE REVIEW, routine maintenance and repair will not trigger new source review requirements. Equipment replacement is considered routine if it meets specific emission criteria. States cannot have stricter new source review provisions than those set by the Administrator. SEC. 8. DISCOUNTED SALES OF ROYALTY-IN-KIND OIL TO QUALIFIED SMALL REFINERIES. The Secretary of the Interior must issue regulations within 60 days to offer discounted prices for crude oil sales to qualified small refineries. The discount cannot exceed $4.50 per barrel and must reflect transportation costs. The discount will end when the Secretary of Energy deems domestic refining capacity sufficient. Qualified Small Refinery refers to a refinery of a small business refiner that shows unused crude oil processing capacity in 2004. The Act is based on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce as outlined in the United States Constitution."
