    "content": "The 2010 earthquake in Haiti led to a humanitarian crisis and prompted a reevaluation of U.S. policies on Haitian migration. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control confirmed a cholera outbreak in Haiti, the first in at least 100 years. Some members of Congress criticized harsh treatment of Haitian migrants, while others argued for stricter immigration control to prevent illegal migration. The balance between humanitarian policies and immigration control is being debated in light of the earthquake's impact on Haiti. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti led to a humanitarian crisis and prompted a reevaluation of U.S. policies on Haitian migration. Haitians have been coming to the United States by boat without proper travel documents since the 1970s. The U.S. Coast Guard has been interdicting vessels carrying Haitians since 1981. Country conditions in Haiti and U.S. policy responses to surges in Haitian boat people are being considered. Since FY1998, the Coast Guard has interdicted over 1,000 Haitians annually, with peaks in FY2006 (1,198) and FY2007 (1,610). Haitian interdictions ranked second to Cuban interdictions in FY2007. In FY2009, 1,782 Haitians were interdicted, leading all other countries. Not all Haitian migrants are intercepted by the Coast Guard, as seen in incidents like the landing of over 200 Haitians in Biscayne Bay, FL in 2002 and a boat carrying 167 Haitians that ran aground in South Florida in 2001. Reports of deaths at sea involving Haitians were also documented in 2007. In the 2000 Decennial census, there were 532,000 persons reporting Haitian ancestry in the United States. According to estimates, there were approximately 757,000 persons reporting Haitian ancestry in the United States based on the 2006-2008 American Community Survey. From 2001 to 2010, 213,752 Haitians became legal permanent residents in the United States. According to the Office of Immigration Statistics, around 230,000 Haitians were legal permanent residents in the US by 2008, many through the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998. There are no reliable estimates of unauthorized Haitian residents in the US. 35,110 Haitians have applied for Temporary Protected Status. The Carter Administration referred to Haitians and Cubans from the 1980 Mariel Boatlift as \"Cuban-Haitian Entrants.\" The Reagan Administration established a program to interdict Haitian asylum seekers arriving by boat in 1981, allowing the U.S. Coast Guard to board and inspect vessels suspected of transporting undocumented Haitians. This agreement with Jean-Claude Duvalier aimed to stop and search private Haitian vessels on the high seas. The Reagan Administration established a program in 1981 for the Coast Guard to board and inspect private Haitian vessels on the high seas to intercept undocumented migrants. INS determined the immigration status of interdicted Haitians, with only 11 qualifying for asylum out of 22,940 interdicted from 1981 to 1990. In 1991, 11 Haitians qualified for asylum in the United States following a military coup in Haiti. The US hesitated on whether to force Haitians to return due to strong condemnation of the coup. Approximately 450 Haitians were held on Coast Guard cutters while options were considered. The former Bush Administration sought a regional solution, and the UNHCR arranged for temporary safe havens in Belize, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. In 1991, the US began treating Haitians fleeing by boat as asylum seekers, taking them to Guantanamo for pre-screening. Approximately 10,490 Haitians were paroled into the US after a credible fear of persecution was determined. On May 24, 1992, citing a surge in Haitian arrivals, the US continued to grapple with the influx. The US implemented a policy to intercept and return Haitians fleeing by boat without interviews to determine persecution risk. This policy lasted for two years under President Bush, then shifted to regional \"safe havens\" under President Clinton. Refugee processing was briefly offered but suspended due to the influx of Haitian boat people. In 1993, in-country refugee processing was expanded to Les Cayes and Cape Haiten. President Clinton granted deferred enforced departure (DED) to Haitians for one year in December 1997. Interdicted Haitians expressing fear of persecution undergo credible fear hearings at Guantanamo Bay. Only nine out of 1,850 interdicted Haitians received hearings in 2005, with one man granted refugee status. Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) enabled certain asylum applicants to seek immigration relief. The Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act (HRIFA) of 1998 allowed Haitians who filed asylum claims or were paroled into the US before December 31, 1995, to adjust to legal permanent residence. HRIFA was added to the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The requirement for status reports on HRIFA applications was removed by P.L. 110-161. Proper immigration documents lead to expedited removal. Aliens expressing fear of repatriation are referred to asylum officers for a \"credible fear\" determination. Those with pending cases must be detained. Haitians who reach U.S. shores and express fear are detained. Asylum and removal hearings are conducted by EOIR immigration judges. In FY2006, 570 Haitians were granted asylum, while 2,522 were denied. Approval rates were 4.6% in FY2007 and 4.8% in FY2008. In FY2008, the approval rates for Haitians seeking asylum were 4.6% and 4.8%. As of January 19, 2010, there were 488 Haitians in detention, with most being criminal aliens. The former INS implemented expedited removal proceedings for certain aliens arriving by sea in November 2002, citing national security concerns. Attorney General John Ashcroft ruled in April 2003 that immigration judges should consider national security interests when making bond determinations. The Attorney General vacated a decision regarding bond determinations for unauthorized migrants arriving in the US by sea, citing concerns about encouraging unlawful mass migrations. The case involved a Haitian who arrived in Biscayne Bay, FL, in 2002 and was released on bond by an immigration judge. The DOJ instructed field operations to adjust parole criteria for inadmissible Haitians to deter risky sea travel. The Bush Administration argued that Haitian migrants arriving by sea could trigger mass asylum to the US and pose a national security risk. Critics challenged the policy, citing the detention of Haitians in South Florida and arguing that Haitians were unfairly targeted. Haitians made up 2% of foreign nationals detained by DHS in 2008. In 2008, Haitians detained by DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement faced obstacles in accessing legal counsel for their asylum cases. Pro bono lawyers experienced delays in meeting with clients, and some argued that expedited removal provisions should not apply to those without proper immigration documents. The issue of Haitian TPS has been a recurring topic, especially after Haiti was declared a disaster in 2004. The U.S. Ambassador declared Haiti a disaster in 2004 after Tropical Storm Jeanne. In 2008, tropical cyclones caused hundreds of deaths in Gonaives. The Bush Administration did not grant TPS to Haitians. DHS temporarily halted Haitian deportations in 2010 due to a humanitarian crisis in Port au Prince. The DHS temporarily halted the deportation of Haitians in 2010 due to a humanitarian crisis in Port au Prince. Legislation was introduced in Congress to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Haitian nationals, but no action was taken. DHS Secretary Napolitano granted TPS for 18 months to Haitian nationals in the U.S. as of January 12, 2010, citing the need to provide temporary refuge for those whose safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti. The extension and re-designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the United States, granted by Secretary Napolitano on May 17, 2011, aims to support Haiti's recovery. Eligible individuals who arrived up to one year after the earthquake in Haiti can receive TPS, which is effective from July 23, 2011, to January 22, 2013. Cuban-Haitian Entrants are eligible for federal benefits, while newly arriving LPRs are barred from major federal benefits for the first five years. Noncitizens are restricted from major federal benefits and cash assistance for the first five years after entry, as established by Title IV of the PRWORA of 1996. Refugees and asylees are limited to five years of eligibility for means-tested public assistance. Temporary visa holders and unauthorized entrants are barred from most federal public benefits, with exceptions for emergency services. Amendments extended food stamp/SSI/Medicaid eligibility for refugees and asylees to seven years, including Cuban and Haitian Entrants. The term \"Cuban-Haitian Entrant\" was used by the Carter Administration in 1980 to admit Cubans and Haitians to the US. They did not qualify for asylum but were later granted LPR status under the IRCA of 1986. Congress defined Cuban-Haitian Entrant for federal assistance eligibility. Title V of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, also known as Fascell-Stone, defined Cuban and Haitian Entrants as individuals granted parole status or any other special status under immigration laws for nationals of Cuba or Haiti, regardless of their status at the time of receiving assistance. They must meet certain criteria, including not having acquired any other status under the Immigration and Nationality Act, being in removal proceedings, or having an asylum application pending. The Fascell-Stone provision aimed to treat Cubans and Haitians as refugees for federal benefits. The Office of Refugee Resettlement uses the term Cuban-Haitian Entrants for Haitians who meet the definition. Haitians benefiting from TPS or paroled after the 2010 earthquake may qualify. Policy makers may restrict this classification for earthquake-displaced Haitians. Asylees, refugees, and Cuban-Haitian entrants are eligible for certain benefits under current law. Certain aliens, including Cuban-Haitian entrants, refugees, asylees, and those in specified humanitarian categories, may be eligible for SSI benefits for seven to nine years after entry. They must meet eligibility requirements like age, disability, or blindness, and income thresholds. Eligible aliens may also enroll in their state's Medicaid Program. Cuban-Haitian Entrants are eligible for Medicaid for seven years in the United States. Haitians who are LPRs may become eligible for Medicaid after five years, with certain work history or military connections. Medicaid coverage is required for qualified SSI recipients. Families with children under 18 may be eligible for cash assistance through TANF. The TANF program has a 60-month lifetime limit for federal benefits, with exemptions for hardship. States administer TANF with varying payment levels. Refugees in job training programs may be exempt from TANF requirements. TANF beneficiaries may qualify for Medicaid, but SSI beneficiaries are generally ineligible for both programs. Cuban-Haitian entrants are eligible for federal resettlement assistance. Cuban-Haitian entrants are eligible for federal resettlement assistance through the ORR, which includes transitional cash and medical assistance. The assistance is designed to promote self-sufficiency and social adjustment, with benefits limited to six to eight months. Those who meet income and resource requirements for SSI, TANF, or Medicaid may receive benefits under the ORR-funded programs. Under Title V of the Refugee Education Assistance Act, states are fully reimbursed for cash and medical assistance to Cuban and Haitian entrants under the same conditions as refugees. States can choose to have a publicly administered or public/private RCA program, with most states opting for public administration. Payment levels in publicly administered RCA programs are equivalent to TANF levels and vary by state. States also administer their own RMA program from ORR funds, covering 100% of costs for eligible refugees and entrants. Refugees not eligible for Medicaid can receive benefits under these programs. Refugees and entrants who are not eligible for their state's Medicaid program may be eligible for RMA benefits for up to eight months, with covered services similar to state Medicaid plans. Costs of RMA vary based on age, health, and services provided. Some U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents have family in Haiti awaiting visas to become LPRs in the United States. The INA allows for a flexible annual limit of 675,000 LPRs worldwide, with per-country levels set at 7% for other family-sponsored LPRs. The INA establishes per-country levels at 7% of the worldwide level for family-sponsored LPRs. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are exempt from numerical limits. Family-sponsored preference visas are issued in order of petition filing. Spouses and children have derivative status. Visas are prorated when demand exceeds limits. U.S. citizens and LPRs have family members waiting in backlogs for visas, with long waits for siblings from Mexico and the Philippines. Options to expedite immigration for Haitians with approved petitions include legislative actions such as amending the INA to exempt certain Haitians from numerical limits. Advocates have requested humanitarian parole for Haitians in the visa backlog, allowing temporary presence in the U.S. without formal admission. Advocates are pushing for an amendment to the INA to exempt certain Haitians from numerical limits and expedite the admission of Haitians with family in the United States to relieve the humanitarian burden in Haiti and increase remittances for rebuilding efforts. Advocates are pushing for an amendment to the INA to exempt certain Haitians from numerical limits and expedite their admission to the US. Opponents argue that helping Haitians should be done in Haiti, not in the United States. The Haitian Emergency Life Protection Act of 2010 aimed to allow Haitian nationals with approved family-sponsored immigrant visas to obtain nonimmigrant visas. The V visa is for immediate relatives of LPRs with pending petitions for three years. Haitian orphans eligible for adoption by US residents were given humanitarian parole after the earthquake. They must meet criteria for adoption approval. The humanitarian parole for Haitian orphans includes eligibility criteria such as a Notice of Approval of Form I-600A, FBI background clearances, physical custody in Haiti, or a security background check. Children matched with American adoptive parents before January 12, 2010 may also be eligible. DHS and DOS are evaluating additional criteria for orphaned children in Haiti. As of March 29, 2010, the United States has granted humanitarian parole to 1,050 Haitian orphans, with 902 already in the country. The program for Haitian children in the adoption process before the earthquake ended in April 2010. The House passed the Help HAITI Act of 2010 on July 20, 2010, allowing the DHS Secretary to adjust certain aliens to LPR status. The House passed H.R. 5283, allowing the DHS Secretary to adjust certain aliens to LPR status if they were granted parole for Haitian orphans. The Senate introduced a similar bill, S. 3411. To qualify, the applicant must be physically present in the U.S. and admissible as an LPR. The legislation also applies to adopted children under 18 years old. The Senate passed H.R. 5283 with an amendment on August 4, 2010. The House passed H.R. 5283 on August 4, 2010, which became P.L. 111-293 on December 9, 2010. This law allowed Haitian orphans paroled into the country to adjust to LPR status and potentially become U.S. citizens. The Haitian Orphan Placement Effort Act of 2010 (H.R. 4603) aimed to expand humanitarian parole for Haitian orphans eligible for adoption by the government of Haiti before January 12, 2010. President Barack Obama requested Congress to consider funding for relief and reconstruction support for Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. A small portion of the $2.8 billion requested would go towards Haitian evacuees and migrants in the United States, including $220.0 million for the Department of Health and Human Services to fund Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible Haitians, as well as assistance for repatriation. The President's request for funding includes $220 million for Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible Haitians, as well as cash, medical, and repatriation assistance. Additionally, $15 million is allocated for the USCIS Examinations Fee Account to fund processing and adjudication of various benefits. The Administration proposed using funds for reception and settlement services for designated Haitians, fee waivers for eligible Haitians with TPS, humanitarian parole for medical evacuees and certain Haitians, and costs related to adoptions and orphans. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provides $10.6 million to USCIS for processing Haitian migrants. Previous legislation on immigration reform included provisions for Haitians to adjust to LPR status. H.R. 750 and H.R. 454 aimed to adjust the status of certain Haitian nationals in the U.S. based on their age and status as of October 21, 1998. These bills included provisions for children to apply for status adjustment through a parent or guardian and addressed document fraud as a ground for inadmissibility. Similar elements are found in a broader immigration reform bill in the 111th Congress (H.R. 4321). The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act continued the prohibition of funds for visas to certain aliens involved in political violence in Haiti. There were 105,193 Haitians with approved petitions to immigrate to the U.S. by FY2010. Canada's Haiti Special Measures Program expedited processing for Haitians with family members in Canada. Some have urged DHS Secretary Napolitano to use humanitarian parole authority to allow Haitians with approved visa petitions to enter the U.S. without waiting for visas. The cholera outbreak in Haiti has led to appeals for expedited admission of Haitians with family in the United States. Concerns about the spread of cholera by Haitian immigrants are countered by the argument that health screenings are part of U.S. immigration policy. Supporters of the current policy believe expediting Haitian admission is not in the U.S. national interest due to the outbreak and potential mass migration from Haiti. The earthquake in Haiti has caused mass displacement and potential lawlessness, disease outbreaks, and political turmoil, leading to fears of a mass migration of Haitians seeking refuge in nearby countries, including the United States. The return of Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier has heightened concerns about political instability. Multiple federal agencies handle Haitian migrants, including DHS's Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and DOJ's EOIR. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and DOJ's EOIR handle asylum and removal hearings for Haitian migrants. DHS is prepared for potential mass migration but Secretary Napolitano warns against fleeing Haiti after the earthquake. TPS only applies to those in the U.S. before January 12, 2010. DHS balances border security and immigration control during the crisis. In January 2011, DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported 27 Haitians, 26 with criminal convictions and one a national security risk. ICE resumed Haitian deportations halted after the 2010 earthquake. 300-350 Haitians with criminal convictions are in custody for removal. ICE spokeswoman stated decisions would align with domestic immigration enforcement priorities. Advocates argue against forced repatriation of Haitians given the 2010 earthquake aftermath. Some argue that deporting Haitians back to their homes after the 2010 earthquake could worsen political turmoil in Haiti and endanger deportees due to poor conditions in Haitian jails. ICE believes deportation is necessary to prevent releasing criminals back into U.S. communities. ICE and DOS are working with Haitian officials to ensure safe and humane removals with minimal disruption to rebuilding efforts."
