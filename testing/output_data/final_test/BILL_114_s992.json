    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that the use of firearms and archery equipment for target practice on Federal land is allowed, but some areas have been closed for this activity. The availability of public target ranges is decreasing due to population growth and development. Providing opportunities for target practice on both Federal and non-Federal land can promote shooting enjoyment and recreational activities. The purpose of this Act is to promote shooting enjoyment, recreational activities, and hunting by facilitating the construction and expansion of public target ranges with increased Federal support. Construction and expansion of public target ranges on Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The term \"public target range\" in this Act refers to a location designated by a governmental agency for recreational shooting, open to the public, may be supervised, and can accommodate various types of shooting activities. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to include a definition of \"public target range\" as a location for recreational shooting open to the public and may accommodate various shooting activities. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to allow states to pay up to 90 percent of the cost for managing wildlife areas and resources, with specific changes to the non-Federal share and regulations. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to allow states to allocate up to 10 percent of the amount apportioned for acquiring land for public target ranges. The Federal share of the cost for activities under the grant shall not exceed 75% except for public target range construction where it can reach up to 90%. Amounts allocated for land acquisition can be up to 10% under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act. The exception allows funds for public target range acquisition, construction, or expansion to be available for 5 fiscal years. SEC. 5. LIMITS ON LIABILITY. The Federal Tort Claims Act exempts the United States from civil actions for injuries or damages at public target ranges on Federal land or funded by the government. Congress believes that the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management should work with State and local authorities to manage waste and activities on Federal land used as public target ranges to support continued use for marksmanship training."
