    "content": "The Act titled \"Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004\" amends the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 by retaining the task force and focusing on scientific assessments, research, demonstration, and technology transfer plans. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004 further amends section 603 by requiring the Task Force to collaborate with State, Indian tribe, and local governments, as well as industry, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations in developing assessments and plans. Additionally, the Task Force must conduct scientific assessments of harmful algal blooms every 5 years. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004 mandates Congress to conduct scientific assessments of harmful algal blooms in US coastal waters. The assessments will focus on marine and freshwater blooms, including those in the Great Lakes and estuaries. They will examine causes, ecological consequences, economic costs, and evaluate progress of Federal research programs. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004 requires a scientific assessment of freshwater harmful algal blooms, focusing on causes, ecological consequences, and coordination of Federal research efforts. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004 mandates a scientific assessment of harmful algal blooms in freshwater locations, focusing on causes, ecological consequences, and coordination of Federal research efforts. This includes establishing priorities for a research program to better understand harmful algal blooms and prevent duplication of research efforts among Federal agencies. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004 requires a national research plan to reduce impacts of harmful algal blooms on coastal ecosystems, public health, and the economy. The plan includes establishing priorities for a research program on prevention, control, and mitigation methods. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2004 mandates a national research plan to address harmful algal blooms. This plan includes methods for prevention, control, and mitigation, as well as improving coordination among Federal agencies. Additionally, it emphasizes the inclusion of diverse institutions in research efforts. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with other agencies, will establish a program for research, development, and technology transfer in line with the established priorities. The Secretary, in consultation with Sea Grant Programs, ensures communication of program results to governments and the public. The Task Force must submit a scientific assessment of hypoxia every 5 years, examining causes, consequences, and costs, as well as potential actions for prevention and mitigation. The Secretary, in consultation with Sea Grant Programs, ensures communication of program results to governments and the public. The Task Force must submit a scientific assessment of hypoxia every 5 years, examining causes, consequences, and costs, as well as potential actions for prevention and mitigation. The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Task Force and appropriate State, Indian tribe, and local governments, shall provide for local and regional scientific assessments of hypoxia or harmful algal blooms, as requested by State, Indian tribe, or local governments, or for affected areas as identified by the Secretary. The Secretary ensures diverse geographical and ecological assessments of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms, with findings communicated to relevant authorities and the public. Scientific assessments examine causes, consequences, costs, and prevention methods for these issues in specific areas. The Task Force will also consider other relevant topics related to hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, and their ecological and economic impacts. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Section 605 of the Act is amended to authorize appropriations. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized $19,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007 for activities related to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. $1,500,000 for each year will be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for research and assessment activities. For fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007, funding is allocated for various projects related to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. This includes the ECOHAB project, research programs, MERHAB project, and activities for hypoxia research and monitoring. For fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007, $1,500,000 annually is designated for activities outlined in section 603(f). Funding from other paragraphs is solely for competitive, peer-reviewed research programs. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 7, 2004."
