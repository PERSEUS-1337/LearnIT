Congress finds that HIV/AIDS continues to infect and kill thousands of Americans, disproportionately impacting African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and women. It is estimated that 1.6 million Americans have been infected with HIV, with a significant number unaware of their status. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine HIV screening for all patients aged 13-64, regardless of risk, to increase the proportion of people who know their HIV status. Standard health insurance plans cover HIV screening when there are clinical indications or known risk factors present. Requiring health insurance plans to cover routine HIV screening is crucial in preventing HIV/AIDS spread and ensuring infected individuals receive effective treatment. SEC. 2.
