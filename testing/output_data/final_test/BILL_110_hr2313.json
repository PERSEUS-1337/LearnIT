    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development Act of 2007\". The Congress recognizes the importance of developing clean, domestic, renewable energy sources to reduce environmental impacts, increase national security, improve public health, and create economic stability. Marine renewable energy technologies are a nonemitting source of power production that can serve as an alternative to fossil fuels and create new jobs in the United States. Europe has successfully deployed wave and tidal energy devices off the coast of Scotland, and recent studies have identified the potential for marine renewable energy development. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has identified viable sites in the United States with wave and tidal resources for marine power technologies. Research and federal support are needed to develop these technologies and make marine renewable energy commercially viable. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nMarine Renewable Energy includes energy from waves, tidal flows, ocean currents, and ocean thermal energy conversion.\n\nSEC. 4. MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary, with other agencies, supports research and development for marine renewable energy production, including studying technologies, reducing costs, grid integration, wave forecasting, modeling, and improving reliability. The Secretary supports research to enhance marine renewable energy technologies, including developing corrosive-resistant materials, studying environmental impacts, and establishing protocols for ocean community interaction with energy devices. The Secretary supports research to enhance marine renewable energy technologies, including developing power and identification standards, addressing system integration methods, and utilizing marine resources in specific regions. Siting criteria for marine renewable energy projects will be developed prior to installation. The National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers are established under Section 5. The Secretary will award grants to institutions of higher education for the establishment of National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers. Locations for Centers will be selected based on criteria such as existing marine renewable energy programs, expertise in environmental and policy issues, and access to marine resources in specific regions. Special consideration may be given to historically black institutions. The Secretary will award grants to institutions of higher education for the establishment of National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers. Special consideration may be given to historically black colleges and universities and land grant universities. The Centers will advance research, development, and commercial application of marine renewable energy, coordinating with the Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere on criteria related to wave forecasting technologies and marine renewable energy systems. The National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers serve as a clearinghouse for the marine renewable energy industry, disseminating best practices and managing resources. Applicants for grants must demonstrate the need for Federal support, showing that the research conducted by the Centers would not be possible without it. The Act does not waive any environmental or other laws. $50,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary for the Act each year from 2008 to 2012, excluding funds for activities already funded under a specific section of the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
