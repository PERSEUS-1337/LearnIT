    "content": "The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) aims to prevent the international trade in plants and animals from threatening their survival. The United States, a CITES signatory, is a major player in the global wildlife trade, with illegal trade in endangered wildlife products estimated at billions of dollars annually. This includes elephant ivory, rhino horns, and turtle shells, as well as illegal logging and fishing, making wildlife trafficking one of the top 10 most lucrative criminal activities. Illegal wildlife trafficking is among the top 10 most lucrative criminal activities globally, following narcotics, counterfeiting, and human trafficking. Congress oversees U.S. involvement in CITES, providing funding for conservation programs. The most recent CITES COP in March 2013 discussed listing proposals for various species. The next COP will be in South Africa in September 2016. CITES, an international wildlife trade agreement, was signed in 1973 and entered into force in 1975. It aims to protect species at risk from international trade. CITES regulates trade of approximately 5,600 animal species and 30,000 plant species through import and export permits. The administrative bodies include the Secretariat, COP, and Management and Scientific Authorities of each country. Parties meet every two years to evaluate implementation, with the US implementing legislation being the Endangered Species Act. The FWS in the DOI oversees the responsibilities of the Management. Under CITES, species are identified for protection based on criteria like trade, population size, habitat quality, distribution area, subpopulations, and reproductive potential. Enforcement responsibilities are shared by FWS, APHIS, Customs Service, and NOAA Fisheries. Under CITES, species are selected for protection based on criteria like trade, population size, habitat quality, distribution area, subpopulations, and reproductive potential. Proposals for changes to the appendix must meet specific criteria and require a two-thirds majority vote for adoption. Criteria for listing species under CITES have evolved over the years, with new parameters added in 1994. Under CITES, species are selected for protection based on criteria like trade, population size, habitat quality, distribution area, subpopulations, and reproductive potential. The level of international trade, distribution, and population size of the species, threats facing the species, management, conservation efforts, and consultations with other countries are considered. Three appendixes in CITES offer different levels of protection. Once listed, species can only be traded with permits to ensure survival. Certificates of Exemption are granted under specific criteria. Article II outlines conditions for species inclusion in each Appendix. Appendix II of the treaty provides conditions for species inclusion, with the most stringent restrictions on trade for species in Appendix I. Trade in Appendix I species is strictly regulated to prevent endangering their survival, allowing limited trade for scientific, breeding, or educational purposes with required permits. For example, Namibia and South Africa were permitted to export a limited number of black rhinoceroses annually. The treaty allows limited trade of Appendix I species for specific purposes with strict regulations. Appendix II species have less restrictive trade rules, allowing for commercial purposes if not harmful to the species in the wild. For example, Namibia and South Africa can export a limited number of black rhinoceroses annually for conservation programs. Trade of Appendix II species requires an export permit from the country of origin, unless the importing country has additional requirements. CITES may classify individuals or parts of Appendix I species as Appendix II if bred in captivity. An introduction from-the-sea certificate is needed for importing Appendix I or II specimens from the high seas. Appendix III species are regulated within a country's jurisdiction to prevent exploitation, requiring specific permits for international trade. To export species listed in CITES, a permit is required based on the origin country or previous import. A certificate of origin is needed for Appendix III specimens exported from a different country. Appendix I specimens need both import and export permits for trade between party nations, with additional permits required for trade involving non-party nations. When a non-party nation is involved in trade, the party nation must provide the necessary import or export permit. CITES permits are required for importing Appendix I specimens acquired abroad. Domestic trade within a party nation does not need a CITES permit. The United States is the largest importer of animal trophies globally. Reservations can be made by parties to detract from the listing of a species they find unacceptable. Reservations can be made by parties to detract from the listing of a species they find unacceptable. Palau has the most reservations with 33 for marine species, followed by Iceland, Norway, and Japan. Other countries like Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and Liechtenstein have reservations for bird species, amphibians, and some mammals. The United States has no reservations. Certificates of Exemption may be issued for pre-convention specimens or species involved in scientific exchanges. Certificates of Exemption may be issued for pre-convention specimens or species involved in scientific exchanges. The administration of CITES is divided into the Secretariat, the Management and Scientific Authorities, and the Conference of the Parties, with the Secretariat housed within the United Nations Environment Programme in Geneva, Switzerland. The Secretariat is responsible for organizing meetings, preparing reports, and conducting scientific studies. The Secretariat oversees scientific and technical studies for CITES implementation. Each party appoints Management and Scientific Authorities. Management Authorities issue permits, ensuring compliance with laws and welfare standards. Scientific Authorities provide necessary advice. Management Authorities maintain trade records, care for species in transit, and designate trade points. Scientific Authorities under CITES determine the impact of trade on species conservation and assess the suitability of facilities for live animal imports. The Conference of the Parties meets every few years to vote on amendments and review progress, aiming to improve CITES effectiveness. The Conference of the Parties (COP) meets every few years to vote on amendments and review progress for improving CITES. Attendance is open to observers, including non-party members, and decisions are often made by consensus. Party members have voting rights, and enforcement of CITES is the responsibility of the party countries. CITES does not have enforcement authority but requires parties to enact legislation prohibiting trade violations, with penalties and confiscation of illegally traded specimens. Enforcement activities include designating ports, caring for specimens, maintaining import/export records, and preparing biennial reports. Party countries can adopt stricter measures than CITES, such as the EU and the US under the ESA. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and Wildlife Service, is primarily responsible. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) under the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for implementing CITES in the United States. They issue permits for the trade of protected species, enforce regulations, and coordinate with other federal agencies for proposals to the COP. NOAA Fisheries provides assistance for marine species. NOAA Fisheries provides scientific advice and enforcement for marine species covered by the ESA and CITES. APHIS inspects plant shipments and assists in detecting wildlife products. The Department of Agriculture and State also support FWS in policy and international agreements. Wildlife trade in the US is regulated by additional laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Lacey Act. The Marine Mammal Protection Act, Lacey Act, and Fisherman's Protection Act are laws regulating wildlife trade in the US. The Marine Mammal Protection Act aims to conserve marine mammal populations, the Lacey Act enforces against illegal wildlife trade, and the Fisherman's Protection Act also plays a role in regulation. The Lacey Act only covers plants indigenous to a state and listed under CITES or state laws for species conservation. This excludes many tropical timber species. The Fisherman's Protective Act includes the Pelly Amendment, allowing the President to stop imports from countries affecting international fishing treaties or endangered species programs like CITES. The FWS implemented changes to CITES regulations in the United States on May 27, 2014, reflecting updated provisions. The ESA implements CITES, with overlapping but not identical species lists. The ESA protects around 2,185 species, including 628 in foreign countries. The Secretary of the Interior can consider actions by foreign governments on species under the ESA. The Interior can consider foreign government actions on species for listing. The FWS reviews foreign species under ESA criteria before listing. Differences exist between ESA and CITES in listing and protecting species. Both have similar rationales for listing species due to threats to survival. The ESA and CITES have similar rationales for listing species based on threats to survival. Species listed under both have varying levels of protection, with some like the Saiga antelope being listed as endangered under the ESA but only under Appendix II in CITES. This means that legal hunting in one country may not allow for trophy importation into another without meeting regulations from both countries and exemptions under the ESA. Endangered species listed under the ESA can be imported to the US if they meet requirements of Section 10 or Section 4(d) of the ESA. Section 10 permits are issued for scientific research purposes, but not for sport hunting trophies. Exceptions for sport-hunting trophies under CITES are sometimes granted for species listed under Appendix I and II. The FWS may issue special rules under Section 4(d) of the ESA for threatened species, allowing some trade if it benefits conservation. Import bans have been lifted for some threatened species listed under CITES, with sport-hunted trophies allowed to incentivize conservation efforts in the species' countries of origin. Some species listed as threatened under the ESA have rules allowing import of body parts to promote conservation programs in their native countries. CITES permits trade in endangered species if not harmful, while the ESA requires imports to enhance species survival. For example, cheetahs are listed as endangered under the ESA and as Appendix I species under CITES, allowing limited trade in sport-hunted cheetahs in some countries. The ESA is stricter than CITES in terms of species protection, with limited trade allowed under certain conditions. The debate continues on whether domestic ESA measures should be stricter for foreign endangered species. Some argue for stricter domestic measures for foreign endangered species to focus on overall protection and conservation, while others believe it may discourage developing countries from creating conservation programs. The FWS proposed a policy allowing limited trade in foreign endangered species if funds are invested in conservation programs. The controversy surrounding the issue of enhancement-of-survival permits was met with skepticism and concerns about its impact on endangered species. Despite the authority to issue such permits, the policy was not implemented. The implementation of CITES has had both success stories and controversies, with no species listed under CITES in the last 30 years going extinct. CITES is widely accepted with 183 signatories. CITES is a widely accepted treaty with 183 signatories that has increased monitoring and control of international wildlife trade. The use of science-based criteria for listings has contributed to its success, although implementation issues remain. Several species have shown improvement since being listed on CITES. Enforcement of CITES in foreign countries is complex and controversial, with low penalties for violations and lack of resources for monitoring. Many parties to the treaty have not effectively enforced it, with approximately 50% failing to implement necessary legislation. This has led to the persistence of the global illegal wildlife trade. Enforcement of wildlife trade laws in many countries is hindered by corruption, collusion between poachers and officials, and a lack of political support. Penalties for CITES violations are seen as inadequate to deter illegal wildlife trade. Strengthening penalties and political support could improve enforcement efforts. CITES does not provide specific guidance on penalties for illegal wildlife trade, leading to varying enforcement approaches among countries. Reservations allowing countries to exempt themselves from regulations pose a threat to CITES implementation. Confiscation of wildlife and products is a common penalty for violations. Supporters of reservations argue they provide a country with the opportunity to object to listing a species without withdrawing from the Convention. Critics see reservations as a loophole that can lead to depletion of endangered species if trade is uncontrolled. Implementation problems are being addressed by the Secretariat through increasing party nations' capacity to enforce CITES and enhancing cooperation among international stakeholders. CITES is gaining acceptance worldwide and is effective in curbing the trade of endangered species. However, some argue that implementation issues, such as lack of legislation in some party nations, compromise its effectiveness. The United States is addressing this issue in their Implementation Plan for the U.S. National Strategy for Combating Wildlife. The United States is implementing the U.S. National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking by providing support and technical assistance to ensure countries comply with CITES regulations. They also aim to enforce use-after-import provisions and address differences between domestic regulations and CITES regulations for foreign endangered species. There is debate over whether stricter measures under the ESA would be more effective than CITES in protecting foreign endangered species."
