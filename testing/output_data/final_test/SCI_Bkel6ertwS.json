    "content": "The recent expansion of machine learning applications in molecular biology has significantly contributed to our understanding of biological systems, particularly genome functioning. Technological advances have allowed for the collection of large epigenetic datasets, including information on DNA binding factors (ChIP-Seq) and DNA spatial structure (Hi-C). Studies have shown a correlation between DNA binding factors and Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) in DNA structure, but genomic coordinate information has not yet been utilized to improve prediction models. Machine Learning methods are used to predict DNA folding patterns in Drosophila melanogaster. Various models, including Gradient Boosting and Recurrent Neural Networks, were tested, with the bidirectional LSTM RNN model performing the best. The study highlights the importance of sequential DNA states in chromatin folding and identifies key epigenetic features. This research showcases the impact of complex models in molecular biology and the significance of understanding cell processes through Machine Learning algorithms. Investigating the spatial organization of the genome, or chromatin, is a challenging task supported by connections between gene regulation, inheritance, disease, and chromatin structure. High-throughput experiments like Hi-C have revealed principles of chromosomal folding, showing that chromosomes are folded 10^4 - 10^5 times while maintaining vital cell processes. Despite being developed a decade ago, high-quality Hi-C experiments have only recently been published, with the protocol still being elaborate and expensive. Chromosomes are subdivided into self-interacting domains called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which correlate with replication timing regulation and epigenetic domains. Factors like ChIP-Seq aid in detecting DNA binding factors, enabling exploration of chromatin structure with Machine Learning. Increasingly available datasets from ChIP-Seq experiments for histone modifications in public databases facilitate studying the relationship between TADs and epigenetic marks. The relationship between TADs and epigenetic marks has been explored, but the mechanisms behind genome partitioning into TADs are not well understood. This study focuses on understanding 3D chromatin structure using Machine Learning, specifically analyzing Drosophila melanogaster chromatin with Linear Regression models and Recurrent Neural Networks. The study analyzed Drosophila melanogaster chromatin using Linear Regression models and Recurrent Neural Networks to identify significant chromatin marks in predicting information about TADs. The techniques could also be applied to explore 3D chromatin structure in mammals and humans, with potential medical applications such as understanding chromosomal topology disruptions linked to conditions like gliomagenesis and limb malformations. The increasing volume of data has enabled the application of complex and efficient methods in predicting 3D chromatin architecture using Machine Learning. Some studies focus on predicting 3D chromatin architecture using Machine Learning methods. One approach uses Hi-C maps as input, as seen in REACH-3D by Cristescu et al. Another approach, by Schreiber et al., uses nucleotide sequences to estimate Hi-C contacts. The predicted outcomes are related to histone modification, functional elements, and replication timing. The research by Ulianov et al. suggests that active chromatin and transcription are key factors in chromosome partitioning into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). They found that active chromatin marks are present at TAD borders, while repressive histone modifications are depleted within inter-TAD regions, showing a correlation between TADs and chromatin marks. This study highlights the dynamic self-organization of TADs through transient interactions between nucleosomes. The study by Hansen (2015) successfully extracted knowledge from ChIP-Seq data of histone modification to analyze chromatin structure. They developed a predictive model for Hi-C that revealed correlations with replication timing, supporting the idea of extracting Hi-C contact information from Nucleotide Sequence and DNaseI assay signal in Homo sapiens cell lines. This research focused on exploring 3D chromatin characteristics of Drosophila melanogaster using ChIP-Seq data, a unique approach not seen in other studies. The input data for this study included Hi-C datasets for Drosophila melanogaster S2-DRSC cells collected from Ulyanov et al. (2016), with the Drosophila dm3 genome assembly divided into 5950 sequential genomic regions called bins. This work aimed to predict Topologically Associated Domain characteristics from epigenetic marks, a novel contribution to the field. The study focused on analyzing chromatin structure in Drosophila melanogaster using ChIP-Seq data. The genome was divided into 5950 bins, each representing 200,000 DNA base pairs. Two sets of ChIP-Seq data were distinguished, with different biologically significant features. The input data was normalized by centering and scaling each feature. Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) were a key focus of the study. The study focused on analyzing chromatin structure in Drosophila melanogaster using ChIP-Seq data. Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) were segmented based on the characteristic size parameter gamma, avoiding the need for parameter selection. Armatus software was used to annotate TADs with gamma, determining TAD boundaries and sizes. Each genomic bin was characterized by the gamma value at which it transitioned between TAD and non-TAD regions. The study analyzed chromatin structure in Drosophila melanogaster using ChIP-Seq data. TADs were segmented based on the gamma parameter, with higher values indicating smaller TADs in Armatus annotation. The Machine Learning problem defined bins as DNA sections, features as ChIP-Seq data on chromatin markers, and the target value as transitional gamma for TAD boundaries. The aim is to predict the characteristics of the 3D structure of chromatin transitional gamma, identifying significant chromatin marks in predicting information about TADs. The target value is a continuous value from 0 to 10, leading to a regression problem with an unbalanced distribution. The majority of objects have target values between 0 and 3, with a focus on minimizing Mean Square Error. The contribution of error on objects with high true values using Mean Square Error is significant. Objects with high transitional gamma values have a unique biological nature. A custom loss function called modified weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) is introduced to accurately predict transitional gamma values. The maximum value of the target value in the transitional gamma dataset is 10, resulting in \u03b1 being equal to 11. Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressors, and Recurrent Neural Networks were used to explore the relationships between 3D chromatin structure and epigenetics data. Models were trained with wMSE loss function and no regularization, L1 and L2 regularization, or both. Input bins are sequentially ordered in the genome for intuitive feature importance interpretation. The input bins are ordered in the genome for intuitive feature interpretation. RNN models were selected to learn the correlation in target variable values due to DNA connectivity. DNA is a long molecule made of nucleotides in a linear sequence, with complementary base pairs. Bidirectional LSTM RNN architecture was chosen to utilize the property of DNA being read in both directions. The study investigated variable parameters in the LSTM model for DNA sequence analysis, including sequence length, number of LSTM units, training epochs, loss function, and optimizer. Data was split into train, test, and validation sets, with models trained multiple times for consistency. Results were based on observations from ten experiments. The study conducted ten experiments to analyze DNA sequences using LSTM models with variable parameters. The best performance was achieved with Linear Regression using L1 and L2 regularization, with a weighted Mean Square Error of 0.2. Results for MSE, MAE, and R2 are presented in tables and figures, showcasing the importance of feature coefficients in the prediction model. The study analyzed DNA sequences using LSTM models and Linear Regression with L1 and L2 regularization. The feature coefficients were prioritized based on their influence, with Chriz being the most valuable and Su(Hw) the least. The stability of the weights varied between datasets, with the second dataset showing less stable results. The study prioritized feature coefficients based on their influence, with Chriz identified as the most robustly reproduced influential factor. CTCF and CP190 were also significant factors. Linear Regression with L1 regularization highlighted Chriz as the sole important feature. Gradient Boosting outperformed linear regression models but showed a tendency for overfitting with various parameter settings. The study focused on determining the optimal parameters for the Bidirectional LSTM neural network model. Experiments were conducted with different settings such as 'n estimators', 'max depth', and 'learning rate'. Results were evaluated based on weighted Mean Square Error and sequence length. An optimal sequence size of 6 with 64 LSTM Units was identified, showing a clear biological interpretation. The study identified an optimal sequence size of 6 with 64 LSTM Units for the Bidirectional LSTM neural network model. Evaluation scores showed better performance compared to constant prediction, Linear models, and Gradient Boosting models. Feature importance was explored by replacing values with zeros and evaluating the impact on evaluation metrics. The results on the test set were consistent with using the full dataset. The study found that dropping out individual features did not significantly affect the wMSE scores on the test set, indicating that the RNN could achieve similar performance with a subset of features. Evaluating the biological impact of features using ChIP-Seq data showed consistent results. This allowed for identifying the value of specific biological characteristics in chromatin folding pattern prediction. Training ML models with this data confirmed the effectiveness of the approach.
