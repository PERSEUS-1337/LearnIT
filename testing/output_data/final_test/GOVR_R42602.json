    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages water resource projects like dams and locks, critical for flood management, navigation, and hydropower. Private individuals are prohibited from possessing loaded firearms at Corps project areas open to the public, except for hunting or shooting at authorized ranges. Ongoing lawsuits challenge Corps firearms regulations, with legislation introduced in the 113th Congress to ban enforcement of such regulations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prohibits private individuals from possessing firearms at Corps projects, except for hunting or shooting at authorized ranges. Proposed language aimed to limit the agency's ability to enforce firearm restrictions in compliance with state law. The report compares Corps regulations with the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and addresses firearms-related safety and security issues at Corps projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prohibits private individuals from possessing firearms at Corps projects, except for hunting or shooting at authorized ranges. The Corps can issue firearms warnings or citations, with an average of 33 warnings and 21 citations annually for firearms, explosives, other weapons, and fireworks. Corps water resources projects are multipurpose, providing economic benefits through navigation, flood damage reduction, hydroelectric power, and water storage for various uses. Congress has granted the Corps authority to support recreation at its projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages 422 lake and river projects with recreation, providing 33% of U.S. freshwater for fishing. Corps projects receive 370 million recreational visits annually, with 90% of recreation areas within 50 miles of a metropolitan area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages numerous lake and river projects for public recreation. Regulations prohibit individuals from possessing loaded firearms at Corps-administered water resource projects, except for hunting, authorized shooting ranges, or with written permission. Firearms must remain unloaded in recreation areas like campgrounds, regardless of state laws on carrying firearms. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers enforces regulations on land and waters it owns, allowing loaded firearms only for hunting purposes in designated areas. Hunting is permitted except where prohibited by the District Commander, and all applicable laws apply on project lands. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allows hunting on roughly half of its 8.8 million acres of fee-owned land, with regulations restricting loaded firearms to designated areas. The other half is closed to hunting due to proximity to developed areas. Regulations do not directly address firearm discharge, but visitors may be in violation if possessing a loaded firearm outside of hunting or designated shooting ranges. Persons designated by the District Commander can write citations for violations of recreation regulations, with potential fines or imprisonment. Proposed legislation in Congress aimed to ban certain activities related to firearms on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' fee-owned land. The proposed legislation in Congress aimed to allow individuals to possess firearms at Corps projects in compliance with state law, excluding federal facilities and restricted project areas. The proposed legislation aimed to allow individuals to possess firearms at water resources development projects in compliance with state laws, similar to existing laws for Department of the Interior lands. Supporters saw it as part of a larger effort to improve consistency in firearms regulations on federally managed lands. The proposed legislation aimed to provide consistent treatment of open and concealed firearms possession within a state, for recreational shooting and self-defense, and to protect the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. However, concerns were raised about implementation challenges at Corps projects, including public safety and infrastructure security issues. The Administration opposed the Corps firearms regulation prohibition provision in H.R. 3590, citing critical infrastructure concerns. Many structures, such as multipurpose dams and navigation locks, require additional security measures due to homeland security concerns. Legislation in the 113th Congress did not explicitly give the Corps authority to restrict firearms at its facilities open to the public, raising questions about security maintenance. The proposed prohibition against enforcing Title 36, Section 327.0, of the Code of Federal Regulations would not have changed the existing federal law prohibiting firearm possession. The proposed legislation may alter federal law prohibiting firearms at Corps facilities open to the public. The definition of a \"federal facility\" is crucial, and the Corps' authority to restrict access remains unchanged. Existing regulations allow closure for public safety reasons. The proposed legislation may impact the Corps' ability to enforce firearms regulations at its projects, potentially leading to increased security measures and restricted public access. While Congress has granted the Corps authority to regulate conduct, it lacks typical law enforcement powers such as carrying firearms and making arrests. Stakeholders have differing views on allowing individuals to carry loaded firearms for self-defense at Corps projects. The Corps' law enforcement authority is limited compared to the Department of the Interior, which has officers with full law enforcement functions. While individuals can possess firearms at NPS and NWRS units, enforcement at these sites is restricted to issuing citations by Corps rangers, who primarily focus on land management duties. The Corps relies on state and local authorities for law enforcement at projects, with limited authority for contracts up to $10 million per year. Legislative proposals from the 113th Congress did not change law enforcement authorities for the Corps, maintaining unarmed Corps rangers. The proposed legislation would have affected Corps firearms regulations, but no information is available on the need for additional law enforcement assistance or funding. Reclamation water resources projects also have significant infrastructure and public access, but their firearms regulations were not impacted by the proposed legislation. Reclamation facilities manage firearms differently than the Corps, with regulations allowing possession on lands and waterbodies in compliance with federal, state, and local laws. Possession is not allowed at Reclamation facilities, and regulations may apply in special-use areas. Unlike the Corps, Reclamation distinguishes between facilities, lands, and waterbodies. Reclamation regulations allow firearms on lands and waterbodies in compliance with laws, while prohibiting them at facilities. Possession of loaded firearms is permitted on most Reclamation project areas, with restrictions on discharge unless for hunting or at authorized ranges. Unlike the Corps, Reclamation distinguishes between facilities, lands, and waterbodies. Reclamation regulations permit hunting on lands and waterbodies in accordance with laws. Congress has provided criminal penalties for violations to maintain law and order at Reclamation projects. Law enforcement can be provided by DOI armed officers or other personnel through agreements. Various personnel are utilized for security and public safety at Reclamation projects. The law enforcement at Reclamation projects includes authority and uniformed guards, armed security response task force, state and local law enforcement personnel, and private security companies. Most criminal offenses are handled by state police or local law enforcement. Reclamation rangers and Corps rangers do not have significant law enforcement authority or carry firearms. The Corps projects serve various purposes like recreation, navigation, flood damage reduction, and hydropower. Current regulations prohibit private individuals from possessing loaded firearms at Corps projects, except for hunting or at designated shooting ranges. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to eliminate restrictions on loaded firearms possession in public areas of Corps projects, as long as it complies with state law. Firearms would still be prohibited at federal facilities. If enacted, the proposed legislation would have lifted restrictions on loaded firearms on 4.4 million acres of Corps fee-owned lands open to the public. This would allow possession of loaded firearms for hunting or shooting at designated ranges, in line with state and federal firearms laws."
