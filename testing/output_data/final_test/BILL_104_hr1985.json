    "content": "The \"Adoption Incentives Act of 1995\" is cited as the short title. Section 137 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include adoption assistance. The \"Adoption Incentives Act of 1995\" amended Section 137 of the Internal Revenue Code to exclude employee adoption assistance benefits and military adoption assistance benefits from an employee's gross income. Employee adoption assistance benefits cover qualified adoption expenses paid by the employer, while military adoption assistance benefits are benefits provided to military personnel for adoption. The term 'military adoption assistance benefits' refers to benefits provided under specific sections of the United States Code. Qualified adoption expenses include fees directly related to legal adoption of an eligible child, excluding expenses incurred in violation of laws or surrogate parenting arrangements. An 'eligible child' is defined as any individual meeting certain criteria. The Secretary will issue regulations to coordinate the application of the section with other provisions allowing a credit or deduction for qualified adoption expenses. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made to Sec. 137 and Sec. 138 apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995. SEC. 3 allows withdrawal from an IRA for adoption expenses. The amendment allows exclusion of qualified adoption expenses from gross income if paid from an individual retirement plan, exceeding certain limits and not exceeding others. The amendment made by this section allows exclusion of qualified adoption expenses from gross income, with certain limits, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995."
