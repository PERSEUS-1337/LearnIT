    "content": "The end of the Cold War changed the U.S.-French relationship, with France known for its independent policy-making. French foreign policy under President Nicolas Sarkozy has aimed to improve bilateral relations with the United States. Sarkozy has pursued a more practical approach compared to his Gaullist predecessors. President Nicolas Sarkozy has pursued a more practical approach in French foreign policy, diverging from his Gaullist predecessors who emphasized nationalism and opposition to U.S. influence. Sarkozy admires U.S. global leadership, values American culture, and believes in a U.S. component for European security. Despite these differences, France remains committed to spreading its values through multilateral frameworks like the European Union and maintains a secular society that influences its approach to religion. Since the Cold War, France and the United States have diverged in some views on the state's relation to religion. Both countries prioritize stability in Europe through the EU and NATO, engaging Russia constructively, and addressing terrorism and weapons proliferation. Post-Cold War challenges have affected the U.S.-French relationship, with shifts in power dynamics towards central and eastern Europe. French-German initiatives remain important, but German perspectives are also influential. French-German initiatives are crucial in Europe, but German perspectives are turning towards the east. Central European states feel closer to the United States than France. Despite this, France remains a key player in European affairs. The United States has been deeply involved in European affairs since World War II, but by the mid-1990s, there were signs of disengagement. French and German efforts to form an EU security policy independent of NATO and the U.S. emerged during this period. During the George W. Bush Administration, France and other European allies urged the United States to address global crises within a multilateral framework, emphasizing the importance of engaging the international community in responding to threats like terrorism and proliferation. French Presidents have advocated for a \"multipolar\" world, promoting cooperation through institutions like the EU and the United Nations. During the George W. Bush Administration, France and other European allies promoted a \"multipolar\" world, encouraging economic development and political stability. The Bush Administration reacted with hostility, viewing it as opposition to U.S. initiatives. President Obama's election was welcomed in France, with strong popular support indicating a shift away from perceived unilateralism. Some U.S. observers saw France as an antagonist after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with occasional mutual antagonism evident. During the early years of the Fifth Republic, President de Gaulle had differing views on international affairs compared to Washington and other allies, even withdrawing France from NATO's military structures in 1966. France later developed its own nuclear deterrent force. Sarkozy worked to improve relations with the United States, rejoining NATO's military command structure in 2009. French assertiveness in Europe has historically driven the European integration project. France's assertiveness in Europe has historically driven the European integration project, with Paris playing a major role in initiatives like the EU's Economic Monetary Union. Despite being a medium-sized country with modest resources, France has consistently taken on leadership roles in establishing EMU, forming common European foreign policies, and opposing the U.S.-led Iraq war. Recently, France led diplomatic efforts with the UK at the UN to impose arms embargoes and economic sanctions. France led diplomatic efforts at the United Nations to impose arms embargoes and economic sanctions on the regime of Muammar Qadhafi in Libya, gaining international approval for a military mission to protect civilians. France and the UK are major contributors to ongoing military operations, with intertwined interests and actions with the US, particularly in trade and investment ties. The economies of France and the United States have become increasingly integrated through commercial interactions. The United States and France have a strong economic relationship, with over $1 billion in daily commercial transactions creating millions of jobs. They also have a long military history dating back to the Revolutionary War. Analysts believe France and Britain have flexible military forces capable of deploying long distances. Former NATO SACEUR James Jones has praised France's military capabilities as the most able in Europe for distant theaters. France's military is considered the most capable in Europe for distant theaters, with strong relations with American troops in various missions. Despite differences over Iraq, France has played a central role in NATO missions, peace operations, the Middle East Peace Process, countering the Iranian nuclear program, and fighting terrorism. This report analyzes key factors shaping French foreign policy and tensions in U.S.-French relations. President Sarkozy, of the center-right Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), was elected in May 2007 and is expected to stand for re-election in 2012. His presidency has been marked by ambition and energy, earning him the nickname \"hyper-president.\" However, a decline in popularity suggests French voters expected more substantive results from his initiatives. Sarkozy faces pressure from left-wing Socialist Party and rise of far-right National Front as 2012 election approaches. Sarkozy's struggles are attributed to dissatisfaction with fiscal austerity and high unemployment post-2008 economic downturn. His focus on French national identity and debate on Islam is seen as a move to secure conservative support for the 2012 election. His challenges include stimulating the economy after a 2.5% contraction in 2009 and reducing a budget deficit of 7.5% of GDP in 2010. Sarkozy aims to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2013 through spending cuts and phasing out stimulus measures. Economic growth is expected to stagnate at 1.5% of GDP, with unemployment forecasted to decrease slightly. The government faces opposition to spending cuts and reforms to liberalize the economy, including labor market flexibility and public administration streamlining. France's history of strikes and protests complicates enacting such reforms. In 2010, protests erupted over the government's decision to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62. Despite the unpopularity of the initiative, Sarkozy's government may not pursue further structural reforms due to his low public standing. Sarkozy focused on boosting France's international profile through assertive foreign policy, earning praise for his handling of the EU presidency in 2008 and diplomatic efforts at the U.N. France's history of protests complicates enacting economic reforms. France, led by Sarkozy, played a key role in gaining international approval for military action in Libya and is leading ongoing operations there. France also holds the chairmanship of the G8 and G20 in 2011. The country has a history of religious violence, with conflicts in the 16th century and efforts to separate religion and politics in the 20th century. The 1905 law in France established la\u00efcit\u00e9 as a principle of French life, aiming to balance religious freedom and public order. It prohibits the wearing of religious symbols in public schools and bans full-face veils in public, causing controversy and tensions with some Muslims. The French government passed a law in 2010 banning the wearing of face-covering garments in public, including the burqa and niqab, to address religious militancy. Supporters believed it would reduce tensions, while critics warned it could alienate Muslims in society. The ban officially took effect in April 2011. The French government passed a law in 2010 banning face-covering garments like the burqa and niqab in public. The ban imposes fines and prison time for wearing or forcing someone to wear such coverings. Supporters cite human dignity, equality, and public safety, while critics argue it alienates Muslims and infringes on religious freedom. Public opinion polls show strong support for the ban. Critics of the French veil ban argue that it stigmatizes Muslims and is more about political gain for President Sarkozy. Only a small minority of French Muslims wear the full face veil for religious reasons. Sarkozy has a history of controversial remarks towards the Muslim community. Since becoming president, Sarkozy has emphasized the need for foreign descent individuals to respect French laws and cultural norms. His efforts to address integration issues have faced criticism from Muslims and immigrant rights advocates, sparking debate in France. Sarkozy's dismissal of his diversity advisor in 2011 and the launch of a national identity debate in 2009 have further fueled discussions on the role of Muslims in French society. In 2009, Sarkozy launched a national identity debate in France to address what it means to be French in the 21st century. Critics argue that the initiative fueled tensions between Muslims and \"native\" French, with accusations of using nationalist sentiment for political gain. A follow-up convention on Islam and La\u00efcit\u00e9 in 2011 faced similar criticism, with Sarkozy's former diversity advisor alleging involvement of \"neo-Nazis.\" France, like the United States, sees itself as having a special role in the world. France's role in the world stems from the Revolution of 1789, which led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the spread of democratic institutions across Europe. The cultural achievements of France have also contributed to its influence. French influence has been significant since the Revolution, with the belief in a \"civilizing mission\" still present today. The French government emphasizes human rights and democracy globally, with officials actively promoting French values. France's rank and influence in the world are crucial to its national identity. France's rank and influence in the world are important to French policymakers, with aspects like membership on the U.N. Security Council, close relations with former colonies, and possession of nuclear weapons shaping its self-identity in international affairs. Some contest France's values, as seen in disputes with colonies like Algeria and Morocco. Multilateralism is crucial for all 27 EU members, reflecting a painstakingly built entity over fifty years. Europeans view international institutions as crucial for legitimizing governmental policies and promoting political and economic stability. The EU and the U.N. are seen as promoting cooperation over confrontation in global affairs, with France playing a key role due to its permanent seat and veto power in the U.N. Security Council. French support is essential for important EU policies. French support is crucial for EU policies as French officials hold key roles in European institutions. Sarkozy emphasizes multilateralism and has called for U.S. leadership in combating climate change. He also stresses the importance of U.N. backing for peacekeeping operations and NATO missions. France, along with other European allies, has pushed for addressing crises within a multilateral framework. Sarkozy has reaffirmed France's commitment to NATO by rejoining its integrated military command structure. France, along with other European allies, has consistently emphasized the importance of multilateralism and U.N. endorsement for the use of force in addressing crises. Chirac criticized the U.S. invasion of Iraq as a unilateral action that undermines collective security, stating that no one can act alone in today's world. France's stance on U.N. approval for the use of force has been unwavering, with a record of obtaining U.N. resolutions for potential or actual military interventions since 1990. France, since 1990, has obtained U.N. resolutions for military interventions in various countries, including the first Gulf War, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Congo, the Ivory Coast, Haiti, and the ongoing NATO mission in Libya. In 1999, France joined NATO allies in a war against Serbia to prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, seeking a U.N. resolution until the last minute. France has been a strong advocate for multilateralism and U.N. endorsement for the use of force in addressing crises. The EU was established in the 1950s with economic objectives of trade improvement and development post-World War II. Political goals included reconciliation between Germany and its former enemies, and stability in Europe. France played a key role in promoting political unity and economic strength within the EU, shifting from a belief in acting alone as a global power to exerting influence through the EU. French officials aim for the EU to be a catalyst for positive change in Europe. France aims for the EU to be a force for positive change in Europe and the world, while also seeking to maintain a strong position within the Union. French officials have proposed an \"inner circle\" of states, including France, Germany, and sometimes Britain, to lead EU initiatives like Economic Monetary Union and a common foreign policy. Some European governments oppose this idea, viewing it as an attempt by the three countries to dominate the EU and push smaller member states to follow their lead. French officials argue that this \"pioneer group\" can guide EU policies effectively. French officials believe in the effectiveness of a \"pioneer group\" of EU countries, including France, Germany, and Britain, to lead initiatives such as the Schengen agreement, EMU, and efforts to curb the Iranian nuclear program. However, the EU's enlargement has reduced Franco-German decision-making power and forced them to focus on managing relations with other member states. France and Germany have sometimes struggled to find common ground on EU policies, especially during economic downturns and debt crises. French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel have had disagreements on EU policies, prioritizing national interests over European unity. France's defense policy has evolved over the past 20 years under Sarkozy's leadership. President Sarkozy has focused on professionalizing France's military force into smaller, more flexible units and has pledged to maintain defense expenditures at 2% of GDP. Despite budget constraints, France is pushing for increased defense cooperation within NATO and the EU, as well as with individual countries like the UK. As of February 2011, around 9,000 French troops were deployed. As of February 2011, close to 9,000 French troops were deployed to various military operations worldwide, including NATO's ISAF mission in Afghanistan, a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, and operations in Ivory Coast and Libya. French forces were simultaneously engaged in combat in these three regions, a first since World War II. The sustainability of these commitments depends on ongoing defense reforms. The French White Paper on Defense and National Security, released in 2008, outlines a 15-year national security strategy for France. It emphasizes the need for defense reforms and enhanced cooperation within NATO, the EU, and with selected allies. The new defense policy reflects the changing global landscape where non-state actors have significant power and blurs the lines between internal and external security. This shift in resources aligns with traditional French foreign policy themes of multilateral cooperation and the importance of the European Union. The 2008 French White Paper on Defense and National Security emphasizes the need for defense reforms and enhanced cooperation within NATO, the EU, and with selected allies. It identifies global threats to France's national security and outlines a military strategy focused on intelligence, observation, and advanced technology, while maintaining the French nuclear deterrent. The 2008 French White Paper on Defense and National Security calls for significant reallocation of resources, including personnel cuts to the French armed forces. This involves a 54,000-person reduction by 2014, with resources redirected towards intelligence and technology-focused programs. The Sarkozy government has increased funding for intelligence, satellite, and space programs, established a cyber-security agency and intelligence academy, and modernized French combat units' equipment. The nuclear program remains intact, with upgrades to warheads, ballistic missiles, and a satellite monitoring system. France is reconfiguring its military bases, shifting focus from sub-Saharan Africa to the Middle East. In 2010, France handed over a base in Senegal to local authorities and opened a new base in the United Arab Emirates in 2009. The new focus is part of a broader shift in strategic interests identified in the 2008 French White Paper on Defense and National Security. France has opened a base in the Gulf, marking the first time a Western country besides the United States has established a presence in the region. Budgetary concerns have led to debates on implementing reforms, with defense expenditures frozen until 2013. The Ministry of Defense aims to save \u20ac3.5 billion over three years by selling assets and pursuing defense cooperation agreements with other European countries. France has proposed joint projects with UK, Italy, and Germany for new satellites, missiles, drones, and anti-IED technologies to increase interoperability among EU allies. France reintegrated into NATO's military command structure in 2009, becoming the fourth largest contributor of troops and a significant financial contributor. Despite domestic opposition, the French parliament approved the decision to rejoin NATO. Sarkozy's decision to rejoin NATO was approved by a vote of 329-238 on March 17, 2009. U.S. officials welcomed French reintegration as a step towards improving alliance cohesion and strengthening the European role within NATO. French doubts about NATO in the 1990s stemmed from concerns about U.S. leadership and efficacy during the Balkan conflicts. Some French officials believed the Bush Administration distanced the U.S. from NATO with its \"coalitions of the willing\" approach. France's reintegration into NATO was approved in 2009, signaling a shift towards strengthening alliance cohesion. French officials had previously opposed NATO's \"coalitions of the willing\" approach, citing concerns about U.S. leadership. Despite recognizing the limitations of EU defense efforts, France has increased engagement in NATO operations in recent years. The crises in the former Yugoslavia and post-9/11 operations in Afghanistan led to a shift in French thinking towards NATO. Former President Chirac emphasized the need for realism in a changing world and highlighted France's updated vision of NATO's role. France aims for increased influence within the alliance through full reintegration, with significant troop contributions to NATO operations in Afghanistan and Kosovo. France has almost 4,000 troops in Afghanistan and 765 in Kosovo. They have contributed significantly to NATO missions in Libya and have key roles in NATO command posts. There are differing views on France's role in determining NATO's strategic direction, with some advocating for closer consultation with Russia and a focus on core missions. Sarkozy has pushed for a strong European Security and Defense Policy, arguing it could enhance NATO. U.S. officials support France's calls for developing Europe's defense capacity as a complement to NATO. France's past policy positions may not dictate its future approach to the alliance. The 2008 White Paper on Defense and National Security emphasizes the need for stronger European cooperation in security matters, urging EU members to increase defense spending and combat capability. France has been at the forefront of efforts to build an EU security structure independent of NATO, with the EU developing a defense identity outside of NATO since 1999. The EU has developed the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) to boost civilian crisis management and police training capacity. They have launched over 20 operations in various regions and are working towards creating a rapid reaction force of 60,000 troops, including \"battle groups\" for quick deployment in crises. The EU has developed the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) to boost civilian crisis management and police training capacity. France and Germany, with some support from Britain, have sought to enhance EU decision-making bodies and a planning staff for EU military forces under CSDP. The United States initially opposed elements of this effort, particularly the proposal for a planning staff. NATO and the EU have since reached a compromise with two planning staffs, each with representation from the other organization. CSDP remains a work in progress. Several central European governments, including those that joined the EU in 2004, still rely on the United States and NATO for defense. Shrinking national defense budgets and fiscal austerity in the EU are impacting military capabilities for EU operations. The US has evolved its views on an independent European defense identity over time. The US has evolved its views on an independent European defense identity over time. American officials are increasingly optimistic about CSDP not undercutting NATO but enhancing allied contributions. France's reintegration into NATO's command structure has strengthened this view, with proposals for an \"autonomous military capacity\" within the EU endorsed by the US. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasizes the importance of a strong Europe as a critical partner to NATO and the US for security and prosperity. The stabilization of Afghanistan is a key mission for NATO and the United States, with a commitment to transfer security responsibility to the Afghan government by 2014. Over 132,000 allied forces are deployed to NATO's International Security Assistance Force, including almost 99,800 U.S. forces. NATO leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Afghan mission during a summit in November 2010. France, the fourth largest troop contributor to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, has almost 4,000 troops serving under ISAF command. French forces are highly regarded for their combat capabilities and willingness to engage in combat. While initially focused on combat operations, France has shifted towards training Afghan security forces and enhancing the police and judicial system. In 2010, French President Nicolas Sarkozy reaffirmed a commitment not to send additional combat forces to Afghanistan. France has also increased its development aid efforts. France has increased its development aid budget to Afghanistan and indicated a willingness to send additional non-combat military personnel for training the Afghan National Security Forces. In November 2009, France transferred its main land component from Regional Command Capital to eastern Afghanistan, with 3,000 soldiers deployed as part of Task Force Lafayette. French troops work alongside U.S. and Afghan forces in Kapisa and Surobi provinces, receiving praise from U.S. commanders. About 600 French troops have been training the Afghan National Army and Police Force. France increased its development aid budget to Afghanistan and sent additional non-combat military personnel for training the Afghan National Security Forces. They deployed combat troops to serve alongside U.S. forces in eastern Afghanistan and spearheaded the establishment of the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan (NTM-A). France also pledged additional financial aid to Afghanistan, focusing on development in eastern Afghanistan, Kabul, Kunduz, and Balkh provinces. France increased development aid to Afghanistan, focusing on health, education, agriculture, and rule of law in Kunduz and Balkh provinces. Despite some opposition in France, military engagement in Afghanistan is seen as effective. Critics argue for more civilian development efforts. France emphasizes a clear division between civilian and military roles in overseas deployments. France's military forces are trained for combat and stabilization operations, with a focus on civilian development and capacity building efforts in Afghanistan. President Sarkozy has taken a leading role in military operations in Libya and political deliberations. France, along with the UK, supported the use of force to protect Libyan civilians and sponsored U.N. Security Council Resolutions. France played a leading role in military operations in Libya, supporting the use of force to protect civilians and sponsoring U.N. Security Council Resolutions. French fighter jets were the first to launch attacks on Libyan ground forces, and they have been heavily involved in establishing and maintaining a no-fly zone over Libyan territory. NATO took over command and control of military operations in Libya after just over a week of coalition air operations under U.S. command. France initially resisted transferring the mission to NATO command in Libya due to concerns about western motives and public perception. They emphasized the importance of maintaining control over ongoing military operations to protect civilians from attacks by the Gaddafi regime. French officials stress Arab endorsement and involvement in military operations and diplomatic efforts in Libya. As of April 5, 2011, 14 NATO allies and three partner countries contribute 195 fighter jets and 18 naval vessels. French assets include 20 combat aircraft and the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with 26 aircraft. Four French frigates are also present off the Libyan coast. Despite alliance unity, initial planning had challenges. During the mission in Libya, France faced discord within Europe and NATO over the flexibility of NATO forces to protect civilians. French officials wanted to strike ground forces threatening civilians, while Turkey opposed targeting ground forces. Tensions resurfaced as French and British officials called for more allies to join and criticized countries in Operation Unified Protector for operational restrictions on their forces. President Sarkozy's decision to lead international efforts in Libya was influenced by domestic political considerations, as he sought to boost his public approval ratings ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Despite enjoying support from the French public for his handling of the situation, a prolonged military mission with no resolution could harm his political prospects. The perception that his government failed to support pro-democratic forces in Tunisia and Egypt may have also driven Sarkozy to take a proactive stance against the Qadhafi regime. Sarkozy's proactive stance against the Qadhafi regime was influenced by his previous underestimation of the Tunisian crisis and his desire to boost public approval ratings before the 2012 presidential election. France, along with Britain and Germany, has been part of the EU-3 leading efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program. France and the P5+1 have been instrumental in pushing for U.N. sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. France and the EU-3, including President Sarkozy, have been actively involved in imposing stringent U.N. sanctions against Iran, including bans on new investments in Iranian oil and gas industries, relationships with Iranian financial institutions, insurance of Iranian government institutions, and asset freezes of Iranian companies and individuals. President Sarkozy is known for taking a tough stance on Iran compared to other European leaders. French officials, led by President Sarkozy, have been actively imposing stringent U.N. sanctions against Iran, advocating for autonomous EU sanctions if necessary. They have pressured French and European companies to cease business with Iran, with measures such as ending export credit guarantees and influencing companies like Total to withdraw from projects in Iran. While supporting U.S. diplomatic engagement with Iran, French officials have also urged the U.S. to react more firmly to Iran's rejection of international overtures. French officials, led by President Sarkozy, have actively imposed stringent U.N. sanctions against Iran and advocated for autonomous EU sanctions. They pressured companies to cease business with Iran and urged the U.S. to react more firmly to Iran's rejection of international overtures. France has a strong history of combating terrorism with a centralized law enforcement system and extensive intelligence network. Various terrorist groups have targeted France, leading to a more forceful law enforcement policy against Muslim extremists in recent years. The French government's enforcement policy against Muslim extremists strengthened after the 1995 Paris subway bombing by Algerian militants. Al Qaeda has targeted French interests, with AQIM claiming responsibility for attacks. France considers Al Qaeda its greatest terrorist threat and has intensified efforts against them. France has been adept at dismantling and prosecuting terrorist networks since 1986 when a special law was created to respond to terrorism. Special judicial and police authorities oversee efforts to find and arrest terrorists, with anti-terror magistrates having greater authority to order wiretaps and surveillance. The French military is also being modified to be more effective in counter-terror efforts at home and abroad. France has a strong central authority that constrains civil liberties in response to real or perceived threats, with increased surveillance measures since the 1995 subway bombing. The government has enhanced its ability to ensure order through measures like Vigipirate, which allows for greater surveillance of public places. The French government has implemented Vigipirate to enhance security measures in response to terrorist threats, including increased surveillance at various locations. Coordination between the United States and France in counter-terror policy has improved since September 11, with the exchange of intelligence information on terrorist activities. In 2002, the French and U.S. governments signed an agreement allowing U.S. inspectors to join their French counterparts in inspecting sea cargo containers at the major port of Le Havre for weapons of mass destruction. The commercial ties between the two countries are extensive, with over $1 billion in transactions daily. France is the world's sixth-largest economy with a large industrial base, skilled workforce, and significant agricultural resources. France is also the second largest trading member of the EU. France is the second largest trading member of the EU and ran a $69 billion trade deficit in 2010. Total trade amounted to $1.1 trillion, with 65% of it being with other EU members. The U.S. is France's largest trading partner outside the EU, with bilateral trade in goods, services, and income receipts totaling nearly $119 billion in 2009. Major industries for trade include aerospace, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electrical machinery. France is the sixth largest market for U.S. exports of services. In 2009, France and the United States had significant foreign direct investment in each other's countries, with French-owned companies employing 760,000 workers in the U.S. and U.S.-owned companies employing 650,000 workers in France. France was the twelfth largest host country for U.S. foreign direct investment abroad, while the U.S. was a major foreign investor in France with investments valued at $85.8 billion. French companies had direct investments in the U.S. totaling $189.3 billion, making France the sixth largest investor in the U.S. France has around 650,000 workers and has implemented economic reforms to attract foreign investors. The government provides investment incentives, but still intervenes in foreign investment decisions at times, often due to union opposition or French firms' preference for European partners. French stakeholders have historically opposed foreign takeovers, and labor market regulations, including the 35-hour work week, remain in flux. Many companies have used the 35-hour work week to negotiate flexible work-hour programs with employees."
