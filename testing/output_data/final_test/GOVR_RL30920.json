Congress has made amendments to the program over the years to expand coverage, adjust retirement age, provide cost-of-living adjustments, and address solvency concerns. This report tracks the key decisions impacting the Social Security program, focusing on amendments to Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI). The Social Security Act of 1935 established a national old-age benefits program, providing monthly pensions for insured workers aged 65 or older. It included a payroll tax on employees and employers, payable on earnings up to $3,000 each year. The act also provided for federal-state unemployment compensation. The Social Security Act of 1935 established a national old-age benefits program funded by employer payroll taxes. It also provided for federal-state unemployment compensation and grants to states for assistance payments to the needy. Prominent Republicans in Congress tried to remove the old-age pension system, arguing for a charity-based approach instead. Minority members expressed concerns about the constitutionality and economic burden of the payroll tax for businesses. The Ways and Means Committee's report to the House criticized the old-age benefits program in the Social Security Act, arguing it would compete with private insurance and harm existing retirement systems. Despite some opposition, the majority of Republicans supported the bill, while Democrats generally backed the proposed benefits program. Congressional debate on the bill lasted from April 11 to April 19, 1935, with approximately 50 amendments offered but none passed. On April 18, 1935, Representative Monaghan proposed an amendment for a more generous social insurance system, known as the Townsend plan, which called for a $200-a-month pension for individuals 60 years and older, funded by a 2% tax. Several significant votes were taken, including one on final passage of the bill. Representative Monaghan proposed a pension plan for individuals 60 years and older, financed by a 2% tax on financial transactions. Another amendment by Representative Lundeen called for social insurance for all workers and farmers over 18, offering higher benefits tied to the cost of living. Lundeen's plan was approved by the House Labor Committee. The Lundeen proposal aimed to extend a more generous social insurance program to workers and farmers unable to work due to various reasons, funded by taxes on higher incomes. Despite a division vote of 52 in favor and 204 opposed, an amendment by Representative Connery was rejected. Representative Treadway later proposed to remove the old-age benefit provisions from the bill, citing opposition to these benefits and the taxing provisions of Title VIII. Representative Treadway opposed the old-age benefits provision and taxing provisions of Title VIII, deeming them unconstitutional and burdensome on industry. He argued that adding a payroll tax would lead to more unemployment and uncertainty. Representative Jenkins supported Treadway's amendment, criticizing the mandatory 3% contribution from workers for old-age benefits and describing it as a financial burden on people already struggling with debts and taxes. Representative Treadway opposed the old-age benefits and unemployment insurance provisions in H.R. 7260, arguing they were not emergency measures and would hinder economic recovery. He objected to levying taxes on both employers and employees, describing the system as burdensome. The Treadway amendment was defeated by a 49-125 vote on April 19, 1935. On April 19, 1935, Representative Treadway strongly opposed the Social Security bill, criticizing the lack of business interest in protecting itself before Congress. The bill passed in the House by a vote of 372 to 33. In the Senate, there were major votes on different proposals, including amendments to the bill and final passage. Senator Long also offered an amendment to modify the old-age assistance program and remove the payroll tax provisions on June 17, 1935. Senator Long recommended replacing the payroll tax with a state tax on wealth or property, but his amendment was rejected. Senator Clark proposed an amendment to exempt employees with private pension systems from the old-age benefits system, citing benefits such as more liberal annuities and increased investment reserves. The Administration opposed an amendment to exempt employees with private pension systems from old-age benefits, arguing it didn't guarantee true retirement income. Critics said it discouraged hiring older men. Despite rejection by committees, the amendment passed in the Senate. Senator Hastings later motioned to remove old-age benefits provisions from the bill, calling it a forced annuity system. Senator Hastings's amendment to remove old-age benefits provisions from the bill was rejected by a vote of 15 (12-R, 3-D) to 63 (7-R, 54-D, 2-I). Senator George (D-GA) then proposed an amendment to promote industrial pensions as an alternative to Titles II and VIII, allowing employers to manage their own plans. The amendment for a uniform schedule of benefits nationwide, including disability and survivor benefits, along with old-age and unemployment benefits, was defeated by voice vote. The Senate passed the bill on June 19, 1935, with a vote of 77 to 6. The House rejected the Clark amendment related to employees under private pension plans on July 17, 1935. On July 17, 1935, the House rejected the Clark amendment related to employees under private pension plans. The Senate then insisted on keeping the Clark amendment and requested a further conference. The conference report was approved by the House and the Senate, leading to the signing of H.R. 6635, the Social Security Amendments of 1939, into law on August 10, 1939. Congress mandated the Social Security Board to study and recommend effective methods for providing economic security through social insurance. In May 1937, an advisory council was appointed to work with the Social Security Board on amending the Social Security Act. Recommendations were made by both the board and the council, with President Roosevelt sending the board's recommendations to Congress in January 1939. The 1939 amendments extended benefits to dependents and survivors of workers covered by Social Security. The 1939 amendments to the Social Security Act extended benefits to dependents and survivors of covered workers. This included an aged wife, a child under 16 (under 18 if attending school), a widowed mother caring for an eligible child, an aged widow, and a dependent aged parent if there were no eligible widow or child. Widows would receive 75% of the worker's primary insurance amount, while other dependents would receive 50%. Monthly benefits started on January 1, 1940, and were based on average monthly wages. Congress also increased the tax rate to 2% in 1943-1945 and allowed OASI beneficiaries to earn up to $14.99 monthly. No benefits were paid if the recipient earned $15 or more in a covered month. The 1939 amendments to the Social Security Act extended benefits to dependents and survivors of covered workers. This included an aged wife, a child under 16 (under 18 if attending school), a widowed mother caring for an eligible child, an aged widow, and a dependent aged parent if there were no eligible widow or child. Widows would receive 75% of the worker's primary insurance amount, while other dependents would receive 50%. Monthly benefits started on January 1, 1940, and were based on average monthly wages. Congress also increased the tax rate to 2% in 1943-1945 and allowed OASI beneficiaries to earn up to $14.99 monthly. No benefits were paid if the recipient earned $15 or more in a covered month. The system was renamed Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and the old-age reserve account was changed to a trust fund managed by a board of trustees. The proposed pension plan by Representative Townsend in 1935 aimed to address unemployment and restore prosperity by giving elderly people purchasing power. To be eligible for a $200 monthly pension, individuals over 60 had to give up their jobs, potentially opening up 4 million jobs for middle-aged and younger individuals. The plan would have been funded by a 2% tax on transactions, with the President having the authority to adjust the tax rate. Representative Sabath criticized the Townsend bill, calling it unfeasible and unnecessary. Many others also opposed the bill, preferring to focus on the Social Security program for elderly care. Despite concerns from House members, the Townsend movement received significant support through letters. The House rejected the Townsend plan bill, H.R. 6466, on June 1, 1939, with a vote of 97 to 302. The presentation of the Townsend bill overshadowed the liberalized benefits in H.R. 6635, leading many to vote against it. The House then considered H.R. 6635 on June 6, 1939, which had general support from the Ways and Means Committee. The minority in the Means Committee supported improvements in the Social Security bill despite its flaws. Amendments to extend coverage to various worker groups were proposed but rejected. On June 9 and 10, 1939, amendments related to Social Security were proposed and rejected in the House. Representative Carlson's amendment to exclude non-citizens from coverage was opposed, and a motion to recommit H.R. 6635 was also rejected. The House ultimately passed H.R. 6635 on June 10, 1939. On July 13, 1939, Senator Downey criticized the Social Security Act, stating that H.R. 6635 would provide lower benefits compared to government subsidies. A motion to recommit the bill for further study was rejected. Senator Reynolds proposed an amendment to exclude non-U.S. citizens from Social Security coverage, which was not passed. The Senate passed H.R. 6635 on July 13, 1939, with a vote of 57 to 8. The Revenue Act of 1942, signed by President Franklin Roosevelt, froze the payroll tax rate for old-age and survivors benefits in 1943. The Social Security payroll tax rate increase was postponed seven times between 1942 and 1947, eventually rising to 1.5% in 1950. The payroll tax rate for old-age and survivors benefits was frozen at 1% by P.L. 211 in 1943, instead of increasing to 2%. President Roosevelt signed the joint resolution on December 22, 1943, to delay the tax increase until March 1, 1944. The Revenue Act of 1943, P.L. 235, vetoed by Roosevelt on February 22, 1944, deferred the tax increase to 1945 and allowed the use of general revenues if needed. The Murray-Vandenberg general revenue provision was repealed in 1950 when the tax rate was increased under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act of 1945. President Roosevelt signed the act on December 16, 1944, freezing the payroll tax rate at 1% until 1946 and gradually increasing it to 3% thereafter. The Revenue Act of 1945 deferred tax rate increases until 1947, with subsequent amendments delaying further increases until 1950. Supporters argued that Social Security reserves were sufficient to meet benefit payments without raising payroll taxes. The Administration warned that failing to increase rates could jeopardize future benefits and proposed expanded Social Security for economic security during and after the war. Opponents argued that the tax increase was crucial for the OASI trust fund's long-term stability. The Administration wanted a tax increase to retire wartime debt, with bipartisan support for postponing payroll tax increases. Legislation in 1948 clarified who was considered an employee for Social Security coverage. Regulations from 1936 provided some guidance on the terms employee and employer. The regulations from 1936 and subsequent rulings clarified the definition of employee and employer, emphasizing factors like control and the right to discharge. Court cases and legislation further defined the boundaries of the employee-employer relationship, including a case in 1946 where newspaper vendors were ruled as employees. Legislation in 1948 proposed treating newspaper and magazine vendors as independent contractors. In 1948, Congress proposed treating newspaper and magazine vendors as independent contractors to exclude them from Social Security coverage. H.J.Res. 296 was introduced to maintain this status quo and prevent new federal regulations defining employees under common-law rules. In 1948, H.J.Res. 296 and H.R. 5052 were vetoed by President Truman, but Congress overrode both vetoes. Truman argued that Social Security should cover independent contractors to ensure national security and welfare. The controversy over who should be covered under Social Security was highlighted by the actions taken on H.R. 5052. Representative Gearhart argued for the exclusion of newspaper and magazine vendors from Social Security coverage under H.R. 5052, stating that they were originally considered independent contractors but were later deemed employees by court decisions. This change subjected them to payroll taxes despite their earnings being profits from their own business operations. The House passed H.R. 5052 on March 4, 1948, excluding magazine vendors from Social Security coverage. The Senate also passed the bill on March 23, 1948. President Truman vetoed the bill on April 6, 1948, citing concerns about vendors working under independent contractor status. President Truman vetoed H.R. 5052 on June 6, 1948, stating that news vendors should continue to receive Social Security benefits as independent contractors until broader coverage is provided. He emphasized the importance of protecting the Social Security program against piecemeal attacks. President Truman's veto of H.R. 5052 was overridden by the House and Senate in April 1948. Additionally, President Truman's veto of H.J.Res. 296 was overridden in June 1948. H.R. 6000, the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950, was signed into law by President Truman on August 28, 1950, expanding coverage to approximately 10 million more individuals. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 expanded coverage to roughly 10 million additional individuals, including various groups of workers and their dependents. Benefits were increased by 77%, the wage base was raised, and employer and employee taxes were gradually increased. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 expanded coverage to 10 million more individuals, increased benefits by 77%, raised the wage base, and gradually increased employer and employee taxes. H.R. 6000, reported on August 22, 1949, included disability protection for Social Security and public assistance recipients, extended coverage to farm and domestic workers, and did not include President Truman's recommendations for health insurance or lowering the OASI eligibility age to 60 for women. The minority report from all 10 Republicans on the committee opposed the disability insurance provision in H.R. 6000, stating that aid to the disabled should be limited to charity aid. Despite opposition, a closed rule was granted, barring floor amendments to the bill. Representative Sabath offered a resolution for four days of debate with only the Committee on Ways and Means having the right to offer amendments. The Ways and Means Committee spent six months considering the bill, hearing from 250 witnesses. A closed rule was approved, allowing only the Committee to offer amendments. The House voted in favor of the closed rule, with some members opposing it, stating that it undermined the rights of other House members. Representative Mason moved to recommit the bill and offered a substitute bill. The bill proposed by Representative Kean in 1949 recommended changes to the Social Security system, including a wage base of $3,000, expanded coverage for domestic workers, and exemptions for teachers, firemen, and policemen with their own pension systems. The motion to recommit was defeated, and H.R. 6000 was passed in the House. The Senate did not consider H.R. 6000 until 1950, where the Finance Committee made amendments after extensive hearings. The Finance Committee made amendments to H.R. 6000 in 1950 to strengthen the OASI system as the primary method of providing security to retired persons and survivors. The bill did not include disability insurance or federal grants for the permanently and totally disabled. Debate began in the Senate on June 12, 1950, with Republicans indicating support for the bill but favoring a study on the OASI and old-age assistance programs. The Finance Committee made amendments to H.R. 6000 in 1950 to strengthen the OASI system by providing subsistence-level pensions for all elderly persons at age 65, financed from current revenues. Senator Myers' amendments for a disability insurance program and increasing the OASI wage base were rejected. Senator Long introduced an amendment for federal grants to States for needy disabled persons. The Senate rejected an amendment for federal grants to States for needy disabled persons by a close vote. Senator George's amendment to increase the basic wage base was approved by voice vote. The Senate also adopted a resolution for a study on a universal old-age pension system. H.R. 6000 was passed with conferees dropping the disability insurance proposal but keeping the public assistance program for the permanently and totally disabled. Representative Byrnes moved to recommit the conference report to prevent the removal of a Senate floor amendment. The House passed the conference report on H.R. 7800, the Social Security Amendments of 1952, increasing OASI benefits and allowing recipients to earn more without losing benefits. President Truman signed the bill into law on July 18, 1952. The Social Security Amendments of 1952 included wage credits for military service and a disability \"freeze\" to preserve benefits for disabled workers. The House debated a provision to exclude periods of disability when calculating eligibility for benefits and average earnings. The Social Security Amendments of 1952 included wage credits for military service and a disability \"freeze\" to preserve benefits for disabled workers. Medical examinations for disability determinations were to be paid for by the Federal Security Agency (FSA), leading to opposition from the American Medical Association (AMA). The bill, H.R. 7800, faced challenges in passing due to the disability provision, with Republicans voting against it. Democratic leaders later brought a revised version of the bill to the floor, empowering the FSA to make disability determinations. The revised bill empowered the FSA to make disability determinations but omitted specific instructions. Representative Reed criticized the bill, stating it gave more power for socialized medicine. The bill was approved by a majority on June 17, 1952, but the Senate Finance Committee later dropped the disability freeze provision. The Senate Finance Committee dropped the disability freeze provision from H.R. 7800 on June 26, 1952. The conferees retained the provision in principle but made it inoperative until Congress took further action. The intent was to allow for tentative agreements with states for administration of the provision. The conferees shifted responsibility for determining disability from the FSA to state agencies. The Federal Security administrator could overturn a state agency's ruling of disability but not the opposite. President Eisenhower signed the Social Security Amendments of 1954, expanding coverage to self-employed individuals like farmers and professionals. The Social Security Amendments of 1954 expanded coverage to self-employed individuals such as farmers, engineers, architects, accountants, and funeral directors. It also extended coverage to federal employees not under government pension plans, farm and domestic service workers, ministers, and certain state and local government employees. The bill increased the OASI tax wage base to $4,200 and raised the tax rate for employers and employees to 3.5% in 1970 and 4.0% in 1975. OASI benefits were raised by roughly 15%, with the maximum individual benefit increasing from $85 to $98.50 a month. Future retirees saw a 27% increase in benefits, with the maximum benefit rising to $108.50 a month. The Social Security Amendments of 1954 increased benefits by roughly 27%, raising the maximum benefit from $85 to $108.50 a month. It also implemented the disability freeze, allowed recipients to earn up to $1,200 a year without deductions, eliminated the earnings test for individuals aged 72 or older, and adjusted wage determinations for benefit computation. Representative Smith and other farm area Democrats objected to the closed rule for H.R. 9366 due to the inclusion of farmer coverage in the bill. On June 1, 1954, the closed rule for H.R. 9366 was adopted by the House, allowing amendments to designate classifications of persons for coverage. The bill included extending coverage to self-employed professionals except doctors, and passed with a vote of 356 to 8. The Finance Committee's version also covered farm and domestic service workers, ministers, and state/local government employees. The amendments to H.R. 9366 included coverage for various workers and professionals, increased the earnings test threshold, reduced the age for the earnings test, and raised the lump-sum death benefit. Senator Long's amendment required a study on increasing minimum benefits under the Social Security program. Several amendments were adopted and rejected during the Senate debate. The Senate debated various amendments to H.R. 9366, including proposals to change Social Security eligibility age, coverage for farm workers, and widow's benefits. Senator Lehman's amendment to extend coverage and increase benefits was withdrawn. The Senate ultimately passed H.R. 9366, which included mandatory coverage for self-employed farmers and professionals. The Social Security Amendments of 1956 expanded coverage to self-employed farmers, architects, engineers, and funeral directors, excluding lawyers and medical professionals. Benefits were provided for disabled workers aged 50 to 64, dependent children of deceased or retired insured workers, and female workers and wives at age 62 with reduced benefits. The Social Security Amendments of 1956 expanded coverage to self-employed professionals, increased the tax rate to finance disability benefits, and created a separate Disability Insurance trust fund. Major provisions included benefits for disabled persons aged 50 or older and reduced the age for women to receive benefits to 62. H.R. 7225 was passed by the House on July 18, 1955, under suspension of the rules, with a two-thirds vote required for passage. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare opposed reducing the retirement age to 62 for women and providing disability benefits. Spokesmen argued that disability insurance was necessary based on union experience and federal studies dating back to 1937. In 1956, the Senate Finance Committee reported H.R. 7225, eliminating the Disability Insurance program and tax increase for it. Senator George reinstated the program with a separate trust fund. Senator Kerr's amendment allowed women to receive benefits at age 62 at reduced rates. The Senate passed H.R. 7225 on July 17, 1956, with bipartisan support. On July 17, 1956, the Senate passed H.R. 7225 by a vote of 90 to 0. President Eisenhower signed H.R. 13549, the Social Security Amendments of 1958, on August 28, 1958. The amendments increased recipients' benefits, raised maximum family benefits, raised the wage base, and increased the tax rate for employers, employees, and the self-employed. The amendments also provided benefits to dependents of workers receiving disability benefits and allowed aged dependent parents of insured deceased workers to receive survivors' benefits. The controversy over H.R. 13549 focused on public assistance programs, with little debate on the proposed OASDI provisions. Representative Reed stated the bill would enhance Social Security's actuarial soundness. The House passed H.R. 13549 on July 31, 1958, with overwhelming support. Senator Yarborough later proposed an amendment to increase benefits by 10%, citing higher public assistance payments in some states. Supporters argued it would combat benefit erosion from inflation, while opponents raised concerns about recipients with other sources of income. Senator Yarborough's amendment to increase Social Security benefits by 10% was rejected in a vote. Subsequent amendments by Senators Kennedy, Morse, and Humphrey to further increase benefits and provide health insurance were also rejected. On August 16, 1958, Senator Kennedy proposed an amendment to remove the dollar ceiling on the lump-sum death benefit and restore the 3-to-1 ratio between the death benefit and the regular monthly benefit, but it was rejected. Senator Revercomb also proposed an amendment for full Social Security retirement benefits at age 62, which was also rejected. The Senate passed H.R. 13549 on August 16, 1958, and the House agreed to the Senate amendments on August 19, 1958. President Eisenhower signed H.R. 12580, the Social Security Amendments of 1960, on September 13, 1960, with health care for the aged being a primary issue. The debate centered on whether the federal government should take on a major role in the health care of the elderly. The 1960 amendments expanded federal funding for old-age assistance programs, allowing states to improve medical care services for elderly recipients. The \"Kerr-Mills\" legislation established a voluntary medical assistance program for individuals aged 65 and older with insufficient income and resources for medical expenses. Disability benefits were also made available to workers under 50, along with new OASDI provisions. The 1960 amendments expanded federal funding for old-age assistance programs, allowing states to improve medical care services for elderly recipients. Disability benefits were made available to workers under 50, with new OASDI provisions including a new earnings test and liberalized requirements for fully insured status. H.R. 12580 also included two medical care provisions for elderly people, providing additional funding for state medical care programs and establishing a new federal-state program. The Ways and Means Committee rejected H.R. 4700, which would have provided insurance for medical services for OASDI recipients. Proponents of H.R. 12580 argued that it offered medical assistance for all aged persons in states with a medical assistance program. Representative Thompson criticized H.R. 12580, stating that it would deny individuals the opportunity to contribute to their old-age health insurance coverage while employed. The House passed H.R. 12580 on June 23, 1960, by a vote of 381 to 23. The Senate amended Title I of the Social Security Act to provide medical services for aged persons. Senator Javits proposed federal matching grants for states to provide healthcare to needy individuals aged 65 or older, but the amendment was rejected. Senator Anderson also offered an amendment related to Social Security. On August 20, 1960, Senator Anderson proposed using Social Security and public assistance for health care for the elderly, but the amendment was rejected on August 23, 1960. The Senate passed a bill allowing men to retire at 62 with reduced benefits. The medical care provisions in the bill became known as the Kerr-Mills program. The House agreed to the bill on August 26, 1960. The Social Security Amendments of 1961, signed into law by President Kennedy on June 30, 1961, raised the minimum benefit to $40 per month and allowed men to claim retired worker's benefits at the age of 62. The Social Security Amendments of 1961 increased benefits for surviving aged widows, widowers, and dependent parents, adjusted the earnings test thresholds, and raised employer and employee tax rates. In the House, the main point of contention was lowering the eligibility age for men from 65 to 62. Several Republicans opposed the provision to lower the eligibility age for men to 62, citing concerns about \"compulsory retirement\" and the impact on older workers. Representative Curtis made a motion to recommit the bill and remove the age provision, but it was rejected. The House passed the bill on April 20, 1961, with a vote of 400 to 14. On June 26, 1961, the Senate debated amendments to increase the earnings test limit for OASDI. Senator Cotton's amendment to raise the limit to $1,800 a year was opposed by Senator Kerr, who argued it lacked funding. Senator Hartke offered a substitute amendment with a lower limit of $1,700, which was passed. Provisions to finance the change were agreed upon, and another amendment to broaden the definition of disability was rejected. The Senate passed H.R. 6027 with a vote of 90 to 14. The Senate passed H.R. 6027 on June 26, 1961, with a vote of 90 to 14. The proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964 included various provisions such as a 5% benefit increase, extension of child benefits, early retirement for widows at age 60, and coverage extension to previously excluded groups. The conference committee adjourned on October 3, 1964, without reaching an agreement. The proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964, passed by the Senate, included a hospital insurance program, increased benefits, raised the earnings base, liberalized the earnings test, changed eligibility requirements for the blind, and allowed religious groups to reject Social Security coverage. H.R. 11865 was passed by the House on July 29, 1964, and approved by the Finance Committee on August 21, 1964. Amendments to create a hospital insurance program were rejected. The Senate passed the Social Security Amendments of 1964 which included a hospital insurance program. Senator Gore's amendment to increase benefits and liberalize the earnings test was approved. However, the conference committee could not reach an agreement on including hospital insurance provisions. The House, by a 3 to 2 vote, rejected certain provisions in the Social Security Amendments of 1965. President Lyndon Johnson signed H.R. 6675 into law on July 30, 1965, establishing Medicare. Previous attempts at federally operated health insurance programs were made in 1935 and 1945 but faced opposition. The 1965 amendments finally established Medicare as a two-part health insurance program under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 established Medicare as a two-part health insurance program. Part A, financed by a separate payroll tax, covers hospitalization and related care for recipients of Social Security and railroad retirement programs aged 65 or older. Part B, a voluntary plan financed through monthly premiums and federal payments, helps pay doctor bills and related services for all persons aged 65 or older. Other amendments included a 7% increase in OASDI benefits, extended self-employment coverage to doctors, and allowed widows to receive reduced benefits at age 60. The 1965 amendments to the Social Security Act allowed widows to receive reduced benefits at age 60, provided benefits to divorced wives and widows under certain conditions, increased the earnings test amount, and expanded eligibility for disability benefits. Additionally, the amendments increased the payroll tax rate, reduced the number of quarters of work necessary for insured status for older individuals, and established a new federal-state medical assistance program. The new Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, replaced the Kerr-Mills law for medical assistance for the aged. It was available to those receiving public assistance and those unable to meet their medical costs. The 1964 congressional elections brought in new Medicare supporters, leading to progress in passing the federal hospital insurance program. The Ways and Means Committee began discussing H.R. 1, a bill for a social insurance program for the aged, on January 27, 1965. House debate focused on Medicare, with supporters calling it overdue and critics concerned about its compulsory nature and funding. Republicans proposed a voluntary health plan instead. On April 8, 1965, the House rejected a motion to change the bill. H.R. 6675 was sent to the Ways and Means Committee to replace H.R. 7057, which proposed a voluntary healthcare financing system. The motion to recommit was rejected, and H.R. 6675 was passed by the House on April 8, 1965. The Finance Committee approved the bill on June 30, 1965. Senator Ribicoff's amendment to remove time limits on hospital stays was rejected on July 7 and 8, 1965. Senator Ribicoff's (D-CT) proposed amendment to remove time limits on hospital stays under Medicare was rejected by a vote of 39 (13-R, 26-D) to 43 (12-R, 31-D). Senator Miller's (R-IA) amendment for a 3% increase in Social Security pensions based on the \"retail\" price index was also rejected. Senator Prouty's (R-VT) amendment for benefit increases based on income brackets was rejected, as well as Senator Curtis's (R-NE) amendment for Medicare patient deductibles based on ability to pay. However, Senator Byrd's (D-WV) amendment to lower the age for Social Security benefits to 60 was approved by voice vote on July 7, 1965. On July 8 and 9, 1965, several amendments related to Medicare were passed, including raising the minimum age for benefits to 60, prohibiting federal payments to hospitals not meeting standards, liberalizing the definition of blindness for Social Security, eliminating time limits on hospital care, and raising payroll taxes to finance benefits. On July 9, 1965, Senator Curtis (R-NE) offered amendments related to Medicare, Parts A and B, but they were rejected by the Senate. H.R. 6675, including Medicare provisions, was passed by the Senate on July 9, 1965, and later adopted by the House on July 27, 1965. H.R. 12752, signed by President Johnson on March 15, 1966, raised income taxes to help pay for the Vietnam War and extended OASI benefits to persons over the age of 71. The bill did not contain any Social Security provisions, but an amendment was proposed to extend a minimum Social Security payment of $44 a month to all persons aged 70 or older who were not eligible for benefits. The Prouty amendment, passed in March 1966, extended a minimum Social Security payment of $35 a month to persons aged 70 or older who were not eligible for benefits. The Tax Adjustment Act of 1966 was also passed during this time. President Johnson signed H.R. 12080, the Social Security Amendments of 1967, on January 2, 1968. The amendments included a 13% increase in benefits, raised the taxable wage base, increased the payroll tax rate, raised the minimum benefit, adjusted the earnings test limit, added benefits for disabled widows and widowers, and clarified the definition of disability. President Johnson signed H.R. 12080, the Social Security Amendments of 1967, on January 2, 1968. The amendments included a 13% increase in benefits, raised the taxable wage base, increased the payroll tax rate, raised the minimum benefit, adjusted the earnings test limit, added benefits for disabled widows and widowers, and clarified the definition of disability. H.R. 12080 was introduced in the House on February 20, 1967, and passed on August 17, 1967, with most of the Administration's proposals, including raising the earnings test limit to $1,680. On November 14, 1967, the Senate Finance Committee reported a bill with OASDI provisions recommended by the Administration. The Senate bill proposed a 15% Social Security increase, higher than the House bill's 12.5%. Senator Prouty's amendment to fund the benefits from general revenues was rejected. Senator Metcalf's amendment to remove a stricter disability definition was approved. Senator Williams proposed a payroll tax increase in January 1968. The Senate Finance Committee recommended a payroll tax increase in January 1968, which was defeated in a vote. Various amendments were proposed and voted on, including one to raise the earnings test limit. The Senate passed H.R. 12080 with a roll call vote, and the conference report was filed in December 1967. The Tax Reform Act of 1969, signed by President Nixon on December 30, 1969, included a 15% increase in Social Security benefits starting in January 1970. The House and Senate adopted the conference report in December 1967, with the House voting 390 to 3 and the Senate voting 62 to 14. Senator Long's amendment to raise basic Social Security benefits by 15% was passed by a vote of 73 to 14. On December 5, 1969, the Senate passed an amendment to increase Social Security benefits by 15%, effective January 1, 1970, with a vote of 69 to 22. Senator Williams offered a substitute amendment for a 10% increase, which was rejected. The House adopted the conference report on December 22, 1969. On December 22, 1969, the Tax Reform Act, H.R. 13270, was adopted by the House and Senate. President Nixon signed the act on March 17, 1971, which included a 10% increase in OASDI benefits, raised the minimum benefit, increased the taxable wage base, and raised the OASDI tax rates. Additionally, a comprehensive Social Security bill (H.R. 17550) was passed by the House in 1970. H.R. 17550, a Social Security bill, was passed by the House and Senate in 1970. It increased benefits by 10%, raised the minimum monthly benefit to $100, and made changes to the taxable wage base and Medicare programs. Senator Long urged the House to act on raising Social Security benefits, but no agreement was reached in a conference. Senator Long proposed a 10% increase in Social Security benefits and a $100 minimum monthly benefit as an amendment to H.R. 4690. The Senate passed the amendment on March 12, 1971, and the House adopted the conference report on March 16, 1971, with some modifications. President Nixon signed the bill into law. President Nixon signed H.R. 15390, a bill to extend the limit on the public debt, on July 1, 1972. Congress passed a separate 20% increase in Social Security benefits, with future automatic increases tied to the consumer price index. The taxable wage base was raised to $10,800 in 1973 and $12,000 in 1974. The increase was attached to the debt limit bill for two reasons. The House passed a bill to increase the debt ceiling on June 27, 1972, and Senator Aiken proposed an amendment to increase Social Security benefits by 30% on June 29, 1972. On June 30, 1972, the Senate passed an amendment by Senator Church (D-ID) to increase Social Security benefits by 20% and make benefit increases automatic based on CPI. The Senate also passed H.R. 15390 by a vote of 78 to 3, sending it back to the House. The House sent the debt ceiling bill to a conference committee without accepting the Senate's benefit increase. On June 30, 1972, the House rejected a proposed 20% increase in Social Security benefits, with Representative Byrnes calling it \"irresponsible.\" Instead, a motion for a 10% benefit increase was also rejected. Representative Mills then proposed a 20% benefit increase with automatic cost-of-living adjustments, which was passed by the Senate. H.R. 1, the Social Security Amendments of 1972, was signed into law on October 30, 1972, by President Nixon, granting a 20% Social Security benefit increase and annual automatic cost-of-living adjustments. Congress had raised OASDI benefits three times from 1969 to 1972, with increases of 15% in 1969, 10% in 1971, and 20% in 1972. P.L. 92-336 provided for future automatic benefit increases whenever the consumer price index rose more than 3% in a year, starting in January 1975. President Nixon's Social Security recommendations became law with the passage of H.R. 1 in 1972. The 1972 amendments (H.R. 1) increased Social Security benefits for widows and widowers, raised the earnings limit, reduced the waiting period for disability benefits, extended Medicare protection to disabled recipients, and provided a special minimum benefit. OASDHI tax rate-increases were also raised for several periods. The bill also included the President's Family Assistance Plan, causing controversy over welfare reform in the Senate. The Senate approved H.R. 1 after controversy over welfare reform. The final version federalized adult public assistance programs and created the Supplemental Security Income program. Debate focused on family welfare provisions, with little discussion on OASDI and Medicare. The House passed H.R. 1 on June 22, 1971. Senator Mansfield's amendment to increase the earnings test limit was approved on September 27, 1972. Senator Percy's amendment on Department Secretary requirements was discussed on September 28, 1972. On September 28, 1972, Senator Percy's amendment requiring a review of the Social Security earnings test was accepted. On September 29, 1972, Senator Long's amendment for a federal SSI program was passed. The Finance Committee's amendment guaranteeing a minimum monthly benefit for those with 30 years of covered employment passed on the same day. Senator Byrd's amendment to lower the age for reduced Social Security benefits was also discussed. On October 17, 1972, the House and Senate adopted the conference report on H.R. 1, with significant bipartisan support. A 11% benefit increase for Social Security recipients aged 65 or older was signed into law by President Nixon on December 31, 1973, replacing a previously scheduled 5.9% increase. P.L. 93-233 increased Social Security benefits by 7% in March 1974 and by another 4% in June 1974. The taxable wage base was raised to $13,200 in January 1974. The COLA mechanism was revised to base increases on the rise in CPI from the first quarter to the next year. The House passed H.R. 11333 on November 15, 1973, with only one floor amendment allowed. The House passed H.R. 11333 on November 15, 1973, recommending an 11% Social Security benefit increase in 1974 and SSI benefit increases. The Senate Finance Committee approved a 7% benefit increase initially and a further 4% increase in June 1974. The Senate attached its Social Security amendments to H.R. 3153 instead of acting on H.R. 11333. On April 2, 1973, the House passed H.R. 3153, which made technical amendments to the Social Security Act. Senator Byrd later introduced an amendment to lower the age for women to claim a Social Security widow's benefit to 55, aiming to help widows unable to establish a new career between 55 and 60. Senator Curtis objected to the amendment as inequitable. Senator Byrd's amendment, adopted by a vote of 74 to 13, kept the age requirement at 62 for women working until retirement age. Another amendment increased the earnings test limit to $3,000 and lowered the age limit to 70. Senator Hartke's amendment for blind persons to be eligible for disability benefits after 18 months of covered employment was also accepted. The Senate passed H.R. 3153 by a vote of 66 to 8 on November 30, 1973. The Senate passed H.R. 3153 with amendments on November 30, 1973. The House appointed conferees two days before the end of the session, who then focused on revising H.R. 11333 instead. A compromise was reached on December 20, 1973, with a two-step 11% increase in benefits and other changes. The Senate passed H.R. 11333 with amendments on December 21, 1973, and the House concurred with the bill. The Social Security Amendments of 1977, H.R. 9346, was passed to address financial problems caused by inflation and recession. It aimed to reduce deficits over the next 25 and 75 years through increased payroll taxes or general fund infusions. The Social Security Amendments of 1977 aimed to address financial problems caused by inflation and recession by increasing Social Security tax rates, adjusting the taxable earnings base, and reducing expenditures. The final bill included procedures to correct a flaw in the benefit computation formula and liberalized the earnings test for recipients aged 65 or older. The Social Security Amendments of 1977 made changes for recipients aged 65 or older, eliminated the earnings test for those aged 70 or older, reduced spousal benefits for government annuitants, and liberalized benefits for divorced and widowed recipients. Legislation incorporating these changes was introduced in 1977. The House debated H.R. 9346 on October 26, 1977, regarding changes in payroll tax and Social Security coverage. An amendment was proposed to delete mandatory coverage for federal, state, local, and nonprofit employees. Representative Fisher offered a substitute to exempt federal employees and allow state and local governments and nonprofits to choose coverage. The bill also included a provision for a study on mandatory coverage. The Fisher amendment retained a provision for a study on mandatory Social Security coverage, with supporters arguing for universal coverage to be studied first. Opponents believed the committee bill allowed enough time to work out details by postponing coverage extension until 1982. The Fisher amendment also included greater increases in the Social Security tax rate and wage base to make up for revenue loss from deleting mandatory coverage provisions. The Administration and various affected groups lobbied for the Fisher amendment. The Fisher amendment, supported by the Administration and various groups, was agreed to by a vote in the House. Representative Pickle's amendment to prevent general treasury funds for Social Security was rejected. Representative Corman later offered an amendment to eliminate a provision. On October 26, 1977, Representative Corman (D-CA) proposed eliminating the minimum Social Security benefit for new recipients, citing concerns about benefits exceeding contributions. The amendment was rejected. On October 27, 1977, Representative Ketchum (R-CA) suggested gradually raising the earnings limitation for recipients over 65, with a tax rate increase to cover costs. This amendment was approved. Representative Conable (R-NY) then moved to send H.R. 9346 back to the Ways and Means Committee. Conable (R-NY) moved to recommit H.R. 9346 to the Ways and Means Committee with instructions to report out the bill with an amendment that mandated coverage of federal workers, diverted half of the HI portion of the payroll tax to OASDI in 1980, and replaced the lost HI revenues with general revenues. The recommittal motion was rejected by a vote of 57 (44-R, 13-D) to 363 (97-R, 266-D). H.R. 9346 passed the House on October 27, 1977, by a vote of 275 (40-R, 235-D) to 146 (100-R, 46-D). Preliminary hearings and markup sessions on financing and decoupling were held by the Senate Committee on Finance in the summer and fall of 1977. The Finance Committee amendments were attached to H.R. 5322, an unrelated tariff bill, to quickly present them to the Senate. Senator Long introduced an amendment to substitute the Finance Committee Social Security proposals in H.R. 5322 for the House bill, which included decoupling measures and changes to employer Social Security taxes. The amendment was accepted, making H.R. 5322 H.R. 9346 as amended. On November 3, 1977, Senator Curtis proposed an amendment to raise the tax rate above committee-recommended levels to address the deficit in the Social Security fund. Senator Nelson opposed the amendment, stating that it would disproportionately burden average workers with higher taxes. The Senate narrowly rejected the motion to table the Curtis amendment. On November 4, 1977, Senator Goldwater proposed an amendment to lower the age for the earnings test from 72 to 65, aiming to end discrimination against retirees with earned income. Senator Church offered a substitute amendment to lower the age to 70, but Senator Goldwater's motion to table it was rejected. The Senate rejected a motion to table the Church amendment by a vote of 33 to 53. They then adopted the Church substitute amendment by a vote of 59 to 28, and the Goldwater amendment as amended by the Church substitute by a vote of 79 to 4. Senator Church's amendment for semiannual COLAs when inflation is 4% or greater was adopted by a vote of 50 to 21. Senator Bayh's amendment to remove the earnings limit for blind persons collecting disability benefits was adopted by voice vote. The Senate passed H.R. 9346 by a vote of 42 to 25 on November 4, 1977. The conference agreement on the bill included higher payroll tax rates, changes to loans to trust funds, and adjustments to the earnings test limit for the elderly. Despite differences between the House and Senate versions, the conferees resolved their issues smoothly. The main controversies involved welfare programs and college tuition tax credits. The House approved the conference report on December 15, 1977, with unease due to significant tax increases. Representative Conable (R-NY) was involved in the discussions. On December 15, 1977, the Senate passed the conference report on H.R. 3236, the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980, with little controversy. President Carter signed the bill on June 9, 1980, changing the Social Security disability insurance program in significant ways. The Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 made changes to Social Security benefits, incentivized recipients to return to work, increased federal reviews of disability awards, and modified the administrative relationship between the federal government and states. Additionally, the amendments established federal standards for \"medigap\" insurance policies. The House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Social Security held public hearings and incorporated recommendations into H.R. 3236, introduced on March 27, 1979. After the Subcommittee on Social Security incorporated recommendations into H.R. 3236, the full Committee on Ways and Means reported the bill to the House on April 23, 1979. Controversy arose regarding the rules for considering the bill on the House floor, with many parties wanting to vote on provisions separately. The Rules Committee then provided a modified rule for one hour of debate on H.R. 3236, allowing only specific amendments to be considered. The House passed H.R. 3236 after a delay in floor consideration by the opposition coalition. The Ways and Means Committee and Representative Simon's amendments were agreed upon, and the bill passed with a vote of 235 to 162. The Senate Finance Committee held hearings on the bill in October 1979 and reported it to the Senate in November. Floor debate began in December, with final debate focusing on establishing a lower limit on family benefits in late January 1980. Senator Metzenbaum played a role in the discussions. Senator Metzenbaum's amendment to increase disability benefits was defeated, while Senator Bayh's amendment to exempt terminally ill applicants from the waiting period was discussed. Senator Long argued against the elimination of the waiting period, citing potential costs and lack of relevance to the bill. On January 31, 1980, the Senate passed H.R. 3236 with amendments, including a provision limiting future family benefits. The conferees combined the Senate and House limits on benefits and made modifications to the medigap provision. The House passed H.R. 3236 on May 22, 1980. On October 9, 1980, President Carter signed H.R. 7670 into law, reallocating Social Security taxes between OASI and DI Trust Funds to address financing problems caused by inflation and unemployment. This shift ensured adequate reserves in both funds through 1981. On July 21, 1980, Representative Pickle moved to pass H.R. 7670 to ensure stability of trust funds and allow Congress time for further changes. Reallocation of OASDI tax rates was emphasized as a traditional method to maintain reserve ratios. The bill was passed without a roll call vote. On September 25, 1980, H.R. 7670 was passed by unanimous consent, and on October 19, 1980, H.R. 5295 was signed by President Carter, making changes to Social Security benefits for prisoners and earnings tests. P.L. 96-473 eliminated the monthly earnings test, reducing benefits for excess earnings under the annual test. The earnings test under P.L. 96-473 applied to all recipients affected by the earnings limitation, allowing certain dependents' benefits recipients to use the monthly earnings test in the year their entitlement ended. It also provided a \"grace year\" for all recipients and made changes for the self-employed. P.L. 96-473 prohibited certain Social Security benefits for prisoners convicted of a felony, except for those in rehabilitation programs. It also excluded impairments caused by crimes or developed in prison from disability considerations. Congressional hearings were held in 1979 and 1980 regarding Social Security benefits for prisoners. The Subcommittee on Social Security held hearings on paying Social Security benefits to prisoners. Senator Long discussed amendments to the earnings test, stating the purpose was to correct inequities. H.R. 5295 was passed unanimously by the House. The Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Social Security also held hearings on the earnings test in 1980. During the spring of 1980, the subcommittee held hearings on denying Social Security benefits to prisoners. The 1981 Budget Reconciliation bill included a provision prohibiting payment of Social Security disability benefits to prisoners convicted of serious crimes. Amendments were made to the bill, specifying that it would apply only to felony crimes. The House and Senate passed the bill with unanimous consent. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, signed into law by President Reagan, included Social Security changes aimed at reducing federal expenditures. The Administration targeted benefits for elimination or reduction, arguing they were not earned. The budget proposals eliminated the minimum Social Security benefit and phased out benefits for students in postsecondary schools. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, signed by President Reagan, made changes to Social Security benefits. It eliminated or reduced benefits for students in postsecondary schools, limited lump-sum death benefits to certain spouses, and reduced benefits for those with high disability payments. Other changes included ending parents' benefits when the youngest child turns 16 and requiring workers and spouses to meet entitlement requirements throughout the month. The Ways and Means Committee added provisions to the Social Security legislation, which was considered in the budget and reconciliation processes. Both the House and Senate simultaneously reviewed the proposals, leading to the adoption of the First Concurrent Budget Resolution on May 21, 1981. The Senate included spending reductions recommended by the Finance Committee in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, reported on June 17, 1981. The Social Security proposals in the Act were similar to the Administration's with minor modifications, sparking debate in the Senate from June 22-25, 1981. On June 22-25, 1981, the Senate debated S. 1377, focusing on the elimination of the minimum benefit for Social Security recipients. Senator Riegle's amendment to only eliminate the minimum benefit for future recipients was defeated. The Senate passed S. 1377 with the Finance Committee's proposals by a vote of 80 to 15. The Ways and Means Committee recommendations differed from the Administration's proposals and were included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. The adoption of the rule for floor consideration of H.R. 3982 on June 19, 1981, became a highly controversial issue. The Democratic leadership argued for six separate votes to increase accountability, while a bipartisan group supported a rule allowing only an up-or-down vote on a substitute bill. The original rule was defeated on June 25, 1981, by a close vote. The House passed the Gramm-Latta II alternative package on June 26, 1981, by a vote of 217 to 211. This alternative package included amendments related to the COLA, minimum benefit proposal, and student benefit phase-out. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was passed on the same day by a vote of 232 to 193, resulting in Social Security measures similar to the Administration's original proposals. On July 13, 1981, the Senate voted to substitute reconciliation proposals from S. 1377 for those passed by the House in H.R. 3982. Representative Bolling threatened to delay the conference agreement until modifications were negotiated. An agreement allowed H.R. 4331, the Social Security Amendments of 1981, to be brought to the House floor before the reconciliation conference report vote. Both the House and Senate approved the conference report on the 1981 Budget Reconciliation bill on July 31, 1981. The Senate approved the conference report on the 1981 Budget Reconciliation bill, with the House and Senate voting in favor. President Reagan signed H.R. 4331, the Social Security Amendments of 1981, on December 29, 1981. The amendments restored the minimum benefit for current recipients but eliminated it for new beneficiaries after December 31, 1981. The law also allowed the OASI trust fund to borrow from other trust funds until December 31, 1982. The Social Security Amendments of 1981 allowed OASI to borrow $17.5 billion to pay benefits until June 1983. It also extended benefits for members of religious orders, extended payroll tax to sick pay, criminalized altering Social Security cards, and allowed DHHS access to prevent ineligible prisoners from receiving benefits. The House passed H.R. 4331 on July 31, 1981, by a vote of 404 (172-R, 232-D) to 20 (17-R, 3-D), repealing the section of P.L. 97-35 that eliminated the minimum Social Security benefit for current and future recipients. On July 31, 1981, the House passed H.R. 4331 by a vote of 404 to 20. Senators Riegle, Moynihan, and Kennedy tried to expedite consideration in the Senate, but the motion was ruled out of order. The Finance Committee reported a bill in September 1981 that restored the minimum benefit for current Social Security recipients, with exceptions for those with government pensions. Members of religious orders eligible for Social Security in 1972 could retain the minimum benefit for 10 more years. The Senate agreed to restore the minimum benefit for Social Security recipients, offsetting the cost by applying payroll tax to sick pay and lowering the maximum family retirement benefit. Amendments were made to allow access to prison records, make altering Social Security cards a felony, and apply payroll tax to employer-financed sick pay. On October 15, 1981, Senator Moynihan's amendment for counterfeit-proof Social Security cards was accepted by voice vote. Senator Eagleton's amendment to repeal a provision of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and use tax savings for Social Security trust funds was tabled. The Senate passed H.R. 4331 with a unanimous vote. The conference agreement focused on funding the minimum benefit restoration through tax increases or benefit cuts, with inter-fund borrowing allowed for one year. The conference agreement restored the minimum benefit to recipients eligible before 1982, rejecting Senate provisions to reduce benefits for those with government pensions over $300 per month and limit family benefits in OASI cases. The Senate and House approved the conference report in December 1981, and President Reagan signed H.R. 7093 on January 12, 1983. Implementation of the continuing disability investigation process in 1982 resulted in some recipients losing benefits, later restored upon appeal. P.L. 97-455 was a temporary measure to address issues. P.L. 97-455 was a temporary measure to address procedural inequities in the disability review process. It allowed individuals dropped from the rolls before October 1, 1983, to receive DI and Medicare benefits while appealing the decision. Face-to-face hearings during reconsideration were required as of January 1, 1984. The Secretary had to report semiannually on disability reviews and terminations. The Finance Committee marked up S. 2942 on September 28, 1982, giving the Secretary authority to decrease disability cases sent for review. Senator Dole attached S. 2942 to H.R. 7093, which was passed by the Senate on December 3, 1982, addressing unfair terminations of disabled individuals. On December 3, 1982, the Senate passed H.R. 7093 by a vote of 70 to 4. The bill was amended by the House on December 14, 1982, to include provisions for face-to-face hearings during reconsideration of disability benefits and changes to the government pension offset provision. The House and Senate passed H.R. 7093 in December 1982, with modifications to the government pension offset provision. President Reagan signed H.R. 1900, the Social Security Amendments of 1983, on April 20, 1983. Projections showed the OASDI program would run out of funds by mid-1983, needing $150-200 billion for solvency. The program was projected to be adequately financed for 35 years, but deficits were expected after 2025 due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation. The National Commission on Social Security Reform was formed to address the system's financing problems. In 1983, amendments were made to the OASDI program, including changes for federal employees, cost-of-living adjustments, income taxation on higher earners, and a gradual increase in the retirement age to 67. In 1983, amendments to the OASDI program raised the retirement age to 67, increased benefits for certain groups, liberalized the earnings test, and made changes to pension offset provisions. The amendments also excluded OASDI and HI income and expenditures from federal budget totals. The Ways and Means Committee reported out H.R. 1900, which included recommendations from the National Commission, Social Security provisions, and measures for long-run financing. The House debated the bill on March 9, 1983, with proponents emphasizing the need to address Social Security financing issues quickly. Opponents questioned the effectiveness of the bill and suggested raising the retirement age instead of increasing payroll taxes. Representative Pickle's (D-TX) amendment called for increasing the age for \"full\" retirement benefits to 66 by 2009. The House approved raising the full retirement age to 66 by 2009 and to 67 by 2027 by a vote of 228 to 202. Early retirement at age 62 would be reduced to 70% of full benefits. Representative Pepper's amendment to increase the OASDI tax rate was rejected. H.R. 1900 was passed by the House on March 9, 1983, and the Senate Finance Committee reported out S. 1 on March 11, 1983. The Senate considered H.R. 1900 on March 16, 1983, with 72 amendments offered and 49 adopted. Senator Long's amendment for coverage of new federal employees was passed, while an amendment to exclude federal workers was rejected. Senator Stevens's amendment for a retirement program by October 1985 was also rejected. The Senate passed H.R. 1900 on March 23, 1983, with a vote of 88 to 9. The primary issue was addressing the system's long-run financial problems, with differences between the House and Senate bills on retirement age, earnings test, and benefit payments. The Senate bill also included a provision to delay coverage of new federal employees. The House and Senate passed H.R. 1900 in March 1983, with the Senate addressing long-term financial issues. President Reagan signed the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act in 1984, ending controversy over the DI program's review process. After the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act was signed in 1984, criticism arose over the DI program's review process. Complaints included a large number of individuals being dropped from the rolls, an increase in disability reviews, and erroneous terminations. Advocacy groups and federal courts raised concerns about termination policies, leading to appeals and calls for legislative relief. The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 introduced changes to the disability benefits program. Key points include termination of benefits only if the individual has medically improved, delays in mental impairment disability reviews, consideration of combined impairments, and uniform standards for disability determinations. Additionally, demonstration projects for personal appearance interviews were recommended. The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 introduced changes to the disability benefits program, including termination of benefits only if there is medical improvement, delays in mental impairment disability reviews, consideration of combined impairments, and uniform standards for disability determinations. It also addressed the qualifications of representative payees and established a temporary standard for evaluating pain. The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 introduced changes to the disability benefits program, including termination of benefits only if there is medical improvement. Representative Conable and Representative Pickle expressed concerns about errors in benefit termination notifications and the hardships faced by disabled recipients. Remedial steps were taken, including the approval of P.L. 97-455 and the introduction of H.R. 3755. The House passed H.R. 3755 on March 27, 1984, with overwhelming support. Secretary Heckler had previously imposed a moratorium on disability reviews due to confusion in the system. The bill aimed to restore order and humanity to the disability review process. On May 16, 1984, the Finance Committee approved S. 476, allowing disabled persons to continue collecting Social Security benefits if their medical condition had not improved. The Senate bill required recipients to prove their condition had not improved. Senator Cohen highlighted the need for change in disability reviews due to numerous legal challenges against benefit terminations. The Senate passed H.R. 3755 on May 22, 1984, after substituting the language of S. 476. Senator Levin praised the bill for addressing problems in the disability review process and ensuring a fair and responsible review process. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, included in H.J.Res. 372, was passed unanimously by the House and Senate in 1984. It required annual deficit reductions and across-the-board cuts to nonexempt programs to achieve this goal. The act aimed to decrease deficits until reaching zero in FY1991, sponsored by Senators Gramm and Rudman. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, sponsored by Senators Gramm, Rudman, and Hollings, accelerated the treatment of OASDI off-budget from FY1993 to FY1986. It exempted Social Security benefits from automatic cuts and required the restoration of lost interest to the trust funds. The HI trust fund was not affected until FY1993. In 1985, the House and Senate approved a debt-limit increase as part of the FY1986 budget resolution. The Senate adopted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings amendment to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Control Act of 1985. The conference report was filed in disagreement, leading to a second conference and eventual agreement by both chambers. The Senate also voted to skip the 1986 COLA for various federal programs. In 1985, the Senate voted to skip the 1986 COLA for various federal programs, including Social Security. President Reagan proposed a COLA freeze for federal benefit programs, excluding Social Security. The Senate Budget Committee added Social Security to the list of programs with COLA freezes for 1986. The proposed COLA cutback for federal retirement programs aimed to limit COLAs to 2% per year plus inflation exceeding assumptions, ensuring a minimum 2% increase. This would result in $22 billion in Social Security savings over three years, with potential for higher savings in the future. The Senate rejected the COLA freeze and alternative limitation, opting for full funding of Social Security COLAs. However, a revised budget package was adopted, including the original COLA freeze. An amendment for a full Social Security COLA in January 1986 was tabled. The final budget resolution assumed enactment of the 1986 COLA freezes. The House rejected amendments to limit Social Security COLAs and freeze 1986 COLAs for various federal benefit programs. The House-passed resolution was included in S.Con.Res. 32, approved by a vote of 258 to 170. The House and Senate met to work out an agreement on a deficit reduction package in 1985. Various proposals were discussed, including delaying COLA freezes, means testing COLAs, and adjusting income tax brackets every other year. However, no agreement was reached on Social Security constraints, and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 was signed by President Reagan on October 21, 1986. In 1986, the 3% requirement for Social Security COLA was permanently eliminated by P.L. 99-509, allowing for a 1.3% COLA in December 1986. The Senate and House both included measures in budget reconciliation acts to provide a COLA in January 1987 regardless of inflation rates. The Senate approved S. 2706 on September 20, 1986, and the House passed H.R. 5300 on September 24, 1986. The House passed H.R. 5300 on September 24, 1986, and the conference report was approved on October 17, 1986. H.R. 3545, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, was signed into law on December 22, 1987, by President Reagan, affecting Social Security provisions. H.R. 3545 was a bill passed by the House on October 29, 1987, to meet deficit reduction targets set by the FY1988 budget resolution. It included changes in Social Security provisions such as extending coverage to military training of inactive reservists, group term life insurance, and lengthening the period for disability recipients to re-entitle to benefits. The Finance Committee approved H.R. 3545 on December 3, 1987, with the House Social Security coverage provisions. On December 10, 1987, the Senate rejected an amendment to limit the 1988 Social Security COLA to 2%. On December 21, 1987, both the House and Senate passed the conference report for H.R. 3545. President Reagan signed H.R. 4333 on November 10, 1988, which included provisions affecting Social Security. The Ways and Means Committee approved a bill affecting Social Security on July 14, 1988. The House passed the bill on August 4, 1988, and the Senate approved it on October 11, 1988. The bill included measures such as extended payment of benefits during appeal, denying benefits to deported Nazis, and reducing the years of substantial earnings needed to phase out the windfall benefit formula. On October 11, 1988, H.R. 4333 was approved by the House and Senate, with President George H. W. Bush signing it into law on December 19, 1989. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 included Social Security provisions extending benefits to adopted children, continued payment of benefits during appeal, increased calculation of average wages, and raised the maximum earnings subject to FICA tax. The Ways and Means Committee proposed Social Security-related measures in H.R. 3299, including making SSA an independent agency, raising the Special Minimum benefit, increasing earnings test limits for recipients over 64, extending benefits to adopted children, continuing payment of benefits during appeal, and including deferred compensation in benefit calculations and FICA tax limits. The House passed H.R. 3299 on October 5, 1989. The House passed H.R. 3299 on October 5, 1989, with provisions including an increase in the maximum earnings subject to FICA tax. The Senate approved its version on October 13, 1989, with some differences, such as not making SSA an independent agency. The House and Senate passed H.R. 3299 with provisions, including an increase in FICA tax earnings. A provision was added for SSA to provide estimates of earnings and benefits to workers over 24. President George H. W. Bush signed H.R. 5835 in 1990, making permanent a provision for recipients to continue receiving benefits during appeals. In 1990, legislation was passed to align the definition of disability for widows with that of disabled workers, extend benefits to spouses in invalid marriages, protect trust fund balances, expand coverage to state and local government employees, and increase the maximum earnings subject to HI taxes to $125,000. The congressional agenda was focused on reducing a large budget deficit under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. The Administration's FY1991 budget included Social Security measures, such as extending coverage to state and local government workers without retirement plans. Budget negotiations stalled due to disagreements on deficit reduction methods. A budget agreement was reached after a \"summit\" between congressional and Administration leaders, involving tax increases and spending cuts in entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. The House approved bills extending Social Security coverage and raising HI taxes. Senator Moynihan proposed cutting the Social Security payroll tax for true pay-as-you-go financing. The proposal by Senator Moynihan aimed to adjust the Social Security payroll tax rate based on program costs to address concerns about the use of surpluses to reduce the federal budget deficit. Despite majority support in the Senate, the measure failed to pass due to a point of order raised against it. On October 18, 1990, the Senate passed a budget reconciliation bill with an amendment to remove Social Security from deficit calculations. The House later passed the bill, and on August 10, 1993, President Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which made up to 85% of Social Security benefits taxable for certain recipients. President Clinton proposed increasing the proportion of Social Security benefits subject to taxation from 50% to 85% in 1994 to generate $32 billion in new tax revenues over five years. The proceeds would go to the Medicare Hospital Insurance program instead of the Social Security trust funds. This change aimed to align the treatment of Social Security benefits with private pensions and improve the financial outlook of Medicare. President Clinton proposed increasing the taxation of Social Security benefits to generate new tax revenues for the Medicare Hospital Insurance program. The proposal faced opposition from the Republican minority, who argued that it was unfair and would weaken the \"earned right\" nature of the program. Critics believed that the increase in taxation would essentially reduce the benefits promised to recipients. The FY1994 Concurrent Budget Resolution, H.Con.Res. 64, included additional revenue from President Clinton's proposal to increase taxation on Social Security benefits. The House passed H.Con.Res. 64 on March 18, 1993, and the Senate debated it for six days, ultimately rejecting an amendment to remove the revenue projection. On March 24, 1993, the Senate approved an amendment expressing the sense that the revenue assumptions were contingent on the Finance Committee's actions. The Senate approved H.Con.Res. 64, which included additional revenue from taxing Social Security benefits. The resolution assumed the Finance Committee would seek alternative revenue sources before imposing taxes on benefits for recipients with incomes below $32,000 (single) and $40,000 (couples). Thresholds for taxing 50% of benefits remained at $25,000 and $32,000. The House and Senate approved the resolution, with modifications made by the House Committee on Ways and Means. The President's proposal in H.R. 2264, the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, included taxing Social Security benefits with modifications to credit proceeds to the General Fund. The House and Senate passed the resolution, with the Senate rejecting amendments to change taxation thresholds and increase proceeds allocation. The Senate approved the Budget Reconciliation bill with amendments on taxation of Social Security benefits. The House adopted amendments setting second-tier thresholds and modified the taxation provision in conference. The final version of the bill passed by a narrow margin in the House on August 5, 1993. The House passed H.R. 2264 on August 5, 1993, and the Senate approved it on August 6, 1993. President Clinton signed H.R. 4277, the Social Security Administrative Reform Act of 1994, on August 15, 1994, establishing the SSA as an independent agency. The act imposed restrictions on DI and SSI benefits for drug addicts and alcoholics. President Clinton initially opposed SSA's independence but supported the final passage of H.R. 4277. Interest in making SSA independent began in the 1970s due to its impact on fiscal policy. The push for Social Security Administration (SSA) independence in the early 1980s aimed to protect it from short-term budget cuts and ensure long-term stability. Proponents believed independence would lead to better leadership and public reassurance, while opponents argued that SSA's financial impact should be considered alongside other social programs. Making SSA independent was seen as a solution to administrative problems influenced by ongoing issues. The push for SSA independence in the early 1980s aimed to address administrative problems influenced by ongoing policy changes. Congress made attempts to make SSA independent, with disagreements between the House and Senate on how it should be administered. H.R. 2264 proposed a three-member bipartisan board approach, while S. 1560 proposed a single-administrator approach. The Senate passed S. 1560 by voice vote on March 2, 1994, and on May 23, 1994, the Senate approved H.R. 4277 after incorporating the language of S. 1560. Conferees reached an agreement on July 20, 1994, for SSA to be run by a single administrator appointed for a six-year term. The House passed the agreement on August 11, 1994, and President Clinton signed H.R. 4278, Social Security Domestic Reform Act of 1994, on October 22, 1994, which included changes to Social Security coverage and reallocated taxes. In early 1993, the issue of coverage of domestic workers came to light due to under-reporting of household wages. Measures were introduced in Congress to raise the threshold for reporting wages, with H.R. 4105 proposing an increase to $1,250 a year in 1995. This measure was included in H.R. 4278, approved by the House on May 12, 1994. The Senate passed a revised version of H.R. 4278 on May 25, 1994, raising the threshold for Social Security coverage of household workers to $1,000 in 1994. The measure also provided for future increases in $100 increments based on average wage growth. On March 29, 1996, President Clinton signed H.R. 3136, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act of 1996, which raised the annual earnings test exempt amount for retirees over seven years, prohibited DI and SSI eligibility for drug addiction or alcoholism, tightened entitlement requirements for benefits, and provided funds for additional disability reviews. In 1994, 300 Republican congressional candidates presented a \"Contract with America\" with 10 proposals, including the \"Senior Citizens Equity Act\" to increase earnings test limits for those over 64. The Act was sponsored by 131 Members in H.R. 8 in 1995 but was not included in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation bill. In 1995, H.R. 2684, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act, was approved to gradually increase earnings test limits for those aged 65-69 to $30,000 in 2002. The full committee approved H.R. 2684 by a vote of 31-0 on November 30, 1995. The House approved H.R. 2684 on December 5, 1995, by a vote of 411 to 4. A modified version of H.R. 2684 was included in H.R. 3136, the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996. H.R. 3136 also included an increase in the debt ceiling and other measures. On March 28, 1996, H.R. 3136 was passed by the House by a vote of 328 to 91. On December 14, 1995, the Senate Committee on Finance approved S. 1470, a bill similar to H.R. 2684. On March 28, 1996, H.R. 3136 was passed by the Senate by unanimous consent. President Clinton signed H.R. 1180, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentive Act of 1999, on December 17, 1999. This act provided disabled recipients with vouchers for rehabilitative services and extended Medicare coverage for up to 4.5 years for those who work. In the 1990s, there was a push to help disabled Social Security recipients transition back to work by enhancing incentives and access to rehabilitation services. The House and Senate passed bills to enhance work incentives for the disabled. President Clinton signed the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act in 2000, eliminating the earnings test for recipients who have reached FRA. The Senior Citizens Right to Work Act in 2000 eliminated the earnings test for recipients who have reached FRA. Critics found the earnings test unfair and harmful to work incentives, while defenders argued it was a reasonable means of executing the purpose of Social Security. In 2000, the earnings test for Social Security recipients at FRA was eliminated due to the program's improved financial status and budget surplus. The Delayed Retirement Credit (DRC) increase in 1983 laid the groundwork for this change, ensuring no negative impact on long-term financing. In 2000, the earnings test for Social Security recipients at FRA was eliminated through legislation introduced by Representative Sam Johnson (R-TX). The DRC increase in 1983 ensured no negative impact on long-term financing, leading to overwhelming support for the repeal of the test. President George W. Bush signed H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act of 2004, on March 2, 2004. The measure aimed to reduce fraud and abuse in Social Security and SSI programs by imposing stricter standards on representative payees, limiting assessments on attorney fee payments, and prohibiting fugitive felons from receiving benefits. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 aimed to reduce fraud and abuse in Social Security and SSI programs by imposing stricter standards on representative payees, limiting assessments on attorney fee payments, and prohibiting fugitive felons from receiving benefits. It also required certain noncitizens to have authorization to work in the United States to gain insured status under the Social Security program. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 strengthened accountability for representative payees by removing the negligence requirement for benefit reissuance. It made non-governmental payees liable for misused funds and allowed SSA to impose penalties for misuse. Additionally, claimants can have representation in SSA proceedings. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 enhanced accountability for representative payees, allowing claimants to have representation in SSA proceedings. Claimant representatives, such as attorneys, may charge fees for their services, subject to limits authorized by SSA. If awarded past-due benefits, SSA withholds an attorney's fee payment from the benefit award and sends it directly to the attorney, along with an assessment of up to 6.3% to cover administrative costs. Before this law, non-attorney representatives or SSI claimants would receive the full benefit award, with the representative responsible for collecting their fee. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 allowed claimants to have representation in SSA proceedings, with attorneys able to charge fees capped at 6.3% of the attorney's fee or $75. The law also extended fee withholding to SSI claims and non-attorney representatives, and required a study on the fee payment process for claimant representatives. Additionally, before the law, SSA was prohibited from paying SSI benefits to fugitive felons and had to provide information about them to law enforcement upon request. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 allowed representation in SSA proceedings with capped attorney fees. The law prohibited SSA from paying SSI benefits to fugitive felons and required information sharing with law enforcement. Additionally, the law authorized the payment of SSI and Social Security benefits previously denied to fugitive felons. Under the new law, a state or local government employee must be covered by Social Security for at least the last 60 calendar months of employment to be exempt from the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Noncitizens assigned a Social Security number (SSN) in 2004 or later must have work authorization at the time the SSN is assigned to qualify for Social Security benefits. Under the new law, noncitizens assigned a Social Security number (SSN) before 2004 are not required to have work authorization to qualify for benefits. The Social Security Protection Act of 2003 was approved by the House on April 2, 2003, and by the Senate Finance Committee on September 17, 2003. The Senate approved H.R. 743, renamed the Social Security Protection Act of 2004, on February 11, 2004, with bipartisan support. President Obama signed the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 on December 17, 2010, which included a temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax in 2011. The Social Security initiative in the legislation aimed to stimulate the economy by reducing FICA and SECA tax rates for employees and self-employed workers. The law did not change the FICA rate for employers in 2011. Any decline in tax revenue was covered by transfers from the U.S. Treasury. The House approved H.R. 4853 on March 17, 2010. The Senate passed the bill, with an amendment focused on the aviation industry, titled the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2010, Part III. The House then removed aviation provisions and used the bill for tax relief measures. On December 2, 2010, the House adopted an amendment to H.R. 4853 for tax relief. On December 17, 2010, the House approved the Senate amendment to H.R. 4853, which included a one-year partial payroll tax \"holiday\" for workers and the self-employed in 2011. The bill was signed into law by President Obama on December 23, 2011, extending temporary Social Security payroll tax contribution rates. The law extended temporary Social Security payroll tax rates from 2011 into 2012, along with unemployment insurance and health provisions. The Social Security portion of the payroll tax for self-employed workers remained reduced at 10.4% in 2012. The FICA tax rate on employee earnings was also temporarily reduced from 6.2% to 4.2% through February 2012. In 2011, proposals were made to extend temporary payroll tax reductions through 2012. H.R. 3630 was considered for a year-long extension but stalled due to differences in House and Senate versions. H.R. 3765 was a short-term compromise, extending the tax cuts for two months. The House and Senate approved H.R. 3765 on December 23, 2011. The Senate approved H.R. 3765 on December 23, 2011, extending reduced Social Security payroll tax rates through 2012. President Obama signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 on February 22, 2012, further extending the tax cuts. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended Social Security payroll tax rate reductions through the end of 2012. It also included extensions of unemployment insurance, health, and welfare provisions, as well as provisions for retirement contributions for federal employees and public safety programs. The temporary payroll tax rates expired at the end of 2012, returning to 6.2% for employees and 12.4% for the self-employed in 2013. The House approved the Act on December 13, 2011. The Creation Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Dave Camp (R-MI), was approved by the House and renamed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Senate also approved the bill, and President Barack Obama signed it into law on December 18, 2014. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, signed into law by President Barack Obama, included provisions for the termination of Social Security benefits for individuals involved in Nazi persecutions, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killings under specific conditions outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. This law expanded the circumstances under which benefits would be terminated and allowed for reinstatement of benefits for those ordered removed based on these actions. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 expanded provisions for terminating Social Security benefits for individuals involved in Nazi persecutions, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killings. Concern arose over individuals living outside the US who had participated in Nazi persecutions during WWII and were still receiving benefits. Some had left the country before being ordered removed, allowing them to continue receiving benefits. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 expanded provisions for terminating Social Security benefits for individuals involved in Nazi persecutions, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killings. P.L. 113-270 further clarified the termination of benefits for those involved in such actions and prohibited them from receiving benefits based on another person's work record. It also specified the timeframe for notifying the SSA of certain actions involving these individuals. The change in benefit eligibility for those involved in genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killings as a result of P.L. 113-270 is likely an unintended consequence of the legislative language. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (H.R. 1314) made changes to Social Security rules, including deemed filing and voluntary suspension of benefits. It also temporarily reallocated payroll tax revenues from the OASI Trust Fund to the DI Trust Fund. President Obama signed the legislation into law on November 2, 2015. Options for claimants at full retirement age or older are limited, as they are required to file for both retired-worker and spousal benefits simultaneously. The spousal benefit is reduced under the dual entitlement rule, where the individual receives the higher of the two benefit amounts. This rule previously only applied to claimants below full retirement age. Before P.L. 114-74, claimants below full retirement age could use a claiming strategy to maximize their Social Security benefits by filing a restricted application for spousal benefits only. This allowed them to receive a full spousal benefit without the dual entitlement rule being applied immediately. However, P.L. 114-74 eliminated this option for claimants at full retirement age or older, who are now required to file for both retired-worker and spousal benefits simultaneously. The deemed filing change affects those born in 1954 or later, allowing them to file for both retired-worker and spousal benefits if eligible. Those born before 1954 are grandfathered under old rules and can file a restricted application for spousal or retired-worker benefits at full retirement age. Family members generally cannot claim benefits on a worker's record unless the worker has claimed benefits. The \"file and suspend\" approach allowed workers to accrue delayed retirement credits while eligible family members could claim benefits. Beneficiaries could also receive spousal or widow(er)'s benefits based on another person's record. Workers could unsuspend benefits retroactively and receive a lump sum. Under P.L. 114-74, a worker at FRA or older can file for retired-worker benefits and voluntarily suspend benefits to accrue DRCs. However, benefits are no longer payable to eligible family members during the suspension period, except for divorced spouses. Widow(er)'s benefits can still be collected on a deceased worker's record who had suspended their own benefits. Additionally, a worker cannot receive benefits based on another person's record while their own benefits are suspended. The changes to Social Security's filing rules under P.L. 114-74 prevent the voluntary suspension of benefits from allowing workers and spouses to collect more benefits than intended. Before the changes, a person could claim spousal benefits only if they also qualified for retired-worker benefits, resulting in full spousal benefits for several years. The changes now end voluntary suspension at age 70 or upon request to resume benefits, effective for requests made after April 29, 2016. The changes to Social Security's filing rules under P.L. 114-74 prevent the voluntary suspension of benefits from allowing workers and spouses to collect more benefits than intended. The \"restricted application\" and \"file and suspend\" options were being used in combination by some married couples to maximize their benefits. In July 2015, projections showed that the DI trust fund reserves would be depleted by the end of 2016, potentially affecting disability benefit payments. Section 833 of P.L. 114-74 provided a temporary reallocation of the Social Security payroll. Section 833 of P.L. 114-74 temporarily reallocated the Social Security payroll tax rate between the OASI and DI trust funds, extending DI trust fund solvency to 2023. The reallocation did not affect the OASI trust fund's solvency, projected until 2035. Other provisions in P.L. 114-74 addressed fraud in SSA's disability programs. H.R. 1314, introduced by Rep. Patrick Meehan, was approved by the House in April 2015 without Social Security provisions. The House approved H.R. 1314 in April 2015 without Social Security provisions. The bill was later renamed the Trade Act of 2015 by the Senate. After further amendments, it became the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 on October 28, 2015. The House adopted an amendment to H.R. 1314, as amended by the Senate, by a vote of 266 to 167. The Senate agreed to the House amendment to H.R. 1314 by a vote of 64 to 35. President Trump signed H.J.Res. 40 on February 28, 2017, nullifying a rule by the SSA regarding the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. The rule would have required the SSA to send names of certain individuals to the National Instant Criminal History Background Check System. The SSA final rule regarding benefit payments was vacated by H.J.Res. 40, introduced by Representative Sam Johnson. The rule was criticized for stigmatizing individuals with mental health issues or disabilities. The compliance date for the rule was delayed, and no records were reported to the NICS as a result. The joint resolution H.J.Res. 40, which vacated the SSA final rule on benefit payments, was passed after debate in the House and Senate. President Trump signed the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017 into law on September 15, 2017, which included provisions to limit the use of SSNs on mailed documents. The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017 limits federal agencies from including SSNs on mailed documents. Agencies must issue regulations within five years specifying when an SSN is necessary. H.R. 624, introduced by Rep. Valadao, was approved by the House in May 2017. The bill H.R. 624 was passed by the Senate without amendment and signed into law by President Donald Trump on April 13, 2018. The law aimed to increase oversight of representative payees and protect vulnerable beneficiaries under the Social Security Act. It required the SSA to provide annual grants to each state's protection and advocacy system for reviews of representative payees in the SSI and OASDI programs due to reported cases of abuse. The Social Security Advisory Board published reports on representative payees, and the GAO also released a report on the SSA Representative Payee Program. The House Committee on Ways and Means held hearings on the program in 2017. P.L. 115-165 included a provision to enhance personal control for beneficiaries. The Social Security Advisory Board and the GAO released reports on the SSA Representative Payee Program. H.R. 4547 aimed to enhance personal control for beneficiaries by allowing them to choose their payee in advance. It also imposed restrictions on who could serve as payees. The bill was introduced by Representative Sam Johnson and passed by the House and Senate. President Trump signed the Tribal Social Security Fairness Act of 2018 into law on September 20, 2018. The Tribal Social Security Fairness Act of 2018 extended Social Security benefits to tribal council leaders upon request by Indian tribes. It allowed tribal council members to receive credit for taxes paid before the agreement, reversed an SSA policy, and was introduced by Representative Dave Reichert. The bill passed the House and Senate and was signed into law on September 20, 2018. President Donald Trump signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act on May 24, 2018. The Act required the SSA to accept electronic signatures for verifying personal information to combat synthetic identity theft. This type of fraud involves using a mix of real and fake information to create a false identity. The SSA's Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification Service was established to address this issue. The Number Verification Service was updated by P.L. 115-174 to allow electronic signatures for verification requests, modernizing the SSA's system. Senator Mike Crapo introduced S. 2155 to enable financial institutions to electronically verify customers' personal information with the SSA. The bill S. 2155, introduced by Senator Mike Crapo, was amended to include Social Security provisions in Section 215 by S.Amdt. 2151. Senator Tim Scott explained that Section 215 aimed to reduce synthetic identity theft by allowing entities to crosscheck consumer information with the SSA. The amended bill passed the Senate and House in March and May 2018, respectively."
