    "content": "U.S. departments and agencies are increasingly relying on private firms for security services in combat or stability operations overseas, including the State Department, USAID, and possibly the CIA. The Department of Defense also uses civilian contractors for security. The use of private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan has sparked debate due to incidents of misconduct and excessive force. There is concern that reliance on contractors may undermine U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Legislation has been enacted to close jurisdictional gaps for prosecuting civilian employees committing crimes overseas. Civilian contractor personnel can be prosecuted in federal or military court depending on the offense, location, nationality, and nature of the contract. The jurisdictional gaps for prosecuting civilian employees committing crimes overseas may affect agency responsibility and venue for prosecution. While some contractor personnel have faced prosecution in the United States for crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many investigations have not led to charges yet. The foreign affairs implications were highlighted by the 2007 incident at Nisoor Square involving Blackwater Worldwide security guards. The 2007 incident at Nisoor Square involving Blackwater Worldwide security guards led to the deaths of 17 civilians, prompting the Iraqi government to revoke Blackwater's operating license. The dismissal of criminal indictments against five contract employees further strained U.S.-Iraq relations, with Iraqi officials vowing to seek redress. The United Nations Working Group on the use of mercenaries called for those responsible to be held fully accountable. This report discusses the legal framework for contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, including international law implications and proposals for regulating private security contractors. It also covers treaty frameworks, jurisdiction in U.S. courts, and the roles of private security contractors in inherently governmental functions. Contractors to coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan operate under three levels of legal authority: international law, U.S. law, and domestic law of host countries. They are considered civilian non-combatants under international law, and can be prosecuted by courts in Iraq and Afghanistan under applicable status of forces agreements. The status of armed contract personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan falls into a grey area under international law. Contractors, particularly U.S. nationals, may be prosecuted in U.S. federal courts or military courts. The international law of armed conflict is relevant to their conduct, especially in belligerent occupation and non-international armed conflict situations. The critical question is whether contractors are considered civilians or non-combatants under humanitarian law. Contractors who take a direct part in hostilities may be considered combatants for distinguishing them from civilians in armed conflicts. They may risk losing their rights as POWs if captured by the enemy, as they fall outside the military chain of command. If a non-international armed conflict occurs, contractors engaged in hostilities would be entitled to minimum standards under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The International Committee of the Red Cross provided interpretive guidance on \"direct participation in combat.\" The report discusses whether contractors should be considered civilians or members of armed forces for protection from attack in an international armed conflict. It concludes that all armed actors showing military organization and belonging to a party must be regarded as part of the armed forces based on their continuous combat function involving direct participation in hostilities. The ICRC advises that determinations regarding the status of private contractors on the battlefield should be made carefully, considering their proximity to armed forces and ongoing hostilities. Contractors not authorized to act as combatants but participating directly in hostilities are considered civilians under international humanitarian law but lose protection against direct attack during that time. Private security personnel and contractors assigned to perform continuous combat functions may be considered members of an organized armed force and not entitled to protection under the principles of distinction. This includes those protecting embassy personnel or military supply convoys, as their defensive actions could impact hostilities and require engagement with enemy forces. The Geneva Conventions do not prohibit the use of civilian contractors in a civil police role in occupied territory, allowing them to use force when necessary. Contractors in occupied territory may use force to defend persons or property, but it can be challenging to differentiate between law enforcement duties and combat. If engaged in combat, civilian security guards could be targeted by enemy forces and prosecuted for hostile acts. Mercenaries fight for personal gain, not loyalty to a party, and may be liable for harming civilians regardless of their combatant status. Mercenaries are often considered \"unlawful combatants\" as they fight for monetary gain rather than loyalty. They may not receive POW treatment and can be punished for their actions, even if lawful for soldiers. The definition of a mercenary is outlined in Article 47 of Protocol I. Article 47 of Protocol I defines a mercenary as a person recruited to fight in armed conflict for private gain, not a national or resident of the conflict parties, and not a member of their armed forces. The definition of a mercenary according to Protocol I involves individuals hired to participate in hostilities, not nationals of the conflict parties, and not members of their armed forces. The UNCHR has shown interest in the role of mercenaries in armed conflicts, appointing a special rapporteur in 1987 to address human rights violations and the obstruction of peoples' right to self-determination. The UNCHR has addressed the impact of private security companies on the right to self-determination, with concerns about mercenary activities in conflict zones. A new International Convention on the Regulation of Private Military and Security Companies has been proposed to regulate their use. The draft convention on Private Military and Security Companies emphasizes that states should have a monopoly on the use of force and are responsible for their use of force under international law. It prohibits delegating fundamental state functions to non-state actors and requires states to establish rules for the use of force within domestic and international law. The convention does not establish a binding regulatory framework but requires states to adopt their own procedures for the use of private military and security. The draft convention on Private Military and Security Companies aims to regulate the use of force by states and prohibit the transfer of this right to private actors. It also prohibits private companies from directly participating in armed conflicts, military actions, or terrorist acts that aim to overthrow governments or violate territorial sovereignty. Additionally, it includes measures to prevent the use or trafficking of weapons of mass destruction, establish jurisdiction, criminalize violations, and provide redress for victims. The draft convention on Private Military and Security Companies aims to regulate the use of force by states and prohibit the transfer of this right to private actors. Private companies would be prohibited from arbitrarily or abusively using force, and would be permitted to use force only as a measure of last resort. The convention would create a UN Committee on the Regulation, Oversight and Monitoring of Private Military and Security Companies, composed of up to fourteen experts nominated by states parties. States would submit periodic reports on measures taken to implement the Convention, to which the Committee would provide interpretive guidance on international law and make confidential inquiries into incidents if warranted. States parties could refer complaints about the compliance of other states parties. The draft convention on Private Military and Security Companies aims to regulate the use of force by states and prohibit the transfer of this right to private actors. Parties could refer complaints about compliance to the Committee for review, which would appoint a Conciliation Commission to help reach a resolution. Private victims or groups could also bring petitions to the Committee. The Committee has no authority to enforce sanctions but can review breaches. The Montreux Document clarifies legal responsibilities for private military and security companies during armed conflict. Contracting states that use private military and security companies must ensure compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. They are responsible for training contractors, preventing violations, enacting regulations and sanctions, investigating misconduct, and providing remedies when necessary. Private military and security companies must comply with international law, and contracting states are responsible for ensuring their adherence. If misconduct occurs, the state must provide reparations according to customary international law. Misconduct can be attributed to the state if the company's personnel are integrated into the state's armed forces or operate under its command. Private military and security companies must comply with international law, and contracting states are responsible for ensuring their adherence. The Document outlines the responsibilities of states and private military companies, including compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. The Montreux Document emphasizes that private military and security companies must comply with international law, including humanitarian and human rights law. It provides guidelines for determining the status of personnel and outlines the responsibilities of superiors for crimes committed by personnel under their control. Additionally, it recommends \"good practices\" for adoption by contracting states, territorial states, home states, and the companies themselves. Contracting states are advised to ensure accountability by evaluating legislation and procurement regulations for private military and security companies. They should provide criminal and civil jurisdiction over these companies abroad and cooperate with the territorial state in investigations. States should determine which services can be outsourced to these companies based on factors like the likelihood of involvement in hostilities and assess their capacity to comply with relevant laws. This includes considering the company's work history, employer references, and ownership. Contracting states should provide resources and expertise for selecting and overseeing private military and security companies (PMSCs). They must ensure compliance with legal responsibilities, accountability, transparency, and supervision in the selection and contracting of PMSCs through legislative oversight and public disclosure of regulations and practices. Territorial states should also evaluate their domestic legal framework applicable to PMSC conduct. The Document advises territorial states to enact licensing requirements for PMSCs and establish regulations on weapons, incident reporting, and other aspects. Home states are encouraged to consider licensing or regulatory regimes to control security service exports without duplicating existing state regulations. PMSCs are not inherently bound by international law, which only applies to parties in conflict and individuals, not corporate entities. Statement 22 explains that PMSCs operating in Iraq are subject to the law of the government of Iraq, including orders issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority. CPA Order Number 17 exempted contractors from Iraqi laws for acts related to their contracts. However, as of January 1, 2009, jurisdiction over U.S. defense contractors is governed by the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the United States and Iraq. The Withdrawal Agreement, effective since January 1, 2009, grants Iraq primary jurisdiction over U.S. defense contractors and their employees. The United States may retain jurisdiction in cases where U.S. courts have authority, but Iraq is not obligated to follow the Agreement's provisions for handling cases involving U.S. servicemembers and DOD civilians. The Agreement does not allow the U.S. to arrest or detain contractors. The United States is not authorized to arrest or detain contractor personnel in Iraq without a warrant from an Iraqi court, except in cases of serious crimes or on base. Arrests must be reported and detainees handed over to Iraqi authorities within 24 hours. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is involved in two military operations - Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), each with separate agreements governing the status of personnel. The UN mandate for ISAF in Afghanistan is for \"peace enforcement\" to assist the Afghan government in creating a secure environment for reconstruction. ISAF personnel have immunity from Afghan authorities and are subject to the jurisdiction of their own governments. Operation Enduring Freedom is a U.S.-led coalition against terrorism. The U.S.-led coalition Operation Enduring Freedom was formed after 9/11 to combat terrorism. In 2002, an agreement was reached between the United States and the transitional government of Afghanistan regarding the status of U.S. military and DOD civilian personnel in Afghanistan. This agreement grants U.S. personnel immunity from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities and criminal jurisdiction over them is authorized by the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan. The agreement between the United States and Afghanistan grants immunity to U.S. personnel from Afghan prosecution. The agreement remains in force under the new Afghan government, but does not provide immunity for contractor personnel. There is debate over whether private security functions should be considered inherently governmental. Congress defined \"inherently governmental function\" in the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998 as functions that are essential for the public interest and require performance by Federal Government employees. This includes activities that involve discretion, value judgments, protecting national interests, contract management, and impacting private individuals. Congress may also designate functions as inherently governmental through statutes. Congress has defined \"inherently governmental functions\" as essential tasks that require performance by Federal Government employees. These functions involve discretion, value judgments, protecting national interests, contract management, and impacting private individuals. Congress may also directly forbid or limit the use of contractors for certain functions that are considered inherently unsuitable for association with the government. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) list examples of inherently governmental functions, and the Office of Management and Budget provides guidelines for executive agencies to follow. Circular A-76 provides guidelines for executive agencies to determine whether an activity should be performed by government personnel or the private sector. It allows contractors to provide certain protective services, but agencies must consider the impact on public life, liberty, and property when deciding. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) allows for the use of contract personnel for security, with limitations on guarding military installations and provisions for contractors accompanying U.S. Armed Forces deployed overseas. Contractors are considered civilians during contingency operations and are not authorized to use deadly force, except in self-defense. In June 2006, DOD amended the DFARS to allow private security contractors to use deadly force when necessary to protect assets/persons. Combatant commanders must ensure contractors do not perform inherently governmental military functions. The distinction between governmental and commercial security functions is based on the level of involvement in hostilities. The distinction between governmental and commercial security functions is based on the level of discretion and engagement with enemy fighters. The Combatant Commander has the authority to classify security functions as commercial. The DFARS-mandated clause limits military security provision for DOD contractors in theater of operations. Contractors must incorporate the required clause when hiring subcontractors for security services. A decision by the Comptroller General may provide further insight on private security. The Comptroller General denied a protest by a contractor challenging security requirements for contracts involving cargo transportation in Iraq, stating that providing guard or protective services does not make a company a 'quasi-military armed force'. The decision noted DOD regulations and DFARS provisions that permit contracting armed security services but prohibit direct combat or offensive operations. The Anti-Pinkerton Act may bar hiring contractors operating as a \"quasi-military armed force.\" State Department and USAID regulations do not specifically address contractors overseas during war or contingency operations. The 2008 amendment to the FAR imposes new requirements for government contracts involving contractor personnel working in designated operation areas or at certain diplomatic or consular missions outside the United States. This includes addressing the accountability of contractor personnel for conduct that could undermine mission objectives, with potential criminal prosecution for misconduct. U.S. contractor personnel and civilian employees in Iraq and Afghanistan can be prosecuted in U.S. courts under certain circumstances. The jurisdiction of U.S. criminal law extends to U.S. nationals at U.S. facilities overseas. Contractor personnel working with the armed forces overseas may be prosecuted under MEJA or UCMJ. However, some offenders may not fall under U.S. jurisdiction, leading to potential challenges in prosecution. Congress expanded jurisdictional coverage over contractor personnel through amendments to MEJA and the UCMJ. The 2008 NDAA required agencies to establish a memorandum of understanding for investigating and referring violations of UCMJ or MEJA in Iraq or Afghanistan. The 2009 NDAA further addressed jurisdictional issues related to contractor personnel. Section 854 of the FY2009 NDAA expands MOU requirements for contractors to report offenses under UCMJ or MEJA, provide victim and witness protection, and ensure awareness of reporting responsibilities. These provisions do not apply to CIA contracts but may cover CIA contractor personnel under MEJA. The MOU requirements do not include crimes under special maritime and territorial jurisdiction or crimes with general extraterritorial jurisdiction. The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction includes premises of US missions in foreign states and residences used for mission purposes. Offenses committed by individuals covered by MEJA or UCMJ at these locations may not fall under jurisdiction if they are felonies. Criminal statutes applicable in this jurisdiction cover offenses such as maiming, assault, kidnapping, and sexual crimes. The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction covers crimes like maiming, assault, kidnapping, sexual abuse, murder, and manslaughter. The DOJ prosecutes these crimes, with some cases involving other federal agencies. A CIA contractor was convicted in 2007 for assaulting a detainee in Afghanistan, arguing that a military base used as a firebase was not part of a military mission. The appellate court disagreed and upheld the conviction. The court defined a \"mission\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(9) as a place with qualities of a permanent base, considering factors like premises size, length of US control, improvements, actual use, personnel occupation, and host nation's consent. The court concluded that a firebase qualified as a military installation, extending federal criminal jurisdiction to assaults committed there. The War Crimes Act of 1996 and federal statutes prescribe criminal sanctions for offenses committed by or against U.S. nationals overseas. The prohibition on torture applies to acts outside the United States regardless of the perpetrator's nationality. The War Crimes Act prohibits \"grave breaches\" of Common Article 3, including torture, murder, and sexual assault. The War Crimes Act of 1996 covers serious offenses like bodily injury, rape, and taking hostages. Federal jurisdiction applies to crimes involving U.S. nationals or servicemembers. Other extraterritorial criminal proscriptions include assaulting or killing internationally protected persons. The prohibition on torture applies globally, with jurisdiction over offenders found in the United States. Extraterritorial jurisdiction over murder requires approval from the Attorney General if both the perpetrator and victim are U.S. nationals. Implied jurisdiction in statutes aims to protect federal officers and prevent obstruction of overseas activities. Some statutes apply to conduct affecting foreign commerce, but this alone may not show Congress intended to reach overseas conduct. Persons employed by or accompanying the armed forces overseas may be prosecuted under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) of 2000 for felony offenses committed outside the U.S. jurisdiction, including civilian employees of the Department of Defense and contractors. MEJA covers employees of federal agencies and provisional authorities supporting DOD missions overseas, but may not apply to civilian and contract employees of other agencies operating overseas or host nation nationals. It does cover foreign nationals working under covered contracts but may not extend federal jurisdiction over crimes not explicitly defined within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. The DOD issued regulations in 2005 to implement MEJA, which covers federal crimes prohibited nationwide. The DOD Inspector General is responsible for reporting suspicions of federal crimes and implementing investigative policies. The DOJ Criminal Division provides liaison with DOD and designates U.S. Attorney's Offices to handle cases. The Department of Justice reported that several individuals were charged under MEJA, with ongoing investigations. Contractors from Special Operations Consulting Security Management Group, Inc. were indicted for kidnapping, while Blackwater Worldwide employees contracted with the State Department were charged with manslaughter. Defendants argued that MEJA did not apply to them, but the judge declined to dismiss the charges. Several successful prosecutions of Department of Defense contractors under MEJA have been reported. Cases involved possession of child pornography, abusive sexual contact, and other crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. The judge dismissed indictments due to compelled statements protected by the Fifth Amendment. Several successful prosecutions of Department of Defense contractors under MEJA have been reported, including cases of assault, manslaughter, rape, and murder in Iraq and Afghanistan. The applicability of MEJA in prosecutions brought by other means has been questioned, with a contract for training Afghan police forces being deemed \"in support of [DOD's] mission overseas\" despite being administered by the State Department. The judge dismissed a count of child pornography possession for conduct at an Afghan police training facility as it was outside the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States for that contractor. Contractor personnel may face military prosecution under the UCMJ during hostilities, but civilian contractor trials by court-martial may be challenged constitutionally. Military jurisdiction extends to persons serving with armed forces in declared war or contingency operations. The UCMJ may extend jurisdiction to try civilian contractor personnel for offenses that violate the law of war, allowing for trial by court-martial or military commission. Prior to the FY2007 NDAA, civilians serving with the Armed Forces in the field were only covered during \"time of war,\" interpreted to mean wars declared by Congress. This raises constitutional issues regarding trials in military tribunals, as seen in Supreme Court cases like Reid v. Covert. The Supreme Court has ruled that trials in military tribunals during \"time of war\" must be limited to wars declared by Congress. Former servicemembers disconnected from the military cannot be tried by court-martial for past crimes. Congress's authority allows for different rules in courts-martial compared to civilian trials, with potential constitutional challenges for trying civilian contractors in military courts. The Supreme Court has found exceptions to fundamental rights for servicemembers in military courts. The UCMJ provides procedural protections similar to civilian courts, but military jurisdiction is not extended to civilians. The Covert Court distinguished civilian courts-martial from trials in enemy territory. In enemy territory held by military forces, Army commanders can establish commissions to try individuals, including civilians, connected or not with the Army. The Constitution may allow DOD contractors in non-U.S. territories to be subject to military jurisdiction as long as the U.S. is considered an \"occupying power.\" The Covert Court left open the possibility of trying civilians who are part of the armed services by court-martial during wartime. The Supreme Court has suggested that courts-martial may be permissible for civilians \"in\" the Armed Forces during war. During wartime, civilians accompanying the Armed Forces may be subject to trial by court-martial if they are considered to be \"in\" the Armed Forces. Lower courts have upheld courts-martial of civilian employees and merchant seamen for military charges. The Constitution and statutory requirements of the UCMJ must be satisfied for prosecution under military jurisdiction. It is essential to determine if a civilian contractor is \"serving with or accompanying an armed force\" in the field to be subject to the UCMJ. During wartime, civilians may be subject to trial by court-martial if they are \"serving with or accompanying an armed force\" in the field. Military jurisdiction over a civilian cannot be claimed based on convenience or non-availability of civil courts. Contractors in Iraq or Afghanistan may not be subject to military jurisdiction solely based on their employment. Civilians serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field may be subject to military jurisdiction, even outside of Iraq or Afghanistan, if connected to ongoing military operations. Issues may arise regarding prosecution for military crimes, availability of non-judicial punishment for civilian contractors, and limitations on appellate review due to sentencing considerations. The government can appeal adverse rulings on an interlocutory basis only in cases where a punitive discharge may be imposed. Defendants can appeal if the sentence includes death, dismissal of an officer, dishonorable discharge, or confinement for one year or more. Access to the Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces is limited, affecting access to the Supreme Court. There is no way to compel continued employment for civilians undergoing court-martial proceedings. DOD issued guidance in 2008 for implementing the law. The legal framework governing a command response to illegal activities by Department of Defense civilian employees and DOD contractor personnel overseas with the Armed Forces emphasizes jurisdiction based on military necessity and justice interests. The Secretary of Defense has sole authority for convening a court-martial or initiating non-judicial punishment for conduct within the United States or involving offenders not outside the country. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to convene a court-martial or initiate non-judicial punishment for Department of Defense civilian employees and DOD contractor personnel overseas. Commanders of geographic combatant commands can also initiate disciplinary proceedings or delegate this authority. Prior to initiating proceedings, convening authorities must follow notification procedures outlined in DOD Instruction 5525.11 to allow the Department of Justice to take action within fourteen calendar days. If DOJ does not indicate intent to exercise jurisdiction, DOD may proceed with authorization. Private security contractors provide essential security services for reconstruction and stabilization efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military commanders can investigate violations by civilians while the Department of Justice determines jurisdiction. Concerns have been raised about outsourcing the role of armed contractors. Some private security contractors may not be held accountable under U.S. law for misconduct in Iraq or Afghanistan, despite recent legal amendments. Congress may need to review and update the existing statutory framework as courts interpret and apply these statutes."
