    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2005\". The Congress recognizes the importance of Federal involvement in innovative land use planning and growth management, leveraging remote sensing and geospatial data for societal benefits. Landsat and other earth observation data have shown significant potential for various applications. The potential of commercial and civil remote sensing data, along with geospatial information systems, can address societal needs for urban planning, disaster monitoring, and resource management. However, there is still untapped potential in utilizing these technologies for public sector requirements. Presidential directives and policies support the development of US commercial remote sensing capabilities. Many government agencies are unaware of the benefits of remote sensing for urban planning and environmental impact. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration can demonstrate how scientific data combined with other sources can assist in decision-making for agriculture, weather forecasting, and forest management. NASA can also stimulate the development of remote sensing and geospatial information sectors through pilot projects. NASA projects aim to showcase the benefits of merging governmental and commercial remote sensing data with geographic information systems and satellite-based positioning data for practical applications. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"geospatial information,\" \"high resolution,\" and \"institution of higher education.\" SEC. 4. PILOT PROJECTS TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC SECTOR APPLICATIONS. NASA projects aim to showcase the benefits of merging governmental and commercial remote sensing data with geographic information systems and satellite-based positioning data for practical applications. The Administrator will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs. Preference will be given to projects using commercial data sets and integrating multiple sources of geospatial information. Non-Federal contributions are encouraged. The Administrator will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs. Projects must involve commercial entities processing data to create value-added products and demonstrate diverse public sector applications. Opportunities will be sought to assist in developing commercial applications and helping agencies apply remote sensing technologies for growth management. Assistance for pilot projects will last up to 3 years. Recipients must submit a report on project results within 180 days of completion and conduct a workshop within the same timeframe. The Administrator will issue regulations for project procedures, reports, and workshops. SEC. 5. PROGRAM EVALUATION. The Administrator will establish an advisory committee with expertise in various fields to monitor the program under section 4. The committee will consult with relevant industry representatives and organizations. An evaluation of the program's effectiveness in utilizing remote sensing sources must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2009. The program will be evaluated by an independent entity to assess the integrated use of remote sensing and geospatial information for State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs. The Administrator will ensure that pilot project results are accessible through an electronic database. An educational outreach program will be established to raise awareness of remote sensing applications. $15,000,000 is authorized annually for 2006-2010 for this Act."
