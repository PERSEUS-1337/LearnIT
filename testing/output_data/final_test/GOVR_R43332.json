    "content": "The 2014 farm bill reauthorized nutrition programs, including SNAP, administered by USDA-FNS. The bill is an omnibus legislation that reauthorizes agriculture-related statutes every five years. The 2008 farm bill programs expired in 2012 but were extended until September 30, 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The 2014 farm bill extended the 2008 farm bill through September 30, 2013, with most nutrition programs operating under FY2014 appropriations. Congress debated reauthorizing SNAP in the farm bill, reducing spending, and addressing the expiration of a temporary benefit increase. Changes to eligibility rules and benefit calculations were considered. The report summarizes key SNAP and nutrition provisions in the new law and the 113th Congress's Senate and House farm bills, including eligibility rules, treatment of LIHEAP payments in SNAP benefit calculation, disqualification of certain populations from food assistance, changes to retailer and benefit redemption policy, work requirements for SNAP participants, promotion of fruits and vegetables purchases, and provisions to increase funding for emergency feeding organizations. The report provides a summary of the enacted law's legislative history in the 113th Congress, including cost estimates of the Nutrition Title compared to Senate and House bills. It also outlines details on SNAP, Programs in Lieu of SNAP, Commodity Distribution Programs, and other nutrition-related programs. Appendix A offers a more detailed CBO estimate. The report summarizes the legislative history of the enacted law in the 113th Congress, including cost estimates of the Nutrition Title compared to Senate and House bills. It also provides details on SNAP, Programs in Lieu of SNAP, Commodity Distribution Programs, and other nutrition-related programs. Appendices offer detailed CBO estimates and comparison tables. The Agriculture Committee completed markup of the farm bill (H.R. 1947) and approved the amended measure by a 36-10 vote. The bill was considered by the House Rules Committee and later defeated in a House vote. A revised bill (H.R. 2642) excluding the Nutrition Title but including previous amendments was approved by the House. The Senate substituted the text of H.R. 2642 with S. 954 to initiate conference committee negotiations. On July 18, H.R. 2642 was substituted with S. 954. The House passed a stand-alone nutrition bill (H.R. 3102) on September 19. A resolution (H.Res. 361) combined the texts of H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3102 into one bill for resolving differences with the Senate. Conferees were appointed by the Senate on October 1, 2013, and by the House on October 13, 2013. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (H.R. 2642) was finalized on January 27, 2014, after a public meeting on October 30, 2013. Both chambers approved the agreement within eight days, with the President signing the bill on February 7, 2014. The enacted farm bill is estimated to reduce spending by approximately $8.0 billion over 10 years. During deliberations, the Congressional Budget Office provided cost estimates for proposed changes in program spending levels. The 2014 farm bill, signed into law in February 2014, is estimated to reduce spending by approximately $8.0 billion over 10 years. The bill includes provisions that affect the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is an open-ended, appropriated mandatory program. Changes to SNAP spending levels require amending eligibility and benefit calculation rules set by Congress. The 2014 farm bill, signed into law in February 2014, contains SNAP and non-SNAP provisions that will result in a net reduction in spending of approximately $8.0 billion over 10 years. The SNAP provisions alone are estimated to reduce spending by slightly more than $8.6 billion over 10 years, compared to the Senate bill's $4 billion reduction and the House bill's $39 billion reduction. The law's Nutrition Title cost estimate is largely the result of three SNAP policy decisions. The 2014 farm bill includes SNAP provisions that will reduce spending by $8.6 billion over 10 years. SNAP accounts for the largest amount of federal funding and serves the largest number of households. In FY2013, SNAP benefits were provided to 47.6 million individuals at a cost of $79.6 billion. During the 2008 farm bill period, SNAP participation and spending increased due to the recession and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The ARRA's SNAP benefit boost ended in November 2013, leading to forecasted reductions in SNAP participation and spending starting in FY2014. This has influenced the congressional debate on SNAP reauthorization. The 2014 farm bill includes provisions to reduce SNAP spending by $8.6 billion over 10 years, affecting program authorization, eligibility, benefit calculation, retailers, and other policies. The 2014 farm bill extended SNAP authorization through September 30, 2018, with provisions to reduce spending by $8.6 billion over 10 years. Congress provided appropriations for SNAP operations between FY2014 and FY2018. The House bill proposed reauthorization for three years, while the Senate's bill proposed five years. The 2014 farm bill extended SNAP authorization through FY2018, with the House proposing a three-year reauthorization and the Senate proposing five years. Some policymakers wanted to separate nutrition programs from the farm bill. Federal law sets eligibility rules for SNAP based on income and assets. Under traditional categorical eligibility, a SNAP applicant household is eligible for benefits when every member receives specific cash assistance programs. States have the option to also adopt \"broad-based\" categorical eligibility, where households receiving any TANF-funded benefit may qualify for SNAP benefits. As of July 2013, 43 states had implemented broad-based categorical eligibility for SNAP, allowing households at or below 200% of the federal poverty line to qualify for benefits. This option often means that applicants' assets are not checked. The 113th Congress debated changes to categorical eligibility but ultimately did not make any revisions. Section 4005 of the House proposal aimed to limit categorical eligibility for SNAP applicants, potentially reducing spending by $11.6 billion over 10 years. Approximately 1.8 million people per year could lose benefits under the proposed changes. SNAP law includes rules on work-related activities for participants, with variations in requirements due to state-specific SNAP Employment and Training Programs. SNAP law imposes a time limit on able-bodied adults without dependents who do not work a minimum of 20 hours per week, restricting benefits to three months over 36 months. States have some flexibility in enforcing this limit based on local labor market conditions. Policy makers have debated increasing work requirements for SNAP participants. The 2014 farm bill made little change to work requirements in SNAP. Most able-bodied adults must register for work, accept suitable job offers, and fulfill any work, job search, or training requirements to maintain eligibility. In FY2011, nearly 64% of SNAP participants were exempt from work requirements due to age or disability, with 45% being children, 9% elderly, and 10% disabled. States can disqualify individuals for failing to comply with work requirements for varying periods, ranging from one to six months, with the option to disqualify the entire household for up to 180 days if the household head fails to comply. In FY2013, states reported that 13.3 million SNAP participants were subject to work requirements and had to register for work. SNAP agencies must operate an Employment and Training program for work registrants, which may include job search, training, or workfare activities. States can also exempt certain individuals from participation in the program. The 2014 Farm Bill expanded states' Employment and Training (E&T) programs for SNAP participants, with nearly 640,000 participants placed in E&T services in FY2013. The bill also introduced a special time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents, known as the \"ABAWD Rule.\" The \"ABAWD Rule\" limits SNAP benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless they meet certain work requirements. States have the option to offer these individuals slots in employment and training programs or workfare programs, with some states receiving extra federal funding for pledging to serve all ABAWDs. Benefits can be terminated for those without at least a half-time job once the 3-month limit is reached, unless exemptions or waivers apply. The ABAWD Rule limits SNAP benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless exemptions or waivers apply. Those who lose benefits can reenter the program by working 80 hours or participating in a work/training activity within a 30-day period. ABAWDs who become employed but then lose their jobs can earn an additional 3 months of eligibility under certain circumstances, bringing their maximum months of SNAP receipt without meeting work requirements to 6 months in a 36-month period. The enacted law did not include proposed changes to this rule. Since the 2002 farm bill, SNAP E&T has been funded through various streams of federal funding, including $90 million in annual mandatory funds, $20 million for states providing E&T services to ABAWDs, matching funds for administrative costs, and matching funds for dependent care and transportation costs. Program requirements and funding uptake vary by state, with appropriations laws sometimes reducing the mandatory funding. The 2014 farm bill maintains the $90 million in E&T funding. The 2014 farm bill maintains $90 million per year in mandatory funding for SNAP E&T, with no changes to existing funding. Section 4022 allows some states to expand and test their programs, requiring reporting on outcomes. USDA is required to conduct pilot projects to test work and job readiness strategies for SNAP participants. The 2014 farm bill maintains funding for SNAP E&T programs with no changes. USDA is to conduct pilot projects testing work strategies for SNAP participants, including geographic diversity and targeting different subpopulations. The pilots must meet specific criteria and test mandatory and voluntary E&T participation models. The 2014 farm bill maintains funding for SNAP E&T programs with no changes. Pilot projects will test work strategies for SNAP participants, with funding of $10 million in FY2014 and $190 million in FY2015. Projects will run for a maximum of three years, with an independent evaluation of their impact on employment and earnings outcomes. States must set performance goals for existing SNAP E&T programs and report annually. The Senate's proposal did not change work-related policies, keeping funding at $90 million. The House's conference proposal included various approaches to work rules for SNAP E&T programs, such as additional monitoring of reporting, funding for pilot projects evaluation, repealing labor-market-based waivers, and creating a new pilot/state option for work requirements. This proposal aimed to reduce available E&T funding but allowed states to share savings if federal spending decreased as a result. The 2014 farm bill made changes to SNAP disqualifications, including new provisions and amendments. College students attending higher education courses half-time or more were mostly ineligible for SNAP benefits, with exceptions for certain criteria. The bill did not include the House's proposal for drug testing SNAP applicants. The 2014 farm bill introduced new criteria for SNAP eligibility, including exemptions for individuals under 18 or over 50, disabled, employed at least 20 hours per week, parents, TANF recipients, or enrolled in certain programs. There was no specific provision for lottery or gambling winners, but significant winnings could affect eligibility. P.L. 113-79 added regulations for post-secondary students and gambling winnings. The law adds specific rules for post-secondary students receiving substantial gambling winnings, making them ineligible for SNAP until they meet eligibility limits. State SNAP agencies must collaborate with state gaming agencies to determine winnings. The law allows states to require drug testing for SNAP applicants under certain conditions, but the conference agreement did not include a provision for states to conduct drug testing at their own cost. Previously, only drug felony offenses could impact SNAP eligibility, but the 2014 farm bill added disqualifications for individuals convicted of specified federal crimes and certain state offenses. The 2014 farm bill added disqualifications for individuals convicted of specified federal crimes and certain state offenses, including murder, rape, and crimes against children. The law allows states to collect information on SNAP applicants' convictions and disqualifies ex-offenders who are not compliant with their sentence or are \"fleeing felons.\" Household members of disqualified ex-offenders can still apply for benefits, but the benefit amount may be smaller. The disqualification does not apply to convictions before February 7, 2014. The House and Senate bills proposed disqualifications for individuals convicted of specified federal crimes and certain state offenses, including murder, rape, and crimes against children. The House included an additional provision to ensure the policy only affected those convicted after the enactment date. Eligibility for SNAP is just one step in the application process, with benefits calculated based on household size, income, and deductible expenses. Net income for SNAP benefits is determined by subtracting specified expenses from gross income, including deductions for excess shelter and medical expenses. 30% of net income is subtracted from the USDA's monthly maximum benefit to calculate the monthly benefit. The 2014 farm bill maintains current law on benefit calculation but changes the excess shelter deduction calculation method. The SNAP statute allows for deductions from income, including excess shelter and medical expenses. Heating and cooling expenses can increase the deduction, leading to a higher SNAP benefit. LIHEAP assistance can be used to document these expenses, triggering a standard utility allowance based on state average costs. The SNAP benefit calculation includes a Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) based on state average utility costs. Proof of heating or cooling expenses can increase the SUA, leading to a higher benefit. LIHEAP assistance must now be over $20 per year to be included in benefit calculations, affecting approximately 16 states that previously used nominal LIHEAP benefits through a \"Heat and Eat\" practice. The 2014 farm bill's change in the law requires more than $20 a year in LIHEAP assistance to trigger an increase in SNAP benefits, affecting 17 states. This change will not impact SNAP eligibility but may reduce benefit amounts, particularly for states that had implemented \"Heat and Eat\" policies. States and households may have some options within the new law. The new law allows states to delay implementation or reduce the impact for up to five months. States can issue LIHEAP payments over $20 to maintain benefit levels. Some states have already chosen to provide $20 of energy assistance. USDA has issued memos to guide state planning. Changes in SNAP benefits can lead to significant spending changes. The 2014 farm bill change will reduce SNAP spending by $8.6 billion over 10 years. Approximately 850,000 SNAP households could see a $90 reduction in benefits per month. The House and Senate passed related proposals, with the House setting a $20 threshold for LIHEAP payments. The farm bill (H.R. 2642 combined with H.R. 3102) included the $20 threshold for LIHEAP payments. Section 5(e) of the Food and Nutrition Act specifies parameters for an excess medical expense deduction for households with elderly or disabled members. Some states were including medical marijuana expenses in excess shelter deductions, but a memorandum from FNS clarified that SNAP medical deductions cannot be used for illegal substances like medical marijuana. States allowing this deduction must stop immediately. The farm bill clarified that SNAP benefits cannot be used for medical marijuana expenses. SNAP provides benefits on an EBT card for eligible foods. Non-compliant states may face penalties for overissuing benefits. Retailer-related provisions in the 2014 farm bill are significant. The 2014 farm bill introduces significant changes to SNAP retailer-related provisions, including requirements for becoming a SNAP retailer, using technology for EBT transactions, specific types of retailers that may accept SNAP, and measures to prevent benefit trafficking. SNAP benefits can only be accepted by authorized retailers based on inventory and sales criteria. The 2014 farm bill amended SNAP's definition of retail food store, requiring authorized retailers to carry perishable foods in at least three staple food categories and offer at least seven foods in each category. The law also gives USDA the authority to consider limited access to food in the retailer's location. The 2014 farm bill amended SNAP's definition of retail food store, requiring stores to carry perishable foods in three staple categories and offer seven foods in each category. The law also allows USDA to consider limited food access in store locations. Retailers can choose to purchase credit card machines that accept EBT at their own cost. Some small retailers still use manual SNAP vouchers instead of EBT machines. The 2014 law changed EBT equipment policy, shifting costs to retailers and requiring unique terminal identification numbers. Manual SNAP vouchers are now restricted unless approved by USDA for specific circumstances. This change is estimated to save $77 million over 10 years. The new farm bill requires USDA to consider existing commercial practices for EBT transactions and prohibits issuing regulations earlier than two years from enactment. Prior to this, government funding only covered wired EBT machines, with no explicit authorization for wireless or online transactions. $4 million from FY2012 funds was used to expand EBT devices at farmers' markets. Using SNAP EBT cards for online purchases was not allowed or technologically feasible before the new law. The new farm bill allows retailers to accept SNAP benefits over the Internet and through mobile technologies, pending demonstration project results. Prior to this, SNAP EBT cards could not be used for online purchases. The bill also includes provisions for mobile and online redemption demonstration projects. Additionally, the bill made shares in Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) establishments eligible for SNAP benefits. Prior to the 2014 law, non-profit grocery delivery services for the elderly and disabled were not considered \"retail food stores\" eligible to accept SNAP benefits. SNAP benefits are generally not redeemable at restaurants for hot, prepared foods, but states could choose to operate restaurant meals programs for homeless individuals. The 2014 farm bill expanded SNAP benefits to include Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares and allowed for redemption at restaurants offering concessional prices. Approximately $44.3 million of SNAP benefits were redeemed at \"meal delivery/private restaurants\" in FY2012. The law also added non-profit food purchasing and delivery services for the elderly and disabled to the definition of retail food stores, with restrictions on delivery fees paid with SNAP. USDA regulations are required to include protections and limitations for these services. The USDA may not approve more than 20 purchasing and delivery services until regulations are issued. The law added responsibilities for state agencies, private establishments, and USDA before restaurants can participate in a restaurant meals program. Restaurants contracted with the state to accept SNAP benefits can continue without meeting additional requirements for up to 180 days. Trafficking SNAP benefits is illegal and enforced by USDA-FNS with penalties including fines and imprisonment. An analysis of trafficking during the 2009-2011 period estimated a rate of 1.3%, up from 1.0% in a previous study. Current law imposes penalties, including fines and imprisonment, for SNAP trafficking. USDA enforces penalties through various activities funded by the SNAP account. Approximately $8 million annually was allocated for retailer integrity and trafficking in FY2010-2012. Increasing monitoring and penalties for lost EBT card replacement could help curb trafficking, with FNS proposing a new rule in this regard. Agencies may collect a fee for replacing an EBT card by reducing the monthly allotment of the household. The 2014 farm bill provides funding to track and prevent SNAP trafficking, with $15 million in mandatory funding available until expended. Additional measures in the bill address the purposeful loss of cards, allowing USDA to decline replacement requests without explanation. The Senate and House proposed different funding amounts for USDA, with the Senate authorizing $5 million annually and the House providing $5 million annually for three years. The 2014 farm bill allows agencies to collect a fee for replacing an EBT card by reducing the household's monthly allotment. The bill also includes measures to prevent SNAP trafficking and address the purposeful loss of cards, with USDA able to decline replacement requests without explanation. Policy makers aimed to reduce federal spending in the Nutrition Title without affecting benefits, but it can be challenging as most of the SNAP spending goes towards benefits. The 2014 farm bill introduced measures to prevent SNAP trafficking and loss of EBT cards. State agencies can receive $48 million per year in performance awards for achievements in payment accuracy and program access. Performance awards were established in the 2002 farm bill and were expanded to include measures other than payment accuracy rates. Bonus awards were given to 52 out of 53 state agencies from FY2003 to FY2011. There was no requirement for these awards to be reinvested in SNAP. Under the 2002 farm bill revision, states can receive performance awards for payment accuracy and program access in SNAP. Sanctions are only imposed on states with high error rates for two consecutive years. The law now requires these awards to be reinvested in the program. The House bill sought to repeal USDA's authority to issue performance awards and the related $48 million in funding. Formerly SNAP Nutrition Education, this program provides grant funding for states to offer programs for SNAP participants and low-income households. The authorizing law provides mandatory funding of $375 million in FY2011 for a nutrition education and obesity prevention program. The program received $401 million in FY2014 and funds may also be used for programs promoting physical activity. The House bill proposed reducing funding in FY2014, which would have resulted in a significant decrease in funding over 5 and 10 years. \"Programs in Lieu of SNAP\" are related programs operated by entities not running SNAP. In lieu of SNAP, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands operate nutrition assistance programs with unique service delivery. Indian tribal organizations may opt for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) instead of regular food stamp benefits, with federal government covering most expenses. Funding for these programs is included in the SNAP account, authorized by the 2014 farm bill. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) provides an alternative to SNAP for Indian Reservations by delivering a household food package. Funding for FDPIR is included within the SNAP account. The law authorizes a local foods pilot program in FDPIR and requires a feasibility study on tribes operating nutrition assistance programs. The 2014 farm bill includes mandatory funding for a feasibility study and a demonstration project for the purchase of traditional and local foods. Guam and the Virgin Islands participate in SNAP, while American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and CNMI do not. American Samoa and Puerto Rico receive mandatory funds for nutrition assistance block grants, while CNMI negotiates a block grant with USDA. Block grants offer flexibility but limited funding compared to SNAP. The 2008 farm bill authorized a study on including Puerto Rico in SNAP, with findings showing similarities and differences with NAP. Puerto Rico's administration of its block grant allows for flexibility in providing food assistance benefits, including the option to redeem up to 25% of the benefit as cash. The 2014 farm bill includes a policy to phase out cash assistance in Puerto Rico over time, starting with a mandatory $1 million study in FY2014. Cash allotment is crucial for many participants to buy non-food essentials like medicine and hygiene products. Families would need alternative ways to pay for these items as cash provision is phased out annually until no cash is provided in FY2021, with exceptions for vulnerable populations. The House proposal aimed to amend Puerto Rico's block grant, requiring benefits to be provided only in EBT form, not cash. For the Northern Mariana Islands, a feasibility study for a SNAP pilot was authorized with funding for administrative support. If the pilot was unfeasible, the funding would be added to the existing block grant. The Senate bill did not propose changes for these territories' programs. USDA commodity foods are purchased by the USDA for distribution to nutrition programs like TEFAP, CSFP, NSLP, SFSP, and CACFP. These programs provide a wide variety of fruit, vegetable, livestock, dairy\u2014fresh, frozen, and processed foods. The distribution includes \"entitlement commodities\" and \"bonus commodities\" based on requests from the agricultural producer community. All relevant provisions regarding commodity distribution are summarized in Table B-9. TEFAP, a USDA-FNS program supporting emergency feeding organizations, receives federal funding for entitlement commodity foods and administrative costs. It also gets bonus commodity donations from USDA. Mandatory funding for entitlement commodities is $250 million for FY2012 and onwards, with an adjustment for food-price inflation. An additional $100 million can be appropriated for TEFAP administrative costs. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for TEFAP's entitlement commodities by $125 million over five years and $205 million over 10 years. The Senate and House bills proposed differing amounts of mandatory funding increases for TEFAP. The new law increases funding for entitlement commodity by $333 million over 10 years. It also includes provisions for modifying labeling of Kosher and Halal foods at emergency feeding organizations. Additionally, funding for TEFAP will be available over a two-year period and reauthorizes TEFAP infrastructure grants. CSFP is a household-based food assistance program operating in 39 states, DC, and two Indian Tribal Organizations. The new law reauthorizes the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) through FY2018, with a change in eligibility rules to limit the program to low-income seniors. This change is not controversial as the majority of participants are already seniors, while women, infants, and children typically opt for the WIC program. FNS has issued guidance on implementing this provision. In FY2013, approximately 10% of federal assistance for the National School Lunch Program was in the form of USDA commodity foods. These foods are also provided to child-serving institutions participating in various food programs. The policies for USDA commodity food procurement are overseen by specific committees in Congress. The 2014 farm bill impacted USDA commodity foods in school meal programs, allowing schools to use entitlement commodity assistance for local purchases. Stakeholders have shown interest in this change. The new law extends USDA's authority for commodity food processing. The new law extends USDA's authority for commodity food processing, allowing for reprocessing agreements with private companies and retaining title to processed foods. It also includes provisions for purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables, creating a pilot grant program for local sourcing, and implementing a pulse crop pilot project for schools. The 2014 farm bill's Nutrition Title authorizes up to $10 million for pulse crops and products for schools. It reauthorizes programs like the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and introduces new funding for SNAP bonus incentive projects. Funding for the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program remains at $20.6 million through FY2018. The Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program funding remains at $20.6 million annually, with no need for additional appropriations. The House proposed expanding eligibility to include low-income families at nutritional risk, with 50% of funding designated for seniors. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program is permanently authorized and funded, with a House proposal suggesting changes to include frozen, canned, and dried products. The House proposed changes to the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, including allowing frozen, dried, and canned products. A pilot project will test these options in schools in five states with $5 million in funding. Additionally, the Community Food Projects grant program has increased funding and allows for infrastructure projects with 50% matching funds. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized a program with increased funding for eligible organizations and purposes, including gleaners. It also introduced a new grant program to provide incentives for SNAP households to purchase healthy foods. The new law includes $100 million in mandatory funding over five years for competitive grants that incentivize SNAP participants to buy fruits and vegetables. The USDA will house a consolidated Healthy Food Financing Initiative, with a community development financial institution as the \"national fund manager.\" The new law authorizes $125 million annually for a community development financial institution as the \"national fund manager.\" It includes detailed CBO cost estimates and a comparison of the 2014 Farm Bill's Nutrition Title."
