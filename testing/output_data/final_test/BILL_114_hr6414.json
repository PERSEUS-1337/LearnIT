The Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes, challenges, crowdsourcing, and citizen science to accelerate research, improve science literacy, and engage citizens in agency missions. Granting Federal agencies explicit authority to use these methods will promote their appropriate use and increase public participation in innovation. The Congress acknowledges the advantages of utilizing incentive prizes, challenges, crowdsourcing, and citizen science to speed up research, enhance science literacy, and involve citizens in agency missions. Granting Federal agencies the authority to use these methods will boost public participation in the innovation process, benefiting the Federal Government and participating citizens. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" refers to open collaboration in the scientific process, including formulating research questions, conducting experiments, and making discoveries. \"Crowdsourcing\" is a method to obtain services or content by soliciting contributions from a group, especially online. The terms defined in this section include Director, Federal agency, Participant, and Related entity for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. The term \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, grantees, investigators, fellows, and detailees of a Federal agency. Federal agencies are authorized to use crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches to advance their missions, and may accept voluntary services. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, as long as the services are unpaid and do not displace any government employees. The agencies must promote the projects for broad participation and ensure consent, registration, and terms of use are followed. Each Federal agency can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment required for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. When seeking consent, agencies must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms clearly. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing from participants. Federal agencies must ensure that crowdsourcing or citizen science projects involving human subjects comply with regulations. Data collected should be made open and available to the public in machine-readable formats, with participants informed of data uses during the consent process. Federal agencies must ensure that data and results from crowdsourcing or citizen science projects are made available to the public. Participants must be authorized to publish such data, and technologies developed through these projects should be open and available to the public. Each participant must agree to liability terms when participating in these projects. Citizen science projects must assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct. Federal agencies must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity policies. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science activities can share administrative duties with private sector entities, government agencies, or public institutions of higher education. Funding for these activities can come from Congress, other federal agencies, or private sector entities. Federal agencies can collaborate with private sector entities, government agencies, or public institutions of higher education for crowdsourcing or citizen science activities. The General Services Administration provides assistance in developing products and services to facilitate these activities. The Federal agencies can utilize contract vehicles and technology platforms to enhance their ability to carry out crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. Agencies are encouraged to consult guidance provided by the Director and designate a coordinator for these activities. Sharing best practices with other agencies is also recommended. A report is required to be submitted within 2 years of the date specified. The Director must include a report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies in the report required under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. The report should summarize project goals, participation rates, and other relevant statistics from the past 2 fiscal years. The report required under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act must include a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies. This summary should cover project resources, activities, obligations, expenditures, and the use of these methods across all Federal agencies. The Director must include a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies in the report. This summary should cover project resources, activities, obligations, expenditures, and partnerships. Additionally, the section includes savings provisions to ensure that this does not affect other authorized activities or displace resources allocated to agencies using crowdsourcing or citizen science."
