The country's significance in the global economy led to increased interest in bringing China into the WTO, with U.S. trade officials emphasizing the need for commercially meaningful terms to reduce trade barriers. China's WTO accession process was seen as an opportunity to gain greater market access and reduce the U.S.-China trade imbalance. Proponents believed it would also improve human rights by enhancing the rule of law and promoting the private sector in China. China officially joined the WTO on November 11, 2001. China officially joined the WTO on December 11, 2001, agreeing to bind tariffs, limit subsidies for agriculture, grant trade rights to foreign enterprises, provide non-discriminatory treatment to all WTO members, and eliminate dual pricing practices. China's WTO commitments include implementing the TRIPs Agreement, accepting a 12-year safeguard mechanism for export surges, opening the banking system to foreign institutions, allowing joint ventures in insurance and telecommunication with varying degrees of foreign ownership. U.S. officials and business groups closely monitor China's compliance, with a 2002 report highlighting significant progress but raising concerns. The USTR's second annual China compliance report in December 2003 highlighted significant progress in meeting WTO obligations but raised concerns over China's compliance in agriculture, services, IPR protection, tax policies, and transparency of trade laws. U.S. business groups, including the USCBC, also expressed growing concerns about China's ability to fulfill key commitments on time. The General Accounting Office survey in 2003 found that U.S. firms felt China had only partially implemented its WTO obligations. U.S. officials raised concerns about soybean exports to China due to new bio-engineered food rules. China agreed to interim safety certificates until new regulations are implemented. China issued new biotechnology regulations in October 2002, extending them through April 2004. U.S. exporters faced challenges with GMO shipments requiring safety certificates and import licenses. China's potential delay in approving GMO crops led to a U.S. protest, with analysts suggesting China aims to limit biotech imports. U.S. officials warned of taking the issue to the WTO for resolution. U.S. officials have warned of taking the issue to the WTO for resolution regarding China's tariff-rate quotas on agricultural products. U.S. soybean exports to China tripled in 2003, making China the largest market for U.S. soybean exports that year. U.S. firms accuse China of violating WTO rules with its allocation policy for tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on agriculture and manufactured products. USTR Robert Zoellick expressed concern in 2002 and warned of a potential dispute resolution case at the WTO in 2003. China made some improvements in TRQ regulations in 2004 but transparency issues persist, such as the failure to publish details of the 2004 TRQ allocation. China has failed to publish details of its 2004 TRQ allocation and continues to maintain two categories of import quota licenses for cotton. U.S. officials accuse China of subsidizing grain exports and cotton, using discriminatory taxes to discourage imports and favor domestic production. The USTR filed a WTO dispute resolution case against China for its discriminatory tax treatment of imported semiconductors. China applies a 17% VAT rate on imported semiconductor chips but offers a tax rebate if they are produced or designed in China. Despite new IPR laws, China's piracy rate for copyrighted products is estimated at 90%, costing U.S. firms $2.6 billion in lost sales in 2003. Some members of Congress urge the Administration to take WTO action against China for its lack of IPR enforcement. China pledged to reduce IPR infringement by cracking down on counterfeit goods. China faces challenges in complying with WTO obligations due to resistance from government officials, corruption, and lack of resources. Concerns about trade liberalization causing employment disruptions in sensitive sectors like agriculture contribute to hesitancy in implementing reforms. The government's focus on promoting critical industries, especially high tech, further complicates efforts to enforce intellectual property rights. China is promoting the development of critical industries, including high tech, while maintaining policies that favor domestic industries. Despite trade disputes, U.S. exports to China have increased significantly since it joined the WTO in 2001. Selected U.S. exports to China, such as poultry, soybeans, cotton, semiconductors, and autos, have seen substantial growth. The U.S. exports to China have increased significantly since China joined the WTO in 2001. However, there are concerns about China's compliance with its WTO commitments, including unfair trade practices such as dumping and currency manipulation. Congress may push the Bush Administration to address these issues using the WTO dispute resolution mechanism or U.S. trade laws like Section 301."
