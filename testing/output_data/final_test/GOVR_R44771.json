    "content": "Tax reform proposals aim to lower tax rates, broaden the tax base, and create a simpler tax system. The challenge lies in agreeing on crucial details such as rate reductions, modifications to tax provisions, and the type of tax system to implement. Policymakers are striving for comprehensive reform of the tax code to address federal deficits and debt. This report reviews recent legislative proposals for tax reform introduced since the 113th Congress. Congress could consider reforms to certain parts of the tax code as an alternative if comprehensive reform is not feasible. This could involve reforming the corporate tax system first, followed by the individual and payroll tax systems later. Another option is to focus on specific areas of the corporate system, such as international aspects. Evaluating business-only options, including changes to the corporate and individual systems for pass-through business income, is also a possibility. Before reviewing recent reform proposals, it is important to consider the criteria economists use to evaluate tax policy: equity, efficiency, and simplicity. Tax reform is a topic actively debated in the 115th Congress, with a focus on equity, efficiency, and simplicity in the tax system. Economists consider horizontal equity, vertical equity, and efficiency when evaluating tax policy. Tradeoffs may exist between these objectives. No comprehensive tax reforms have been introduced into legislation yet in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, two key tax reform proposals are being debated: the House GOP's \"A Better Way\" tax reform proposal and President Trump's campaign reform proposal. The GOP's proposal aims to consolidate individual tax rates into three brackets, reduce taxes on business income and capital gains, increase the standard deduction, and repeal certain tax provisions. To offset revenue loss, the proposal calls for the repeal of most itemized deductions. The House GOP's tax reform blueprint includes repealing most itemized deductions, personal exemptions, and certain tax expenditures. It also proposes reducing the corporate tax rate to 20%, implementing a territorial tax system, and a border adjustment. Overseas earnings would be subject to a deemed repatriation tax. President Trump's campaign proposal aims to consolidate individual income tax rates into three brackets, increase the standard deduction, limit deductions, and repeal certain taxes like the AMT and unearned Medicare tax. All businesses would face a 15% income tax, with changes to overseas operations and a deemed repatriation tax on foreign-source income. Most corporate tax expenditures would be eliminated except for the R&D tax credit. No legislation has been introduced for comprehensive individual tax reform as of the report date. Two bills introduced in the 115th Congress propose to repeal and replace the income tax system with a 23% national retail sales tax. The Fair Tax Act of 2017 (H.R. 25 and S. 18) would eliminate individual and corporate income tax, payroll taxes, self-employment tax, and estate and gift taxes. Families would receive a rebate on sales tax up to the federal poverty level. The Fair Tax Act of 2017 proposes a 23% national retail sales tax to replace income tax. Families would receive a monthly sales tax rebate up to the federal poverty level. States could collect the sales tax on behalf of the federal government. Taxpayer rights provisions are included in the act, and the sales tax would sunset after seven years if the Sixteenth Amendment is not repealed. The 114th Congress did not enact comprehensive tax reform or legislation to replace the income tax system. No legislative proposals were introduced in the 114th Congress to comprehensively reform the individual and corporate income tax systems. The House majority released a tax reform proposal blueprint in June 2016, and President Trump released a campaign tax reform proposal in September 2016. Several proposals to replace the income tax system were discussed. Several proposals to replace the income tax system were introduced in the 114th Congress, including the Fair Tax Act of 2015, the Flat Tax Act, and the SMART Act. The Fair Tax Act would have implemented a national retail sales tax, while the Flat Tax Act and SMART Act would have imposed a flat tax system similar to the Hall-Rabushka proposal. The Fair Tax Act of 2017 would have allowed individuals or businesses to elect a flat tax instead of existing provisions and repealed estate and gift taxes. The Flat Tax Act of 2017 proposed a flat tax system with initial rates of 19% for individuals not in business, decreasing to 17% after two years. It would apply to wages, retirement distributions, and unemployment compensation, with deductions based on filing status. Additionally, taxable income would include dependent children under 14. The Flat Tax Act of 2017 proposed a flat tax system with initial rates of 19% for individuals not in business, decreasing to 17% after two years. Deductions would be indexed for inflation using the consumer price index. Business owners under the flat tax would pay tax on gross revenue minus purchases, wages, and pension contributions. Government and nonprofit employers would pay a flat tax on employee fringe benefits. Any changes to the flat tax rate or standard deduction would require congressional action. The SMART Act (H.R. 1824/S. 929) proposed replacing current taxes with a flat tax system, including a 17% wage tax on all income except Social Security. It required a three-fifths vote in Congress to change the tax rate or standard deduction. The SMART Act proposed a flat tax system with a 17% wage tax on all income except Social Security. Social Security contributions would not be deductible and would be taxed from after-tax income. Firms and individuals would have to pay taxes on their contributions, with standard deductions based on filing status. Businesses would pay a 17% tax on the difference. The proposed business tax under the SMART Act would have been 17% on the difference between gross revenue and certain expenses, covering various types of businesses. Pension contributions would be deductible, but not fringe benefits. State and local taxes, payroll taxes, and excess deductions could be carried forward with interest. Government and nonprofit organizations would also pay a 17% tax on employees' fringe benefits, excluding retirement contributions. The American Business Competitiveness Act (H.R. 4377) proposed a top business tax rate of 25% on net income, with most credits and deductions repealed. Depreciation system would be replaced with expensing capital purchases, and interest would no longer be deductible. The proposed tax changes included expensing capital purchases for businesses, eliminating the deductibility of interest, and taxing interest income for individuals at the same rate as capital gains and dividends. Net operating losses could be carried back five years and forward indefinitely, all businesses would be required to use the cash method of accounting, and the AMT would be repealed for business income. Additionally, a territorial system for taxing overseas income and a cash flow tax similar to H.R. 4377 were part of the proposal. Other legislation aimed to eliminate the current tax code and implement a new, simple, and fair tax system. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1) proposed significant changes to the federal tax system, including modifications to individual, corporate, and business income taxes. It aimed to create a fair system with low rates for all Americans, tax relief for working individuals, and promotion of economic growth without penalizing marriage or families. Several tax reform proposals from previous Congresses may inform the current debate. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes to the federal tax system, including individual and corporate income taxes. It aimed to create fair tax rates, with two regular income tax brackets at 10% and 25%, and a top rate of 35%. Certain income thresholds would trigger the 35% bracket, with adjustments for inflation. Dividends and capital gains would be taxed as ordinary income, with 40% exclusion for net capital gains and qualified dividends. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed significant changes to the individual income tax system, including eliminating personal exemptions, increasing the standard deduction, and modifying various tax credits and deductions. Key changes included repealing the AMT, setting the standard deduction at $22,000 for joint filers and $11,000 for other filers, and phasing out the deduction for certain higher-income taxpayers. Additionally, the proposal aimed to scale back the mortgage interest deduction, earned income tax credit, and modify the charitable deduction and education incentives. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes to individual income tax, including eliminating personal exemptions, increasing the standard deduction, and modifying tax credits and deductions. The proposal also aimed to scale back the mortgage interest deduction, earned income tax credit, and modify charitable deduction and education incentives. The Act also proposed changes to corporate taxation, including taxing all C corporations at a top rate of 25% and modifying or eliminating various credits, deductions, and provisions. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed significant changes to corporate taxation, including repealing the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, the LIFO method of inventory accounting, and the corporate AMT. It also included modifications to the tax treatment of foreign source income earned by U.S. multinational corporations, such as a 95% exemption for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, changes to Subpart F rules, and a one-time tax on previously untaxed earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. The Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act (S. 1616) proposed consolidating tax brackets, repealing the AMT, and making changes to deductions. The Flat Tax Rate Act (H.R. 5882) suggested a single income tax rate of 15%. Other proposals in the 113th Congress aimed to replace the income tax system with alternative forms of taxation at the federal level. The Fair Tax Act of 2013 (H.R. 25 / S. 122) aimed to replace the current federal tax system with a national retail sales tax, while the Flat Tax Act (H.R. 1040) and the SMART Act (S. 173) proposed a flat tax rate of 17% on individuals' wages and businesses' taxable incomes. The American Growth & Tax Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 2393) proposed a progressive consumption tax to eliminate public debt, with options to add to existing federal taxes, replace individual income tax, or replace corporate income tax. The Progressive Consumption Tax Act of 2014 proposed a 10% consumption tax on goods and services, reducing individual and corporate income tax rates. It would broaden the income tax base, provide allowances for taxpayers, and replace refundable tax credits with rebates for lower-income families. The Tax Code Termination Act in the 113th Congress aimed to eliminate the existing tax code and create a new, simple, and fair system. The End Wasteful Tax Loopholes Act proposed to eliminate tax loopholes, enhance tax fairness, crack down on tax cheaters, and reform the federal tax code. Former Committee on Finance Chairman Max Baucus released discussion drafts related to tax reform in the 113th Congress, including international tax reform, tax administration, cost recovery, and energy tax policy. The proposal aimed to tax foreign-earned income and income from goods consumed in the US at the full rate, with alternatives for income from products and services sold abroad. Former Chairman Baucus proposed two options for taxing foreign-earned income, with \"Option Y\" subjecting all foreign income to a minimum tax rate of 80% of the U.S. rate, and \"Option Z\" taxing 60% of foreign active business income at the U.S. rate. Additionally, reforms to cost recovery and accounting rules were suggested, including the elimination of MACRS and the capitalization and amortization of certain intangibles. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes such as repealing LIFO inventory accounting rules, increasing small-business expensing allowances, and introducing clean energy production and investment tax credits. Former Chairman Baucus also released a discussion draft on tax administration and energy tax reform, including proposals to reduce the tax gap and incentivize clean energy resources. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes including repealing LIFO inventory accounting rules, increasing small-business expensing allowances, and introducing clean energy production and investment tax credits. The proposal also included a new tax credit for clean transportation fuels."
