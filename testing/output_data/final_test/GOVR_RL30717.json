    "content": "Human genetics has advanced, allowing scientists to use DNA for identification purposes in various scenarios like criminal cases, identifying human remains, determining biological relationships, and species identification. DNA evidence can link suspects to crimes or exclude them, and can be obtained from various sources like blood, semen, or items like a bottle cap or toothbrush. This report focuses on using human DNA for individual identity, but animal and plant DNA can also be used for species identification. The report discusses the use of genetic information for identification purposes, including species and individual identification. It addresses policy issues related to genetic information in the criminal justice system, technological advancements, privacy concerns, and individual rights. The report also outlines federal programs and activities related to DNA identification and highlights legislative activity in this area. The use of DNA in identification, also known as DNA typing or DNA profiling, is complex due to its unique characteristics. DNA is a chemical consisting of nucleotides connected in a linear sequence, with four bases - adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Each DNA molecule has two complementary strands, with specific base pairings. The DNA molecule contains the genetic code with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine pairing with cytosine. The Human Genome Project aims to map the DNA code and identify base sequences. Each person has billions of identical DNA copies in their cells, with 23 pairs of chromosomes inherited from parents. The DNA molecule contains genetic information inherited from both parents, with some DNA unique to the mother found in mitochondria. Each person has a unique nuclear DNA sequence, except for identical twins. Individual alleles on chromosomes are inherited intact from each parent. The DNA of individuals is inherited from both parents, with variations in DNA among people characterized by technologies used in DNA identification. Close relatives have more similar DNA than distant relatives or unrelated individuals. Half of a person's DNA comes from each parent, resulting in shared alleles among siblings, grandparents, and cousins. Sons inherit identical alleles on the Y chromosome from their fathers, while alleles in mitochondria are identical to the mother's. The inheritance patterns of DNA show that mitochondrial DNA is inherited through the maternal line alone, while Y-chromosome DNA is inherited from the paternal line. Most of a person's DNA has no known biological function, with genes containing the code for making specific chemicals. Nonfunctional segments of DNA can be characterized as markers using molecular biology techniques. DNA can be easily preserved intact in dried or frozen samples, but can degrade in warm or moist environments. Using DNA in identification involves comparing unknown DNA from a crime scene with known DNA from a suspect. Four basic steps are involved: characterization, comparison, calculation, and interpretation. The first step in DNA analysis for forensic evidence involves characterizing DNA sequences in samples to be compared, focusing on alleles at specific loci using markers like VNTRs, STRs, mtDNA, and simpler sequences. VNTRs have been the primary marker used due to their high variability among individuals. VNTRs and STRs are DNA markers used in forensic analysis. VNTRs are highly variable, with sequences of 15-70 bases repeated many times, while STRs have smaller repeated sequences of 2-4 bases. VNTR analysis requires more DNA and is not suitable for degraded samples, while STRs are less variable and require typing more loci for the same resolution. \"STRs are less variable than VNTRs, requiring more loci to achieve the same resolving power. However, STRs can be examined with smaller samples due to PCR technology, making them less likely to be damaged and yielding more usable results. Additionally, STRs can be processed more quickly in the lab and are easier to interpret, making them advantageous for forensic use.\" Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a valuable tool for forensic identification, especially in cases involving small or degraded samples. It can be extracted from skeletal remains and has been used to identify remains from past conflicts. However, mtDNA is less variable than STRs and VNTRs, making it less powerful for positive identifications and requiring comparison with maternal relatives. It also takes longer to analyze than STRs. Some nuclear DNA markers like DQA and Polymarker are simpler than STRs or VNTRs, requiring small amounts of DNA for analysis. While less variable, they are used for rapid elimination or further investigation in forensic cases, including paternity tests. DNA profiles are compared, and if alleles differ, the samples are deemed non-matching, indicating different origins. This is crucial in criminal investigations to exclude suspects. DNA can be used as a means of exclusion in criminal investigations and paternity cases. If DNA profiles do not match, it indicates different origins. This exclusion method is crucial in identifying suspects and determining biological relationships. The use of DNA in criminal investigations and paternity cases involves analyzing markers to estimate the probability of a coincidental match, rather than providing a definitive identification like fingerprints. This method of exclusion is important for identifying suspects and establishing biological relationships. The controversy over calculating probabilities in DNA identification has largely been settled. The process involves identifying the population frequency of each allele in the profile, which varies among subpopulations within a country. Data from relevant subpopulations, such as racial or linguistic groups, are used for comparisons. The process of calculating probabilities in DNA identification involves determining the population frequency of each allele in the profile, which can vary among subpopulations. This information is used to estimate the likelihood that someone drawn at random from the population would have that profile, with probabilities potentially reaching one in billions or even trillions. However, in some cases, probability calculations may not be feasible due to unknown allele frequencies or insufficient loci/alleles for accurate estimates. In DNA identification, calculations may not be necessary in certain cases, such as when one profile yields a match while the other does not. Mixed DNA samples can complicate analysis, making it challenging to separate contributions from different individuals. The interpretation of DNA results revolves around determining if someone can be excluded and assessing the likelihood of a match based on population frequencies of alleles. The interpretation of DNA results involves two key questions: confirming if the DNA matches the suspected source and determining the significance for the case. Probability calculations help answer the first question, but the threshold for a positive identification is not universally agreed upon. Unlike fingerprints, DNA probabilities are provided for interpretation by the jury or trier of fact. Fingerprints, unlike DNA, have been used for identification much longer and are not as amenable to statistical analysis. However, with DNA evidence, a very low probability estimate can be interpreted as a positive identification under certain conditions. The significance of a positive identification must then be determined, which can be complex in cases such as rape where the probability of a coincidental match is very small. In criminal cases, a match probability in DNA evidence should not be seen as proof of guilt but as evidence for consideration by the jury or judge. Population databases provide allele frequencies used to estimate profile frequencies and match probabilities, stratified by ethnicity. Population databases contain profiles of donors stratified by ethnicity or race. The databases can include profiles of convicted felons, victims of unsolved crimes, missing persons, and their relatives. Cold hits can be identified by searching these databases when a profile is obtained from an unknown source. The increasing number of cases involve identifying suspects through aDNA profiles from crime-scene samples searched against databases of convicted felons or unknown persons. Cold hits can be found by matching profiles from relevant samples to forensic databases. Federal agencies involved in DNA identification activities include the FBI, NIJ, and Bureau of Justice. The FBI, NIJ, and BJA in the Department of Justice, NIST in the Department of Commerce, and AFIP, CILHI, and USACIL in the Department of Defense are involved in forensic DNA evidence activities. The FBI Laboratory provides training, research, development in DNA typing technologies, and manages a national DNA database program for federal civilian cases. The FBI Laboratory is involved in forensic DNA evidence activities, including DNA typing technologies, a national DNA database program, and expert testimony in courts. It was the first public crime lab in the US to analyze forensic DNA evidence and currently performs mtDNA analyses. The lab administers the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which links local, state, and national DNA databases for comparison. CODIS began as a pilot program in 1990 and was authorized in the DNA Identification Act of 1994. Over 40 states now participate in CODIS, which includes a convicted offenders index. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 required states to collect DNA samples from persons convicted of certain crimes to be eligible for grants. All 50 states now collect samples from persons convicted of sexual felonies, with most also collecting samples from those convicted of murder or other violent crimes. The national component of CODIS, called NDIS, has been in operation since 1998 and includes various indexes for DNA profiles. NDIS, the National DNA Indexing System, has been operational since 1998, with laboratories in 24 states contributing DNA profiles. CODIS initially used VNTR markers but now uses more powerful STRs. NDIS utilizes thirteen core STR markers established as a standard set by the FBI's DNA Advisory Board. Quality control and assurance are crucial in DNA typing, leading to the establishment of standards by the FBI Director's DNA Advisory Board in 1998. These standards replaced those set by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods. The FBI's DNA Advisory Board sets standards for DNA profiling, with most crime labs following DAB or TWGDAM standards. DAB will dissolve in 2000, transferring functions to SWGDAM. The National Institute of Justice supports research to improve DNA profiling speed, reliability, and cost through various programs. The DNA Laboratory Improvement Program, funded by the DNA Five Year Research Program, aims to reduce processing time and cost of DNA samples, enhance reliability of DNA analysis, and develop technologies for crime scene analysis. Grants have been awarded to state and local governments to improve forensic laboratories' abilities to analyze DNA evidence. The Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 authorized grants for DNA identification programs and sample backlog elimination. The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence was established in 1997 to address postconviction DNA use, legal concerns, training, and future technological developments. The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence was established in 1997 to address postconviction DNA use, legal concerns, training, and future technological developments. Its members include representatives from various law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, defense lawyers, and other experts. The commission is developing reports on specific issues and making recommendations continuously. In 1998, the need to address a backlog of DNA samples was identified, leading to recommendations for handling postconviction DNA-typing requests in 1999. The Bureau of Justice Assistance supports state and local criminal justice programs, including grants for improving DNA-analysis capabilities of forensic laboratories. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plays a significant role in developing standards for DNA profiling and provides standard reference materials for testing the accuracy of DNA analyses in forensic laboratories. NIST also conducts research on new DNA-typing technologies through various programs. The Department of Defense collaborates with various agencies and private industry for DNA-forensic activities. DNA identification is used for criminal investigations and identifying military personnel remains. The DNA Registry was established in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm to collect samples from Armed Forces personnel. The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) processes DNA samples from military personnel for identification purposes. The repository holds over 3 million specimens. AFDIL assists in identifying remains in cases such as the Waco fire in 1993 and the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996. Another unit involved in DNA identification is the United States Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii (CILHI), which recovers and identifies remains of military personnel lost in past conflicts. The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) recovers and identifies remains of military personnel lost in past conflicts. AFDIL performs mtDNA analysis on the recovered remains and maintains a database of mtDNA profiles for matching. In June 1999, 154 matches were obtained, including the identification of First Lieutenant Michael J. Blassie, USAF, whose remains were interred as the Vietnam Unknown in Arlington National Cemetery. The United States Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) performs DNA analysis for criminal cases. The United States Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) conducts DNA analysis for criminal cases with a military connection, processing around 500 cases annually using STR analysis. They participate in CODIS, providing profiles for NDIS and searching for matches in ongoing investigations. Additionally, other federal agencies like the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health support research for DNA identification advancements. The Human Genome Project is supported by the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 addressed quality control and privacy issues related to DNA evidence in the United States. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 established quality assurance and privacy provisions for forensic laboratories receiving grants for DNA analysis. Recipients must meet FBI director's quality standards and undergo proficiency testing. DNA samples can only be used for law enforcement, judicial proceedings, and criminal defense, with anonymized samples allowed for population databases and research. The act also created the FBI's DNA Advisory Board for quality assurance recommendations. The FBI's DNA Advisory Board was established to recommend quality-assurance standards, proficiency testing, and CODIS indexes for DNA analysis. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2000 added an index for profiles from relatives of missing persons. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 authorized the application of CODIS to federal crimes and provided grants for state and local government participation. States must collect DNA samples from convicted persons to be eligible for grants. The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 established the National Human Genome Research Institute to review and fund proposals addressing ethical and legal issues related to the genome project. The Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 established the State Grant Program for Criminal Justice Identification, Information, and Communication to improve state capabilities in crime identification and promote compatibility among identification systems. Funding is authorized through FY2003. DNA samples are collected from convicted individuals and crime scenes in all 50 states, leading to increased workload in forensic laboratories. Casework and convicted-offender samples have significantly increased, requiring labs to prioritize sample analysis due to limited resources. Currently, there is a backlog in the United States of several hundred thousand DNA samples that have not been analyzed and entered into CODIS databases, leading to profiles not being available for database searches. Funding increase and conversion to core STR markers are proposed solutions to address this backlog. The backlog of DNA samples in the United States is causing profiles to be unavailable for database searches. More than 200,000 existing profiles may need to be retyped with STR technology. Failure to process backlogs may result in unsolved crimes and the destruction of crime-scene samples. Additionally, there are many owed samples from paroled or released convicts that have not been taken. The backlog of DNA samples in the United States is causing profiles to be unavailable for database searches. Prioritizing which samples to type first is crucial, as typing a person's DNA is less expensive than typing DNA from a crime scene. However, successful cold hits require typing both convicted persons and crime scene samples. Obtaining samples from individuals newly in custody is often easier than from those who have been released. Obtaining DNA samples from individuals in custody is easier than from those who have been released. Solving old crimes with DNA evidence can serve justice and prevent future crimes, but it may also have negative consequences such as retraumatizing victims. Additional federal funding to reduce the backlog could speed up processing of samples and increase the rate at which crimes are solved. The backlog is partly attributed to the success of the DNA Identification Act grant program. The DNA Identification Act grant program has contributed to the backlog of DNA samples. States vary in the crimes for which they collect DNA samples, including felony sex crimes, offenses against children, murder, assault, and more. Some states collect samples from juveniles and retroactively from incarcerated convicts. In the United Kingdom, the Forensic Science Service maintains a national DNA database with profiles of suspects charged, reported, cautioned, or convicted for crimes punishable by imprisonment. The database has yielded matches of suspects to crime scenes and profiles are removed if suspects are acquitted. Questions about cost-effectiveness in profiling convicted individuals are raised when considering broadening the range of qualifying crimes. The power of DNA evidence raises questions about the balance between using profiles for crime prevention and protecting civil liberties. Postconviction DNA analysis is crucial for exonerating the innocent, but issues arise regarding its appropriateness and the role of the federal government. DNA analysis may not have been done during the original prosecution for various reasons, such as the suspect's identity not being in question, no DNA evidence being found initially, or limitations in technology at the time. Relevant DNA evidence may have been inconclusive due to technological constraints. DNA technology has evolved significantly since the original prosecution, with the more sensitive STR technology becoming standard in the late 1990s. This advancement allows for analysis of smaller or degraded samples, potentially leading to definitive exclusions or strong matches. Improvements in DNA technology continue, making even more samples amenable to typing. Despite most states limiting new trials based on newly discovered evidence to within three years after conviction, properly handled DNA evidence remains stable and can provide useful information even ten years or more later. The stability of DNA evidence, advancements in technology, and its exclusionary power raise questions about extending time limits for cases with newly discovered DNA evidence. Some states allow postconviction DNA analysis for those claiming innocence, prompting considerations for federal legislation on jurisdiction, evidence standards, and procedural requirements. As DNA technology advances, questions arise about preserving evidence, requiring samples from third parties, and compensating wrongfully convicted individuals. The use of DNA in paternity cases raises issues regarding legal acknowledgment of paternity versus biological fatherhood. Current research on improving DNA identification is mainly supported by NIST, NIJ, the FBI Laboratory, AFDIL, and private industry. The research aims to enhance sensitivity of analyses for typing from smaller or degraded samples, improving specificity for positive identifications, even among identical twins. States vary in their treatment of legal responsibility for child support in cases where the biological father is not involved. Child advocates are concerned about the potential negative impacts on children if challenges to paternity are allowed. Research on improving DNA identification aims to enhance sensitivity and specificity for positive identifications, even among identical twins. Cost reductions and advancements in automation and miniaturization may lead to more widely available DNA analysis. The development of an automated, portable DNA-typing system for on-site analysis is a possibility in the future. It is believed that STR markers will remain the standard for DNA identification. Research suggests that STR markers will continue to be the standard for DNA identification, while mtDNA may be used for degraded samples. Efforts to amplify longer sequences could lead to the use of VNTR or other variable systems. The Human Genome Project is uncovering small genetic differences like SNPs, which could improve marker systems and potentially reveal physical characteristics like eye color from genetic sequences. Future improvements in DNA typing face challenges in validation and acceptance by scientific, law enforcement, and court communities. Technological advances in DNA profiling are validated by scientific and law enforcement communities before being widely used in cases. There are concerns about the impact of new technologies on the appeals process and post-conviction petitions. Balancing these concerns with the ability of advances to reverse or avoid wrongful convictions is crucial. Technological advances in DNA profiling are validated by scientific and law enforcement communities before being widely used in cases. FBI experts can testify that a person is the source of a DNA sample if the match probability is low enough. However, the exact probability or number of loci needed to eliminate the possibility of a coincidental match is still debated. Match probabilities do not account for errors in the laboratory or evidence custody chain. The stability of DNA evidence raises questions about its usefulness in post-conviction typing and the potential for misidentification. The use of DNA evidence in post-conviction cases raises questions about extending statutes of limitations for crimes. As DNA profiles from \"cold cases\" increase in databases like CODIS, the balance between effective prosecutions and victim trauma needs to be considered. Differences and similarities exist between DNA for identification and medical genetic tests, both relying on genetic differences among individuals. The characteristics of DNA sequences used for identification and genetic tests differ in variability, functionality, and independence. Genetic markers for identification need to be highly variable with many alleles, while genes in genetic tests are usually not highly variable. Independence refers to whether loci are inherited together or independently. In genetic testing, linkage is not usually important as loci on different chromosomes are usually unlinked. DNA identification requires examining multiple loci that are independent for accurate results. Noncoding sequences are of interest in identification as they work best with the mathematics used. Some loci used in identification may be linked to coding loci related to genetic diseases. Regulation and accreditation of laboratories performing genetic tests are done through various mechanisms. Clinical laboratories must be certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Standards are set by the Health Care Finance Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Medical research labs supported by federal funds are subject to policies protecting human subjects. Forensic labs need to adhere to standards for DNA Identification Grants. To be eligible for DNA Identification Grants or Byrne Grants, laboratories must adhere to FBI standards and undergo proficiency testing. DNA evidence in criminal and civil cases must undergo judicial scrutiny, which may challenge custody-chain and quality-control procedures. New DNA technologies are adopted slower for forensic use than for medical testing. There is currently no federal law governing genetic privacy and discrimination, but Congress and the executive branch have taken some actions. The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts agencies from disclosing personally identifiable information. Federal laws and guidelines provide privacy protections for personal information, including genetic discrimination against executive branch employees. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 ensures DNA samples are only used for law enforcement identification purposes, judicial proceedings, and criminal defense. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 restricts the use of DNA samples to law enforcement identification, judicial proceedings, criminal defense, and certain limited purposes for federal, state, and local participants in CODIS. State laws vary in how samples can be used, leading to some disagreement over the adequacy of privacy protections. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 limits the use of DNA samples to law enforcement purposes and certain authorized procedures. Genetic markers used in DNA identification differ from medical genetic testing, raising privacy and discrimination concerns. New advances in genomics may lead to convergence of issues between DNA profiling and genetic testing. Research laboratories have used STR typing for added protection against mislabeling. DNA identification advancements may broaden applications, raising privacy concerns. Private-sector practices like parents obtaining DNA samples from children are not federally regulated. Other countries involve government agencies in DNA-identification activities. The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is a British Government agency operating as a nonprofit corporation, offering DNA profiling services for employee security and paternity analysis for the public. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential misuse of genetic information, with the risk of \"function creep\" in expanding DNA applications beyond their original intent. DNA typing has the potential for various uses in identity verification due to decreasing costs and easier sample collection. Privacy concerns may arise if coding loci are used for identification, similar to issues seen in medical testing. Additionally, the use of DNA samples from individuals or crime scenes raises privacy and discrimination concerns. DNA samples obtained from individuals or crime scenes contain the person's entire genetic code, posing potential privacy concerns regarding the disposition of samples. An example involving Toysmart.com highlighted issues with sharing customer information during bankruptcy. Additionally, DNA samples not only reveal information about the subject but also their biological relatives. Consideration of privacy issues related to DNA identification must also take into account potential impacts on family members. Difficult scenarios may arise, such as whether a sibling of a convicted offender should be arrested based on a similar DNA profile, or if the DNA profile of a sibling can be examined to determine its similarity to crime-scene evidence. Such dilemmas are likely to occur as DNA is more widely used in identification. The growing use of DNA for identification poses policy challenges as it overlaps with medical genetic testing. New issues may arise as technology evolves, making legislative responses difficult due to the biological role of DNA and its information about family members."
