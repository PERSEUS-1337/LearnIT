    "content": "In the early session of the 112th Congress, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2011 (S. 1000) was introduced by Senators Shaheen and Portman. The bill was reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (SENR) in July 2011 with five major provisions aimed at promoting energy efficiency in buildings and industries. Title IV of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act aimed to improve energy efficiency in federal agencies through advanced computer tools. In the 113th Congress, a modified version of the bill, S. 761, included provisions for model building energy codes, commercial building energy efficiency financing, industrial energy efficiency, and federal agency measures. S. 761, a modified version of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, dropped a $400 million provision for credit support for energy efficiency measures and added a $250 million provision for a Commercial Building Energy Efficiency Financing Initiative. It also removed some federal agency provisions, including agency implementation plans and web tracking for energy and water use. Compared to S. 1000, S. 761 focused on a new state grant program in Title II and trimmed federal agency measures. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act was modified to create S. 761, which introduced a new state grant program in Title II and removed some federal agency provisions. The bill was discussed in a hearing by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and reported on in June 2013. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a net discretionary cost of $210 million over a 5-year period for S. 761, with new authorizations of appropriations totaling $480 million. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 761, includes funding for energy-efficient buildings, rebates for efficient motor controls and transformers, and promotion of energy-efficient supply chains. The bill proposes expanding agencies' authority for energy savings contracts, increasing spending by $350 million from FY2014 to FY2023. CBO found that the bill mandates state and tribal governments to certify building energy codes but falls below UMRA's cost threshold. S. 1392, introduced to replace S. 761, is deficit-neutral and based on voluntary provisions. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported the bill by a vote of 19-3. S. 1392 retained most provisions of S. 761 but dropped Title II, cutting the total bill authorization by $250 million. The introduced bill S. 1392, which replaced S. 761, had changes that reduced the total bill authorization by $250 million. Section 403 of S. 761 was removed, impacting federal agency use of energy savings contracts for natural gas and electric vehicles. CBO reports that S. 1392 would not significantly affect direct spending or revenues. The bill focuses on building energy codes, industrial energy efficiency, federal agencies, and budget offsets. The bill S. 1392 focuses on building energy codes and industrial energy efficiency. It includes provisions for creating building training centers at colleges, grants for career skills training programs, and expanding DOE's industrial materials program. The bill aims to promote energy and environmental performance in residential and commercial buildings, as well as in industry. The bill S. 1392 aims to improve coordination of Industrial Research and Assessment Centers (IRACs), fund outreach to IRACs, expedite loans recommended by IRACs, perform industrial process energy efficiency assessments, create a partnership program on sustainable manufacturing, establish a \"Supply Star\" program for energy-efficient supply chains, and create rebate programs for energy-efficient electric motors and transformers. Title III of bill S. 1392 aims to improve energy efficiency at federal agencies through provisions such as issuing guidance for using information technologies, updating building designs for energy efficiency, and setting goals for energy savings. Title IV provides a budgetary offset by reducing authorization for the Zero Net Energy Commercial Buildings Initiative. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) initiated an energy-saving bill, S. 1392, supported by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). ACEEE estimated energy and cost savings for each provision of the bill using a bottom-up analysis. The bill sponsors have broad support from 260 business, environmental, and other organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) initiated an energy-saving bill, S. 1392, supported by various organizations including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, Sierra Club, NRDC, ACEEE, and the Christian Coalition. The Obama Administration expressed support for the bill, highlighting its alignment with the President's Climate Action Plan and goal to reduce energy waste by 2030. Opposition to the bill comes from Heritage. Heritage Action opposes the Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative bill, arguing it would impose voluntary standards on states with federal incentives, claiming it offers negligible environmental benefits and assumes individuals act irrationally without government intervention. They believe businesses can save money without taxpayer-funded mandates and regulations. Comments reference a Heritage Foundation study questioning the bill's promised savings for families and businesses. The document questions the need for taxpayer money to fund initiatives promising savings for families and businesses, specifically focusing on S. 761 on buildings and industry. The Senate voted on S. 1392 with a consent agreement restricting amendments related to Syria or military force. An amendment to the Affordable Care Act (S.Amdt. 1866) was proposed, blocking voting on other amendments. By September 19, 2013, 125 amendments had been discussed. By September 19, 2013, a total of 125 amendments had been proposed, categorized into 75 on energy efficiency, 23 on other energy and carbon emissions, and 27 on non-energy amendments covering health care and environmental regulations. The amendments were published in the Congressional Record on various dates. 75 energy efficiency amendments had been filed, some identified as bipartisan, and discussed during floor sessions. During floor discussion, bill sponsors and managers have referred to a varying number of bipartisan amendments, ranging from \"nearly a dozen\" to \"16,\" identified for floor action. The ACEEE report estimates energy and cost savings for 13 energy efficiency amendments, including weatherization program reauthorization, school retrofits, Better Buildings/Tenant Star, building benchmarking, nonprofit energy efficiency, disaster relief, and Race to the Top. The curr_chunk discusses various amendments filed related to energy aspects and climate concerns, covering policy areas such as renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions, natural gas vehicles, and petroleum issues. One notable amendment involves support for the Keystone XL Pipeline. Most other amendments focus on carbon/greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, and energy-related regulations. As of September 19, 2013, 23 amendments had been filed related to health care, environmental regulations, and other non-energy concerns. The amendments are grouped by issue areas, with seven focusing on changes to the Affordable Care Act. S.Amdt. 1866 and S.Amdt. 1908 have been the subject of major floor debate, with most non-energy amendments proposing changes to EPA regulations and the Affordable Care Act. The most debated amendment, S.Amdt. 1866, would impact health insurance coverage for Members of Congress and other federal employees. Debate on this amendment occurred on September 11, 12, and 17, 2013, with the sponsor later introducing a similar stand-alone bill, S. 1497. The sponsor requested immediate consideration and a vote on S.Amdt. 1866, blocking action on other amendments. The sponsor of the debated amendment, S.Amdt. 1866, requested immediate consideration and a vote before the open enrollment period starting on October 1, 2013. The sponsor emphasized the need for action on the provisions of the amendment, seeking a guarantee that it would be brought for a vote on any active legislative vehicle. However, the enacted CR (P.L. 113-46, H.R. 2775) did not include the provisions of S.Amdt. 1866. The issues surrounding the Keystone XL Pipeline are discussed in detail in CRS Report R41668. The Keystone XL Pipeline, proposed by TransCanada Corporation, would transport oil from Canada and North Dakota to Nebraska, then to Gulf Coast refineries. It requires a Presidential Permit based on national interest factors. Environmental impacts are assessed in an Environmental Impact Statement. The debate over S.Amdt. 1908 on the Keystone XL Pipeline project took place on September 12, 2013. Proponents expressed concern over the delay in issuing the Presidential Permit for TransCanada to begin work on the pipeline. In the floor debate over SA 1908 regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline project, supporters argued that it would create jobs, increase tax revenues, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Opponents claimed that controversy and environmental concerns were causing delays in the project approval. The Keystone XL Pipeline project was debated in the Senate, with supporters emphasizing job creation, tax revenue generation, and reduced dependence on foreign oil. Opponents raised concerns about controversy and environmental issues causing delays in project approval. Leaders of major oil companies stated the pipeline is no longer critical for growth, while supporters highlighted job estimates and improved energy independence. Opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline project argue that it would primarily benefit corporate profits by exporting oil overseas, rather than promoting national energy independence. They also raise concerns about environmental impacts, despite supporters claiming the pipeline would be safer and more efficient than alternative transportation methods. Opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline project raise concerns about its environmental impacts, citing the potential for significant carbon emissions and risks of oil spills. They also argue that the pipeline would divert funds from clean energy initiatives. Amendments related to fossil fuel use, carbon emissions regulation, and regional haze regulation have sparked controversy. The Hoeven-Manchin amendment (S.Amdt. 1917) aims to repeal a section of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which prohibits fossil fuel use in new federal buildings after 2030. It proposes tighter energy efficiency guidelines and a 36% energy reduction target for 2017 compared to 2003. Supporters argue the existing prohibition is unworkable, while opponents fear it would undermine federal leadership on net-zero energy buildings and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. An alternative amendment (S.Amdt. 1919) by Whitehouse seeks to address near-term concerns by removing incremental targets before 2020. The Hoeven-Manchin amendment aims to repeal a section of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which prohibits fossil fuel use in new federal buildings after 2030. An alternative amendment by Whitehouse seeks to address near-term concerns by removing incremental targets before 2020. EPA regulations aim to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, focusing on six types of gases linked to climate change, with carbon dioxide being the most prevalent. The EPA regulations focus on limiting carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide being the most prevalent type, accounting for nearly 85% of annual emissions. Concerns have been raised about the economic impacts of GHG regulations, with some arguing that the case for controls has not been proven. EPA argues that the Clean Air Act already requires action based on a 2007 Supreme Court decision. Several proposed amendments to S. 1392 relate to EPA regulation of carbon/GHG emissions, with no floor debate on these amendments. The regional haze issue is addressed in CRS Report RL30853, which sets national goals for visibility in parks and wilderness areas. Amendments would modify, limit, or prohibit certain provisions of EPA regional haze regulations. Several proposed amendments to S. 1392 address EPA regulations, including regional haze regulations. Some of the non-energy amendments have not yet been debated on the floor. Examples include amendments to repeal the renewable fuel standard and tax credits for alternative fuels. These proposals could potentially spark significant floor debate. The Senate faced challenges in reaching an agreement on various amendments, including those related to wind farms and renewable energy technologies. Despite efforts to limit debate and voting time, disagreements arose over non-energy amendments, leading to a shift in focus towards a continuing resolution and raising the federal debt ceiling. Floor managers are working to resolve CR, shutdown, health care, and debt limit issues to resume action on S. 1392. Efforts are ongoing to narrow the list of amendments and allow votes on S.Amdt. 1908 and possibly S.Amdt. 1866. They are considering incorporating a select group of amendments into the bill to secure enough votes for a cloture vote. Title I of S. 1392 focuses on energy-efficiency improvements in buildings, highlighting the complexity and barriers in this area. Title I of S. 1392 aims to strengthen model building energy codes for residential and commercial buildings to improve energy efficiency. The Department of Energy would work with states and private industry to make the code-writing process more transparent. States that adopt codes meeting or exceeding the model codes would be eligible for federal training and funding assistance. Incentives would be provided to train the next generation of workers in energy efficiency. Subtitle A of S. 1392 focuses on building energy codes, amending sections of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to facilitate DOE updates of model codes for new construction. DOE would provide technical assistance and incentives to states and tribes adopting codes exceeding the model standards to achieve energy savings targets. The text chunk discusses the achievement of energy savings targets through building energy codes that exceed model standards. It defines a \"model building energy code\" as a voluntary code developed through a consensus process. The code elements are drawn from various organizations such as the International Code Council and ASHRAE. Compliance with these codes is supported through certification and updates. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for states and Indian tribes to self-certify the adoption of model building energy codes, compliance with energy savings targets, and reporting on code updates. The DOE would provide support by reporting on code status, offering technical assistance, and establishing incentive funding for code implementation. Establish incentive funding for states and Indian tribes to implement and improve building energy codes, promote energy efficiency, and develop stretch codes and advanced standards. Provide technical and financial support for energy-efficient building design. DOE to analyze code improvements and options for substantial energy savings compared to model codes. The DOE would work with states, tribes, and local governments to update building energy codes by setting energy-saving targets. This includes measures like making buildings more adaptable for zero-net-energy use and incorporating lifetime energy use in calculations. Compliance would be verified through methods other than self-certification. DOE would set energy savings targets for residential and commercial buildings, based on the 2009 IECC for residential and ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2010 for commercial buildings. Targets would be revised to be technologically feasible, cost-effective, and promote high-performance buildings. Initial targets must be set within a year, considering efficiency gains in appliances, lighting, windows, insulation, and building sealing. The DOE aims to set energy savings targets for residential and commercial buildings, considering advancements in appliances, lighting, insulation, and building sealing. They will also focus on distributed generation, on-site renewable power, heating/cooling improvements, building management systems, and SmartGrid technologies to reduce energy use. Additionally, DOE will provide technical assistance for model codes and standards development. Subtitle A of Title I focuses on setting energy savings targets for buildings and providing technical assistance for model codes and standards development. DOE would recommend adjustments to the energy code if revisions do not meet the targets. $200 million would be authorized for appropriations. Subtitle B involves establishing building training and assessment centers at universities and colleges to promote energy efficiency opportunities and train engineers and architects.

DOE would recommend adjustments to the energy code if revisions do not meet the targets. $200 million would be authorized for appropriations. Subtitle B involves establishing building training and assessment centers at universities and colleges to promote energy efficiency opportunities and train engineers and architects. Additionally, funding of $10 million would be authorized for career skills training programs to help students become certified in installing energy-efficient building technologies. Title II focuses on industrial efficiency and competitiveness, aiming to reform DOE's industrial efficiency programs, accelerate technology deployment, strengthen partnerships, and stimulate industrial productivity and competitiveness. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 would be amended to rename the energy-intensive industries subprograms as the Future of Industry Program. Program modifications and initiatives include defining an \"energy service provider\" company, assessing sustainable manufacturing goals, improving coordination with manufacturing partnership centers, increasing partnerships with ESPCs, funding outreach activities by industrial assessment centers, funding federal share of industrial internship programs, and expediting applications from eligible small businesses. Subtitle B of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act would create a new program called Supply Star to promote sustainable manufacturing and industrial technologies. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would conduct on-site assessments for manufacturers to improve energy efficiency and conservation practices. Additionally, industry-government partnerships would be established to research and develop new sustainable manufacturing processes. Subtitle B of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act introduces the \"Supply Star\" program at DOE to promote efficient supply chains that conserve energy, water, and resources. DOE will evaluate products based on their lifecycle energy and resource use, excluding climate change and outsourcing of American jobs as positive factors. Grants and incentives will be awarded for studying and improving supply chain efficiency, with $10 million authorized for funding. Subtitle C: Electric Motor Rebate Program (\u00a7221) DOE would establish a rebate program for purchasing and installing energy-efficient electric motors and equipment. The rebate would be capped at $250,000 per entity, with $10 million authorized for funding over FY2014-2023. Subtitle D: Transformer Rebate Program (\u00a7231) DOE would create a rebate program for energy-efficient electric power transformers. The Transformer Rebate Program aims to promote energy-efficient electric power transformers meeting NEMA \"Premium Efficiency\" standards. Rebates range from $5 to $15 per kilovolt-ampere for three-phase transformers and 75% of that for single-phase transformers. Funding of $5 million for FY2014 and FY2015 each is allocated, with the program ending on December 31, 2015. The DOE would issue guidance to federal agencies on using advanced tools for energy efficiency. Agencies must report plans and savings estimates. GSA can use funds to update building designs for energy efficiency, not exceeding cost savings. The bill aims to achieve energy and cost savings through updates to federal data centers, with a goal set for a five-year period. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program of the Department of Defense is exempt from this provision. Funding offsets for the bill include reducing funding for the zero net energy commercial buildings initiative for FY 2014. The bill aims to achieve energy and cost savings through updates to federal data centers over a five-year period, with funding offsets including a reduction in funding for the zero net energy commercial buildings initiative for FY 2014 through FY2017."
