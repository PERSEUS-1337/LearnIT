    "content": "Parameters are crucial in machine learning models, and re-learning them can be time-consuming. A framework based on optimal transport theory proposes adapting model parameters by finding correspondences between models and data, reducing training costs. This approach is demonstrated in creating probabilistic spatial representations for autonomous robots, addressing the computational challenges in learning diverse spatial parameters in Bayesian models. The idea leverages the similarity of geometric features observed by robots in different environments. In this paper, the focus is on re-using parameters and hyperparameters learned in different domains to make adaptation more computationally efficient for robots. Experiments show that transferring thousands of parameters incurs minimal time and memory costs, enabling large-scale mapping in urban environments. The traditional approach of re-learning parameters from scratch is deemed redundant in the face of abundant data and diverse problem sets. In this paper, the focus is on improving training time by transferring model parameters from source datasets to a target dataset in a zero-shot fashion. The main challenge hindering models like automorphing Bayesian Hilbert maps (ABHMs) from real-world use is the high run-time cost of learning thousands of parameters and hyperparameters. The paper focuses on transferring model parameters from source datasets to a target dataset in a zero-shot manner to improve training time. The ABHM model's \"geometry-dependent spatial features\" are adapted using Optimal Transport theory, bypassing explicit parameter learning. An occupancy model is a parameterized function giving the probability of a point being occupied in the environment. The ABHM model uses LIDAR data to estimate parameters for Bayesian logistic regression in a high-dimensional feature space. Occupancy probability is calculated using a sigmoid function with weights and spatial kernels. Parameters are learned from LIDAR data, and spatial features are adapted using Optimal Transport theory for zero-shot transfer of model parameters. In this section, a framework is proposed for adapting parameters and hyperparameters of a Bayesian mapping model using pre-trained maps to extract LIDAR scans and corresponding model parameters. The source LIDAR data with learned parameters from ABHM is defined as the source atom in a trainable environment. The framework proposes adapting parameters and hyperparameters of a Bayesian mapping model using pre-trained maps to extract LIDAR scans. The objective is to determine a new set of parameters through a nonlinear mapping technique from a source to a target, recognized as an optimal transport problem. The entropic regularization, known as the Sinkhorn distance, enables solving the problem efficiently. The optimal coupling between source and target LIDAR is achieved using regularization parameter \u03bb. Source parameters are transported to the target domain through a linear map. Individual ABHM maps are learned for different areas, creating a dictionary of atoms X (S) for transferring atoms from various domains to the target. The algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1, with experiments conducted using the Carla simulator and KITTI benchmark dataset. Dosovitskiy et al. (2017) and KITTI benchmark dataset Geiger et al. (2013) were used for experiments, comparing vanilla variational inference and variational inference with reparameterization trick. Two paradigms were considered: intra-domain and inter-domain transfer. In intra-domain transfer, source atoms are generated from the first 10 frames of a dataset, and parameters are transferred within the model. The method involves Parameter Optimal Transport, where training domains correspond to pre-learned models, and data-space correspondences are found using optimal transport. Our method utilizes optimal transport maps to transfer pre-learned parameters to out-of-sample test domains, reducing knowledge loss during the transfer process. Results for intra-domain and inter-domain transfer are presented in Table 4, with a focus on building instantaneous maps using dynamic datasets. The study evaluates the performance of building instantaneous maps in dynamic environments using two dynamic datasets: SimCarla and RealKITTI. The model's test performance was assessed using accuracy (ACC), area under ROC curve (AUC), and negative log-likelihood (NLL). Results show the transfer of features from different towns to the dynamic datasets."
