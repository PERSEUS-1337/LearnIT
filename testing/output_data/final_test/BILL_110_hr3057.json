    "content": "The Medicare Long-Term Care Patient Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 is the short title of this Act. The table of contents for this Act is provided. The Medicare Long-Term Care Patient Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 includes definitions of long-term care hospitals, implementation of facility and patient criteria, establishment of rehabilitation units, expanded review of medical necessity, and quality improvement initiatives. \"Long-Term Care Hospital\" is defined in the Medicare Long-Term Care Patient Safety and Improvement Act of 2007, which includes criteria for facilities and patients, establishment of rehabilitation units, review of medical necessity, and quality improvement initiatives. The term \"long-term care hospital\" is defined as an institution primarily providing inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries with complex medical conditions requiring a long hospital stay. It must have an average inpatient length of stay greater than 25 days, meet specific facility criteria, and have a patient review process prior to admission. The long-term care hospital must validate patients' admission criteria, regularly evaluate them, assess discharge options, have active physician involvement, and an interdisciplinary team. The long-term care hospital must have interdisciplinary team treatment for patients and meet patient criteria for medically complex cases. A long-term care hospital must admit a majority of patients with high severity levels in specific major diagnostic categories defined by the Secretary. Establishment of Rehabilitation Units Within Certain Long-Term Care Hospitals: Categories are formed by dividing principle diagnoses into exclusive areas as per Federal Register 49,985. The Secretary of Health and Human Services approves distinct part inpatient rehabilitation units in long-term care hospitals if rehabilitation services are not included in a major diagnostic category. Long-term care hospitals accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities can establish distinct hospital rehabilitation units that meet specific requirements without a one-year waiting period for conversion. Long-term care hospitals can establish hospital rehabilitation units without a waiting period for conversion. Services in these units will not be reimbursed as long-term care hospital services and will be subject to payment policies set by the Secretary. The amendments will apply to discharges on or after January 1, 2008. SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF FACILITY AND PATIENT CRITERIA. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment, containing recommendations for national long-term care hospital criteria. These recommendations should consider the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission's report from June 2004 to ensure that patients admitted to long-term care hospitals are medically complex and suitable for long-term care services. After a report is submitted to Congress, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must implement national long-term care hospital criteria within a year. These criteria will screen patients for medical necessity and appropriateness of admission, stay, and discharge from long-term care hospitals under Medicare, considering the patient's physician's medical judgment. SEC. 4. EXPANDED REVIEW OF MEDICAL NECESSITY. Expanded Duties of QIOs under Section 1154(a) of the Social Security Act now include reviewing the medical necessity of admissions to long-term care hospitals for individuals under part A of title XVIII on a hospital-specific basis. These reviews are conducted annually with a statistically valid sample methodology specified by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a denial rate for reviews of medical necessity of admissions to long-term care hospitals, with a requirement to identify and recover at least 65 percent of overpayments for medically unnecessary admissions. If the denial rate is exceeded, further review may be necessary. The amendment specifies that certain provisions will cease to apply as of a specified date, which is the later of January 1, 2013, or the date of implementation of national long-term care hospital criteria. The Secretary will determine whether to continue guaranteeing recovery of overpayments by long-term care hospitals. The effective date of the amendment is for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007. Limited, qualified moratorium of long-term care hospitals. The Secretary will impose a temporary moratorium on certifying new long-term care hospitals for Medicare, except for those already in development or in areas without such facilities. The moratorium will last for 3 years from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will impose a temporary moratorium on certifying new long-term care hospitals for Medicare, except in areas without such facilities. If there is no long-term care hospital in a rural or metropolitan area, the Secretary will presume that establishing a new hospital is in the best interest of Medicare beneficiaries. \"Under development\" is defined as when all or substantially all funding has been committed or received for the hospital or facility. The hospital must meet zoning requirements, obtain necessary approvals, and demonstrate compliance with a 6-month long-term care hospital demonstration period to be considered under development. Other evidence may also be considered by the Secretary. SEC. 6. The Secretary will not apply certain regulations to freestanding and grandfathered LTCHs. Section 412.536 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, will be void. SEC. 7. Payment for hospitals-within-hospitals. Payments to applicable long-term care hospitals or satellite facilities in rural areas or co-located with urban hospitals are exempt from payment adjustments if certain conditions are met. For co-located facilities, no more than 75% of Medicare discharges can be from a co-located hospital, and for facilities co-located with another hospital, no more than 50% of Medicare discharges are allowed. The new regulation states that over 50% of a hospital's Medicare discharges must be admitted from a collocated hospital, with specific definitions provided for applicable long-term care hospitals or satellite facilities. These changes will apply to discharges from October 1, 2007, onwards. SEC. 8. NO APPLICATION OF VERY SHORT-STAY OUTLIER POLICY. The Secretary will not apply proposed amendments to the short-stay outlier payment provision for long-term care hospitals. SEC. 9. NO APPLICATION OF ONE TIME ADJUSTMENT TO STANDARD AMOUNT. The Secretary will not make a one-time adjustment to long-term care hospital payment rates. SEC. 10. LONG-TERM CARE HOSPITAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE. The Secretary will conduct a study to establish quality measures for Medicare patients in long-term care hospitals and submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2008. After the study, the Secretary will choose 3 quality measures to be reported by long-term care hospitals, with the option to expand the number of measures required. The Secretary will establish quality measures for Medicare patients in long-term care hospitals. Long-term care hospitals must collect and submit data on three quality measures chosen by the Secretary. Failure to submit data will result in penalties for the hospital. The Secretary will establish quality measures for Medicare patients in long-term care hospitals, with a percentage increase applicable to such hospitals reduced by not more than 0.4 percentage points. Procedures will be established for making quality data available to the public."
