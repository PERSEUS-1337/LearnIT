In 1950, Congress authorized Puerto Rico to draft a constitution, which was ratified in 1952 after changes were made and accepted by delegates. The constitution of Puerto Rico, effective since July 25, 1952, establishes a republican form of government and is equivalent to a state constitution. In a plebiscite on November 6, 2012, 54% of voters rejected territory status, and 61% of voters who selected an option chose statehood as the preferred alternative. On August 1, 2013, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing regarding the 2012 plebiscite in Puerto Rico. The majority of voters, 54%, expressed opposition to the current territorial status. It was acknowledged that Puerto Rico needs to address economic and social challenges to reach its full potential. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources discussed the need for Puerto Rico to address economic and social challenges to reach its full potential. The debate over Puerto Rico's status was highlighted, with concerns raised about the lack of voting rights for nearly four million U.S. citizens on the island. The Chairman emphasized that for Puerto Rico to have full self-government, it must either become a sovereign nation or achieve equality among the States of the Union. The President's Fiscal Year 2014 Budget requested $2.5 million for the first Federally sponsored plebiscite in Puerto Rico's history to address these issues. The history of Puerto Rico's political status resolution proposal was enacted in January 2014 as part of Public Law 113-76.
