    "content": "The \"Social Security COLA Fix for 2010 Act\" aims to provide a $150 benefit increase for one month in 2010 to compensate for the lack of a cost-of-living adjustment for seniors and disabled individuals. The \"Social Security COLA Fix for 2010 Act\" provides a $150 benefit increase for one month in 2010 to eligible individuals under the Social Security Act. The increase applies to the first month after 180 days from the enactment of the Act, without affecting benefits in other months. The Secretary of the Treasury issues a notice to individuals receiving the benefit increase, stating that their payment for a specific month reflects a one-time increase of $150 in lieu of an annual cost-of-living adjustment for 2010. If an individual is entitled to multiple monthly benefits under the Social Security Act for that month, the increase applies to the total amount of benefits received. The increase in monthly insurance benefits under subsection (a) is disregarded for determining reductions in benefits under section 203(a) of the Social Security Act. The increase is not considered income or a resource for 9 months for eligibility in Federal or federally assisted programs. The increase in benefits under subsection (a) is not taxable income and does not affect eligibility for federal programs. This section does not allow for payment of benefits if they are not otherwise payable under specific sections of the Social Security Act. SEC. 4 of the Social Security Act increases contribution and benefit base regardless of cost-of-living adjustments. Amendments to Section 230(a) include changing the timing of updates and are effective for years after 2009. The increase in benefits is not taxable income and does not impact federal program eligibility. This section does not allow for benefits to be paid if they are not otherwise payable under the Act."
