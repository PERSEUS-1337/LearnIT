    "content": "The Act titled \"Design-Build Efficiency and Jobs Act of 2015\" aims to improve the design-build construction process for civilian contracts. Section 3309 of title 41, United States Code, is amended to require two-phase selection procedures for contracts over $750,000 for design and construction of public buildings. For contracts under $750,000, contracting officers will determine if two-phase selection procedures are appropriate. The contracting officer anticipates receiving 3 or more offers for the contract, design work must be done before pricing, offerors will incur significant expenses, and factors like project requirements, time constraints, contractor capabilities, and project suitability are considered. The contracting officer evaluates project suitability, agency capability, and other criteria for two-phase selection procedures. The maximum number of offers allowed in a solicitation is 5, unless approved by the head of the contracting activity for the Federal Government's interest. The Federal Government's interest is to have more than 5 finalists in two-phase selection procedures for design-build contracts. Agencies must submit annual reports on instances where more than 5 finalists were selected or contracts were awarded without using two-phase procedures. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will make annual reports on contract awards public, including on the Internet, and publish notices in the Federal Register. SEC. 3.

The contracting officer may use two-phase selection procedures for contracts involving design work, where 3 or more offers are expected, significant expenses are incurred in preparing the offer, and factors like project requirements, time constraints, contractor capabilities, and project suitability have been considered. The contracting officer may use two-phase selection procedures for contracts involving design work, considering factors like project requirements, time constraints, contractor capabilities, and project suitability. The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not be greater than 5 unless approved by the head of the contracting activity. The Secretary of Defense must submit annual reports to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget detailing design-build contracts awarded with more than 5 finalists or without using two-phase selection procedures.
