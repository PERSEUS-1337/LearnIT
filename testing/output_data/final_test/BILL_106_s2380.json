    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that international family planning funds save women's lives by providing reproductive health care, including prenatal, postpartum, and HIV/AIDS education. Over 585,000 women die from pregnancy complications annually, with millions more facing health issues that could be prevented with safe motherhood practices. Additionally, more than 5,800,000 people are infected with HIV/AIDS. International family planning programs provide education and prevention for HIV/AIDS, helping combat the physical, social, and economic devastation caused by the disease. These programs also contribute to slowing global population growth, which in turn helps address environmental problems such as pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. International family planning programs improve the ability of families worldwide to manage their lives and natural resources more sustainably by providing access to family planning resources. This allows for spacing of children, reducing mortality risks for women and children. Voluntary family planning services uphold the right to plan family size, leading to planned pregnancies and wanted children. Increased access to family planning also reduces the incidence of abortion, as evidenced by data from around the world. Development in 1994 estimated that providing family planning and health services would cost $17 billion by 2000, with the US and other donor countries agreeing to contribute. The US should provide almost $1.9 billion for population assistance in 2001. Restoring funding to 1995 levels would help ensure global access to family planning and reproductive health care. International organizations are crucial in meeting the needs of the world's population exceeding 6 billion. Nongovernmental organizations are vital for addressing various needs in society and promoting democratic participation. They require sufficient funding for providing quality care without restrictions on free speech. US assistance should be given to these organizations on equal terms as to governments. In fiscal year 2001, $366,000,000 is appropriated for international organizations and programs, with $35,000,000 allocated for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Additionally, there is funding for population planning assistance. In fiscal year 2001, $541,600,000 is appropriated for population planning activities and other population assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Nongovernmental and multilateral organizations are eligible for this assistance. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development may not impose stricter requirements on nongovernmental and multilateral organizations for population planning assistance than those applied to foreign governments."
