In FY2009, appropriations totaled $3.276 billion, increasing to $3.460 billion in FY2018. Adjusted for inflation, FY2018 was 8.0% lower than FY2009. Excluding supplementals, FY2018 appropriations were 26.8% higher in nominal dollars and 10.5% higher in inflation-adjusted dollars compared to FY2009. The trend showed a decline in the first part of the decade and an increase in the second part, with supplementals including economic stimulus measures in FY2009 and hurricane recovery funds in FY2013 and FY2018. NPS's appropriations in the past decade were primarily organized in five accounts covering park operations, infrastructure construction, assistance to land managers, historic preservation grants, and land acquisition. The largest share of discretionary appropriations, 72% in FY2018, went to basic park operations. Additionally, funds were provided outside regular appropriations laws for hurricane recovery in FY2013 and FY2018. In addition to the five main accounts, Congress also funded the Centennial Challenge account for signature park projects and addressing deferred maintenance. The largest NPS account, Operation of the National Park System (ONPS), received $2.478 billion in FY2018, a 5.2% decrease when adjusted for inflation. The Operation of the National Park System (ONPS) funding increased by 1.3% in real terms over the decade, with ONPS share growing slightly to 71.6% in FY2018. Majority of ONPS funds go directly to park unit managers for visitor services, resource stewardship, park protection, facility operations, and maintenance. Funding for facility operations, maintenance, park support, and external administrative costs also increased. Funding for facility operations, maintenance, park support, and administrative costs increased over the decade, while funding for resource stewardship, visitor services, and park protection declined. Construction account funds new projects and repairs, with higher appropriations in FY2009, FY2013, and FY2018 due to supplemental funds for economic stimulus or hurricane recovery. Adjusted for inflation, FY2018 appropriation was 39.8% lower. The FY2018 appropriation for the Construction account was 39.8% lower than FY2009, adjusted for inflation. Construction appropriations represented a smaller portion of total NPS appropriations in FY2018. Funding for the account grew by 34.8% over the decade in inflation-adjusted dollars. The largest activity funded in the Construction account is line-item construction and maintenance, prioritizing deferred maintenance over new facility construction. The Construction account funds various activities such as emergency construction, repair of employee housing, dam safety, and equipment replacement. The National Recreation and Preservation account supports NPS programs for outdoor recreation planning and resource preservation. Appropriations for the NR&P account ranged from $55 million to $65 million throughout the decade, with a nominal growth from $58.4 million in FY2009 to $63.6 million in FY2018. Adjusted for inflation, there was a slight increase in funding. The NR&P account funding for NPS programs ranged from $58.4 million in FY2009 to $63.6 million in FY2018, with a 5.0% decline when adjusted for inflation. The Heritage Partnership Program, the largest program in the account, saw growth in appropriations despite budget reduction requests. The number of heritage areas also increased from 39 to 49 during the decade. Other programs in the NR&P account assist nonfederal entities, such as the American Battlefield Protection Program and Rivers, Trails. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), established in 1976 and administered by NPS, primarily provides grants to state and tribal historic preservation offices for conservation of cultural and historical sites. Grants are awarded on a 60% federal\u201340% state matching share basis and funded by revenues from oil and gas activities on the U.S. outer continental shelf. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) receives funding from oil and gas activities on the U.S. outer continental shelf. Appropriations for the HPF account varied over the decade, with peak funding in FY2013 and FY2018 due to supplemental appropriations for hurricane recovery. This supplemental funding was primarily for compliance activities related to Section 106 of the NHPA, which assesses potential effects on historic properties for projects receiving federal funds or permits. Additionally, the account received some supplemental funding as part of the economic stimulus package in FY2009. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) account received varying appropriations over the decade, with peak funding in FY2013 and FY2018 due to supplemental funding for hurricane recovery. The largest activity in the account is funding for state historic preservation offices, which remained relatively stable in inflation-adjusted terms. Tribal grants saw a significant increase of 42.9% after adjusting for inflation. Other grant programs funded by the account included grants for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and the Save America's Treasures program for restoring historic structures and artifacts. The Land Acquisition and State Assistance (LASA) account, funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), supports land acquisition for federal land management agencies and grants to states for recreation planning and acquiring recreational lands. A portion of the funding is allocated for a nationally competitive grant program, with the LWCF authorized at $900 million. The Land Acquisition and State Assistance (LASA) account, funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), supports land acquisition for federal land management agencies and grants to states for recreation planning and acquiring recreational lands. Appropriations for the LASA account varied over the past decade, with the highest amounts appropriated in the last three years. The appropriation rose from $64.2 million in FY2009 to $180.9 million in FY2018, showing a growth of 145.6% adjusted for inflation. This increase is mainly due to a significant rise in appropriations for state land acquisition. The Land Acquisition and State Assistance (LASA) account, funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), saw significant growth over the decade. While state assistance increased by 468.6%, NPS land acquisition funds only grew by 9.8% in inflation-adjusted dollars. State assistance started at less than $20 million in FY2009, rose to $40-$50 million annually for FY2010-FY5, and more than doubled to $110-$125 million for FY2016-FY2018. NPS land acquisition funding ranged between $45-$65 million annually, except for a peak of $86 million in FY2010. The Centennial Challenge account, aimed at improving parks through a matching-grant program, was funded in certain years to address deferred maintenance in anticipation of NPS's 2016 centennial anniversary. The Centennial Challenge Fund was established in December 2016 to receive federal revenues from sales of National Parks passes to seniors and discretionary appropriations. Congress provided $5.0 million in 2010 and increased funding in FY2015-FY2018, requiring nonfederal donations to match federal contributions. The FY2018 appropriation for the National Park Service increased by 120.1% over FY2015 and 304.3% over FY2010 in inflation-adjusted dollars. Despite the increase, the $23.0 million appropriation was smaller than other NPS accounts. Changes in NPS appropriations are influenced by factors like park size, visitation numbers, and staffing levels. Over the past decade, the National Park System's acreage grew slightly by 0.8% with the addition of 26 new units. Visitation peaked in 2016 and staffing levels remained around 20,000 employees. The National Park System's acreage remained steady at 95.3% federal ownership, with 26 new units added in the FY2009-FY2018 period. These additions varied in size, from small monuments like Stonewall National Monument (0.12 acres) to larger preserves like Valles Caldera National Preserve (89,000 acres). Boundary adjustments also contributed to acreage changes within existing parks. The National Park System saw an increase in recreational visits over the past decade, with the highest numbers in 2016 and 2017. Staffing levels fluctuated, with the highest in FY2010 and the lowest in FY2015. Appropriations for the National Park Service also varied over the decade. The National Park Service's appropriations fluctuated over the past decade, with supplemental appropriations notably increasing totals in FY2009, FY2013, and FY2018. The overall trend showed a decline in the first part of the decade and growth in the second part, with changes in funding shares depending on whether supplemental appropriations are counted. Despite a relatively stable park system size and staffing level around 20,000, there was a slight increase in park acreage. Visits to National Parks increased in the second half of the decade, peaking at approximately 331 million visits in 2016. The National Park Service faces a major funding issue with an estimated $11.61 billion backlog of deferred maintenance and repairs for its infrastructure in FY2017. Funding for infrastructure needs fluctuated over the decade, with attention given in the 115th Congress."
