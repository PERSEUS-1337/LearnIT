    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biometric Exit Improvement Act of 2015\". It establishes a Biometric Exit Data System. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to submit an implementation plan within 180 days to establish a biometric exit data system as part of the integrated biometric entry and exit data system mandated by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This plan should include a schedule, cost estimate, staffing requirements, and design details. The implementation plan for a biometric exit data system must consider existing resources, training programs, impact on wait times, and input from private sector stakeholders including the trucking, airport, airline, seaport, travel, and biometric technology industries. Trusted traveler programs in existence at the time of enactment should also be taken into account. The implementation plan for a biometric exit data system should include defined metrics of success, milestones, identified risks, mitigation strategies, and a review of how other countries have implemented similar systems. Within two years of the enactment of this Act, a biometric exit data system should be established at the top ten US airports and seaports for international travel. The implementation plan for a biometric exit data system should include defined metrics of success, milestones, identified risks, and mitigation strategies. Within three years of the enactment of this Act, a report analyzing the effectiveness of the system at the top ten international airports, seaports, and land ports of entry should be submitted to the relevant committees. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a pilot program to test a biometric exit data system on non-pedestrian outbound traffic at three land ports of entry within 18 months of the Act's enactment. A pilot program will test a biometric exit data system at land ports of entry on the southern and northern borders, including passenger vehicle lanes. It will assess nationwide implementation, required infrastructure, effects on travel and trade, and wait times. The pilot program will test a biometric exit data system at land ports of entry on the southern and northern borders, including passenger vehicle lanes. It will assess nationwide implementation, required infrastructure, effects on travel and trade, wait times, and effectiveness in combating terrorism. The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit results to the Government Accountability Office for review. The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit a plan for implementing a biometric exit data system at land ports of entry to Congress within 90 days of receiving the review from the Government Accountability Office. The Secretary of Homeland Security will expand the biometric exit data system to all land ports of entry for non-pedestrian outbound traffic within three years of submitting the integrated master schedule. Collaboration with a university-based center of excellence is required for this extension. The head of a university-based center of excellence and a national laboratory within the Department of Homeland Security collaborate on extending the biometric exit data system deadline by two years, with possible renewals in two-year increments, under specific conditions. The Secretary can extend the biometric exit data system deadline by two years, with possible renewals, if certain conditions are met, such as the inability to purchase, deploy, or operate biometric data collection systems at land ports of entry by the initial deadline. The Secretary of Homeland Security must expand the biometric exit data system to all air and sea ports of entry within five years of the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the system must be expanded to all land ports of entry for pedestrians within the same timeframe. The Secretary of Homeland Security will expand the biometric exit data system to all land ports of entry for pedestrians within five years. The collection of biometric data should cause minimal disruption to air, sea, and land transportation. The analysis will consider the impact on wait times for travelers and any significant disruptions. The Secretary of Homeland Security will terminate the proceeding for collecting alien biometric data at air and sea ports. The biometric exit data system will match entry and exit biometric data, leveraging existing infrastructure. The biometric exit data system established under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aims to collect biometric exit data for all individuals except U.S. citizens. The Secretary of Homeland Security cannot require non-Federal entities to collect biometric data without a contractual agreement. The Secretary of Homeland Security aims to collect biometric data through various modes of technology under a contractual agreement."
