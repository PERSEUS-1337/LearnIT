    "content": "Multiple international agreements and declarations, including the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), have condemned and sought to prohibit torture by public officials. CAT is significant as it is the first international agreement to define torture, stating that it involves intentionally inflicting severe physical or mental pain on a person to obtain information. The United Nations Convention against Torture defines torture as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain on a person by a public official or someone acting in an official capacity. It specifies that both physical and mental suffering can constitute torture, and that it must be purposefully inflicted. The UN Convention against Torture defines torture as severe physical or mental pain inflicted intentionally by a public official. The definition excludes mistreatment without official involvement and is limited to extreme acts universally condemned. Police brutality, while deplorable, may not meet the criteria for torture under the Convention. The UN Convention against Torture defines torture as severe mistreatment reserved for extreme, deliberate, and unusually cruel practices. Convention parties are obligated to prevent acts of torture and inhumane treatment in any territory under their jurisdiction. The UN Convention against Torture criminalizes all instances of torture and requires states to ensure that torture is a criminal offense with appropriate penalties. States must also criminalize attempts to commit and participation in torture. While states are not required to prevent torture beyond their territorial jurisdiction, they are obligated to criminalize such acts. The UN Convention against Torture requires states to criminalize torture and impose penalties. States must establish jurisdiction over offenses committed within their territory, by their nationals, or on their registered ships or aircraft. The prohibition of torture under the Convention is absolute. The UN Convention against Torture mandates states to criminalize and penalize torture, with an absolute prohibition under the Convention. It also requires signatory States to provide victims of torture with civil redress for fair compensation and rehabilitation. The UN Convention against Torture mandates states to criminalize and penalize torture, with an absolute prohibition under the Convention. CAT Article 16 requires signatory States to prevent cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment within their jurisdiction. The State Department suggested that this may include treatment not prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. Unlike torture, CAT does not require criminalization of such acts outside territorial jurisdiction. The UN Convention against Torture establishes a Committee Against Torture (CAT Committee) to monitor State compliance, investigate violations, and make recommendations. Parties must submit reports detailing measures taken to comply with CAT provisions. Disputes between signatory parties can be submitted to arbitration under CAT Article 30. The United States ratified the Convention against Torture with reservations, including a declaration that certain articles were not self-executing. Disputes under the Convention can be referred to arbitration or the International Court of Justice if parties cannot agree on the arbitration organization. The United States ratified the Convention against Torture with reservations, including a declaration that certain articles were not self-executing. The Senate's advice and consent to CAT ratification required implementing legislation to fulfill U.S. international obligations. Understandings were provided concerning the scope of the Convention's definition of torture, including mental torture referring to prolonged mental harm caused by intentional infliction of severe physical pain or mind-altering actions. The Convention against Torture defines torture as the infliction of severe physical pain, administration of mind-altering substances, threat of imminent death, or threat of harm to another person. Public officials can be held accountable for acts of torture they acquiesce to. US regulations prohibit the removal of individuals to countries where they may face torture. Regulations prohibit the removal of aliens to countries where they may face torture. Willful blindness by officials to torture may constitute acquiescence, but not when they are aware of third-party torture but unable to stop it. Noncompliance with legal procedural standards does not constitute torture. The Senate's advice and consent on the Convention against Torture was based on providing civil redress for torture victims in the State's jurisdiction. The Senate's advice and consent on the Convention against Torture was based on the reservation that the United States considered itself bound to Article 16 to the extent that cruel, unusual, and inhuman treatment or punishment was prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These Amendments apply in different contexts, with the Eighth Amendment prohibiting \"cruel and unusual punishment\" as a criminal penalty, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protecting individuals from executive abuses through due process rights. The United States has reserved the right to agree to follow the provisions of the Convention against Torture (CAT) or any other arbitration procedure to resolve disputes. Congress did not enact new provisions to criminalize torture within the U.S., assuming existing federal and state statutes cover such acts. However, the U.S. added the Federal Torture Statute to criminalize torture acts outside the country. The United States criminalizes torture acts outside the country, defining torture as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain. The United States criminalizes torture acts outside the country, defining torture as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain. Pursuant to \u00a7 2340A, any person who commits or attempts to commit an act of torture outside the United States may face up to 20 years in prison. In cases where death results, the offender could be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty. Conspiring to commit torture outside the United States carries similar penalties, except for the death penalty. This law also applies to conspiracies involving the transfer of individuals for torture outside the country. The Federal Torture Statute was amended in 2005 to include all areas under the jurisdiction of the United States, expanding the definition of \"United States\" to include several states, the District of Columbia, and other territories. This change allowed for prosecution of torture cases that occurred in facilities abroad previously not considered \"outside the United States.\" The Federal Torture Statute was expanded in 2005 to cover acts of torture at U.S. facilities abroad. The United States claims jurisdiction over these acts if the offender is a U.S. national or present in the U.S. Other federal criminal statutes also cover actions outside the U.S. but within U.S. jurisdiction, including assault, manslaughter, and murder. The War Crimes Act criminalizes grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including torture of detained combatants and civilians in armed conflicts. Specific intent is required for some criminal statutes, such as \u00a7 2340A, which may result in life imprisonment or execution if death occurs from the breach. U.S. military law also imposes restrictions on the treatment of detained individuals. The distinction between general and specific intent in criminal offenses is discussed in memorandums from the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice. Specific intent is required for certain statutes like \u00a7 2340A, which criminalizes torture and may result in severe penalties. Juries may infer specific intent from factual circumstances, especially when the defendant knows their actions will produce the prohibited result. The 2004 DOJ memo stated that specific intent is required for violating the Federal Torture Statute, and that good faith actions after reasonable investigation may not possess this intent. Motive is distinguished from intent in committing an offense, such as for national security reasons. President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order in January 2009, prohibiting U.S. agents from relying on pre-2009 Department of Justice interpretations of interrogation laws. The Federal Torture Statute allows prosecution for acts of torture but has rarely been used, with only one known conviction as of January 2010. The statute of limitations for prosecution under this law is generally eight years. The Federal Torture Statute has a general statute of limitations of eight years for prosecution, except in cases of capital offenses or offenses resulting in death or serious bodily injury. The Torture Victims Protection Act of 1991 provides a private right of action for victims of torture committed under foreign authority. The Torture Victims Protection Act (TVPA) must be filed within 10 years of the incident, and all remedies in the country of torture must be exhausted before a U.S. court can hear the claim. If torture occurs in the U.S., a tort claim can be made under state or federal law. Congress did not pass legislation implementing CAT Article 16, which prohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. There is debate over whether this was an oversight or intentional. Congress believed that the U.S. only agreed to be bound by CAT Article 16 to the extent already required by the Constitution. The Senate's consent to CAT ratification was contingent on the understanding that the prohibited treatment under Article 16 aligns with the U.S. Constitution. This interpretation raises questions about U.S. obligations under Article 16, especially regarding extraterritorial application. The Constitution applies to U.S. citizens abroad, protecting them from extraterritorial infliction by U.S. officials. Non-citizens have limited constitutional protections until entering the U.S. DOJ under the Bush Administration believed CAT Article 16 does not cover certain non-U.S. citizens outside U.S. territorial boundaries. The DOJ's position is that CAT Article 16 does not cover aliens detained overseas, but others argue that it requires the US to prohibit cruel treatment in any territory under its jurisdiction. Former officials and the Committee Against Torture support this interpretation. The Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) was enacted to prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees under U.S. control, known as the \"McCain Amendment.\" This was in response to controversy over the interpretation of CAT Article 16, which some argue should apply to all persons under U.S. authority worldwide. The \"McCain Amendment\" in the Military Commissions Act of 2006 required the President to establish rules for detainee treatment. President Bush issued a signing statement claiming he would interpret the amendment in line with his constitutional authority. The President believes he can waive congressional restrictions on interrogation techniques for national security reasons. The Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) provides a legal defense for U.S. personnel involved in authorized interrogation of suspected foreign terrorists. The legal defense for U.S. agents in civil or criminal actions involves not knowing that interrogation practices were unlawful. Good faith reliance on counsel is crucial. The Department of Defense implemented the McCain Amendment, prohibiting cruel treatment in military custody. Eight techniques, including nudity and sexual acts, are expressly prohibited in intelligence interrogations. The Manual restricts harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, beatings, and deprivation of food and water. In 2005, the DOJ authorized the use of head-slapping, waterboarding, and exposure to extreme temperatures by the CIA. The DOJ issued classified opinions allowing harsh interrogation techniques under the DTA, sparking controversy among Members of Congress. The Obama Administration released some of these memorandums in 2009, while the Bush Administration claimed congressional committees were informed. The CIA waterboarded three high-level Al Qaeda suspects but stopped using the technique in 2003. In 2008, CIA director Michael Hayden stated that waterboarding was not part of the current interrogation program and may not be lawful. President Bush signed an Executive Order in 2007 authorizing the detention and interrogation of certain alien detainees by the CIA if they were linked to Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The Executive Order signed by President Bush in 2007 prohibited the use of torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and other violent acts in the CIA detention and interrogation program for detainees linked to Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The Executive Order signed by President Bush in 2007 prohibited acts beyond the bounds of human decency, including sexual humiliation, threats of mutilation, and denigration of religion. It was unclear which interrogation techniques were considered cruel, inhuman, or degrading, but controversial methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation were explicitly banned in the Army Field Manual. The Executive Order signed by President Bush in 2007 prohibited acts beyond the bounds of human decency, including controversial methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation. However, the Order did not specifically address certain interrogation techniques, leaving it unclear if they were deemed prohibited. On the same day, the Department of Justice issued a legal opinion allowing six \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" under specified conditions for high-value detainees belonging to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. These techniques included dietary manipulation and extended sleep deprivation. President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order in January 2009, rescinding President Bush's order from July 2007. The new Order prohibited any interrogation technique beyond what is authorized under the Army Field Manual for anyone in U.S. custody during armed conflict. This came after controversial methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation were allowed under the previous administration. The Executive Order issued by President Obama in January 2009 prohibits interrogation techniques beyond those authorized in the Army Field Manual for individuals in U.S. custody during armed conflict. It also established a Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques. The Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies, established by President Obama's Executive Order, recommended that the practices and techniques in the Army Field Manual or used by law enforcement are sufficient for conducting interrogations. The Task Force issued its recommendations to the President in August 2009, concluding that no additional methods are necessary. The Task Force recommended the establishment of a scientific research program for interrogation to study and improve techniques. They also suggested creating a High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG) composed of experienced interrogators from various agencies to coordinate the interrogation of high-level terrorist suspects. The High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG) will coordinate mobile teams to interrogate high-value terrorists for intelligence gathering to prevent attacks and protect national security. Best practices for interrogations will be developed and shared among agencies for training. Controversy exists over the application of interrogation techniques in the context of the \"war on terror\" and its relation to Geneva standards. The Geneva Conventions establish legal duties for the treatment of detainees during armed conflicts, prioritizing specific rules over more general standards like CAT. There is debate on whether human rights treaties complement the laws of war. The Bush Administration's stance was that CAT does not apply to armed conflicts. The U.S. State Department argued in a 2006 hearing that CAT does not apply to detainee operations in armed conflicts like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guant\u00e1namo, as they are governed by the laws of armed conflict. The United States claimed that CAT was intended for domestic obligations and should not overlap with treaties governing standards in armed conflicts. The Committee Against Torture disagreed and recommended that the Convention applies at all times, including during armed conflicts. The Obama Administration's stance on whether the Convention Against Torture (CAT) legally governs the treatment of detainees in armed conflict is uncertain. However, President Obama has issued an Executive Order mandating that detainees held by the United States during armed conflict must be treated in accordance with domestic laws and international agreements, including CAT and the Federal Torture Statute. While it is unclear if CAT itself applies during armed conflicts, certain US legislation implementing CAT requirements does. The Federal Torture Statute criminalizes torture outside the US, regardless of armed conflict context. The Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) and Military Commissions Act (MCA) prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of individuals in US custody. In the 110th and 111th Congress, appropriation bills were enacted to prohibit funds from being used in contravention of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and its implementing legislation. The Department of Defense Appropriations Acts in 2007, 2008, and 2010 specifically barred funds from being used to support torture or inhumane treatment by any U.S. official or contract employee. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-118) prohibits funds from being used in violation of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) or its implementing legislation. U.S. courts have defined severe torture as including beatings, maiming, sexual assault, and death threats. However, there is limited jurisprudence on whether less severe interrogation techniques constitute torture under CAT or U.S. law. The definition of \"severe\" pain or suffering is not clearly defined in either CAT or the Federal Torture Statute. The 2004 DOJ Memo stated that \"severe physical suffering\" could be considered torture even without \"severe physical pain.\" The relevance of the 2004 DOJ Memo to U.S. agents is unclear due to President Obama's Executive Order. Foreign courts and international bodies' decisions may indicate an international consensus on prohibiting certain interrogation techniques. U.S. courts may look to non-U.S. jurisprudence for guidance on defining torture under CAT and domestic laws. The U.S. military has also banned specific interrogation methods. The U.S. military has prohibited certain interrogation techniques considered torture. International bodies have assessed State interrogation methods for torture, such as the ECHR case involving British tactics in Northern Ireland. The ECHR found that British officials violated Article 3 of the European Convention by using five interrogation techniques, including wall-standing, hooding, and subjection to noise, which were considered torture. The European Commission of Human Rights investigated interrogation techniques used by Britain on detainees, including deprivation of sleep and food, resulting in weight loss and adverse effects on mental health. The ECHR concluded that these techniques violated the European Convention's prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment, but did not constitute torture. The ECHR investigated interrogation techniques used by Britain on detainees, concluding that while the techniques were inhuman or degrading treatment, they did not amount to torture due to the lack of intense suffering. The evaluation considered factors such as duration of treatment, physical and mental effects, and the victim's sex, age, and health. Israel authorized harsh interrogation techniques against Palestinian detainees, including \"moderate physical pressure.\" Despite arguing that these methods were in line with international law, the CAT Committee deemed them \"completely unacceptable\" under Israel's obligations. Israel's interrogation techniques against security detainees, including painful conditions, hooding, loud music, sleep deprivation, threats, violent shaking, and cold air, were found to violate CAT Articles 2 and 16. The CAT Committee concluded that these tactics constituted torture under CAT Article 1. The CAT Committee found Israel's interrogation techniques against security detainees to constitute torture under CAT Article 1. Despite recognizing Israel's security concerns, the committee recommended immediate cessation of these tactics. The Israeli Supreme Court had previously prohibited certain brutal interrogation methods in 1999. The Israeli Supreme Court prohibited brutal interrogation methods in 1999, including cuffing, sack covering, loud music, \"frog crouch\" position, tight handcuffs, and sleep deprivation. These techniques were deemed impermissible under Israeli law and international treaties prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman treatment. According to a 2003 report by the U.S. State Department, Israel has used \"extraordinary interrogation methods, some involving physical pressure\" at least 90 times since the Israeli High Court's ruling. The State Department also reported in 2000 that Israeli security forces \"abused and tortured Palestinians suspected of security offenses.\" Human rights groups claim that torture is still being employed."
