    "content": "The \"Detainee Interrogation Recording Act of 2007\" requires videotaping recordings of strategic interrogations and interactions among detainees, prisoners, members of the armed forces, intelligence operatives, and contractors of the United States. The President must ensure the videotaping of strategic interrogations involving detainees or prisoners in US custody, in accordance with international conventions and constitutional prohibitions against cruel treatment. The requirement for videotaping strategic interrogations of detainees in US custody applies to those confined in US facilities or taken into custody by the US or its representatives. The President must classify video tapes to protect national security and detainee privacy. The classification of video tapes or recordings made during strategic interrogations must be made available to prosecution and defense attorneys for criminal proceedings. Strategic interrogation is defined as questioning detainees at specific detention facilities, including those outside the area of initial capture. The Act excludes the requirement for Armed Forces engaged in direct combat operations to videotape prisoners. The President must ensure access to prisoners for independent monitoring and transparent investigations in accordance with international law. The Act mandates access for International Red Cross representatives to detainees in Armed Forces custody. Guidelines for videotape recordings must be developed to prevent abuse and violations of law. The Army Judge Advocate General will oversee the development of guidelines for videotape recordings to prevent abuse and violations of law. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress with these guidelines within 30 days of the Act's enactment."
