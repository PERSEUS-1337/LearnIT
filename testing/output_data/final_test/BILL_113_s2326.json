    "content": "The \"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2014\" requires reports on post-shutdown decommissioning activities. The \"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2014\" mandates reports on post-shutdown decommissioning activities, defining terms like affected state, commission, covered facility, host state, licensee, and PSDAR. The licensee must develop a proposed PSDAR for a covered facility after consulting with affected states, local governments, and tribal governments within 50 miles. After additional consultation, the licensee submits the proposed PSDAR to the Commission. The licensee must submit the proposed PSDAR to the Commission and make it available to the public. The Commission will then solicit public participation on the proposed PSDAR in the host State for at least 90 days, including through written comments and public hearings. The host State can either support or not support the proposed PSDAR. The Commission invites the host State to support, conditionally support with recommendations, or nonsupport a proposed PSDAR for a covered facility within 60 days of receiving it. If the host State fails to submit a statement, specific actions are outlined. If the host State does not submit a statement of support, conditional support, or nonsupport for a proposed PSDAR within the specified deadline, the Commission will issue a determination on its adequacy based on various considerations and input from stakeholders. The Commission will consider a proposed PSDAR to be adequate if it ensures the protection of human health and the environment, the licensee is likely to implement it within the specified timeframe, it complies with applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee has taken proactive measures. The Commission will issue a decision document approving the PSDAR if it is determined to be adequate. If the proposed PSDAR is found inadequate, the Commission will reject it and provide reasons for the decision. The Commission will approve a PSDAR if found adequate, otherwise, it will be rejected with reasons for the decision. The licensee must submit a new proposed PSDAR if needed. The Commission will assess the proposed PSDAR's permissibility under applicable law if the host State provides conditional support. Any changes recommended by the host State must be included in the final PSDAR. The Commission will approve a PSDAR if adequate, otherwise reject it with reasons. The licensee must submit a new proposed PSDAR if necessary. Any changes recommended by the host State must be included in the final PSDAR, unless deemed inappropriate based on clear evidence provided by the licensee. The Commission will issue a decision document accepting or rejecting the proposed PSDAR based on determinations made, with any changes recommended by the host State included unless deemed inappropriate. If the Commission approves the proposed PSDAR, it becomes final, and the licensee can start implementation. If rejected, a new proposed PSDAR must be submitted. A requirement for compliance with applicable State laws on air, water, soil quality, or radiological standards is necessary for approval. The proposed PSDAR must comply with applicable State laws if they are more restrictive than Federal laws."
