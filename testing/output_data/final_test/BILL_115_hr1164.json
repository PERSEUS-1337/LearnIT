    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taylor Force Act\". The Taylor Force Act finds that the Palestinian Authority's payment of salaries to terrorists incentivizes terror acts. The United States does not provide direct budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority but funds community-based programs in the West Bank and Gaza for basic human needs and peace promotion. Since fiscal year 2015, annual appropriations legislation has mandated the reduction of Economic Support Fund aid for the Palestinian Authority due to their payments for acts of terrorism. This includes a reduction equivalent to the amount expended by the Palestinian Authority for individuals involved in acts of terrorism. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. Congress calls on the Palestinian Authority and donor countries to stop payments for terrorism-related activities and to focus on providing essential public services instead. The United States urges the UN and other countries to pressure the Palestinian Authority to stop payments for acts of terrorism. The Department of State is also urged to engage with governments and organizations to address this issue. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA. Limitation for assistance under chapter 4 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for the West Bank and Gaza requires certification from the Secretary of State every 180 days that the Palestinian Authority is taking credible steps to end acts of violence. The Palestinian Authority must take credible steps to end violence against Israeli and US citizens, including terminating payments for acts of terrorism and revoking any laws supporting such actions. The Palestinian Authority must revoke any laws supporting compensation for imprisoned individuals involved in acts of terrorism and publicly condemn such violence, while also cooperating in investigations to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Secretary's definition of \"acts of terrorism\" is crucial for determining limitations on assistance. Exceptions include payments to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, wastewater projects, and vaccination programs for children. The Secretary of State must notify congressional committees before providing funds for these exceptions. Withheld funds must align with this section. Funds withheld under this section must align with the Secretary's definition of \"acts of terrorism\" and can be used for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza benefiting the Palestinian Authority. The withheld funds remain available for an additional 2 years beyond their original expiration date. The Secretary of State can certify funds for the Palestinian Authority if conditions are met, with unused funds going to the Department of State for assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 after 180 days. Chapter 4 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows funds to be used for purposes other than assistance for the West Bank and Gaza. If the Secretary of State cannot certify that certain organizations have met the conditions, a report must be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees within 15 days explaining the reasons for the inability to certify. The Secretary of State must submit a report to congressional committees within 15 days, detailing the criteria used to determine if assistance for the West Bank and Gaza directly benefits the Palestinian Authority. The report must be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. The Secretary of State must update and submit a list to congressional committees within 15 days of any modifications made. Within 60 days of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of State must provide a report to congressional committees detailing programs affected by fund withholding. The report may include a classified annex. Additionally, an annual report requirement is outlined. The Secretary of State must submit annual reports to congressional committees detailing Palestinian Authority expenditures on terrorism-related payments and an overview of relevant Palestinian laws. The annual report must include an overview of Palestinian laws authorizing payments for terrorism and US efforts to revoke these laws and urge other nations to do the same. The report required by subsection (a) must be submitted in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. SEC. 7. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED. The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Passed by the House of Representatives on December 5, 2017."
