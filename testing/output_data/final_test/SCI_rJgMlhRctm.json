    "content": "The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL) is a model that learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of sentences without explicit supervision. It builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable programs using neuro-symbolic reasoning. The perception module learns visual concepts based on language descriptions, facilitating learning new words and parsing sentences. Curriculum learning guides searching over the compositional space of images and language, with extensive experiments demonstrating accuracy and efficiency in learning visual concepts. The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL) model demonstrates accuracy and efficiency in learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. It allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes, and questions. Applications include visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval. Humans can learn visual concepts by understanding vision and language jointly. The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL) model proposes a method to jointly learn visual perception, words, and semantic language parsing from images and question-answer pairs. It consists of three modules: a perception module, a semantic parser, and a program executor for answering questions based on visual concepts. The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL) model learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing jointly and incrementally. It starts by learning visual concepts like red vs. green, then interprets referential expressions and learns relational concepts. Finally, it interprets complex questions from visual cues using compositional structure. NS-CL learns from natural supervision without annotations, similar to human concept learning, via curriculum learning. It begins by learning representations of individual objects from short questions on simple scenes. The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL) model learns object-based concepts like colors and shapes on simple scenes, then progresses to relational concepts by interpreting object referrals. It adapts to more complex scenes and questions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVR dataset. NS-CL's modularized design enables interpretable, robust, and accurate visual reasoning, allowing for combinatorial generalization in both visual scenes and semantic programs. The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL) model generalizes to new visual attribute compositions, enables fast adaptation to novel visual concepts, and transfers learned visual concepts to new tasks like image-caption retrieval without extra fine-tuning. It is related to research on joint learning of vision and natural language, particularly in visual question answering (VQA) which requires understanding both visual content and language. State-of-the-art approaches in VQA typically use neural attentions. Our model adopts an object-based visual representation learned based on natural supervision (questions and answers) and uses neural symbolic reasoning as a bridge to jointly learn visual concepts. Our model uses neural symbolic reasoning to learn visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of sentences for visual reasoning. It supports combinatorial generalization over quantities and can be applied in other vision-language tasks like image caption retrieval. There are two types of approaches in semantic sentence parsing for visual reasoning: implicit programs as conditioned neural operations and explicit programs. Our model utilizes neural symbolic reasoning to learn visual concepts and semantic parsing of sentences for visual reasoning. It involves two approaches in semantic sentence parsing: implicit programs as conditioned neural operations and explicit programs. Explicit programs offer better interpretability but require additional supervision, while our proposed method uses visual grounding for distant supervision to parse questions into explicit programs without the need for program annotations. The text discusses various approaches to learning disentangled representations for visual scenes using neural networks. It mentions different studies that focused on pose inference for faces and chairs, as well as the use of deep generative models for representation learning. The proposed neuro-symbolic concept learner utilizes symbolic reasoning to bridge visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing without explicit annotations, treating attributes like Shape and Color as neural operators. The text discusses mapping object representations into a visual-semantic space using a similarity-based metric for classification. It involves using a visual perception module to create object-based representations, a semantic parsing module to translate questions into executable programs, and a quasi-symbolic program executor to infer answers. Training involves paired images, questions, and answers to jointly train visual and language modules. Given an input image, the visual perception module detects objects and generates deep representations for each. The semantic parsing module translates questions into executable programs with a hierarchical structure of symbolic, functional modules. The program executor executes programs on scene representations to answer questions. It is symbolic, deterministic, and fully differentiable for gradient-based optimization during training. Visual perception involves using Mask R-CNN for object proposals and ResNet-34 for features. Visual reasoning involves determining object attributes such as shape by quantizing visual concepts into attribute-specific embedding spaces. The program executor uses Mask R-CNN for object proposals and ResNet-34 for features. The text chunk discusses how visual reasoning involves determining object attributes like shape using neural operators and concept embeddings. It also mentions the use of a domain-specific language for visual question answering tasks. The text chunk describes a framework for visual question answering using a domain-specific language. It explains how a semantic parser generates latent programs from input questions and how symbolic program execution is carried out based on the recovered latent program. The framework includes operations like Filter(Red) and Query(Shape) which are chosen from concepts in the input question. The program executor executes the program and derives answers based on object-based visual representation. Intermediate results are represented probabilistically using attention masks over objects in the scene. The optimization objective of NS-CL involves concept learning and language understanding to find optimal parameters for visual perception and semantic parsing modules to maximize the likelihood of answering questions correctly. The program executor uses attention masks over objects in the scene to derive answers. The program executor is fully differentiable w.r.t. the visual representation. Gradient is computed w.r.t. DISPLAYFORM1 using REINFORCE to optimize the semantic parser \u0398 s. Curriculum visual concept learning involves a curriculum approach to joint optimization, splitting training samples into four stages. This approach is essential for neuro-symbolic learning. The neuro-symbolic concept learner requires fine-tuning of all modules for optimal learning. It demonstrates advantages such as accurate visual concept learning, data-efficient visual reasoning, and generalization to new attributes and domains. The model is trained on a small subset of images and utilizes a pretrained Mask R-CNN module for classification-based concept evaluation. The model achieves near perfect classification accuracy for object properties in the CLEVR validation split, but spatial relation concepts are learned indirectly. A synthetic question set is used to evaluate visual concepts, showing performance compared to strong baselines. Our approach outperforms strong baselines in the CLEVR dataset, showing significant improvement in interpreting visual concepts through object-based visual representations and symbolic reasoning. NS-CL learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing simultaneously, leading to better performance in VQA tasks compared to convolutional and attentional baselines. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVR dataset without the need for program annotations or extra labels, outperforming strong baselines in interpreting visual concepts through object-based representations and symbolic reasoning. The NS-CL model achieves high accuracy in recovering question programs without the need for extra labels. It can detect ambiguous or invalid programs and is applicable to various visual reasoning tasks. Additionally, two variants of baseline models, TbD-Object and MAC-Object, are implemented for a systematic study on visual features and data efficiency. Our model outperforms baselines on data efficiency by fully disentangling visual concept learning and symbolic reasoning. Using masks to guide attention speeds up training and enables competitive performance on visual reasoning testbeds. The model learns interpretable visual concepts and generalizes to new visual compositions. See Appendix H for qualitative results on various datasets. The CLEVR-CoGenT dataset evaluates models' ability to generalize to new visual compositions with color constraints on cubes and cylinders. By training concept embeddings and a semantic parser on split A, our model achieves high accuracy on both split A and split B. Our model achieves 93.9% accuracy on the QA test in Split B by training on images without purple objects in Split A and finetuning on images with purple objects in Split B. The model outperforms the convolutional baseline IEP and the attentional model. The model, Split B, outperforms the convolutional baseline IEP and the attentional baseline TbD by 4.6% and 6.1% respectively. The acquisition of Color operator enhances learning of new visual concepts. The CLEVR dataset is split into four parts to evaluate generalization of knowledge. VQA baselines struggle with counting objects of arbitrary size. The new DSL for image-caption retrieval is introduced to evaluate visual concept transfer. VQA baselines struggle with counting objects of arbitrary size, leading to their removal for fair comparison. Methods with explicit program semantics pre-train the semantic parser on the full dataset, while those with implicit program semantics struggle to generalize to more complex tasks. Our NS-CL model demonstrates almost-perfect generalization to larger scenes and complex questions, outperforming all baselines by at least 4% in QA accuracy. The learned visual concepts can be transferred to other domains like image retrieval by parsing natural language into a new DSL. A synthetic dataset for image retrieval is created with simple captions, enabling the semantic parser to extract visual concepts efficiently. The semantic parser learns to extract visual concepts from sentences for execution on visual representations to determine relational triples in images. Ambiguity in questions like \"Is there a box right of a cylinder\" hinders direct implementation on CLEVR VQA. Separate semantic parser trained for VQA baselines to address this issue. A semantic parser is trained for VQA baselines to translate captions into CLEVR QA-compatible programs. The NS-CL model outperforms CNN-LSTM baseline by 30% on image-text retrieval. Experiments are conducted on MS-COCO images and VQS dataset, which contains visually grounded questions. The model uses a syntactic dependency parser to extract programs. The NS-CL model utilizes a syntactic dependency parser to extract programs and concepts from language. It focuses on learning visual concepts about object properties and relations for visual question answering. The model shows examples of learned visual concepts, including object categories, attributes, and relations. The method jointly learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of sentences from natural supervision. Future work includes extending NS-CL to reason about more general concepts and applying it to general VQA datasets. The proposed framework, NS-CL, learns visual concepts and semantic parsing from natural supervision without explicit supervision. It achieves good results on question answering and generalizes well to new visual compositions and concepts. Future research directions include exploring 3D object-based representations for realistic scenes and integrating formal semantics into processing complex natural language. The paper introduces a domain-specific language for the CLEVR VQA dataset and discusses the potential extension of the framework to other domains like video understanding and robotic manipulation. Researchers are exploring symbolic representations for skills and learning instruction semantics for robotic learning in interactive environments. The DSL introduced in the paper explains the type system and various functions like Scene, Filter, AERelate, Intersection, Query, and AEQuery for object manipulation and attribute querying. The domain-specific language for CLEVR VQA includes operations like Query, CLessThan, CGreaterThan, and CEqual to compare object sets. Some functions require unique objects for accurate answers, ensuring only one object of a specific attribute is present in the scene. The program execution involves implicitly casting input object sets to a single object if non-empty and containing only one object. NS-CL generates hierarchies of latent programs in a sequence to tree manner. The semantic parser uses a bidirectional GRU encoder, operation decoder, and concept decoder to process input questions. The semantic parser utilizes a ConceptDecoder to select concepts from input questions for operations, along with output encoders to encode operations for generating a hierarchical program layout. The algorithmic outline of the semantic parser is illustrated in Algorithm 1, which involves encoding the input question, extracting concepts, and invoking the parsing procedure recursively. The semantic parser uses hand-coded rules to extract concept words from input questions. Each concept is associated with a single word in the question, forming a concept set. Concept words are known for the CLEVR dataset, and word embeddings are used as representations for the concepts during program parsing. Automatic discovery of concept words is left for future work. The visual module uses separate concept embeddings to align object features with concepts. The main function parse(f, {c i }) decodes the root operation op and recursively generates branches based on the inputs. The DSL limits non-concept inputs to at most 2 for any operation. In the implementation, the input encoder maps question words to embeddings with a dimension of 256 for word embeddings and 128 for positional embeddings. The semantic parser can handle novel concept words after training on a fixed dataset. A two-layer GRU encodes the word embeddings, and the parse function generates a hierarchical program layout. OpDecoder and ConceptDecoder are feed-forward networks, with ConceptDecoder performing attentions over concept representations to select concepts. ConceptDecoder performs attentions over representations of concepts to select them. Output encoders are implemented as GRU cells. Pre-processing groups consecutive object-level concept words together. The goal is to fuse multiple Filters into a single operation. A running example is provided with a CLEVR question. The semantic parser encodes word embeddings with IEncoder and uses the last hidden state of the GRU as f0. The concept words are encoded as {ci} = {Attribute 1, ObjConcept 1, RelConcept 1, ObjConcept 2}. The function parse is recursively invoked to generate the program layout. Implementation details of Object-typed and ObjectSet-typed variables are discussed, along with classifying objects by object-level or relational concepts. The text discusses variables representing objects in a scene, with Object and ObjectSet variables being vectors of probabilities. It explains how to convert an ObjectSet variable to an Object variable using the softmax function. The visual representation of objects and object-level concepts are also mentioned. The text introduces object-level concepts and attributes, with each concept associated with a vector embedding and normalized vector. Attributes are implemented as neural operators. A classifier is used to classify objects based on concepts like Red or relational concepts like Left, resulting in vectors and matrices for classification. The text introduces object-level concepts and attributes, with each concept associated with a vector embedding and normalized vector. Attributes are implemented as neural operators. A classifier is used to classify objects based on concepts like Red or relational concepts like Left, resulting in vectors and matrices for classification. In practice, probabilities are stored in log space for better numeric stability. An off-policy program search process is applied to optimize in a non-smooth program space. The gradient is computed with respect to the parameters of the semantic parser. The text discusses computing the gradient with respect to the parameters of the semantic parser in the context of curriculum learning for CLEVR VQA. The gradient is approximated via Monte Carlo sampling in REINFORCE, but an alternative solution is to exactly compute it. The reward function only considers programs leading to the correct answer, and the exact gradient is computed by searching for the set of programs offline based on concept classification results. Based on concept classification results, the exact gradient \u2207\u0398 s is computed for off-policy search in CLEVR VQA. The approach involves enumerating all possible programs and finding those leading to the correct answer using Q(s) as supervision. However, using Q(s) directly can be problematic due to program ambiguity and spuriousness. The training process aims to suppress spurious programs by using a loss function and gradient updates. Spurious programs are identified by their incorrect answers in specific scenes. The training process involves gradually adding visual concepts and complex questions in three stages. Initially, only questions from lesson 1 are used. The training process is divided into 3 stages. Initially, only lesson 1 questions are used to teach object-level visual concepts. Then, the model learns relational concepts while freezing certain parameters. Finally, the model is trained on all lesson 3 questions of varying complexities. The number of objects in the scene gradually increases from 3 to 10. Questions are selected based on the depth of the latent program layout. The curriculum learning lessons are split into two parts. Lesson 1 focuses on fundamental object-based visual concepts with programs of depth 3, generating 5 questions per image. Lesson 2 involves programs of depth less than 5, emphasizing relations between objects. In the original CLEVR dataset, adding a new question template improves learning of relational concepts. Curriculum learning is crucial for the neuro-symbolic concept learner, as removing it affects the visual perception module and semantic parser convergence. Ablation studies show the importance of the curriculum setup for accuracy of semantic understanding. The semantic parser's accuracy is evaluated through ablation studies on semantic parsing, ImageNet pretraining impact on visual perception modules, data efficiency, and object-based representations. The model achieves >99.9% QA accuracy on the validation split, with extra supervision from ImageNet pretraining. Ablation experiments quantify the influence of pretraining on perception modules. The study evaluates the impact of training samples and feature representations on model performance in the CLEVR dataset. The NS-CL model is compared against baselines TbD and MAC, with variations TbD-Object and MAC-Object using object features instead of 2D convolutional maps. The Shape classification accuracy drops slightly, indicating prior knowledge from large-scale image datasets. MAC-Object takes a stack of object features as inputs, with k objects and d obj feature dimension. Object features are extracted using a pre-trained ResNet-34 network, combining region-based and image-based features. Representation of the full scene is crucial for inferring relative attributes like size or spatial position in the CLEVR domain. TbD and MAC networks use image-level attention for reasoning, with additional baselines TbD-Mask and. The TbD-Mask and MAC-Mask baselines implement mask-guided attention on images, silencing attention on non-object pixels. Results show TbD-Object and MAC-Object approaches perform worse due to network architecture differences, such as using 1D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions for attention propagation. The stack of 2D convolutions is replaced by 1D convolution layers for object features. MAC networks use attention mechanism for order-invariant information extraction. TbD-Mask and MAC-Mask show faster convergence with mask-guided attention. NS-CL is more data-efficient than MAC networks and TbD. NS-CL is more data-efficient than MAC networks and TbD, as it answers questions by executing symbolic programs on learned visual concepts. Experiments on the CLEVR training set achieved 99.2% accuracy, with a hold-out validation set used for hyperparameter tuning. The model's performance was also tested on a new reasoning testbed: Minecraft worlds, which differ in visual appearance and question types from CLEVR. The Minecraft reasoning dataset introduces new types of reasoning operations, such as FilterMost and BelongTo, which are added to the domain-specific language. Results are summarized in TAB11 and sample execution traces are shown in FIG5. The method is compared against the NS-VQA baseline, which uses strong supervision for scene representation and program traces. Our method learns from images and executes symbolic programs for answering questions. Our method, NS-CL, outperforms NS-VQA by 5% in overall accuracy by learning from images and question-answering pairs. The inferior results of NS-VQA are attributed to its derendering module, which suffers from poorly localized bounding boxes leading to noisy labels. This affects the accuracy of the derendering module and overall performance of NS-VQA on the VQS dataset BID13. The models are trained and tested on a dataset using a multiple-choice setup for VQA. Latent programs are extracted from natural languages using a pre-trained syntactic dependency parser. Concept embeddings are initialized using GloVe word embeddings. The model is compared against two baselines: MLP and MAC. The study compares the model against two baselines, MLP and MAC, for visual-question answering. MLP uses a multi-layer perceptron to rank candidate answers based on image, question, and answer encoding. MAC network is slightly modified for the VQS dataset, concatenating question and answer for input. Results are summarized in TAB9. The study compares the NS-CL model against MLP and MAC baselines for visual-question answering, achieving comparable results. NS-CL provides transparent reasoning over natural images and language, with symbolic reasoning aiding in model inspection and error diagnosis. The model's interpretability is demonstrated through execution traces on CLEVR, Minecraft, and VQS datasets. Additionally, the system detects ambiguous and invalid programs, as illustrated in Figure 11. The study demonstrates the interpretability of the NS-CL model through execution traces on CLEVR, Minecraft, and VQS datasets. The execution traces show successful and failed executions, with examples of error diagnosis for incorrect answers. The NS-CL model demonstrates interpretability through execution traces on various datasets. It can detect errors such as misclassification of object material and provide transparent reasoning processes. Example D shows misclassification of a sport as a frisbee."
