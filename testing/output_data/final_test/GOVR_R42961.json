    "content": "Financial derivatives played a key role in the 2008-2009 financial crisis by fueling a housing bubble and enabling systemic risk. Congress regulates the derivatives market through laws and oversight of major regulators. The crisis led to global efforts to reform rules governing over-the-counter derivatives markets. Various factors contributed to the financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Financial derivatives exacerbated the financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis in Europe, with investors in the derivatives markets worsening the situation. Actions in the market required government assistance for firms like AIG due to credit default swaps losses. Derivatives also played a significant role in destabilizing financial markets, highlighted by Greece's financial crisis and JP Morgan's $6 billion losses in 2012. Despite their negative impact, derivatives are intended to benefit financial markets by improving risk pricing, enhancing liquidity, and managing risks for various market participants. OTC derivatives are used by various market participants to hedge against price changes and expand financial opportunities. However, they can add substantial risk to financial markets due to lengthy commitments and potential counterparty credit exposure. Small changes in underlying securities can dramatically increase liabilities and counterparty credit risk. Derivatives can significantly increase liabilities and counterparty credit risk, especially during market turbulence. The 2008-2009 financial crisis was exacerbated by credit default swaps fueling the housing bubble and creating synthetic CDOs, spreading losses throughout the financial system. The 2008-2009 financial crisis was worsened by derivatives, particularly credit default swaps, which spread losses throughout the financial system. Concerns arose about cascading losses and lack of transparency in the derivatives market, leading to uncertainty and panic. A notable example was the near-collapse of AIG, which had significant exposure to OTC derivatives contracts. AIG faced margin calls it couldn't meet during the subprime crisis, leading to a bailout by the Federal Reserve and Treasury to prevent global financial chaos. The case highlights the risks of OTC derivatives and the need for reform to prevent destabilizing the financial system. During the financial crisis, AIG faced unexpected losses and risks of default due to its derivatives exposure. Lack of reporting on OTC contracts made it difficult for regulators to assess the extent of AIG's impact on counterparties, leading to market uncertainty and credit freezing. Derivatives reform proposals aim to increase transparency in the OTC market. OTC derivatives reform proposals aim to make the market more like exchange-traded futures by clearing swaps through a third-party organization. The global OTC derivatives market is dominated by five types of swaps: foreign exchange, interest rate, equity-linked, commodity, and credit default swaps. The total notional amounts outstanding of OTC derivatives at the end of 2011 were $647.8 trillion, down 8% from June 2011. The global derivatives market, with a notional value of $647.8 trillion in 2011, dwarfs world assets, GDP, and official reserves. Trading in OTC foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives totaled $567 trillion, nine times the world GDP. Financial markets have seen rapid growth in trading derivatives over the past decade, facilitating large trades involving vast amounts of funds. The global derivatives market in 2011 had a notional value of $647.8 trillion, significantly larger than world assets and GDP. The United States had the largest share of OTC interest and exchange rate derivatives trading, exposing weaknesses in the market during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The OTC derivatives market is dominated by a limited number of dealers who provide liquidity and manage risk exposures. These dealers are highly interconnected and exposed to contagion effects, which can lead to severe market disruptions and defaults. The OTC derivatives market is vulnerable to severe disruptions and defaults due to weaknesses in risk management, interconnectedness of market participants, and limited transparency of counterparty credit risk exposures. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the G-20 nations agreed on reforms to address regulatory failures in the financial system. The global financial system faced major failures in regulation and supervision, leading to increased risk-taking by banks and interconnectedness without sufficient transparency. This interconnectedness can result in contagion, where shocks in one market quickly affect others. Regulators have struggled to address cross-border financial crises due to the complexity of large financial firms operating across multiple markets. National regulators have struggled to harmonize regulations across borders, leading to conflicts and a focus on national objectives over global financial stability. G-20 leaders have refined goals to improve financial market infrastructures, starting with OTC derivative markets and credit default swaps. The Bank for International Settlements has been involved in these efforts. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) emphasizes the importance of harmonized standards for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) in maintaining financial stability. FMIs play a critical role in clearing, settling, and recording financial transactions, but also pose risks if not managed properly. Leaders at the November 2008 summit supported regulatory actions to address these risks. At the November 2008 Washington, DC summit, leaders backed regulatory actions to reduce systemic risks linked to credit default swaps and derivatives. They also supported enhancing transparency and infrastructure for OTC derivatives trading. G-20 reforms focus on transparency, risk mitigation, and market protection. G-20 leaders have consistently supported OTC derivatives market reforms in various summits, including the Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009, where they agreed on trading standardized OTC derivative contracts on exchanges or electronic platforms and clearing through central counterparties. The G-20 leaders agreed in 2012 that OTC contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms and cleared through central counterparties. They also mandated reporting all OTC contracts to trade repositories for transparency. The Financial Stability Board was tasked with assessing the reforms' implementation to improve transparency, mitigate systemic risk, and prevent market abuse. The FSB provided recommendations to G-20 nations for standardization, central clearing, platform trading, and reporting of OTC derivatives transactions. Multiple reports were published by the FSB between 2010 and 2012 detailing country progress on these reforms. In 2012, reports detailed country commitments in six areas of OTC derivatives reform. The Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems published recommendations on OTC derivatives data reporting in 2011. The G-20 Summit in 2011 adopted recommendations for reforming the OTC derivatives market. Reforming the over-the-counter derivatives markets is crucial for a resilient financial system. Standardized contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms, centrally cleared, and reported to trade repositories by the end of 2012. Non-centrally cleared contracts will have higher capital requirements. A coordination group is established by the FSB to address regulatory issues. The FSB is tasked with monitoring G-20 nations' progress in implementing OTC derivatives market reforms. The G-20 leaders have focused on three major objectives of reforms: improving transparency, mitigating risk, and protecting against market abuse. These objectives are addressed through five broad areas of reforms, including standardizing OTC derivatives contracts and developing international standards for central clearing and risk management. The FSB offered four general conclusions based on self-assessments by G-20 members, except for a few countries like France, Germany, and Italy. The FSB found that only Japan and the United States had adopted necessary legislation for derivatives to be centrally cleared by the end of 2012. The EU had a political consensus on legislation, but progress for other asset classes was uncertain. Most countries were behind in implementing commitments for standardized contracts to be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms by year-end 2012. Increasing trading on organized platforms is crucial for transparency and mitigating systemic risk. Only the United States had passed relevant legislation. The G-20 nations are working on standardizing contracts for central clearing, organized trading, and reporting to trade repositories to improve transparency, reduce systemic risk, and prevent market abuse. Most countries have made progress in developing legislative frameworks for reporting OTC derivatives contracts to trade repositories, with the United States leading in passing relevant legislation. The EU and Japan have also taken steps towards improving transparency in derivatives markets. The FSB lacked information on capital requirements for non-bank regulated entities, as capital standards for banks' exposures to central clearing parties are still being developed. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the BIS have published reports on capital and collateral requirements for banks' exposures to central counterparties and OTC derivatives. The BIS expects higher capital standards for non-centrally cleared contracts to incentivize standardization. The FSB initiated a working group to address the issue of most derivative contracts not being eligible for central counterparty clearing, in line with G-20 recommendations. The group was led by the CPSS of the BIS to improve standardization and central clearing of derivatives contracts. The FSB, CPSS, IOSCO, and EC are working on policy options to promote standardized products and mandatory clearing of derivatives contracts globally. The key areas of reform include standards for OTC derivatives contracts, central clearing, trading platforms, trade reporting, and capital requirements. Standardization of derivative contracts is crucial for meeting G-20 commitments. The FSB, CPSS, IOSCO, and EC are collaborating on promoting standardized derivatives products and mandatory clearing globally. Major derivatives dealers have developed a roadmap for increasing standardization, focusing on benchmarking, product standardization, and working with central clearing parties. Progress shows that half of surveyed countries are adopting measures to increase standardized derivative products and processes. The October 2012 FSB progress report highlighted that uncertainty over legislative and regulatory requirements is hindering progress in offering products for clearing and developing new services to support mandatory central clearing. Lack of standardization of financial products and uncertainty about which features will be used as the measure for \"standardization\" across jurisdictions is also slowing progress in offering new products and services for clearing standardized derivatives. The expanded role of CCPs in global financial markets enhances counterparty risk management by providing transparency, accurate risk assessment, and effective insurance against counterparty risk through pooling risks. CCPs have a unique position to assess risks faced by the financial system as a whole and improve risk management and capital allocation. The growing role of CCPs is highlighted by the European Central Bank (ECB). The growing role of CCPs in global financial markets provides effective insurance against counterparty risk by pooling risks. However, the increasing importance of CCPs also brings systemic risks, making regulation and oversight necessary. Factors like market size, governance, and structure impact the successful implementation of central clearing. Achieving sufficient liquidity may require mandatory central clearing, as market incentives alone may not be enough to encourage participation. The economic benefits of central clearing are fully realized with more participants. CCPs need outside supervision to prevent conflicts with risk mitigation. Balancing efficiency and safety is crucial in supervising CCPs. Competition between CCPs can decentralize clearing but may not be optimal. Concentrated clearing poses risks of excessive risk concentration and oversight challenges, especially for cross-border CCPs. BIS proposed standards based on IOSCO and CPSS recommendations. The BIS proposed standards for central clearing of derivatives in 2012, adopted by G-20 and some FSB members. These standards aim to enhance safety, efficiency, limit systemic risk, and foster transparency in financial market infrastructures. Clearing trades centrally can mitigate structural weaknesses in OTC derivatives markets. About half of derivatives contracts are not cleared by a CCP. CCPs aim to reduce counterparty credit risk by netting exposures and enforcing collateralization. G-20 leaders agreed that all standardized derivatives should be cleared through central counterparties by 2012 to mitigate systemic risk. Non-centrally cleared contracts may face higher capital requirements. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recommends higher capital requirements for derivative contracts. In 2012, only 40% of interest rate derivatives were cleared through a central counterparty, while just 10% of credit default swaps were cleared this way. Progress towards central clearing varied among G-20 nations, with the EU, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States making significant legislative strides. The FSB noted progress in implementing legislation for central clearing of OTC derivatives in various jurisdictions, with the US, Japan, and EU needing technical regulations for full effectiveness. Some countries are waiting for regulatory frameworks from leading nations before adopting their own. Regulatory uncertainty remains the main obstacle to further progress. The FSB highlighted regulatory uncertainty as the main impediment to further progress in market infrastructure. They urged jurisdictions to promptly implement legislation and regulations, especially regarding CCP registration requirements for offering clearing services domestically and cross-border. This impacts large banks and brokerage firms with operations in multiple jurisdictions. In October 2012, the FSB reported conclusions on central clearing of derivatives contracts. CCPs are available to clear OTC derivatives in five asset classes. 19 CCPs were surveyed, with 9 in different jurisdictions and 5 offering services across borders. CCPs apply membership criteria to applicants domestically and abroad, with direct clearing members usually located in the same jurisdiction. Timelines for clearing new products vary based on complexity, with some CCPs unable to estimate introduction times due to risk management procedures and regulatory approvals. Approximately half of CCPs have operational links to other market infrastructure. The FSB published survey results in November 2012 on G-20 and FSB countries' approaches to central clearing. The majority of countries allow market participants to use domestic or cross-border CCPs for clearing OTC derivatives contracts. Most G-20 members are expected to implement mandatory clearing requirements or a combination of mandatory clearing and economic incentives to meet the commitment of centrally clearing all standardized OTC derivatives contracts by the end of 2012. Some countries have concerns about fair and open access to clearing. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the BIS produced 24 principles for financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to ensure fair and open access. These principles cover areas such as risk management, settlement, and transparency. Fair and open access to FMI services promotes competition and efficiency in clearing and settlement. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has identified four safeguards for a global framework to help authorities make informed decisions on central counterparties (CCPs) to meet the G-20 commitment. These safeguards include fair market access, cooperative oversight arrangements, appropriate liquidity arrangements, and robust resolution regimes for CCPs. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has outlined four safeguards for a global framework on central counterparties (CCPs) to meet the G-20 commitment. These safeguards include fair market access, cooperative oversight arrangements, appropriate liquidity arrangements, and robust resolution regimes for CCPs. The BIS has published guidance on capital requirements for banks dealing with CCPs and on the recovery and resolution of CCPs during times of crisis. The G-20 leaders agreed that all standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms. OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and cleared through CCPs by the end of 2012. Nearly 90% of derivatives contracts were transacted over-the-counter. The G-20 tasked organizations like BIS and IOSCO to provide guidance for the transition to trading platforms. Legal and regulatory regimes were utilized to regulate derivatives trading, along with international principles for securities regulation. Currently, trading platforms for derivatives can be categorized into multi-dealer platforms and single-dealer platforms, each with varying trade execution models and participant coverage. These platforms aim to ensure an orderly market that protects investors, with interest rate derivatives dominating the market. There are differences in automation, asset class coverage, and geographic reach among the various trading platforms. Trading platforms for derivatives can be categorized into five common forms: order book system, market maker system, periodic auction system, and bulletin board system. These systems provide automated trading, liquidity provision, batch processing of orders, and electronic quotation mediums for market participants. The bulletin board system is an electronic quotation medium for market participants to display quotations in specific instruments. The FSB reported in October 2012 that progress in enacting legislative frameworks for trading standardized derivatives on exchanges and electronic platforms was behind schedule, with uncertainty over the regulatory framework inhibiting development. Only the United States had adopted legislation for this purpose as of October 2012. The FSB reported in October 2012 that the lack of widespread development of organized trading platforms for OTC derivatives is mainly due to uncertainty about regulatory requirements. The United States is the only country with legislation mandating standardized derivatives to be traded on exchanges and electronic platforms. The FSB argues for transparency in reporting OTC derivatives transactions to inform decisions on mandatory platform trading. Market infrastructure operators also face challenges in creating technology to interface with clients and other infrastructure. The FSB highlighted the less developed trading infrastructure for OTC derivatives, with uncertainties about regulatory frameworks. Organized trading platforms mainly focus on credit and interest rate swaps, varying in features and global presence. The platforms are mostly based in Europe and the US, with increasing links to other infrastructure expected. Issue: Trade repositories are crucial for providing national authorities with a comprehensive view of OTC derivatives markets to assess systemic risk, conduct market surveillance, supervise participants, and carry out resolution activities. Standardization of OTC derivatives products is essential for trading on organized platforms, leading to improved market liquidity, pricing, and transparency. New trading platforms are expected to emerge quickly once regulatory frameworks are established. The FSB's October 2012 survey found that most trade repositories primarily serve market participants in their home jurisdictions. Lack of a common format for data reporting hinders the aggregation of OTC derivatives data across multiple TRs. Efforts are underway to address this issue, including the development of a global Legal Entity Identifier system. The finance sector is behind in establishing a consistent global framework for entity identification. The LEI system is seen as a crucial component in enhancing financial transparency. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposed the development of a Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) to govern the global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system. The ROC, operational since January 2013, consists of 45 authorities, primarily central banks, and 15 observers. The LEI system aims to improve risk management, assess micro and macroprudential risks, facilitate orderly resolution, prevent market abuse and financial fraud, and enhance the quality and accuracy of financial data.

The LEI system aims to improve risk management, assess micro and macroprudential risks, facilitate orderly resolution, prevent market abuse and financial fraud, and enhance the quality and accuracy of financial data. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission are involved, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York having observer status. Latest developments include progress in reporting credit, interest rate, and equity derivatives, plans to extend asset classes for trade reporting, and readiness of G-15 dealers for mandatory trade reporting. TRs' estimates for new client registration time range from six weeks to three months. There is commonality in data categories collected by TRs, but no standard format for reporting and storage. Less than half of TRs collect portfolio-level information. All TRs have data security measures in place and provide access to authorities and the public in an anonymous, aggregated form. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision supports reforms for appropriate risk coverage of counterparty credit risk. The Basel III reforms aim to strengthen capital requirements for counterparty credit risk in OTC derivatives transactions. Banks will face credit valuation adjustment charges for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives to quantify potential losses from changes in counterparty credit quality. BCBS issued interim rules in July 2012 to ensure capital requirements for bank exposures to central clearing parties and clients performing central clearing services. The Basel III reforms aim to strengthen capital requirements for counterparty credit risk in OTC derivatives transactions. Interim rules were issued in July 2012 by BCBS to ensure capital requirements for bank exposures to central clearing parties and clients performing central clearing services. These rules include setting a nominal risk weight for banks acting as clearing members of a CCP and requiring them to hold capital against the prospect of drawing upon their default fund. Banks will also need to apply a default risk to their contributions to non-qualifying CCPs. The BIS proposed margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives to mitigate systemic risk, ensure collateral availability, and limit uncollateralized exposures in the financial system. These requirements complement G-20 reforms by promoting central clearing and addressing financial incentives to customize contracts. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published final draft regulations on capital requirements for central counterparties on September 26, 2012. The capital of a European CCP should cover operational expenses, legal risks, credit, counterparty credit, and market risks. The FSB monitors G-20 nations' progress in implementing recommendations. The FSB monitors G-20 nations' progress in implementing recommendations on OTC derivatives market reforms. Some countries are lagging behind in adopting and implementing legislation and regulations, with the most progress seen in reporting to trade repositories and the least progress in implementing margin requirements for non-centrally traded derivatives. The data is based on a questionnaire sent to FSB member countries. The FSB monitors G-20 nations' progress in implementing recommendations on OTC derivatives market reforms, with some countries showing progress in central clearing and reporting to trade repositories. Some jurisdictions are waiting for key elements of the regulatory framework in the EU, Japan, and the United States to be finalized before implementing their own legislation. Individual country details are available in the report's Appendix B. The FSB emphasized the need for jurisdictions to promptly develop and implement legislative and regulatory frameworks for OTC derivatives reform. Market participants must also expand standardized transactions, central clearing, organized trading platforms, and TR reporting. Failure to meet commitments by the deadline risks losing momentum for reform and the benefits of improved transparency and systemic risk mitigation. The FSB highlighted the importance of regulatory development in OTC derivatives trading for transparency, risk mitigation, and market protection. They concluded that market infrastructures are in place and can be expanded, international policy work on safeguards for clearing derivatives is mostly completed, but uncertainty about the regulatory framework hinders further progress. The FSB emphasized the need for regulatory development in OTC derivatives trading to enhance transparency and risk mitigation. Market infrastructures are established, but uncertainty about the regulatory framework is hindering further progress. Clarity and consensus on standardization are required to reduce regulatory arbitrage and accelerate standardization efforts in the financial sector. The FSB supports efforts to improve access to trade repository data for regulatory and financial stability purposes. Financial market regulators from various countries met to discuss reforming OTC derivatives markets and addressing cross-border regulatory issues. The regulators aim to address cross-border regulatory issues by supporting consistent standards across jurisdictions. Harmonization of rules is challenging due to different legal systems and market conditions. Their objective is to prevent regulatory gaps, reduce arbitrage opportunities, and ensure a level playing field. Conflicting rules hinder cross-border transactions. Regulators reached mutual understanding on principles including Clearing Determinants. The regulators agreed to consult before determining which derivatives products will be subject to mandatory clearing. They also agreed on sharing information and cooperation for effective supervision of cross-border activities. Additionally, they aim to meet G-20 clearing, reporting, trading, and capital requirements by the end of 2012, despite potential differences in implementation dates causing regulatory gaps and uncertainty. The regulators agreed on a \"reasonable, limited\" transition period to address gaps in regulations and uncertainty in cross-border regulatory requirements. They also agreed on different approaches to regulating cross-border activities when multiple sets of rules apply. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) was approved on July 4, 2012, and aims to reform the OTC derivatives market in the EU. It establishes clearing obligations, risk mitigation techniques, reporting obligations, and requirements for trade repositories. The regulation requires central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives. The EMIR mandates central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives contracts judged to be subject to clearing obligations. ESMA developed draft technical standards specifying criteria for covered derivatives, prudential requirements for CCPs, and data reporting to trade repositories. ECON of the European Parliament rejected two proposed regulations by ESMA on indirect clearing arrangements. The European Parliament rejected ESMA's proposed regulations on indirect clearing arrangements and central counterparties. ECON's recommendation delayed implementation for at least six months, but a compromise deal allowed non-financial firms to postpone standards for three years. The remaining standards will be implemented around mid-March 2013. The European Union's EMIR addresses cross-border rules on OTC derivatives markets, recognizing equivalent regimes in other jurisdictions. This allows EU counterparties to apply foreign jurisdiction rules and comply with EMIR obligations. The EMIR allows EU entities to apply foreign jurisdiction rules for OTC derivatives markets, with recognition of foreign CCPs and TRs. The EC must determine equivalence of rules and supervision, with cooperation agreements required with ESMA and foreign authorities. The HKMA and SFC have proposed implementing G-20 OTC derivatives market reforms. Hong Kong is working on implementing G-20 OTC derivatives market reforms, including consultations on regulated activities and systemically important entities. There is no mandate currently for derivatives to be traded on organized platforms, but regulators have the option to implement this after further research. The proposed framework includes defining OTC derivatives transactions, mandatory reporting and clearing, regulation of CCPs, and capital requirements. The Hong Kong proposal includes reporting obligations, mandatory clearing obligations, regulation of CCPs, capital and margin requirements, oversight of systemically important players, and location requirements for reporting to trade repositories. Derivatives transactions affecting Hong Kong's financial markets must be reported to the HKMA trade repository. Exceptions are provided for central banks, certain global institutions, and intra-group transactions. The Japanese Diet approved revised legislation on electronic trading platforms and market transparency, to be phased in over three years. Initially, the requirements will apply to OTC derivatives, primarily Japanese yen-denominated interest rate swaps. Mandatory clearing requirements will expand to include foreign currency denominated interest rate swaps and credit default swaps referenced to Japanese companies. The new legislation in Japan mandates clearing requirements for OTC derivatives transactions among large domestic financial institutions registered under the FIEA, members of JSCC, or subsidiaries of JSCC members. Foreign financial institutions may also be included. Financial institutions must report OTC derivatives transactions to trade repositories, covering credit derivatives and various types of swap transactions. The FSB assesses G-20 countries' progress in implementing reforms through surveys provided semi-annually. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses governance of the derivatives market and implements G-20 commitments. Final implementation is left to executive agencies like the CFTC and SEC. Section 722 limits the act's swaps market reforms to activities with a direct connection to the US. The FSB assesses countries' progress in implementing reforms through surveys. The CFTC determines activities related to swaps markets with a direct connection to the US. Congress oversees this determination. The CFTC issued guidance on cross-border swaps provisions, requiring foreign firms with significant OTC derivatives activity to register with the CFTC. Foreign firms registering with the CFTC may substitute compliance with a foreign regulatory regime. Congress oversees the CFTC's assessments, which could impact U.S. businesses with foreign operations. Legislation in the 112th Congress addressed global swaps market questions and Dodd-Frank provisions. In the 112th Congress, legislation such as H.R. 2779 and H.R. 3283 addressed exemptions and limitations on swaps between U.S. and non-U.S. entities under Dodd-Frank. This raises questions about the registration of non-U.S. persons as swap dealers, application of Dodd-Frank requirements to OTC derivatives activities, and the reach of Title VII requirements to U.S. persons abroad. Following the financial crisis of 2008-2009, G-20 leaders have implemented reforms in derivatives trading regulations. Congress may need to monitor these reforms to compare U.S. regulations with those abroad. The objective is to standardize derivatives contracts. Members of Congress and U.S. regulators should consider when to allow non-U.S. persons to comply with foreign regulations instead of U.S. requirements. The objective of derivatives trading regulations reforms is to standardize contracts and have them traded on organized markets through central counterparties with sufficient capital. Data on standardized contracts will be reported to trade repositories for regulators and policymakers to assess market stability. Reforms are focused on standardizing OTC contracts, central clearing, risk management, electronic platform trading, reporting transactions to trade repositories, and implementing international standards for capital. The OTC derivatives markets are undergoing reforms to standardize contracts and implement international standards for capital requirements. Regulators are facing the challenge of regulating domestic activity in markets that are international in scope. Market participants are closely monitoring the implementation of reforms and instances of regulatory arbitrage. The FSB, tasked by the G-20, is coordinating and reporting on the progress of derivatives market reforms. Countries are making progress in areas such as having derivatives contracts. The surveyed countries are making progress in areas like clearing and reporting derivatives contracts, but are lagging in standardizing contracts and building up capital reserves. The lack of a standardized definition for derivatives contracts hinders comparability of data reported to trade repositories, affecting regulators' ability to assess the derivatives markets. Comparability of reforms across countries is also a key issue, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of current reforms and the potential for regulatory arbitrage. The Financial Stability Board found that regulators and derivatives market participants were struggling to implement market reforms by the end of 2012. Progress has been made in standardizing, clearing, and reporting derivatives contracts, but regulators face conflicting objectives and pressure from market participants to develop common rules to reduce regulatory arbitrage and uncertainties in cross-border transactions. Regulators are aligning their actions with market leaders to ensure proposed regulations are in line with international standards. Few countries are aligning their regulations with market leaders like the US and EU. Many nations are facing challenges in reforming derivatives trading and reporting due to uncertainty over regulatory frameworks. While G-20 countries and FSB members are committed to implementing reforms, progress varies, with the US leading the way. Regulatory conformity issues are hindering efforts to standardize, clear, and report on derivatives contracts. Market leaders are uncertain about standardized derivatives contracts, hindering regulatory progress. Trade repositories struggle with data reporting formats, making aggregation difficult. Efforts to standardize data reporting for OTC contracts face challenges. The lack of a common format for OTC derivatives trade data reporting hinders the ability to aggregate data across multiple trade repositories, impacting regulatory objectives. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) play key roles in promoting collaboration and improving banking supervision worldwide. The BCBS promotes collaboration and improves banking supervision worldwide by exchanging information on supervisory issues, developing guidelines and standards, particularly in capital adequacy and cross-border banking supervision. Central Counterparties (CCPs) act as intermediaries in financial markets, reducing risks by requiring collateral from participants. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) are structured asset-backed securities with different risk tranches. Investors buy CDOs, with senior tranches considered safer. CDOs based on sub-prime mortgages caused the 2008-2009 financial crises. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) addresses concerns about payment efficiency and stability. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) focuses on issues related to clearing, settlement, and financial market relations. It is comprised of central bank Governors. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are derivative contracts between two parties, with payoffs linked to credit events. European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) is legislation aimed at regulating the European financial market. Payoffs and collateral calls on CDSs linked to sub-prime mortgage CDOs were a key factor in the financial crisis. The European Commission implemented reforms in the over-the-counter derivatives market in August 2012. The reforms include reporting and clearing obligations for OTC derivatives, measures to reduce risks, common rules for central counterparties, and the establishment of interoperability between CCPs. The European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) ensures the stability of the EU's financial system by enhancing investor protection and supervisory convergence among securities regulators. The European Banking Authority (EBA) was established in November 2010 to safeguard financial system stability, market transparency, and investor protection. It works closely with other European Supervisory Authorities in banking and insurance sectors to prevent regulatory arbitrage, promote supervisory convergence, and provide advice on banking regulations and corporate governance. The Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) are crucial for clearing, settlement, and recording of financial transactions, providing efficiency and reducing risks. Some FMIs help central banks with monetary policy and financial stability. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) was created at the G-20 to address issues related to corporate governance, auditing, and financial reporting. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) was established at the G-20 to coordinate and monitor the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies for financial stability. The FSB is chaired by Mark Carney and U.S. members include the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Group of Twenty (G-20) consists of various countries and serves as a forum for international economic cooperation. The G-20, established in 1999, is a forum for international economic cooperation among 20 major advanced and emerging-market countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), founded in 1944, provides policy advice and financing to member countries in economic difficulties and works with developing nations to achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty. The IMF works with developing nations to achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty by promoting international monetary cooperation, providing policy advice, conducting research and analysis, offering loans, providing concessional loans, and offering technical assistance and training. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) sets standards for securities markets and is the primary international forum for securities market regulation. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) program aims to create a universal standard identifier for parties in financial transactions globally. Trade Repositories (TRs) maintain transaction data centrally, providing regulators with timely access to enhance transparency and identify risks in the financial system. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) program aims to create a universal standard identifier for parties in financial transactions globally. Trade Repositories (TRs) maintain transaction data centrally to enhance transparency and identify risks in the financial system. Appendix B details the progress of G-20 members in implementing derivatives market reforms by the end of 2012, with Argentina showing increased standardization of OTC derivatives trading. Argentina has regulations in place to incentivize trading derivatives on organized platforms with central clearing, overseen by the Central Bank and the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV). The country aims to expand the variety of contracts offered without the need for new regulations. Argentina requires standardized derivatives to be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms. MAE is considering expanding the products available for trading. CNV mandates the use of a common software for trading securities to ensure standardization. Transparency is key, with pre-trade and post-trade price and volume transparency required for all derivatives. There are no current laws mandating reporting of OTC derivatives transactions to trade repositories. The Central Bank monitors OTC derivatives transactions with cross-border counterparties. Legislative steps have been taken for reporting requirements, with no further steps needed for effectiveness. Derivatives under CNV jurisdiction must be centrally cleared. Australian markets mainly trade standardized interest rate and foreign exchange products. The Australian government is introducing legislation to centrally clear standardized derivatives through central counterparties. Regulations and rules need to be implemented before mandatory obligations are imposed. Australian regulators are considering changes to implement Basel III by January 2013, including mandatory trade reporting, central clearing, and trade execution obligations. Legislation is also being introduced to require trading of standardized derivatives on trading platforms or exchanges. The Australian government is introducing legislation for mandatory trade reporting of OTC derivatives on trading platforms or exchanges, with final adoption expected by the end of 2012. Regulations and rules need to be developed before full implementation. Transparency and trading regulations are under review, including pre-trade and post-trade price and volume transparency for all exchange-traded and OTC derivatives. The Australian government is introducing legislation for mandatory trade reporting of OTC derivatives. Implementation of central clearing requirements will be considered on an asset class basis and likely harmonized with major jurisdictions. Reporting to a prescribed governmental authority may be required if trade repositories are not available. Brazil's derivatives markets are highly standardized, with existing legislation requiring central clearing for all exchange-traded derivatives.
