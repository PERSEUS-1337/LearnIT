    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY. The Congress finds that Caribbean trade is valuable for the United States, with the region representing a significant market. Assistance is needed to continue economic reforms and stimulate investment in the Caribbean Basin. Progress has been made in areas aligning with US interests, but more work is necessary. The Castro regime in Cuba is a totalitarian government that violates civil liberties and human rights, lacks a market-oriented economy, and refuses to implement reforms for democracy. The US has historically isolated and sanctioned the regime. The US Congress declares that trade policy must align with foreign policy and hold recipients of foreign assistance accountable for decisions that could harm US interests in the Western Hemisphere. Safeguard mechanisms are needed to prevent US assistance or trade agreements from benefiting the Castro regime in Cuba. The US will withhold assistance to Caribbean Basin Initiative countries supporting Cuba's membership in CARICOM or CACM. Additionally, certain tariff treatment will be prohibited for countries offering membership to Cuba or negotiating a free trade agreement with Cuba. Beginning 90 days after enactment, the President will deny tariff treatment to Caribbean Basin Initiative countries supporting Cuba's membership in CARICOM or CACM, or negotiating a free trade agreement with Cuba. The Act defines terms such as CACM, Caribbean Basin Initiative country, CARICOM, and Government of Cuba. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 outlines conditions for a transition government or democratically elected government in Cuba. The term \"NAFTA country\" is defined in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act."
