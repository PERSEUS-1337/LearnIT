    "content": "The EPA issued proposed rules in December 2003 to address interstate transport of air pollutants affecting NAAQS for PM 2.5 and ozone. The proposed rule identifies states contributing to downwind non-attainment and follows a methodology used in a previous regulation for ozone pollution. The EPA issued proposed rules in December 2003 to address interstate transport of ozone pollution through the NOx SIP Call. EPA set emissions budgets for NOx emissions in 21 states and the District of Columbia, recommending cost-effective controls on electric generators and industrial facilities. The IAQ rule proposes a region-wide emissions cap for NOx and SO2 to be implemented in two phases - 2010 and 2015, with estimates of emissions reductions provided in Table 1. EPA's methodology involves applying cost-effective pollution controls on electric generating units. The EPA proposed cost-effective pollution controls on electric generating units to address interstate transport of ozone pollution. Each state is assigned an emissions budget and required to submit a revised State Implementation Plan. EPA believes a regional cap-and-trade program focused on electric generators is the most cost-effective way to achieve the emissions cap. EPA also finalized new NAAQS for PM 2.5 and ozone in 1997. The EPA implemented new NAAQS for ozone and PM 2.5, tightening standards and setting annual and 24-hour concentration limits. Coordination of the new 8-hour ozone standard with the previous 1-hour standard faced challenges. EPA took a cautious approach to implementing the new standards. In 1998, Congress set a schedule for NAAQS compliance based on EPA's Interim Implementation Policy. EPA analysis shows violations of PM 2.5 standards in eastern US, California, and Montana, affecting 65 million people. Violations of the 8-hour Ozone NAAQS are also widespread. The EPA analysis indicates widespread violations of the 8-hour Ozone NAAQS in various states, affecting 115 million people in 297 counties. The promulgation of revised ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS led to SIP Calls for states to submit revised plans for compliance. The EPA issued the proposed Interstate Air Quality rule (IAQ) in December 2003 to address interstate transport of pollutants contributing to non-attainment. States are required to submit their IAQ rule SIP before NAAQS non-attainment SIPs. EPA justifies the submission of transported air pollutant SIPs by upwind states before the NAAQS non-attainment SIPs. EPA justifies the submission of transported air pollutant SIPs by upwind states before non-attainment SIPs by downwind states based on Clean Air Act sections and policy considerations. The proposed IAQ rule is based on EPA determinations regarding pollution transport, cost-effective control, and compliance feasibility. The pivotal finding is that affected states significantly contribute to non-attainment in downwind states, defining the geographic scope of the rule. The proposed rule by EPA focuses on determining the contribution of upwind states to non-attainment areas in the eastern U.S. for ozone pollution. EPA defines a \"significant contribution\" based on the amount of transported pollution, frequency of threshold exceedance, and comparative contribution to total non-attainment. Modeling was done for 31 states east of the Mississippi River on 47 downwind counties. States with minimal estimated contributions were identified. The EPA proposed rule focuses on determining significant contributions to non-attainment areas in the eastern U.S. for ozone pollution. After evaluating eastern states, 25 were found to significantly contribute. EPA modeled emissions impacts of 41 states on 57 downwind counties for PM 2.5 NAAQS, with a proposed threshold of 0.15ug/m3. 28 states and the District of Columbia were projected to significantly contribute to 2010 PM 2.5 non-attainment. The EPA proposed rule identified 28 states and the District of Columbia as significant contributors to 2010 PM 2.5 non-attainment. EPA modeled emission impacts with a more stringent threshold of 0.10 ug/m3, adding North Dakota and Oklahoma to the list of contributors. The exclusion of Western U.S. states from further analysis was based on geography, meteorology, and topography factors. The EPA excluded Western U.S. states from further analysis of non-attainment areas due to factors like geography and meteorology. The proposed IAQ rule aims to develop a cost-effective remedy based on highly cost-effective reductions. EPA examined the balance between local and interstate controls for addressing significant contributions to non-attainment in other states. The EPA concluded that reducing transport of pollutants over a broader regional area is necessary to reach attainment in many PM 2.5 non-attainment areas. They found that improvements in downwind air quality were mainly due to reductions in transported sulfate from upwind SO2 emissions. For 8-hour ozone non-attainment areas, EPA determined that further regional reductions were needed, calling for a combination of local and interstate transport controls. EPA developed criteria for determining \"highly cost-effective\" transport control levels for SO2 and NOx emissions. SO2 is mainly emitted by stationary sources like coal-fired electric generators, while mobile sources are the primary source of NOx. EPA focused on electric generators for cost-effective emission reduction and set thresholds for large industrial combustion sources in their calculations. EPA developed criteria for determining \"highly cost-effective\" transport control levels for SO2 and NOx emissions by comparing costs of control technologies on electric generators with other regulatory actions. The final regionwide cap for controlling pollutants was determined to be \"highly cost-effective.\" Based on the assumption that States would solely target electric generators for control, EPA proposed redemption ratios of CAA Title IV allowances during phase 1 and phase 2 to achieve a 50% reduction and 67% reduction, respectively, in SO2 emissions. For NOx emissions, EPA calculated emission budgets based on historical annual heat input. The proposed rule sets NOx emission rates at 0.15 lb./mmBtu during phase 1 and 0.125 lb./mmBtu during phase 2, based on historical annual heat input. EPA's rule divides reductions into two phases starting in 2010 and 2015, with deadlines determined by available labor. Additional scrubbers and SCR units would be needed to meet the 2010 requirement. EPA sets NOx emission rates for two phases starting in 2010 and 2015. The deadline for phase 2 is justified by the need for additional time and capital to install controls. EPA believes deferring phase 2 to 2015 will allow companies to overcome technical challenges and raise necessary capital. EPA's preferred implementation strategy is a regionwide cap and trade program focused solely on electric generators. States are encouraged to submit SIPs that follow EPA's guidelines for a model cap and trade program. The proposed rule allows states to choose to cap emissions from electric generators without requiring reductions from other emission sources. States may join together to create a regionwide system, but participation is voluntary. The proposed rule includes two cap and trade systems for SO2 and NOx in a 28-state area to address interstate transport of pollutants hindering downwind states from meeting ozone and PM 2.5 standards. EPA predicts a greater impact on PM 2.5 attainment in the eastern U.S. than on eastern 8-hour ozone attainment, with 58 counties projected to achieve compliance by 2015. The EPA predicts that the proposed IAQ rule will bring 28 counties into compliance by 2015, leaving 13 counties in the eastern U.S. non-compliant. In contrast, 297 counties were out of compliance with the 8-hour ozone standard in 2001. The projected base case is expected to bring 240 counties into compliance, with an additional 8 counties in the east becoming compliant. This leaves 26 counties in the eastern U.S. non-compliant in 2015. EPA does not provide data on non-compliance in the West where the rule would have no direct effect. The EPA's proposed rule raises questions about the magnitude of required reductions and the criteria for determining actual budgets. A more stringent threshold for significant contribution could involve more states in the reduction scheme. The EPA's reduction program is based on \"highly cost-effective\" SO2 and NOx emission reductions from electric generators. The cost-benefit analysis suggests substantial net economic benefits, with annual net benefits in 2010 of approximately $55 billion. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis shows significant net economic benefits from emission reductions, with annual net benefits in 2010 of $55 billion and in 2015 of $80 billion. Questions are raised about focusing only on electric generators for reductions, as other sectors were recommended for controls by OTAG. The EPA's NOx SIP Call calculated state emission budgets based on five sectors, requiring substantial reductions from electric generators and nonutility sources. The proposed IAQ rule exempted certain stationary sources due to lack of data, raising questions about the scope of the rule and the decision to exempt the West from consideration. The EPA's proposed IAQ rule raises concerns about compliance in the West with PM 2.5 and 8-hour ozone standards. Questions arise regarding the exclusion of the West from detailed analysis and the timing of emissions reductions for states facing attainment deadlines. Pennsylvania supports a more comprehensive analysis and emphasizes the importance of cost-effective emissions reductions. The Ozone Transport Commission submitted concerns about the IAQR, stating that emissions reductions are not required until after ozone and PM2.5 attainment dates, which may not be soon enough. EPA argues that 2010 is the earliest feasible mandate for reductions, citing constraints on skilled boilermakers for installing control technology. EPA concludes that control equipment and skilled boilermakers would come during a narrow window at the end of the compliance period. The first phase control levels aim to maximize total control installations while considering labor constraints, resulting in predicted reductions of 40-50% for both pollutants. A phased-in installation schedule could lessen the labor constraint and allow for additional control technology installations. Applying the logic to phase 2 could potentially result in a deadline following phase 1 by only 18 months. EPA modified its justification for the 2015 phase 2 deadline, shifting from labor constraints to potential technical and financing issues. The proposed rule emphasizes similarities to previous methodologies but differences exist between the two rules. The proposed rule's NOx trading program differs from the NOx SIP Call, which focuses on ozone attainment seasonally. States like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire are not covered under the proposed rule but are under the NOx SIP Call or Ozone Transport Commission's trading scheme. The proposed rule only focuses on electric generators, unlike the NOx SIP Call which includes large industrial boilers. Transitional and compatibility issues will be addressed by EPA for affected states. The EPA is addressing transitional and compatibility issues by providing affected states with a model cap and trade program in a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPR). Electric generators may not find the transition difficult during phase 1 as the mandated emissions rate is the same as the NOx SIP Call. However, states and industrial sources may face substantial economic impacts if they are left in a smaller seasonal trading program. Developing a regional cap and trade SO2 program raises issues with the nationwide SO2 cap and trade program created under Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments mandates a reduction of SO2 emissions from electric generators to 8.95 million tons by January 1, 2000. This cap must be maintained in the future, with new SO2 emitting utility plants offsetting their emissions with reductions from existing facilities through a permit and emissions allowance system. Allowances are issued by the EPA and allocated to existing power plants, allowing utilities to offset emissions from newer, cleaner facilities. Power plants starting operation after enactment receive no allowances. The EPA's regional system for trading allowances raises concerns about surplus allowances and potential leakage. The size of the region plays a key role in determining the extent of leakage, with the large eastern trading region proposed in the rule likely to minimize leakage due to its physical limitations. The EPA proposes modifications to Title IV allowances for affected power plants to address potential leakage in the large eastern trading region. Allowances are not considered property rights and can be terminated or limited by the United States. The EPA proposes modifications to Title IV allowances for affected power plants to address potential leakage in the large eastern trading region. Allowances are not considered property rights and can be terminated or limited by the United States. The purpose of characterizing the legal status of allowances is to clarify that regulatory actions taken after issuance are not subject to the \"takings clause\" of the U.S. Constitution. Allowances are essentially permits that bind units to emissions limitations, and the government is not obligated to compensate allowance-holders for any loss in value if the allowances are limited, revoked, or modified. The EPA proposes modifications to Title IV allowances for affected power plants to address potential leakage in the large eastern trading region. Allowances are not considered property rights and can be altered in response to changes in the environment or public policy. The proposed IAQ rule's attempt to modify and restrict Title IV allowances may be subject to litigation and would impact other provisions of the Clean Air Act, such as the regional haze program. The reductions required under the proposed rule aim to reduce regional haze in the eastern U.S., and EPA seeks feedback on how this aligns with its regional haze program requirements. The EPA is proposing modifications to Title IV allowances for power plants to address potential leakage in the eastern trading region. The proposed rule aims to reduce regional haze in the eastern U.S. and seeks feedback on its alignment with regional haze program requirements. Additionally, EPA is considering expanding the emissions cap to states outside the IAQ control region to help meet regional haze obligations. EPA is also discussing potential issues with SO2 emission leakage in the West and the impact on petitions filed under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA is proposing modifications to Title IV allowances for power plants to address potential leakage in the eastern trading region, aiming to reduce regional haze. They are also considering expanding emissions cap to states outside the IAQ control region. Additionally, there are discussions on SO2 emission leakage in the West and its impact on petitions filed under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. EPA is proposing to use Section 126 petitions as a backup to the NOx SIP Call if derailed by courts, but there are concerns about compliance schedules meeting the requirements of Section 126. The proposed rule also includes controls on mercury emissions from coal-fired electric generators. The Administration announced a proposed Hg rule for electric generators in December 2003, aiming to integrate Hg reduction requirements with NOx and SO2 requirements of the IAQ rule. The proposal allows generators to meet Hg limits without specific control technology, but economic advantages may be lost if the IAQ rule is stalled. The proposed Hg rule aims to integrate Hg reduction requirements with NOx and SO2 requirements of the IAQ rule. If the Hg rule is stalled, modest reductions may still be achieved without it. The Bush Administration prefers the Clear Skies Act for addressing air pollution, but due to legislative uncertainty, the proposed rule is considered the prudent course. Clear Skies offers a cost-effective solution for reducing pollutants on a national scale, addressing issues such as leakage and lack of coverage. It introduces new statutory standards for pollutants and allows modified sources to opt in and be exempt from certain requirements. The proposed rule includes exemptions for existing sources to meet particulate matter standards and reduce carbon monoxide emissions within 3 years. It also provides relief for steam electric generating facilities from mercury regulation and delays enforcement of Section 126 petitions until 2012. However, these changes may spark further debate on the Clean Air Act beyond market mechanisms, and it remains uncertain if they will prompt a vote on Clear Skies or other multi-pollutant control bills in Congress. The proposed Interstate Air Quality rule, currently in a 60-day public comment period, aims to have far-reaching effects on economics, environmental impact, and policy. It takes a cost-effectiveness approach, using cost curves to find the most efficient reduction level. Market mechanisms like trading are included to ensure economically efficient reductions. The proposed Interstate Air Quality rule aims to be economically efficient by implementing market mechanisms like trading and banking. Deadlines are set with cost considerations in mind, and reduction targets are based on cost-benefit analysis, with benefits outweighing costs significantly. This approach prioritizes economic efficiency in decision-making. The proposed Interstate Air Quality rule focuses primarily on reducing premature fatalities among adults by lowering PM 2.5 levels. Economic perspectives prioritize cost-benefit analysis, potentially leading to higher reductions and accelerated deadlines. Environmental impacts mainly stem from sulfur dioxide control, with limited focus on ozone reduction. Alternative perspectives and highly cost-effective reduction strategies are not addressed in the proposed rule. The proposed rule primarily focuses on reducing PM 2.5 levels and sulfur dioxide control, with limited attention to ozone reduction. A complementary focus on ozone characteristics may be necessary for addressing non-attainment of PM 2.5 and ozone NAAQS in downwind states. Consideration of a seasonal weighting factor for greater NOx reductions during the ozone season is suggested. The EPA proposed Interstate Air Quality rule aims to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg through integrated actions. Consideration of a seasonal weighting factor for NOx reductions during the ozone season is suggested for potentially greater effectiveness, but the economic efficiency impact is uncertain. The EPA's proposed Mercury rule aims to reduce emissions by combining requirements and technologies to meet reduction targets. The lack of a cost-benefit analysis for Hg reductions raises questions about economic efficiency. The rule adds complexity to existing regulations under the Clean Air Act. The proposed rule for a regionwide annual cap and trade program under the Clean Air Act presents difficulties and conflicts with existing provisions. EPA may struggle to resolve these inconsistencies through regulation, suggesting a need for a statutory solution to restructure compliance strategies towards market-oriented programs."
