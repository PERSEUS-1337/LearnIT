    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arizona Voluntary Grazing Permit Buyout Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that grazing livestock on Federal lands in Arizona is increasingly difficult due to conflicts with other land uses, drought, foreign competition, and industry changes. Resolving these conflicts often requires costly range developments, impacting grazing permittees, lessees, and taxpayers. The cost of the Federal grazing program in Arizona exceeds revenues from grazing fees. Many permittees are willing to end livestock grazing on Federal lands in exchange for compensation. Ranchers and environmental groups in Arizona support voluntary agreements. Conservation groups in Arizona support a voluntary buyout program to compensate grazing permittees and lessees for ending livestock grazing on Federal lands. This program would provide economic options, help prevent the need to sell private lands, resolve conflicts between grazing and other land uses, and be fiscally prudent and socially just. The voluntary buyout program in Arizona is supported by conservation groups to compensate grazing permittees and lessees for ending livestock grazing on Federal lands. It would provide economic options, prevent the need to sell private lands, resolve conflicts between grazing and other land uses, and offer critical information for a possible nationwide expansion of such a program.
