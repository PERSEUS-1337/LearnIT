    "content": "The Act titled \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2007\" limits state and locality withholding and taxation of employee income. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2007\" restricts state and locality income tax withholding and reporting for employees working in multiple states. Wages are only subject to income tax in the state of residence and where the employee works for more than 60 days in a calendar year. Income tax withholding applies from the start of duties in each state or locality. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2007\" allows employers to rely on an employee's time estimate for state income tax withholding, as long as there is no fraud or collusion. Maintaining records of employee locations for business purposes does not override this reliance. Employers can also use their discretion to maintain a time and attendance system for tracking employee locations. The Act allows employers to use a time and attendance system to track employee locations, overriding the employee's own determination. Definitions include what constitutes a day worked in a state, who qualifies as an employee, and exceptions for professional athletes and entertainers. The Act defines professional athletes, entertainers, and certain public figures as individuals who perform services in their respective fields for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis. The term \"employer\" is defined as per the Internal Revenue Code, while \"locality\" refers to any political subdivision of a State. \"State\" includes all States, territories, or possessions of the United States. A \"time and attendance system\" records an employee's work location daily. The term \"wages or other remuneration\" is defined by the State or locality where employment duties are performed, based on daily work location records used by the employer for wage allocation across taxing jurisdictions."
