The \"Universal Service Fairness Act of 2003\" aims to ensure that consumers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas have access to affordable universal services. It highlights disparities in Federal support distribution, emphasizing the need for targeted assistance to small geographic regions within states to help rural consumers in need. The \"Universal Service Fairness Act of 2003\" aims to provide Federal universal service support to rural, insular, and high-cost areas by spreading benefits more equitably, removing implicit State support, and promoting rate comparability between rural and urban areas. Federal and State support mechanisms for high-cost areas need to be reviewed for necessary reform to assist rural consumers in need. SEC. 3. Eligibility for universal service support in high-cost areas. Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to provide universal service support for high-cost areas by revising the support mechanism for eligible telecommunications carriers serving rural, insular, and high-cost areas. The support will be based on the average cost per line in each wire center, with a threshold set at 3.75 times the national average cost per line. The Commission will also ensure hold harmless support for each State. The amendment to Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 provides universal service support for high-cost areas by revising the support mechanism for eligible telecommunications carriers. The support is limited to 5 percent of the total support calculated under the Commission's mechanism, with a cap on the total support for all States. The amendment to Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 establishes support for high-cost areas through a revised mechanism for eligible carriers. Support is capped at 5% of total calculated support, with limits on support for all States. The Commission must implement these requirements within 180 days of enactment. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on the need to reform the high cost support mechanism for rural, insular, and high cost areas. The report will assess rate comparability, removal of implicit support, impact on local competition, and the necessity of amending section 254 for universal service advancement. SEC. 5.
