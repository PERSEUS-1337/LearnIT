    "content": "The federal government plays a key role in protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from various hazards. Congress is particularly concerned about infrastructure vulnerability to natural disasters, accidents, and terrorism. Since 9/11, there has been a focus on identifying vulnerabilities and implementing measures to address them. Infrastructure concentrated in a limited area is at higher risk from geographic hazards like natural disasters and terrorist attacks. A catastrophic ice storm in metropolitan Chicago or extended closure of the port of Long Beach could have disproportionate national effects on infrastructure and commerce. The social and economic impacts of geographic disasters can quickly run into billions and spread beyond the event area. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted the U.S. energy and chemical sectors concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008 caused similar disruptions, raising concerns about geographic vulnerability. Congress has been examining federal policies related to critical infrastructure concentration and vulnerability. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 facilitated the construction of new liquefied natural gas import terminals in diverse ports. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2006 requires periodic studies to identify areas in the US where oil pipeline facilities may cause shortages or price disruptions. The 110th Congress is considering policies like H.R. 6566, H.R. 6709, S. 3202, and S. 3126 to lift federal moratoriums on offshore oil and gas development. This report discusses geographic concentration and vulnerability in critical infrastructures, highlighting the risks of catastrophic failure due to geographic hazards. The report discusses long-term forces contributing to infrastructure concentration, including resource location, agglomeration economies, and capital efficiency. It also examines how the federal government influences critical infrastructure through prescriptive siting, economic incentives, and regulations. The report offers options to address geographic vulnerability within current federal infrastructure policy, focusing on nationally critical infrastructure and federal activities. The report discusses specific geographic hazards to critical infrastructure in the context of federal policy. It does not quantify the likelihood of hazards or vulnerability of infrastructure. The definition of \"infrastructure\" has evolved due to the threat of terrorism. Federal reports and laws have expanded the sectors and assets considered critical for homeland security. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines \"critical infrastructure\" as vital systems and assets that, if destroyed, would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety. This definition was adopted in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, establishing the Department of Homeland Security. The 2006 National Infrastructure Protection Plan lists critical infrastructures and assets of national importance. The majority of critical infrastructure assets are owned by the private sector. Geographic concentration refers to assets located close enough to be vulnerable to disruption by regional events. Concentrated assets may account for a significant portion of national infrastructure capacity. The concentration of critical infrastructure assets in certain sectors or subsectors can have a significant impact on market prices and supplies. Market power is typically associated with companies holding a 25% to 35% market share. Other metrics of concentration, such as environmental factors, do not provide clear thresholds for identifying nationally concentrated assets. Some critical infrastructure sectors in the NIPP show geographic concentration. For example, over 38% of U.S. chlorine production is in coastal Louisiana, and over 33% of waterborne container shipments pass through Long Beach and Los Angeles. Additionally, around 37% of U.S. freight railcars pass through Illinois, and approximately 28% of U.S. hog inventories are in Iowa. About 25% of U.S. pharmaceuticals are manufactured in Puerto Rico. Approximately 43% of U.S. oil refining capacity is clustered along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, while 39% of U.S. securities and options are traded in lower Manhattan. Over 31% of U.S. naval shipbuilding capacity is in Norfolk, VA. Coastal Louisiana has concentrations of both refining and chemical production capacity. Metropolitan New York and New Jersey area contains a concentration of U.S. port capacity. The New York and New Jersey area is a critical infrastructure hub with 12% of container shipping and 8% of airline passengers. This concentration makes it vulnerable to various geographic hazards like hurricanes, floods, and ice storms, which can disrupt infrastructure and displace workers. The damaging effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita on energy and chemicals infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico have been widely reported. In 1998, a major ice storm in Quebec and the northeastern United States caused widespread power and communications blackouts, disrupting power-dependent services. Earthquakes can damage critical infrastructure in seismically active regions like the west coast, Alaska, and the central Mississippi Valley. The 1994 earthquake in Northridge, CA, caused significant damage to bridges and highways vital for commercial activities. The 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan caused extensive damage to critical infrastructure including the port, chemical manufacturers, steel manufacturers, railroads, and utilities. Repairs to the port took almost a year to complete. Coastal infrastructure is also vulnerable to tsunamis, as seen in the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean affecting Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, and other Asian nations. The United States is also potentially vulnerable to a major tsunami, which could disrupt ports and transportation infrastructure. A major tsunami in southern California could close the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles for two months, causing $60 billion in economic losses. Epidemics like SARS and bird flu have the potential to disrupt critical infrastructure by infecting workers or restricting their movement. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza warns that outbreaks can remove essential personnel from the workplace for weeks or months, threatening all critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical health and transportation infrastructure in Canada to infectious diseases like SARS and bird flu has been demonstrated. Concerns have been raised by various health organizations about the potential consequences of a bird flu pandemic. Analysts predict significant absenteeism among workers during a regional outbreak, with livestock concentrations also at risk of infectious diseases. Animal diseases, like foot and mouth disease (FMD), can quickly spread and affect large numbers of livestock in concentrated farming areas. An FMD outbreak could cost the U.S. economy up to $24 billion and have significant social impacts. Certain terrorist attacks, such as nuclear bombs or electromagnetic pulse weapons, could pose a threat to critical infrastructure. Major disasters, including nuclear bombs, radiological weapons, electromagnetic pulse devices, cyber-attacks, and biological attacks, can damage or disrupt critical infrastructure. These events occur often enough to warrant dedicated policy attention, with major disasters occurring almost annually in North America over the past 15 years. Not all events impact critical infrastructure, but the potential costs are significant. The geographic concentration of U.S. critical infrastructure has developed over time due to various market influences, including resource location, economies of scale, community preferences, and capital efficiency. Influences from natural resources and terrain are particularly evident in energy, agriculture, and transportation sectors. The geographic concentration of U.S. critical infrastructure is influenced by resource location, terrain, and market forces. For example, oil and gas pipelines are concentrated between resource regions like the Gulf of Mexico and the Northeast. Similarly, phosphoric acid production is focused in Florida due to its large deposits of phosphoric rock. Agriculture is also driven by geography, with specific crops requiring particular climates and soil types. Terrain, such as the scarcity of natural harbors in the western U.S., can also impact infrastructure concentration. The concentration of critical infrastructure in the western United States, like ports in Long Beach, is driven by economic factors known as \"agglomeration economies.\" These economies create a favorable environment for infrastructure development by providing access to specialized knowledge, skilled workers, production inputs, and large markets. The concentration of critical infrastructure in the western United States, like ports in Long Beach, is driven by economic factors known as \"agglomeration economies.\" Silicon Valley is a prime example, with access to research institutions, skilled graduates, product suppliers, and computer manufacturers. Agglomeration economies also impact food manufacturing and other sectors like financial services, chemicals, and telecommunications, leading to geographic concentration for scale economies. Scale economies drive cost reductions as operations grow, seen in pipeline industries and chemical plants. Analysts suggest megaports benefit from economies of scale in warehousing. This leads to larger facilities and geographic concentration of infrastructure capacity. Community preferences can influence the concentration of critical infrastructure in specific regions, impacting the development of new facilities like LNG terminals. Despite proposals for over 70 new LNG terminals in the US since 2000, many have faced challenges in gaining approval due to concerns about safety and negative impacts on local communities. Opposition from local communities has led to the withdrawal of terminal proposals in various states. Most new LNG terminals in the US face community opposition, with only a few states like Louisiana and Texas supporting their development. Federal agencies approve terminals mostly in the Gulf of Mexico due to existing natural gas infrastructure concentration. Capital efficiency drives private sector investment in critical infrastructure to maximize financial returns. In the 1990s, attention to capital efficiency increased as financial markets sought better company performance metrics. This led infrastructure companies to reduce annual capital requirements, influenced by economic deregulation in energy, telecommunications, and transportation industries. Companies cut excess infrastructure capacity to improve efficiency, with U.S. electric utilities reducing power generation capacity margins by almost 40%. The U.S. electric utility industry's generation capacity margins decreased by nearly 40% between 1992 and 2000, leading to a reduction in excess capacity among critical infrastructures. Oil refineries also saw an increase in capacity utilization from 77% in 1985 to 89% in 2005. Market forces have primarily influenced critical infrastructure development, but Congress and federal agencies have occasionally implemented policies to impact infrastructure capacity and location. The federal government has implemented policies to promote specific social objectives and has prescriptively sited critical infrastructure such as transportation facilities, military bases, and energy facilities. Examples include the construction of the Panama Canal in the early 1900s, which led to a concentration of military and commercial shipping. The federal government has prescriptively sited critical infrastructure such as transportation facilities, military bases, and energy facilities. Examples include the construction of the Panama Canal in the early 1900s. The canal carried over a third of U.S. grain exports in 2006. Dams on the Columbia River system in the Pacific Northwest account for 28% of U.S. hydroelectric generation capacity. Federal siting has dispersed critical infrastructure, like a steel plant in Utah during World War II. The U.S. Postal Service routes no more than 1.3% of all mail through any single processing and distribution center. The federal government has prescriptively sited critical infrastructure like transportation facilities, military bases, and energy facilities. For example, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 directed the Secretary of the Interior to authorize a right-of-way for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipelines System through federal lands in Alaska. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directs federal agencies to designate \"energy corridors\" on federal lands in 11 western states for the siting of new oil, gas, and hydrogen pipelines and electricity transmission facilities. The federal government uses policy mechanisms like economic incentives to direct private sector infrastructure siting, encouraging development in specific geographic areas. This approach has historical precedent, such as the construction of the transcontinental railroad and telegraph under the Pacific Railway Act of 1862. In 1862, Congress provided private companies with incentives to build a rail and telegraph line from Nebraska to the Pacific coast. Similar financial incentives are still offered today for critical infrastructure projects, like the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004. Federal environmental laws also influence the development of critical infrastructure. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA, P.L. 92-583) allows states to establish coastal management programs balancing environmental protection with development. State plans under CZMA may influence the location of infrastructure, with some states restricting port expansion and energy development. The Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA, P.L. 91-604) created a national program to reduce harmful emissions. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established a national program to regulate air pollution by requiring new facilities to install best available control technology. Facilities in counties not meeting air quality standards may have stricter emissions control requirements, potentially leading to higher costs. Some argue that this encourages infrastructure concentration in \"pollution havens\" or dispersal away from polluted regions. One study in New York found that air quality regulations influenced the location choices of manufacturing plants, leading to dispersion of facilities away from polluted areas. Federal policies, such as moratoria on oil and gas development in specific regions, have also impacted infrastructure concentration in certain areas like the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government's lack of regional-level environmental restrictions may influence infrastructure concentration in the oil and gas industry. Economic deregulation in industries like airlines and banking has led to the concentration of operations in centralized facilities to capture economies of scale. Limited federal regulation has resulted in unintended consequences such as the consolidation of the banking sector and the routing of air traffic through concentrated \"hub\" airports. Under the Federal Power Act of 1935, state regulators have historically required utilities to meet state electric generation needs by constructing in-state plants or jointly constructing plants with neighboring utilities, leading to geographically dispersed privately-owned electric power plants among the 50 states. The largest shares of U.S. generating capacity in individual states are 10% in Texas and 6% in California, while the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) had plans in the 1960s to construct 17 nuclear power reactors at seven sites, completing only six due to changes. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) had plans to construct 17 nuclear power reactors at seven sites in the 1960s, completing only six due to changes in the energy market and nuclear safety regulation. The recent restructuring of the electric utility industry is encouraging the geographic concentration of new generating plants near certain transmission corridors. This raises concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and potential national consequences. The private sector may adjust infrastructure practices based on financial interests, reducing vulnerabilities and risks. Private firms engage in risk management planning and security investments as part of business operations. Owners and operators should reassess and adjust programs to enhance protection. Some analysts argue for market forces to determine optimal infrastructure distribution, while others advocate for federal intervention to address geographic vulnerability. Congress has various policy options if federal intervention is deemed necessary. One way Congress can address geographic concentration and vulnerability is by eliminating policies that encourage it. This may conflict with other federal objectives, such as economic deregulation and environmental laws. The CZMA aims to balance environmental protection and economic development by allowing states to concentrate infrastructure where they choose. Policy questions regarding infrastructure concentration require a reconsideration of long-standing objectives in light of evolving concerns about critical infrastructure risk. Encouraging the dispersion of assets where possible is another solution to geographic vulnerability, which can be achieved through targeted federal policies like prescriptive siting, economic incentives, and regulation. Encouraging infrastructure dispersion through federal policy may help alleviate geographical vulnerabilities by shifting critical goods and services to alternative infrastructure. However, this strategy may create new vulnerabilities if the alternative infrastructure is located outside the United States. Identifying and prioritizing geographic infrastructure for dispersion may be challenging. Predicting the long-term effects of dispersion policies on market economics, especially market competition, may be uncertain and costly to the federal government. Infrastructure development being mostly in private and regional government hands can make aligning regional projects with federal objectives challenging. Incentives are crucial for local managers to align their choices with national objectives in infrastructure management. Federal agencies must offer incentives for local managers to align their choices with the welfare and equity goals of federal programs. Choices for infrastructure systems must be based on wide searches among new investments, rehabilitation efforts, or operational changes, and consistent evaluations of long-term effects on efficiency. Infrastructure owners and regional governments may oppose dispersion of critical infrastructure due to vested interests. State and local governments may have concerns about federal policies affecting infrastructure dispersion. Congress appears to be pursuing policies promoting infrastructure dispersion. Congress is pursuing policies to promote infrastructure dispersion, including new energy infrastructure like LNG terminals and oil refineries. However, achieving dispersion objectives may take years due to slow infrastructure development. Industry experts estimate it would take 5-7 years to build a new oil refinery and at least 9 years for the Alaska gas pipeline. Congress may need to ensure the survivability of critical infrastructure during and after major disasters. Protecting critical infrastructure from geographic vulnerabilities is crucial after major disasters. This aligns with the President's strategy for infrastructure protection and should be considered in federally mandated risk assessments. Enhancing infrastructure survivability through design, construction, operation standards, and retrofitting existing infrastructure is essential. Industry and government building standards for protection from natural hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods are available in vulnerable regions. The challenge in protecting critical infrastructure from geographic vulnerabilities lies in incorporating the geographic dimension into infrastructure risk management. Federal authority to change protection standards for assets may be limited if they fall under state or local jurisdiction. It is important to assess whether survivability measures for facility-specific events would be effective against regional events. Backup supply networks and redundant control centers are key components in hardening infrastructure against natural hazards. Predicting the likelihood of disruptive natural events and future terrorist attacks adds complexity to quantifying geographic vulnerabilities for critical infrastructure protection. Allocating limited resources based on geographic considerations may complicate risk-based formulas for federal support. Increasing private costs through new construction standards for infrastructure survivability could be controversial. The federal government, through FEMA and other agencies, provides emergency aid programs for communities affected by disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, or terrorist attacks. These programs offer grants, loans, food, shelter, and long-term infrastructure assistance. The evolving objectives of federal emergency assistance programs are a topic of ongoing debate in Congress. The federal government's emergency aid programs traditionally focus on immediate disaster recovery but may need to consider broader impacts on critical infrastructure. For example, natural gas shortages after hurricanes Katrina and Rita led to increased energy prices and calls for increased aid for low-income households. Congress may need to incorporate measures into existing infrastructure recovery plans to address vulnerabilities in concentrated critical infrastructure. Measures to address vulnerabilities in concentrated critical infrastructure include restoration or alternative provision of services away from the immediate area of a geographic incident. Geographic concentrations of critical infrastructure, while beneficial, are also vulnerable to catastrophic disruption. Government and industry have taken steps to protect infrastructure from disasters and attacks, but questions remain about addressing geographic vulnerabilities. Congressional intervention may be necessary to balance benefits and costs effectively. Congress may need to intervene to address geographic vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure by encouraging dispersion, ensuring survivability, and improving infrastructure recovery capabilities. This may require a combination of policy options and a long-term approach due to existing hazards. Additionally, Congress should consider how geographic infrastructure vulnerability and survivability align with overall infrastructure policies when evaluating proposals that could impact critical infrastructure development. When evaluating proposals for critical infrastructure development, Congress should consider the potential impact on geographic vulnerability. Adding capacity to existing infrastructure or developing new infrastructure in a different location may increase geographic risk. Fiscal implications and the efficient use of federal funds for infrastructure projects should also be taken into account. Coordinating infrastructure priorities could present an oversight challenge for Congress."
