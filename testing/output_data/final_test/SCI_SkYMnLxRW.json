    "content": "Weighted Transformer is a modified version of the Transformer model that achieves better BLEU scores and faster convergence compared to the baseline network. It replaces multi-head attention with multiple self-attention branches that the model learns to combine during training. This improvement results in a 0.5 BLEU point increase on the English-to-German translation task and a 0.4 point increase on the English-to-French task. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), like LSTMs, are crucial for tasks involving sequential data such as language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation. RNNs predict outputs at each time step based on input tokens and previous states, but their auto-regressive nature limits parallelization. Some variants use strided convolutions to avoid time-step based computation. The Transformer network introduces a novel architecture that uses attention mechanisms to learn dependencies between distant positions in input sequences, avoiding the need for recurrence equations. This allows for increased parallel computation and faster convergence, achieving state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation tasks. The Weighted Transformer, a variant of the Transformer network, uses self-attention branches instead of multi-head attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. This modification improves performance by 0.5 and 0.4 BLEU scores on translation tasks. The modified Transformer network improves performance on translation tasks by 0.5 and 0.4 BLEU scores for English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, respectively. The proposed architecture suggests a regularizing effect and replaces the multi-head attention layer with a branched self-attention layer. The Transformer network is enhanced by replacing the multi-head attention layer with a branched self-attention layer, where the contributions of the branches are learned during training. This novel approach has not been previously used in Transformer models and shows promise in various domains. The Transformer network is enhanced by replacing the multi-head attention layer with a branched self-attention layer, where the contributions of the branches are learned during training. Learned embeddings of dimension d model are generated from source tokens and modified by an additive positional encoding. The encoder consists of N layers with two sub-layers each: a multi-head attention mechanism and a feed-forward network. The authors experiment with different embeddings but found no benefit. The Transformer network replaces multi-head attention with branched self-attention, improving numerical stability by scaling the dot-product attention. Multiple representations of (Q, K, V) are computed, concatenated, and projected with a feed-forward layer. The computational load is reduced proportionally, and the number of heads in multi-head attention is denoted by h. The Transformer network utilizes a two-layered feed-forward network with ReLU activation in each layer. The inner layer dimension is set to 2048. Layer normalization and residual connections are used for regularization and ease of training. The decoder includes multi-head attention sub-layers in addition to the feed-forward network. The scaled dot-product attention is masked in the decoder to prevent future positions from being considered. The Transformer network utilizes a two-layered feed-forward network with ReLU activation in each layer. The inner layer dimension is set to 2048. Layer normalization and residual connections are used for regularization and ease of training. In the scaled dot-product attention sub-layers, future positions are masked to prevent illegal leftward information flow. BID33 state three reasons for preferring self-attention over recurrent or convolutional models: (a) lower computational complexity, (b) improved parallel computing utilization, and (c) shorter path length between long-range dependencies. The Weighted Transformer proposes a branched attention layer that modifies the entire attention layer in the Transformer network. It is more efficient to train and makes better use of representational power compared to recurrent models. The attention layer is mathematically described with parameters \u03ba i , \u03b1 i , and W Oi. The Weighted Transformer introduces a branched attention layer with parameters \u03ba i , \u03b1 i , and W Oi. The FFN functions have reduced dimensionality to avoid adding extra parameters. The modified architecture contrasts with the base Transformer model by amplifying or diminishing the contribution of each head before aggregation. The Weighted Transformer introduces a branched attention layer with \u03ba as concatenation weight and \u03b1 as addition weight. The modification maintains the simplex constraint during training and does not add depth to the attention head transformation. It replaces multi-head attention with multibranch attention, where branches are combined by a multi-branch network. Separating \u03b1 and \u03ba improves training outcomes and model interpretability. The Weighted Transformer introduces a branched attention layer with \u03ba as concatenation weight and \u03b1 as addition weight. This mechanism adds O(M) trainable weights, a minor increase compared to the total number of weights. The proposed attention mechanism is used in both encoder and decoder layers, masked in the decoder layers, and retains positional encoding, layer normalization, and residual connections. Instead of using (\u03b1, \u03ba) learned weights, a mixture-of-experts normalization via a softmax layer can also be used. The proposed mechanism in the Weighted Transformer allows for assigning importance to different heads, prioritizing gradients, reducing co-adaptation, and improving generalization. It introduces trainable weights \u03ba and \u03b1, along with layer normalization, residual connections, label smoothing, attention dropout, and residual dropout. The Weighted Transformer introduces trainable weights \u03ba and \u03b1, along with attention dropout and a learning rate warm-up strategy for faster convergence. Freezing the weights (\u03ba, \u03b1) in the last 10K iterations aids convergence, leading to a 15-40% faster convergence compared to the original Transformer network. The Weighted Transformer introduces trainable weights \u03ba and \u03b1, attention dropout, and a learning rate warm-up strategy for faster convergence. It converges 15-40% faster compared to the original Transformer network. The model was trained for 60K and 250K iterations for smaller and larger variants, respectively. Padding was reduced by batching sentences of similar lengths and using byte-pair encoding with a common vocabulary. Word embeddings were tied to entries in the final softmax layer. The Weighted Transformer, trained on NVIDIA K80 GPUs, outperforms state-of-the-art models on WMT 2014 translation tasks. Results are summarized in Table 1, with the small and large models corresponding to different configurations. The Weighted Transformer achieves faster convergence with trainable weights \u03ba and \u03b1, attention dropout, and a learning rate warm-up strategy. The Weighted Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models on WMT 2014 translation tasks, achieving a 1.1 BLEU score improvement for English-to-German with the smaller network and 0.5 BLEU improvement for the larger network. For English-to-French, there is a 0.8 BLEU improvement for the smaller model and 0.4 improvement for the larger model. The Weighted Transformer shows efficient model capacity utilization, needing only 30% of the parameters compared to the baseline transformer while matching performance. The regularizing effect of the Weighted Transformer is also noted. The Weighted Transformer demonstrates improved results and a regularizing effect compared to the baseline Transformer. Experimental results suggest that the proposed architecture may have better regularizing properties. Reported BLEU scores are evaluated on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. The Weighted Transformer outperforms the baseline Transformer in the newstest2013 English-to-German task, showing the importance of learning both (\u03b1, \u03ba) and retaining simplex constraints. Results demonstrate the benefit of branched attention, with the Weighted Transformer achieving up to 1.3 BLEU points higher than the baseline in some cases. Increasing the number of layers does not significantly impact performance. Increasing the number of layers in the Weighted Transformer does not always improve performance, with a modest improvement seen when going from 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 layers, but a degradation in performance when increasing to 8 layers. Increasing the number of heads from 8 to 16 improved the BLEU score, but experiments with 16 and 32 heads degraded performance. The network prioritizes certain branches over others, with changing relative weights suggesting a non-exploitative behavior. The Weighted Transformer network does not purely exploit certain branches, as it prioritizes some over others without ignoring any. Results show that having learned parameters \u03b1 and \u03ba, along with a simplex constraint, was necessary for improved performance. The convergence of weights for the second encoder layer in the English-to-German task demonstrates this behavior. The Weighted Transformer architecture does not favor certain branches over others, as shown by the performance comparison with random and uniform weights. The learned (\u03b1, \u03ba) weights are crucial for its performance, and the modification is similar to Shake-Shake regularization. Unlike random sampling, the weights are learned instead of being sampled randomly, requiring no changes during test time. This strategy aims to determine if the network benefits from learned weights or if random or uniform weights are sufficient during testing. The Weighted Transformer architecture relies on learned weights (\u03b1, \u03ba) for performance, as opposed to random or uniform weights. Experimental results show that random or uniform weights are not effective during testing. Additionally, using gates instead of concatenation-addition strategy was explored to improve performance. The Weighted Transformer architecture uses learned weights (\u03b1, \u03ba) for performance instead of random or uniform weights. Gates were experimented with to replace the concatenation-addition strategy, but this approach performed worse due to low branch numbers. The proposed architecture achieves better performance and trains faster than the original Transformer network. The Weighted Transformer architecture improves performance by using learned weights for multiple self-attention branches. It outperforms the baseline Transformer on WMT 2014 tasks, showing a 0.5 and 0.4 point increase in BLEU scores. Additionally, it trains 15-40% faster and provides regularization benefits across different hyper-parameter settings for small and large models."
