Congress acknowledges the President's constitutional authority as commander in chief but emphasizes the need for bipartisan support in sustaining operations in Iraq with over 137,000 American military personnel currently serving. Many American service personnel have bravely served in Iraq since March 2003, with some losing their lives and many more being wounded. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps, along with other military branches, are facing strain from multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, impacting future recruitment and readiness of the nation's volunteer force. The Congress emphasized the need for Iraqi security forces to take the lead in securing a free and sovereign Iraq in 2006. UN Security Council Resolution 1723 recognized Iraq as a threat to international peace and security. Sectarian violence in Iraq is fueled by political distrust and cultural differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims, requiring political settlements for reconciliation. The failure of Iraqis to achieve reconciliation and reach settlements for a unified government contributes to increasing violence in Iraq. General Abizaid testified that increasing American troops would not significantly improve success in Iraq as the focus should be on Iraqi Security Forces. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki emphasized the political nature of the crisis in Iraq and called for politicians to halt the cycle of violence. There is a growing opposition among the Iraqi public to the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq, with concerns raised by leaders in the Administration and Congress about the deteriorating situation in the country. In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended a new strategy for Iraq, including diplomatic and political efforts, and a change in the mission of U.S. forces. In January 2007, the President announced a new strategy with diplomatic, economic, and military elements. The new strategy for Iraq includes diplomatic, economic, and military elements. The military component involves deploying 21,500 additional U.S. troops to Iraq. There will be a dual chain of command with Iraqi and U.S. military commanders in Baghdad, which may lead to disagreements on troop movements. The proposed troop augmentation in Iraq far exceeds expectations, leading to opposition from many members of Congress. Despite promises from the Government of Iraq to take on more security responsibilities, little progress has been made. The President has emphasized the need for Iraqi leaders to act on their commitments. The Senate disagrees with the plan to increase forces by 21,500 in Iraq and urges the President to consider all options for achieving strategic goals. It is recommended that the US continues operations in Anbar province to combat insurgency and deny terrorists a safe haven. The Senate believes that a failed state in Iraq would threaten regional and world peace. Congress should not take any action that endangers US military forces in the field. The primary objective of the US strategy in Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political progress. The US strategy in Iraq aims to encourage political compromises among Iraqi leaders for reconciliation and unity, leading to improved security. Military efforts focus on maintaining territorial integrity, denying terrorists safe havens, counterterrorism operations, promoting regional stability, supporting Baghdad's security, and training Iraqi forces for self-defense. Military operations should prioritize combating sectarian violence. The US government should transfer necessary equipment to the Iraqi military expeditiously and engage selected nations in the Middle East for a regional peace process. Regular updates on Iraqi progress should be provided to Congress by the Commander of US Central Command. The US government's military, diplomatic, and economic strategy in Iraq should be contingent on the Iraqi government meeting specific benchmarks outlined in a written agreement with the Prime Minister. These benchmarks include deploying additional Iraqi security forces in Baghdad, ensuring fair distribution of resources regardless of sect or ethnicity, and passing legislation to benefit all Iraqi groups from oil resources. The resources of Iraq should benefit all Iraqi citizens equitably, with commanders having the authority to make decisions without political intervention. The United States Policy in Iraq Act requires regular reports on certain aspects of policy and military operations in Iraq. The United States Policy in Iraq Act requires regular unclassified reports on policy and military operations in Iraq, with a classified annex if necessary."
