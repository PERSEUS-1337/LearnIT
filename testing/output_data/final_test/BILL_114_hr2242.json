The term \"foreign person\" refers to an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or national. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF SANCTIONS FOR RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND JOURNALISTS. The President can impose sanctions on a foreign person if they are responsible for severe restrictions on freedom of expression or have supported such activities. These sanctions may include inadmissibility to the United States. The sanctions under this subsection include ineligibility for a US visa or admission, and revocation of a visa if already issued. The President considers information from congressional committees and other sources when imposing sanctions. The President has the authority to waive sanctions for national security interests or to comply with international agreements. Sanctions may be terminated by the President for a foreign person. The President can waive sanctions for national security reasons or to comply with international agreements. Sanctions on a foreign person can be terminated if credible information shows they did not engage in sanctioned activity, were appropriately prosecuted, or have shown a significant change in behavior and committed to not repeat the activity. The President has the authority to issue regulations, licenses, and orders to enforce this section. The President has the authority to issue reports to Congress regarding sanctions and enforcement measures. The President is required to submit an annual report to Congress listing foreign persons sanctioned, the number of sanctions terminated, dates of imposition or termination, reasons for sanctions, and efforts to encourage other countries to impose similar sanctions. The President must submit an initial report within 180 days of the Act's enactment, and subsequent reports by December 10 of each calendar year to Congress, detailing foreign sanctions imposed and terminated, reasons for sanctions, and efforts to encourage other countries to impose similar sanctions. December 10 is recognized as \"Human Rights Day\" in the US and internationally since 1950. Reports required by this section must be submitted annually by that date. The reports must be unclassified but can include a classified annex if needed. The unclassified portion will be made public, including in the Federal Register. Names of sanctioned individuals may be published if the President decides to do so. The President may publish the names of sanctioned individuals without following certain confidentiality requirements regarding visa issuance or refusal. Limiting visas to executives of state-owned news and media organizations operating in the United States. The policy statement emphasizes the importance of press freedoms and free flow of information globally. It calls for a strong response to restrictions faced by foreign journalists, including censorship of news websites. Additionally, there are proposed limitations on I-Visas and restrictions on visas for executives of state-owned media organizations. Section 214 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include restrictions on visas for executives of state-owned media organizations. If any US journalist or news organization personnel faced expulsion, visa denial, intimidation, violence, or other restrictions in the foreign state during the previous fiscal year, the visa for the executive will be refused. The President may order the immediate revocation, delay, or refusal of visas for executives of state-owned media organizations of foreign states in proportion to the expulsions, visa delays, or intimidation experienced by US journalists in those countries. The term \"executive of a state-owned media organization of a foreign state\" refers to a representative in a managerial or executive role of a media organization majority owned, operated, or controlled by a foreign government in the United States. SEC. 6. Inclusion of additional information on restrictions faced by journalists worldwide in annual country reports on human rights practices. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a detailed description of restrictions faced by journalists and their domestic personnel in annual country reports on human rights practices.

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a detailed description of restrictions faced by journalists and their domestic personnel in annual country reports on human rights practices, including limitations on reporting freedom by various entities. SEC. 7. Restrictions on freedom of expression and internet censorship treated as a trade restriction. Congress finds that restrictions on US journalists, media personnel, and internet censorship harm US corporations' competitiveness and limit access to critical information for investors and consumers. Congress declares that the US Government should address these issues in international negotiations with countries like China, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia rated \"Not Free\" by Freedom House. The \"Freedom of the Press\" survey highlights the need for a free operation of websites, an end to visa restrictions for journalists, and the elimination of harassment and surveillance of foreign journalists. The US Government should aim to include provisions for the free flow of information in trade agreements to remove limitations on market access for news agency services and cross-border data flows involving journalists. The US Government should include provisions in trade agreements to ensure fair treatment of foreign journalists and their publications, as well as the free operation of websites in countries where they are blocked or censored. Congress recognizes restrictions on journalists and media websites as significant foreign trade barriers. The US Government should address trade barriers related to blocked or censored websites by including provisions in trade agreements and pursuing disputes at the World Trade Organization to end such blockages. This includes requiring WTO members to publish lists of banned websites and providing website owners with an opportunity to appeal."
