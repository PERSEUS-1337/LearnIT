    "content": "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was reauthorized multiple times between 2017 and 2018, managed by FEMA. Its main goals are to provide access to primary flood insurance and transfer financial risk. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) aims to provide primary flood insurance, transfer financial risk to the federal government, and reduce the nation's flood risk through floodplain management standards. It also includes social goals to provide coverage in flood-prone areas and reduce government costs after floods. As of October 2017, the NFIP had 5 million policies with $1.27 trillion in coverage across 22,000 communities. The NFIP aims to achieve multiple objectives, including ensuring reasonable insurance premiums, having risk-based premiums, securing community participation, and covering claims and expenses. Congress has authorized FEMA to borrow up to $30.425 billion from the Treasury to operate the NFIP. As of the beginning of the 2017 hurricane season, the NFIP owed $24.6 billion to the Treasury and borrowed an additional $5.825 billion to cover claims from recent hurricanes. The NFIP reached its borrowing limit of $30.425 billion to cover claims from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Congress cancelled $16 billion of NFIP debt, allowing the program to pay claims. FEMA borrowed an additional $6.1 billion to fund 2017 losses, bringing the total debt to $20.525 billion. The NFIP currently has $9.9 billion of remaining borrowing authority with no comprehensive expiration provision in its statute. The NFIP faces expiration of key components unless reauthorized by Congress after February 8, 2018. This includes the authority to provide new flood insurance contracts and borrowing funds from the Treasury. The House Financial Services Committee has worked on reform bills to address these issues. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act (H.R. 2874) passed the House on November 14, 2017. Three Senate bills have been introduced to reauthorize the NFIP, but none have been considered yet. H.R. 2874 would reauthorize the NFIP until September 30, 2022. The report focuses on selected provisions that would introduce significant changes to the NFIP or where the effect of the provision may not be clear. As of October 2017, the written premium on approximately 5 million policies in force was $3.6 billion, including various fees and surcharges mandated by law on flood insurance policies. The Federal Policy Fee helps pay for administrative expenses, floodplain mapping, and insurance operations, with amounts set by FEMA. FEMA established a Reserve Fund to cover future claim and debt expenses, with a required reserve ratio of 1% of total loss exposure. The reserve fund assessment, initially at 5% on SFIPs and 0% on PRPs in October 2013, increased to 15% of premiums for all NFIP policies in April 2016. Additionally, a surcharge is assessed on all NFIP policies following the passage of HFIAA. The surcharge imposed by HFIAA varies based on property type, with $25 for primary residences and $250 for other properties. Revenues go to the Reserve Fund. NFIP flood insurance rates are determined by risk and actuarial principles, but Congress has exceptions for certain properties to make insurance affordable. Categories paying less than full rates include pre-FIRM, newly mapped, and grandfathered properties. Pre-FIRM structures, built before December 31, 1974, or before FEMA published the first FIRM for their community, receive lower premiums to cover predicted claims. This subsidy allows preexisting floodplain properties to contribute to their recovery from a flood disaster. Approximately 16.1% of all NFIP policies received a pre-FIRM subsidy as of March 2017. The total number of pre-FIRM policies has remained stable, but the percentage of these policies compared to the total policy base has decreased over time. The pricing subsidy for pre-FIRM policies is being phased out of the NFIP at a rate between 5% and 18% for primary residences and 25% for other categories. Congress introduced a new subsidy in HFIAA for owners of properties newly mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area. This applies to properties previously in zones of moderate or minimal flood hazards newly mapped into a SFHA on or after April 1, 2015. The rate for eligible newly mapped properties may vary. The rate for eligible newly mapped properties is equal to the PRP rate, with a higher Federal Policy Fee for the first 12 months after map revision. After the first year, the rate transitions to a full-risk rate with annual increases. About 3.9% of NFIP policies receive a newly mapped subsidy. FEMA allows properties built in compliance with the FIRM to maintain their old flood insurance rate class when remapped, known as \"grandfathering.\" Grandfathering in the NFIP is not considered a subsidy by FEMA as the discount is offset by other policyholders. Congress eliminated grandfathering after new maps in BW-12 but reinstated it in HFIAA. The exact number of properties with grandfathered rates is unknown, but unofficial estimates suggest 10%-20% are grandfathered. The proposed legislation would phase out the pre-FIRM subsidy for primary residences at a rate of 6.5%-15%, with a gradual increase over three years. Other categories of properties would continue to have a 25% phaseout rate. This change would allow FEMA to raise premiums more rapidly for primary residences. Section 105 of the proposed legislation would require FEMA to calculate premium rates based on differences in flood risk from coastal and inland flood hazards. The FEMA Administrator must publish an explanation of the methodology for determining premium rates six months before they take effect. Section 109 mandates that no new flood insurance coverage can be provided after September 30, 2022, without approval from the appropriate body. The legislation may require sellers or lessors of real estate to disclose flood history, insurance claims, and federal obligations, potentially impacting property sales and values. FEMA would need to study insurance industry best practices for implementing changes. The legislation would require the gradual use of replacement cost value in setting NFIP premium rates, with full implementation by December 31, 2020. Properties with higher replacement costs may pay more for coverage, while those below average may pay less. A cap of $10,000 per year would be set for 1-4 unit residential properties with elevation data meeting standards. This cap could affect 800 properties, or 0.02% of properties. The legislation proposes changes to NFIP premium rates, including the use of replacement cost value and a cap of $10,000 per year for certain residential properties. Section 301 would require premium rates to be calculated based on risk data from FIRMs and other sources. Section 502 would increase the HFIAA surcharge for primary and nonprimary residences. The HFIAA surcharge for nonprimary residences eligible for a Preferred Risk Policy would decrease from $250 to $125. FEMA does not factor this surcharge into premium rate increases, so it would not affect the cap set in Section 102. Section 503 mandates the Administrator to allocate at least 7.5% of the required reserve ratio to the reserve fund starting in fiscal year 2018. Failure to do so would result in incremental increases in the reserve fund assessment until the statutory reserve ratio is met, potentially leading to higher premiums for all NFIP policyholders. The provision in Congress may increase premiums for all NFIP policyholders, raising concerns about the affordability of flood insurance. Studies were conducted to assess the affordability of premiums, with recommendations for programmatic and regulatory changes to address the issue. The framework for a voluntary flood insurance affordability program for owner-occupants of 1-4 unit residences in NFIP communities is still under review by FEMA. Eligibility would be determined by the state, with income limitations for participation. The proposed state affordability program for flood insurance would set income limits for eligibility, funded by a state surcharge on policies. This program aims to assist households with income below a certain threshold, creating a cross-subsidy within the NFIP. The NFIP aims to increase flood insurance purchases by introducing a new cross-subsidy for states with affordability programs. The mandatory purchase requirement was established to incentivize communities and individuals to join the NFIP and purchase flood insurance. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance in communities participating in the NFIP. Property owners in mapped SFHAs must buy flood insurance to get federally backed mortgages. Federal agencies and lending institutions are mandated to enforce this requirement. Compliance rates are low, with a 2006 FEMA study suggesting rates as low as 43% in some areas. Compliance with the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement varies across the country, ranging from 43% to 88%. A study in New York City showed an increase in compliance from 61% in 2012 to 73% in 2016. NFIP policies are concentrated in a few states, with Florida having the highest percentage. Participation rates are higher in coastal areas and are highest in high-risk zones due to the mandatory purchase requirement. The NFIP could benefit financially from a more geographically targeted approach. The NFIP could be financially improved by increasing coverage in areas perceived to be at lower risk of flooding. The 2017 hurricanes revealed low penetration rates of flood insurance, with counties in Texas and Florida showing low average penetration rates. Counties on the coast had higher penetration rates, highlighting the need for a more geographically diverse policy base. Hurricane Irma had low NFIP penetration rates in counties, with St. Johns, Flagler, Nassau, and Palm Beach having the highest rates. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had extremely low penetration rates. Section 508 proposes increasing penalties for lenders not enforcing mandatory flood insurance requirements. The NFIP was created due to the unavailability of private flood insurance in the US. Private companies struggled to offer affordable flood coverage due to the unpredictable nature of flooding. Private insurers currently have a limited role in primary residential flood insurance, mainly assisting in the operational aspect of the NFIP. FEMA oversees the NFIP and bears the financial risk of paying claims. The NFIP is overseen by FEMA, which bears the financial risk of paying claims. Private companies handle day-to-day operations, marketing, and claims management. Two arrangements with private industry are the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and the Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program, with 86% of policies sold by 68 participating companies. The WYO Program, with 86% of NFIP policies sold by 68 companies, compensates companies through various methods. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of WYO compensation and FEMA's lack of data to determine WYO companies' profits. Additionally, there is a small private flood insurance market that offers commercial coverage, coverage above NFIP limits, or coverage in the lender-placed market. Private insurer interest in providing flood coverage has increased in recent years, with advances in analytics and data quantifying flood risk. Private insurers are looking to offer primary flood insurance in competition with the NFIP, focusing on high-value properties with higher premiums to justify the extra expense of flood underwriting. The noncompete clause limits WYO carriers from offering standalone private flood products, but there is growing interest from private insurance companies and industry organizations in entering the market. Private insurers are interested in offering primary flood insurance to compete with the NFIP. Reformed NFIP rates could attract more private insurers, as FEMA's subsidized rates hinder private sector involvement. Private insurers' full-risk rates include a return on capital, unlike NFIP rates, leading to potential underpricing of NFIP policies from the private insurers' perspective. Rules on accepting private insurance for the mandatory purchase requirement are also a factor. The rules allowing federal agencies to accept private flood insurance for the mandatory purchase requirement have impacted the market potential for private insurers. Implementation challenges have arisen, with federal agencies issuing two Notices of Proposed Rulemaking. The main issue is determining if private policies meet the \"at least as broad as\" standard compared to NFIP coverage. The uncertainty surrounding private policies meeting the standard for flood insurance has hindered private sector involvement. Continuous coverage is necessary for property owners to keep subsidies in their NFIP premium rates. Lack of access to NFIP data on flood losses is seen as a barrier for private insurers. Increasing access to past NFIP claims data could help private insurance companies better estimate future losses and price premiums. FEMA's concern is addressing privacy issues to provide this data. FEMA faces privacy concerns in providing property level information to insurers due to the Privacy Act of 1974. Congress revised FEMA's authority to secure reinsurance for the NFIP from private markets. FEMA purchased $1.042 billion of insurance in January 2017, with reinsurers covering 26% of losses between $4 billion and $8 billion. FEMA has paid over $7.3 billion in claims for Hurricane Harvey, triggering the 2017 reinsurance. In mid-November 2017, FEMA began the procurement process for the January 2018 reinsurance renewal. Section 201 would revise the definition of private flood insurance, focusing on compliance with state regulations and including surplus lines insurance. Federal regulators would oversee the financial strength of private insurance companies. The bill would allow private insurance companies to offer flood insurance, with requirements on financial strength. Property owners could switch between private insurance and the NFIP without penalty. Private insurers could offer different coverage options, potentially leaving policyholders exposed after a flood. Section 202 of the bill would remove the mandatory purchase requirement for commercial properties from January 1, 2019, potentially reducing the number of commercial properties covered by the NFIP. It is uncertain how many commercial properties will choose to forgo insurance coverage entirely. Section 203 would eliminate the noncompete requirement in the WYO arrangement with FEMA, allowing WYO companies to sell both NFIP and private flood insurance policies. Section 204 of the bill would require WYO companies to offer their own insurance policies in addition to NFIP policies, with criteria for policy establishment unknown. FEMA would be required to make flood risk data publicly available and develop an open-source data system for immediate public access. Within 12 months, FEMA must establish a searchable database for information on participating communities. The NFIP database provides community information at zip code or census block level, aiming to inform private insurers and flood mitigation efforts. However, it may lead to adverse selection by private insurers, potentially increasing the NFIP deficit. Section 507 limits allowances paid to WYO companies. Section 507 of the NFIP limits allowances paid to WYO companies to 27.9% of the chargeable premium. Section 512 requires transferring a portion of NFIP risk to private reinsurance or capital markets to cover FEMA-determined probable maximum loss targets. Controversy surrounds NFIP coverage for properties with multiple flood losses, raising concerns about program costs and insurability. Multiple definitions of repetitive loss are used within the NFIP. The NFIP uses different definitions for various types of properties, including severe repetitive loss properties. These properties have incurred multiple claim payments exceeding certain thresholds. Repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss properties account for a significant portion of total claims in the NFIP. As of January 31, 2017, there were 90,000 insured repetitive loss properties and 11,000 insured severe repetitive loss properties. The NFIP has currently insured severe repetitive loss properties, accounting for about 2% of overall policies. These properties have generated $9 billion in claims, representing 16% of total claims. A study from 1978 to 2012 showed higher claims for repetitive loss structures compared to nonrepetitive ones. Section 402 mandates NFIP communities to identify repeatedly flooded properties, assess risks, and develop mitigation plans or face FEMA sanctions. The NFIP requires communities to identify properties with repetitive flood losses, including those with 50 or more repetitive loss structures or five or more severe repetitive loss structures. FEMA must provide data on these properties to assist in mitigation planning. Failure to comply may result in sanctions from FEMA. FEMA must issue notice of noncompliance before sanctioning a community for not meeting requirements related to flood mitigation. Sanctions will be developed in future regulations, and financial assistance for mitigation may be influenced by a community's compliance with these requirements. Covered communities may integrate these plans into existing flood or hazard mitigation plans. Section 504 introduces a new category of \"multiple-loss property\" which includes repetitive loss, severe repetitive loss, and extreme repetitive loss properties. A repetitive loss property is defined as a structure with two or more separate flood damage claims, while an extreme repetitive loss property has claims exceeding 150% of the maximum coverage. The section also defines \"qualified loss payment\" as a claims payment. The section defines \"qualified loss payment\" as a claims payment made in connection with a flood event after enactment, excluding claims before compliance with floodplain requirements. Properties with multiple claims not paying full risk-based rates face annual rate increases until full rate is reached. Severe and extreme repetitive loss properties have a minimum annual deductible of $5000. Flood insurance is not available for extreme repetitive-loss properties with a claim. The section aims to restrict flood insurance coverage for properties with multiple claims exceeding three times the replacement value of the structure. This provision would mark the first time the NFIP would deny coverage for a property in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The NFIP's role in providing flood insurance is often overshadowed by its other key responsibilities. The NFIP's key responsibilities go beyond just providing flood insurance. It also engages in noninsurance activities such as disseminating flood-risk information, requiring communities to adopt building standards, reducing the need for post-flood aid, contributing to community resilience, and protecting lending institutions. These tasks are not directly reflected in the NFIP's financial results but save the nation an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses avoided. The NFIP encourages communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to mitigate flood risks. FEMA's mitigation programs, including FMA programs, have shown that for every dollar invested in flood mitigation, society saves $5 in reduced future flood losses. Structures built to FEMA standards experience 73% less damage than those not built to these standards. Flood insurance helps with financial recovery after a flood but does not prevent flooding. The NFIP manages programs to reduce flood risk, funded by policyholders' premiums. Policyholders are required to purchase Increased Cost of Compliance coverage (ICC) to comply with building codes. ICC coverage has a premium structure ranging from $4 to $70 and provides up to $30,000 in payments for eligible expenses, capped at $75 by Congress. ICC coverage provides up to $30,000 for eligible expenses such as elevating, demolishing, relocating, or flood-proofing nonresidential buildings. The payment on the building claim plus the ICC claim cannot exceed $250,000 for residential structures or $500,000 for nonresidential structures. Elevation is the most common form of mitigation, with an average cost estimated at $33,239 to $91,732. The average cost of elevating an existing property is estimated at $33,239 to $91,732. Suggestions have been made to raise the amount of ICC coverage. Section 113 requires the Administrator to offer policyholders a reduction in the risk premium rate for approved flood risk mitigation actions, including innovative techniques for dense urban areas and elevating mechanical systems. Section 403 would authorize the purchase of additional ICC coverage up to $60,000 for a surcharge set by FEMA. The proposed section would expand ICC coverage up to $60,000 for properties at high risk of flood damages, allowing policyholders to mitigate their property before a flood. It also prioritizes grants for mitigation activities to reduce flood damage, with increased funding of $225 million annually for the FMA program. Funding for the FMA program can come from penalties for violations of mandatory purchase requirements and grant funds recouped by FEMA. FEMA develops flood maps called FIRMs with communities to show flood risk zones, set insurance rates, and enforce floodplain management standards. The age and quality of flood maps vary across the country, with no consistent timetable for updates. FEMA is required by law to assess the need for map revisions every five years. FEMA is required by law to assess the need to update floodplain areas and flood-risk zones every five years. The process of updating flood maps can be delayed due to various factors such as new building developments, changes to flood protection systems, and environmental changes. The Technical Mapping Advisory Council (TMAC) was reestablished by Congress in BW-12 to assist in this process. The Technical Mapping Advisory Council (TMAC) was reauthorized by Congress to review and make recommendations to FEMA on the national flood mapping program. A new appeal process would be created if FEMA denies a request to update a flood map based on new information. Additionally, TMAC would develop a procedure for mapping flood hazards in communities and states that choose to develop alternative maps to FEMA's FIRMs. The proposed legislation would allow states and local governments to create their own flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) independently of FEMA, following TMAC procedures and subject to FEMA's final approval within six months. Notification and appeal rights for individuals in communities affected by the proposed flood elevation determinations would be included in the recommended standards and requirements."
