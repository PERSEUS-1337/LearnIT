Current deep generative models have limitations in generating diverse outputs and being interpretable. The proposed pipeline combines a CNN for mapping inputs to smoothed images and a pixel-wise nearest neighbor method for generating multiple high-quality outputs in a controllable manner. The proposed approach combines a CNN for mapping inputs to smoothed images and a pixel-wise nearest neighbor method for generating diverse high-quality outputs in a controllable manner. It demonstrates the generation of high-resolution photo-realistic images from incomplete input such as low-resolution images, sketches, surface normal maps, or label masks, with practical applications in upsampling/colorizing legacy footage, texture synthesis, and semantic image understanding. The text discusses the limitations of current image synthesis methods, particularly conditional GANs, in generating diverse output images. It highlights the importance of human imagination in envisioning multiple plausible outputs given incomplete input. The proposed approach combines CNN and nearest neighbor method to generate high-quality, diverse images from incomplete inputs like low-resolution images or sketches. The text discusses limitations of current image synthesis methods, emphasizing the need for user control and multiple outputs. It proposes using non-parametric models like nearest neighbors to address these issues and generate diverse, high-quality images from incomplete inputs. The approach generates photorealistic output for incomplete signals like low-resolution images, surface normal maps, and edges for various objects. It can produce multiple outputs for a single input, addressing the mode-collapse problem seen in previous approaches. The method involves matching incomplete input queries to a training dataset to generate high-quality outputs. In practice, there are limitations in applying NN for conditional image synthesis, such as a lack of training data, an obvious distance metric, and computational challenges in scaling search to large training sets. To address these limitations, a compositional approach is taken by matching local pixels instead of global images, allowing for the synthesis of images by combining different parts from multiple training images. This approach significantly increases the representational power and flexibility in image synthesis. To synthesize an image using N training images, a compositional approach is taken by matching local pixels instead of global images. This allows for combining different parts from multiple training images, increasing representational power and flexibility in image synthesis. Deep features are used to capture context and allow for compositionality in matching pixels. The pipeline involves training an initial regressor (CNN) to map the incomplete input into a single output image, which may look like a \"smoothed\" average. Our approach involves a two-stage pipeline for image synthesis. The first stage uses a CNN to regress an incomplete input into a smoothed average image. In the second stage, matching pixels in training images are found using multiscale descriptors. By varying the size of the matched pixel set, multiple outputs can be generated. Nearest-neighbor queries are then performed on these regressed outputs using deep descriptors for pixel matching. Our approach involves using a multiscale deep descriptor to match pixels in training images for image synthesis. This allows for efficient matching to a large number of training examples in a controllable manner, generating dense pixel-level correspondences. The approach is inspired by various models like CNNs for discriminative pixel-level tasks. Adversarially-trained generative networks (GANs) have been influential in computer vision for image generation tasks. They can condition on various inputs like low-resolution images, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. Mode collapse is a reported issue, limiting the diversity of outputs and control over synthesis. Our work focuses on providing interpretability and user-control in generative deep networks. By using nearest neighbors to copy-paste information, we can explain how each pixel-level output is generated, making the synthesis process interpretable. This approach allows users to intuitively edit and control the synthesis process, providing fine-grained control over editing image features like color and outline. The text discusses the editing of image features using nearest neighbors for interpretability in generative deep networks. It shows how the frequency spectrum improves in the reconstruction process and compares global vs. compositional reconstruction methods. The compositional reconstruction involves copying pixels from neighboring training examples based on correspondences. In computer vision, correspondence is a core challenge. Various methods like SIFT flow and CNNs have been used for tasks like image super-resolution and 3D reconstructions. Utilizing features from pre-trained convnets, particularly hypercolumn features for semantic segmentation, has shown to improve pixel-level correspondences and extract high-frequency information. Our work utilizes high-frequency information from training examples to synthesize new images. We follow data-driven approaches using nearest neighbors for tasks like image completion. Our compositional approach is inspired by reconstructing query images via compositions of training examples. The problem of conditional image synthesis is defined as generating an image given an input x. Conditional image synthesis involves generating high-quality output images based on a given input, such as an edge map or low-resolution image. The approach focuses on image super-resolution, using a fully-convolutional neural network as a regressor. Training pairs of input/outputs are used for this task, with the goal of synthesizing new images based on high-frequency information from training examples. Conditional image synthesis involves generating high-quality output images based on a given input. The regressor used for this purpose tends to oversmooth outputs, leading to desaturated results in tasks like image colorization. In the context of super-resolution, multiple textures and subtle shape cues may be lost in the synthesis process. The regressor used in conditional image synthesis tends to oversmooth outputs, resulting in desaturated results. To capture high-frequency textures, multiple outputs are required. A K-nearest-neighbor algorithm can be used to predict these high-frequencies. To capture high-frequency textures in conditional image synthesis, a K-nearest-neighbor algorithm can be used to predict missing high-frequencies. Compositional matching allows for generating multiple outputs by matching individual pixels rather than global images. Our approach generates multiple outputs of shoes from edges by copying and pasting patches from the training set. The final composed output in image reconstruction is written as DISPLAYFORM2, with a focus on the choice of distance function for non-parametric matching. Contemporary approaches use deep embeddings to compare global images, while pixel distance functions require dense pixel-level correspondences for accurate matching. By considering both local and global information, compositional matching can generate multiple outputs by matching individual pixels. Hypercolumn descriptors aggregate spatial context information from different layers of a deep network into a multi-scale pixel representation. A pixel descriptor is constructed using features from various layers of a PixelNet model trained for semantic segmentation. Pixel similarity is measured using cosine distances between descriptors. Compositional matches are visualized, and the output of the approach for different input modalities is shown. The efficiency of pixel-wise nearest neighbor search is discussed, avoiding exhaustive search for every pixel in the dataset. To speed up search in deep generative models, non-linear approximations are made by finding global K-NN using conv-5 features and searching for pixel-wise matches in a T \u00d7 T pixel window around pixel i. Multiple outputs are generated for bags, faces, cats, and dogs, capturing subtle details like eyes, stripes, and whiskers. The study focuses on generating multiple outputs for different generations using various parameters. The search parameters include fully compositional and global exemplar match outputs. The approach uses a CPU for nearest neighbor search, with potential for real-time performance with GPU-based libraries. Multiple outputs are shown by varying parameters, showcasing different modalities like low-resolution images. The study presents findings for multiple modalities such as low-resolution images, surface normal maps, and edges/boundaries for human faces, cats, dogs, handbags, and shoes. A comparison is made with the recent work of BID23 using generative adversarial networks for pixel-to-pixel translation. Experiments are conducted on human faces, cats, dogs, shoes, and handbags using various modalities. The study compares the PixelNN approach with Pix-to-Pix BID23 for extracting surface normal and edge maps of human faces, cats, and dogs. For shoes and handbags, the approach follows BID23 using training images from BID47 and Amazon. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the generated outputs. The study evaluates the performance of the approach by comparing synthesized outputs with real images for estimation and edge detection. Six statistics are computed to measure angular error between normals from synthesized and real images. Edge detection performance is evaluated using average precision. The approach's performance is quantitatively shown in Table 1 compared to BID23. Multiple outputs are generated by the approach. Our approach generates multiple outputs without a direct ranking method. Performance comparison was done by selecting outputs randomly and using an oracle for the best output. Results show significant improvement compared to BID23. Despite being based on simple NN, our approach competes quantitatively and qualitatively with state-of-the-art GAN models, producing natural-like images. Our approach allows for intuitive control over image synthesis by specifying a subset of relevant training examples. Failure cases occur when suitable nearest neighbors are not available, requiring exhaustive pixel-wise search. System-level optimization like Scanner 1 could potentially address this issue. Our approach to image synthesis, based on compositional nearest-neighbors, suggests that GANs may operate in a \"copy-and-paste\" fashion. By making this process explicit, our system can generate multiple outputs while remaining interpretable and user-constrained. Additionally, our approach provides dense pixel-level correspondences, allowing for the transfer of semantic labels in image analysis."
