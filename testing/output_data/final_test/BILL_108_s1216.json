Congress finds that the increasing reliance on wireless telephone service by consumers, with over 137 million users in the US, highlights the need for wireless telephone number portability to promote competition in the market.

The Act aims to enhance wireless telephone service quality and promote consumer choice in the market by addressing issues such as lack of information on service deficiencies and restrictive contract terms. Telephone number portability for wireless telephone service is addressed in Section 3 of the Act. The Act requires wireless telephone service providers in the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas to offer consumers the option to port telephone numbers between providers within six months of the enactment date.
