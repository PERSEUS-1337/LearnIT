    "content": "The \"Broadband Access Equality Act of 2009\" is introduced, which includes a credit for property used to provide broadband services in underserved and rural areas under section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The broadband services credit under section 38 is determined as a percentage of the cost of qualified broadband property placed in service during the taxable year. The applicable percentage varies, with 50% for underserved and rural areas with limited broadband access and 30% for other underserved and rural areas. The applicable percentage for the broadband services credit is increased by 10 percentage points for qualified broadband property providing high-speed transmission service. Qualified broadband property is defined as section 1245 property. The term 'qualified broadband property' refers to tangible property or computer software used to provide broadband services in underserved areas, with the original use commencing with the taxpayer. Broadband is defined as an Internet Protocol-based transmission service with specific speed requirements. The term 'underserved area' refers to specific census tracts with low internet speeds and limited access to broadband services, including those in empowerment zones, enterprise communities, or with high poverty levels and low median family incomes. The term 'rural area' is defined as any census tract outside a metropolitan statistical area, with a median family income not exceeding 70 percent of the greater of the metropolitan area or statewide median family income for metropolitan areas, and 70 percent of the nonmetropolitan statewide median family income for nonmetropolitan areas. The credit determined under subsection (a) may not be used to reduce a taxpayer's cost of service, but may be used to reduce rate base, provided that such reduction is restored not less rapidly than ratably. Recapture in Case of Dispositions, etc., if qualified broadband property is disposed of or ceases to be used to provide. If qualified broadband property is disposed of or ceases to be used to provide services in underserved areas, the tax for that year will increase by a recapture percentage of the credits allowed in prior years. Rules similar to section 179(d) will apply, along with basis reduction rules from sections 50(c) and 1016(a)(19). The broadband services credit under section 45R(a) is added to the general business credit in the tax code. A recapture percentage applies if qualified broadband property is disposed of or no longer used in underserved areas. Basis reduction rules from sections 50(c) and 1016(a)(19) also apply. The amendments made by this section apply to property used for broadband services in underserved and rural areas, effective for property placed in service after the enactment date in taxable years ending after that date."
