    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 focuses on increasing postsecondary access for disadvantaged students through financial support like the Pell Grant program and supportive services like the TRIO programs. Pell Grants provide around $30.1 billion to 7.6 million undergraduates, while TRIO programs received $950 million in funding in FY2017 to support disadvantaged students in achieving success in higher education. The TRIO programs received $950 million in funding in FY2017 to support disadvantaged students in postsecondary education. These programs aim to identify, prepare, and provide support services for students, as well as motivate and train individuals for doctoral programs. The six main TRIO programs are TRIO Upward Bound, Student Support Services, Talent Search, Educational Opportunity Centers, McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement, and Staff Development. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 made changes to the TRIO programs to increase accountability and ensure access for disadvantaged students. The U.S. Department of Education released regulations in 2010 to implement these provisions. The report introduces the TRIO programs, describes program provisions, funding trends, unique regulations, and key findings from recent evaluations. The federal TRIO programs offer support services and financial assistance to low-income, first-generation college students to help them succeed academically. These programs provide a pipeline of support services from secondary school through undergraduate education, each serving a different target population at various education levels. UB supports college preparation for secondary students, TS supports postsecondary enrollment for secondary students, and EOC supports postsecondary enrollment for adult students. The federal TRIO programs offer support services and financial assistance to low-income, first-generation college students to help them succeed academically. UB program provides intensive preparation for education beyond secondary school, with projects for secondary students, high school students in math and science, and military veterans. UBMS projects typically serve more junior or senior students with stronger math and science skills compared to Regular UB projects. Grants are available to institutions of higher education, agencies, organizations, and secondary schools. Participants must have completed eight years of elementary education or be between 13 and 19 years old and in need of academic support for postsecondary education. At least two-thirds of participants must be low-income, first-generation college students. The program participants must be low-income, first-generation college students. Regular UB and VUB participants must also be at risk of academic failure. UBMS participants must be low-income or first-generation. High risk for academic failure is defined for Regular UB participants as not proficient in state assessments, not completing pre-algebra or algebra by 10th grade, or having a GPA of 2.5 or less. Military veterans at high risk for academic failure are those out of high school for five or more years. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires grant recipients to offer specific services, including instruction in mathematics, laboratory science, and foreign language. The program serves low-income, first-generation college students who are at risk of academic failure. The grant amounts and minimum number of participants are outlined in the Federal Register notice for each competition. The program has historically been intensive for precollege students, with higher per-participant spending compared to other projects serving secondary school students. The program provides instruction in mathematics, laboratory science, foreign language, composition, and literature as part of the core curriculum. It also offers academic tutoring, course selection advice, college entrance exam preparation, financial aid assistance, and guidance on achieving a secondary school diploma or postsecondary education. Additionally, it includes education and counseling services to improve financial and economic literacy. Regular UB and UBMS grantees must offer a summer instructional component, and UBMS grantees must provide opportunities for participants to learn from mathematicians. The UBMS program requires grantees to provide participants with learning opportunities from mathematicians and scientists engaged in research and teaching, as well as with graduate and undergraduate science and math majors. Grantees can offer activities like exposure to cultural events, academic programs, mentoring, and programs for special populations. They can also pay for tuition, room and board for a summer instructional component, field trips, mentoring, work-study, and stipends not exceeding $40 per month for the academic year and $60 per month for the summer. The UBMS program provides learning opportunities in math and science, including exposure to cultural events, mentoring, and financial support for tuition, room and board. Stipends for participants do not exceed $40 per month for the academic year and $60 per month for the summer recess, with exceptions for work-study participants who may receive $300 per month. VUB grantees offer services like remedial courses and stipends, with a maximum stipend of $40 per month for full-time participants. UB projects must report on participant performance and outcomes annually. The academic performance of participants is measured by standardized test scores in reading/language arts and math, as well as completion of a rigorous secondary school curriculum. Secondary school retention and graduation rates are also assessed, along with postsecondary enrollment. The TS program aims to support high school completion and postsecondary enrollment by assisting students in applying for financial aid and encouraging older individuals to enter or reenter educational programs. Grants and contracts are available to institutions and organizations with experience in serving disadvantaged individuals. The TS program supports high school completion and postsecondary enrollment by assisting students with financial aid applications. Participants must have completed elementary education or be between 11 and 27 years old. At least two-thirds must be low-income, first-generation college students. Grantees provide course selection advice, college entrance exam preparation, college application assistance, financial aid information, and guidance on achieving a secondary school diploma. Individuals over 27 may participate if not served by Educational Opportunity Centers. The TS program provides assistance for high school completion and postsecondary education, including guidance on achieving a diploma or equivalent. Grantees offer tutoring, financial literacy services, and a range of intensive support services. The average cost per participant has increased over the years, with permissible activities including exposure to cultural events, mentoring programs, and career exploration. The Talent Search program supports high school completion and postsecondary enrollment by providing educational assistance and guidance. Grantees can cover costs like tuition, transportation, and meals for participants, and must report on outcomes such as participant retention, graduation rates, and postsecondary education completion. The Educational Opportunity Centers program also focuses on high school completion and postsecondary enrollment, offering information and support services. The Educational Opportunity Centers (EOC) program provides information and assistance for individuals pursuing postsecondary education, including financial aid applications and improving financial literacy. Grants are available to various institutions and organizations serving disadvantaged youth. Participants must be at least 19 years old, with EOC generally serving adults but may also serve secondary-age students if needed. The EOC program serves secondary-age students if they cannot be served by other programs and at least two-thirds of participants must be low-income, first-generation college students. EOC projects provide services like academic advice, tutoring, and counseling, with flexibility in activities provided. Program regulations allow spending on transportation, meals, and lodging under limited circumstances. The EOC program allows grantees to pay for college applications, entrance examinations, and alternative education program fees. Projects must report on participant goals, including secondary school completion, postsecondary enrollment, financial aid applications, and college admissions. The SSS program offers support services to college students. The SSS program provides support services to college students to improve retention, graduation rates, and transfers. Grants are available to institutions, with participants needing academic support. Two-thirds must be students with disabilities or low-income, first-generation college students. In FY2017, SSS projects expended funds. In FY2017, TRIO SSS projects spent $1,500 per low-income student with disabilities on average. Programs must offer academic tutoring, course selection advice, financial literacy education, and assistance with financial aid applications and admission to graduate programs. Grantees may also provide additional services like counseling, cultural events, and mentoring programs. The TRIO SSS projects offer mentoring programs, temporary housing, student aid stipends, and support for special populations. Grantees can provide transportation, meals, and lodging for approved activities. Professional development travel is limited to 4% of staff salaries. Student aid stipends are available for Pell Grant recipients in the first two years of postsecondary education. The TRIO SSS program offers student aid stipends to Pell Grant recipients in their first two years of postsecondary education. Grantees must match federal funds used for stipends from nonfederal sources unless eligible for specific institutional aid programs. All SSS projects must report their progress annually. The TRIO McNair program prepares disadvantaged college students for doctoral study through research opportunities, internships, counseling, and tutoring. Grants are available to IHEs with participants enrolled in nondoctoral degree programs. Two-thirds of students served must be low-income, first-generation college students. The McNair program supports disadvantaged college students for doctoral study through various academic and research opportunities. Projects provide academic tutoring, counseling, summer internships, research activities, seminars, and assistance with graduate program admissions. Stipends and financial assistance are available for participants, with an average expenditure of $8,766 per participant in FY2017. Additionally, projects may offer services such as mentoring and support for underrepresented groups in graduate education. The McNair program supports disadvantaged college students for doctoral study through academic and research opportunities. Projects provide tutoring, counseling, internships, research activities, seminars, and assistance with graduate program admissions. Stipends and financial assistance are available, with an average expenditure of $8,766 per participant in FY2017. Projects may also offer mentoring, cultural events, academic programs, and services to improve financial literacy. McNair projects must report on participant numbers, scholarly activities, graduate program enrollment, retention in graduate study, and attainment of doctoral degrees. The TRIO Training program provides training for TRIO program staff to improve project administration, outcomes, and outreach. Two-year grants are available to institutions and organizations. The TRIO Training program offers training for staff and leadership personnel in TRIO programs through conferences, internships, seminars, and workshops. Training covers topics like legislative requirements, educational technology, and strategies for recruiting disconnected students. Grantees provide annual training with allowable costs for transportation, lodging, and honorariums. ED establishes priorities to ensure specific topics are covered in each grant competition. The TRIO Training program offers training for staff and leadership personnel in TRIO programs, covering topics like legislative requirements and strategies for recruiting disconnected students. Grantees must report on meeting outcome criteria such as the number of participants served and increased qualifications. The program is different from student-serving TRIO programs as it lacks statutorily defined outcome criteria. The Higher Education Act authorized $900 million for FY2009. The Higher Education Act authorized $900 million for FY2009 and subsequent years. The McNair program was allocated at least $11 million annually from FY2009-FY2014. The authorization of appropriations guides funding for TRIO programs. The annual discretionary appropriation for TRIO programs increased from $828 million in FY2008 to $853 million in FY2010, then decreased to $796 million in FY2013. The discretionary appropriation for TRIO programs increased from $828 million in FY2008 to $853 million in FY2010, then decreased to $796 million in FY2013 before rising to $950 million in FY2017. The FY2017 appropriation exceeded the FY2008 inflation-adjusted level. Additionally, through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, ED received a mandatory appropriation of $57 million annually from FY2008-FY2011 for unsuccessful UB applicants. The TRIO programs served over 820,000 participants each year from FY2008-FY2010. The TRIO programs served over 820,000 participants in each of FY2008-FY2010. In FY2011-FY2015, the number of participants decreased due to reduced funding for TS services. However, with increased appropriations in FY2016 and FY2017, the number of participants increased to over 810,000 each year. The FY2017 appropriations agreement aimed to increase grant amounts for continuation awards and the number of grantees awarded in competitions. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 made important changes to the TRIO programs, impacting grant-making processes and services provided to disadvantaged students. TRIO services support secondary school completion, college preparation, enrollment, undergraduate and graduate school completion. Prior to the HEOA, statutory provisions only listed permissible services for each program. The HEOA defined required and permissible services for TRIO programs to increase consistency and effectiveness. Participants can choose which services to receive, and grantees can offer additional services that align with the program's purpose. The TRIO programs award grants based on peer review scores and prior experience points. Grantees with successful track records can earn additional points. Grants are awarded in rank order based on total scores. TRIO program grantee must meet or exceed objectives from prior application to earn additional points in grant competitions. Applicants in FY2006 competitions raised concerns about inconsistent application of points by ED, leading to improper awarding of points. The OIG found issues with ED's regulations and execution errors in awarding PE points to applicants. Congress aimed to improve TRIO programs' rigor and accountability by establishing outcome criteria for PE points. Grantees must meet targets for quality and effectiveness annually. The HEOA added new outcome criteria for PE points in TRIO programs, including completion of a rigorous secondary school program and postsecondary completion. Prior to HEOA, criteria focused on participant numbers, demographics, high school retention, and postsecondary enrollment. The Secretary awarded PE points based on participants' standardized test achievement, GPAs, program retention, and postsecondary success. The HEOA added new outcome criteria for PE points in TRIO programs, focusing on postsecondary completion and completion of a rigorous secondary program of education. Grant competitions now use these criteria established by the HEOA, while TRIO Training still uses a different process for PE points. ED awards Training applicants based on peer review score rankings and uses PE points in case of a tie. PE points are awarded to prior grantees based on established outcome criteria. The HEOA allows unsuccessful applicants to request a second review of their application if there are specific errors made by ED or peer reviewers. Funding may be provided for applications with adjusted scores meeting the minimum cut score. The Secretary reserves funds for grants awarded under the second review process. Only eligible applicants can undergo a second review according to ED regulations. During the FY2012 Regular UB competition, the Secretary reserved almost $9 million for a second review, awarding an additional $23.4 million in the FY2015 SSS competition. Statutory provisions set minimum grant awards for TRIO programs at $200,000 and $170,000 for the Training program. Regulations post-2010 require the Secretary to identify new grant competition rules. The Secretary sets minimum participant numbers and grant award amounts for each new grant competition after 2010. For example, in the FY2011 TS grant competition, applicants had to serve at least 500 participants for up to $460 each, with a maximum award of $230,000 for new grantees. Prior grantees could receive up to $230,000 or 103% of their previous award. TRIO program grants last five years, while training grants last two years. The HEOA allowed for a one-time extension of grants to align durations. The HEOA allowed the Secretary to extend grants for TRIO programs, but the extensions did not synchronize grant periods. Some Members of Congress were concerned about ED regulations limiting the programs' reach. The HEOA clarified that grantees can receive multiple awards for different populations or target areas. Applicants proposing to serve a different population do not receive priority points. In the FY2010 SSS grant competition, the Secretary defined six different populations for grant recipients. Training grantees may receive multiple awards for different absolute priorities established for the competition. Applicants serving a new population do not receive priority points. The TRIO grant competition focuses on specific objectives, with applicants required to address absolute priorities to be eligible for funding. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on program performance and make grants for evaluations of effective practices. A set-aside of 0.5% of the TRIO appropriation is used for evaluations, peer reviews, grantee oversight, and technical assistance. This has led to a large body of TRIO evaluations, including recent independent evaluations and analyses of grantee performance reports. Between 2002 and 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) assessed federal programs through the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), which rated programs as ineffective, adequate, moderately effective, or effective based on purpose, design, planning, management, and results. The results of PART reviews informed amendments to the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) to improve program effectiveness. Additionally, the Department of Education (ED) published data based on grantee annual performance reports (APRs) in response to PART evaluations. The data from grantee annual performance reports (APRs) inform program performance measures for participant retention, enrollment, and completion. ED cautions against comparing results between projects due to differences in student characteristics. Independent comparative evaluations have not been published since 2010 due to challenges in establishing control groups. The evaluation of TRIO programs or similar services shows a positive impact on academic outcomes for participants, with some studies indicating statistically significant results. Data collection for evaluations takes several years, and there may be challenges in establishing control groups for comparison. Receiving supplemental services, such as those from an SSS project, was linked to higher postsecondary persistence and degree completion. A recent study on Regular UB found increased postsecondary enrollment and credential attainment for participants with lower educational expectations. An evaluation of AY1991-1992 freshman SSS participants showed a small but positive impact compared to a matched comparison group. The 1997 evaluation of SSS showed a positive effect on student outcomes like GPA, retention rates, and college credits earned. A study identified promising practices in 1997 based on successful projects, including providing a freshman experience, academic support, maximizing student contact, selective recruitment, incentives, dedicated staff, and campus involvement. A 2010 report concluded that postsecondary supplemental services lead to better student outcomes. Participation in postsecondary supplemental services, including SSS, is linked to improved student outcomes. SSS participation as a freshman is associated with increased postsecondary persistence and degree completion. Receiving supplemental services from any source over time, especially in later years, leads to higher persistence and degree completion rates compared to receiving services only in the freshman year. Models show a significant increase in retention, degree completion, and degree attainment for students receiving supplemental services. Participation in postsecondary supplemental services, such as SSS, is linked to improved student outcomes, including increased retention, degree completion, and transfers from two-year to four-year institutions. The specificity of the results to SSS is limited due to variations in services received and the comparison group also receiving supplemental services from non-SSS programs. The study found positive effects on student outcomes with specific supplemental services such as home-based SSS programs, peer tutoring, counseling, field trips, referrals to outside resources, and college reentrance counseling. Some SSS services were blended with other campus services. A 2006 study of SSS promising practices by ED did not meet methodological standards and was not released. In August 2015, ED released a study comparing postsecondary persistence and completion rates of students who participated in the SSS program. The study compared the persistence and completion rates of students in the SSS program who started college in AY2007-2008 with a sample of students from AY2003-2004. The study found that SSS participants had higher persistence and completion rates in postsecondary education. The SSS program showed higher persistence and completion rates for students who first enrolled in two-year and four-year institutions. SSS students had a 86% persistence rate and 41% three-year completion rate at two-year institutions, while at four-year institutions, the rates were 93% and 48% respectively. BPS:04/09 sample students had a 65% persistence rate and 21% three-year completion rate at two-year institutions, and 79% persistence rate and 40% six-year completion rate at four-year institutions. A 2005 OMB PART review rated the SSS program as moderately effective. The 2005 OMB PART review found the SSS program to be moderately effective, with ambitious goals and good management but needing improvements in efficiency. The review noted that ED had not made grantee-level performance data public, had not fully met performance goals, and had not set targets for program efficiency. ED has published APR data from 2005-2006 to 2013-2014, showing that 87% of first-time, full-time freshmen in the SSS project persisted, graduated, or transferred from a two-year to a four-year institution by the next year. The six-year graduation rate for SSS participants was around 50%. The graduation rate for SSS project participants was around 50% for first-time, full-time freshmen at four-year IHEs and approximately 40% for those at two-year IHEs. A nine-year impact study on Regular UB showed no significant effect on postsecondary enrollment rates or institution selectivity. Postsecondary enrollment for the treatment group was 81% compared to 79% for the control group, with a five percentage-point increase in Regular UB. The official results showed a 5 percentage-point increase in Regular UB participants earning vocational certificates/licenses compared to nonparticipants. Additionally, Regular UB participants with lower educational expectations saw a 12 percentage-point increase in earning a postsecondary degree/certificate/license. Each additional year of participation in a Regular UB project led to a 5 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of receiving a bachelor's degree. A separate analysis of the data was conducted by the ED Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and published by the Council for Opportunity in Education to address sampling design and error issues. The alternative analysis found a 10.9 percentage-point increase in postsecondary enrollment and a 50% increase in the probability of achieving a bachelor's degree for Regular UB and UBMS participants compared to the control group. However, the results do not represent the Regular UB universe accurately due to the exclusion of a project representing 26% of the universe. Additionally, the treatment and control groups were unequally weighted as individuals were reassigned between groups. The study evaluated UBMS participants and found positive outcomes, including GPA increase, higher enrollment in math and science courses, and increased enrollment in selective colleges. Participation in UBMS was also linked to higher postsecondary degree completion, particularly in social sciences. The FY2007 Regular UB competition included an \"absolute priority\" for a random assignment, control group evaluation in the social sciences. Some stakeholders opposed recruiting a control group of low-income and minority students who would not receive services, questioning the selection criteria and effectiveness. The TRIO UB program's focus shifted from recruiting younger students to serving those at high academic risk for failure. The HEOA eliminated the requirement to serve students who completed 8th grade but not 9th grade. An evaluation study initiated by ED in 2006 did not meet standards and was not released. The HEOA now mandates a rigorous evaluation of UB practices. The HEOA mandated a rigorous evaluation of UB practices to be completed by June 30, 2010. ED initiated a $3.8 million study on Upward Bound and other TRIO programs, but statutory limitations made it challenging to meet evaluation standards. A survey report of Upward Bound directors highlighted common program practices, with four core services having predominant approaches. In 2014, around 200 UB projects participated in a study on enhanced college advising for 11th graders. The study aims to assess a low-cost approach to improve college fit and persistence. The evaluation is estimated to cost $6.0 million with a final report expected in 2020. The 2014 study on enhanced college advising for 11th graders, involving around 200 UB projects, is estimated to cost $6.0 million with a final report expected in 2020. A 2002 OMB PART review found the UB program ineffective, citing issues with program targeting, management, evaluation, and performance goals. In 2004-2014, ED reported postsecondary enrollment rates for Regular UB and UBMS participants, with rates ranging from 82% to 89%. In 2013-2014, 85% of Regular UB and 87% of UBMS participants who graduated from high school enrolled in postsecondary education. An analysis in 2008 looked at academic progress data from UB and UBMS APRs. Regular UB served seven high schools on average, while UBMS served 17. Participants in the UB and UBMS projects showed high postsecondary enrollment rates, with 77% of UB and 86% of UBMS participants expected to graduate in 2004-2005 enrolling in postsecondary education by 2005-2006. Enrollment rates increased with longer project participation, with 55% of one-year UB participants enrolling compared to 91% of three-year or longer participants. For UBMS, 80% of less-than-one-year participants enrolled compared to 87% of one-year or longer participants. 45% of participants served by two-year IHE grantees enrolled at their grantee institution. In 2004, an ED contractor released the Final Report from Phase I of the National Evaluation, which described the program's history, grant recipients, program staff, activities, and participants. The evaluation showed that in 1998-1999, 87% of projects achieved their secondary school graduation goal, 53% achieved their postsecondary admissions goal, and 38% achieved their postsecondary reentry goal. On average, 71% of high school graduates enrolled in postsecondary education. Phase II of the National Evaluation included a limited quasiexperimental study of 1995-1996 ninth graders. The National Evaluation in 2006 found that TS participants had higher rates of applying for financial aid and enrolling in public colleges compared to nonparticipants in Florida, Indiana, and Texas. A 2005 review determined the TS program was moderately effective but improvements were needed in making performance data public and meeting program goals. Since 2011-2012, around 84% of high school seniors applied for financial aid, and 80% of college-ready participants enrolled in postsecondary education. Participants were more likely to enroll in a college of the same level as sponsored by the TS program. For example, about 55% of participants served by two-year IHEs enrolled in two-year IHEs compared to 62% of participants served by four-year IHEs. Since 2011-2012, 84% of high school seniors applied for financial aid, and 80% of college-ready participants enrolled in postsecondary education. Participants tended to enroll in a college of the same level as sponsored by the TS program, with 55% of those served by two-year IHEs enrolling in two-year IHEs compared to 62% served by four-year IHEs. The evaluation of TS in 2004 included data on EOC history, grant recipients, program activities, and participant goals for secondary school completion, postsecondary admissions, and postsecondary reentry. Since 2011-2012, 60% of college-ready participants enrolled in postsecondary education, with approximately 68% enrolling in two-year IHEs. College-ready participants are those who received a high school diploma before receiving program services. No rigorous evaluations of EOC have been identified, with a 2007 OMB PART review rating the program results as not demonstrated due to various shortcomings in evaluation and performance measurement. ED has published data on program performance measures from 2006-2007 through 2013-2014. In 2008, an ED contractor released a report on educational and employment outcomes of McNair participants. The report found that 73% enrolled in graduate school within five to seven years of completing a bachelor's degree, with 44% earning a master's degree, 14.4% earning a doctorate degree, and 12.1% earning a professional degree within 10 years of program participation. The findings were not from a random assignment study design. The McNair program was found to be moderately effective in a 2006 review. Data shows that since 2009, 70% of McNair participants enrolled in graduate school within three years of receiving their bachelor's degree. However, a major evaluation of the program has not been conducted, and grantee-level performance results are not publicly available."
