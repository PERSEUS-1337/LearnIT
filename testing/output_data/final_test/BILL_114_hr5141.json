The Congress began accepting applications for the Central American Minors Refugee/Parole Program despite opposition, infringing on Congress's immigration authority. The program allows illegal aliens from 3 Central American countries to enter the US. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services does not track CAM program applicants' prior removals or felony convictions. Some beneficiaries can immediately work and get legal status, with the potential for permanent residence and federal benefits. Citizenship can be pursued after 5 years of permanent residence under the CAM program. The CAM program offers cash, loans for flights, DNA testing reimbursements, and medical assistance to Central American applicants seeking admission to the United States. It also waives certain fees for participants. As of April 2016, 8,001 individuals have applied, with 197 already admitted. Some parents who completed the program were DACA recipients. The CAM program, which offers assistance to Central American applicants seeking admission to the US, plans to accept applications from the DAPA program. DACA and DAPA were created by the Obama Administration through executive action, but faced legal challenges. Recent data shows that a majority of unaccompanied alien minors placed with sponsors in the US were placed with illegal immigrants. U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 141,192 unaccompanied alien minors from Central American countries from October 1, 2008, through February 29, 2016. Border apprehensions on the southwest border increased by 28% in March 2016 compared to the previous year. Testimony on the CAM program was heard in an April 2015 hearing by the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Testimony from officials in the Obama Administration in April 2015 revealed that the CAM program aims to reduce the surge of unaccompanied alien minors at the southwest border. However, it was also noted that the program will impose significant costs on taxpayers and State and local governments. Additionally, the CAM program was described as not a true refugee program but rather a way to circumvent the law and create a new admissions program for alien families from Central American countries to unite them with other illegal aliens in the United States, contributing to the surge of unaccompanied minors. The CAM program, aimed at reducing the surge of unaccompanied alien minors at the southwest border, has failed to deter illegal immigration. It has not been effective in curbing the influx of minors into the United States. No funds or resources allocated to the Secretary of Homeland Security or any other federal official can be used to implement the Central American Minors Refugee/Parole Program or any successor program."
