    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called \"Teaching Children To Save Lives.\" This part is referred to as the \"Teaching Children To Save Lives Act\" and includes findings related to the importance of teaching children life-saving skills. The Congress acknowledges the importance of teaching school children CPR, choking response, and stroke recognition to improve emergency response confidence and potentially reduce death rates from sudden cardiac arrest, choking, and stroke. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, with 220,000 Americans dying annually from sudden cardiac arrest. The American Heart Association estimates that 50,000 lives could be saved each year by following the 'chain of survival'. The 'chain of survival' involves prompt notification of emergency services, early CPR, defibrillation, and advanced cardiac life support. It is important for school children to learn healthy behaviors and basic emergency life-saving skills. Incorporating lifesaving training programs into school health curriculum will equip children with these essential skills. \"Grants for CPR training in public schools are essential to equip children with life-saving skills.\" The Secretary can award grants to State agencies for CPR training in targeted localities, utilizing nationally recognized courses. Grants should support training sites with funds for instructor training, CPR instruction, materials, manikins, AED devices, and equipment. State agencies should promote community partnerships with public and private organizations when awarding grants. The Secretary can award grants to State agencies for CPR training in targeted localities, utilizing nationally recognized courses. Grants should support training sites with funds for instructor training, CPR instruction, materials, manikins, AED devices, and equipment. State agencies should promote community partnerships with public and private organizations when awarding grants. Organizations like the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross, along with emergency medical service providers, fire and police departments, and parent-teacher associations, can aid in providing CPR training in targeted schools. Grants are awarded based on the need for CPR training programs, geographic barriers, and options to maximize fund usage. Eligibility for grants for AED training devices requires demonstrating the need for such devices in the local agency or targeted school. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of a CPR training program in agencies or targeted schools, with definitions provided for terms like AED, CPR, and instructor. The Secretary is authorized to make regulations to carry out this Act. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on activities assisted under the Act. Authorization of appropriations is set at $30,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004."
