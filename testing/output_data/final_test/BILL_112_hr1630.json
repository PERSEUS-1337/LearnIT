The Act recognizes the fiscal pressures of an aging population and seeks to restore confidence in the long-term financial integrity of these programs. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" aims to preserve surpluses for retirement and health security, preventing their use for other purposes. It adds protection for Social Security and Medicare surpluses. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" prohibits setting a budget surplus lower than the combined surpluses of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. It also restricts the consideration of spending and tax legislation that would impact these surpluses. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" prohibits any legislation that would reduce the budget surplus below the combined surpluses of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for any fiscal year. The surplus for any fiscal year must adhere to levels specified in the budget resolution or conference report, and can be adjusted under certain procedures to prevent a decrease in the surplus. The current levels of the surplus for enforcement purposes are also defined. The surplus for any fiscal year is calculated based on baseline levels of direct spending, revenue, and discretionary spending. Adjustments can be made to prevent a decrease in the surplus as specified in the budget resolution or conference report. The budget resolution allows for adjustments in budgetary aggregates based on updated economic and technical assumptions. Revisions will be included in the first current level report on the congressional budget after the mid-session report. Disclosure of Federal trust fund surpluses is required for enforcing any point of order under subsection (a). The report accompanying the budget resolution must include surplus levels for each fiscal year and the surplus or deficit in various Federal trust funds. The Trust Fund calculations are subject to waiver or appeal in the Senate by a three-fifths vote. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Protection for Social Security and hospital insurance surpluses."
