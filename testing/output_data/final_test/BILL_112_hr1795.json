    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Providing Gas Price Relief Through Public Transportation Act of 2011\". Congress finds that public transportation use in the United States has been increasing significantly since 1995, with a 31 percent rise, surpassing the growth rate of the population and vehicle miles traveled on highways. High gas prices are expected to further drive demand for transit services, potentially resulting in a 15 percent increase in ridership with $5-per-gallon gas. Riding public transportation can save households an average of $825 per month, or nearly $10,000 per year based on gas prices in March 2011. Despite increasing demand for transit services, 59 percent of public transit systems in the United States have raised fares or cut service since January 2009. Federal employees in the National Capital Region receive transit benefits, but these benefits should be available to all Federal employees nationwide to promote greater public transportation use. Public transportation stakeholders should involve local communities in promoting the importance of utilizing public transportation as a national priority. SEC. 3. GRANTS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. Authorizations of Appropriations for public transportation services include $750,000,000 for urbanized area formula grants and $100,000,000 for formula grants for other than urbanized areas for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. These funds must be apportioned within 7 days of appropriation and cannot be combined with other allocated funds. In addition to the $750,000,000 for urbanized area formula grants, $100,000,000 is authorized for formula grants for non-urbanized areas in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. These funds must be apportioned within 7 days of appropriation and cannot be combined with other allocated funds. The Secretary of Transportation may make grants for reducing public transportation fares from the allocated amounts. The recipient can use funds to cover operating costs for public transportation or intercity bus service that cannot be paid from fare revenues. This is to prevent fare increases or service decreases due to rising transportation-related costs. The recipient of the grant can use funds for transportation-related fuel, equipment, or facility maintenance, as long as they do not increase fares or decrease public transportation services during the grant term. If expanding, they must certify to the Secretary that they will expand public transportation services.
