    "content": "Leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-2009, banks lacked sufficient credit loss reserves and capital, leading to government intervention to stabilize the financial system. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act to strengthen regulation and prevent future crises, followed by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174) aims to provide relief to financial firms from burdensome regulations. Congress delegates authority to bank regulators and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to determine credit loss reserves, including the current expected credit loss (CECL) implementation. Credit loss reserves help adjust for potential future losses on loans and assets, as credit losses are not evenly realized throughout the life of a loan. The incurred loss methodology under GAAP requires banks to recognize credit losses on financial statements when a loss is probable and estimable. Credit loss reserves are based on historical data and current economic events. In June 2016, FASB replaced this method with the more forward-looking CECL methodology to provide more useful information on financial statements. CECL requires a more proactive approach to estimating credit losses. The CECL methodology requires a broader range of information to determine expected credit losses over the life of a financial instrument. Banking regulators are in the process of implementing CECL, which will impact the banking industry and other financial sectors. The report compares the incurred loss model with CECL and discusses the implementation timeline and policy issues surrounding CECL. The CECL methodology requires more information to determine credit losses over a financial instrument's life. It will impact banks and other financial sectors, with greater transparency of expected losses and improved understanding of changes in credit losses. FASB amended disclosure requirements but retained most of them. CECL requirements are effective from December 2019 for some companies, affecting various financial assets. See Table 1 for implementation dates. CECL will apply to off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and other financial assets with a right to receive cash payments. All SEC filers must adopt the new CECL model for credit loss reserves. The changes will impact regulatory capital rules for banking organizations, including national banks, state-member banks, and savings associations. The regulators have proposed a new rule to address bank capital requirements, with the National Credit Union Administration not participating in the joint proposal. CECL-based credit loss estimates will require reevaluation of credit losses on existing loans and assets, potentially leading to a onetime reduction in earnings upon adoption. This will impact banks in various ways depending on their current practices. CECL will impact banks differently based on their current allowance modeling methods. Regulators offer implementation guidance but not specific forecasts. Credit losses are currently reflected as ALLL on the balance sheet, reducing asset value. Incurred loss methodology delays credit recognition based on probable threshold and incurred loss. CECL requires banks to recognize potential credit losses at the time assets are recorded on the balance sheet, leading to a one-time adjustment for existing loan portfolios. It simplifies credit impairment models by using a single measurement objective for all financial assets, allowing flexibility in estimating expected credit losses. CECL implementation requires firms to develop a model considering reasonable forecasts for credit loss estimates. Early adopters may issue CECL-based financial statements after December 15, 2018. All public companies must incorporate CECL for reporting periods after December 15, 2019. Regulators have issued rules and support for CECL. This section discusses policy issues, the impact on the banking industry, and compares CECL with IFRS 9. The implementation of CECL in the banking industry is compared to IFRS 9, with concerns raised about the current credit loss model and the need for more accurate loss provisions. Banking professionals have expressed worries about the challenges of implementing CECL. Industry professionals have raised concerns about implementing CECL, with worries about its cost, complexity in credit loss calculations, and potential reduction in available credit. The Federal Housing Finance Agency Director noted that CECL will impact reported net income, while FASB officials acknowledged similar concerns raised during congressional testimonies. The adoption of CECL is seen as the most significant bank accounting change in 40 years. FASB acknowledged concerns about complying with CECL, including the effort needed to gather data for estimating credit losses. CECL does not change the economics of lending but alters when losses are recorded, leading to the development of new credit loss models and increased costs for banks. Banks must consider many unknowns under CECL, such as residential mortgages that may extend 30 years. The CECL model considers future economic conditions for potential losses on financial assets, including residential mortgages that can last 30 years. Predicting credit loss reserves for long-term loans is challenging due to economic uncertainties and varying delinquency rates during recessions. The incurred loss methodology failed to account for significant fluctuations in delinquency rates over time. The CECL model allows banks to adjust credit loss models periodically to capture credit deteriorations and recovery, preventing the need to increase credit loss reserves during economic downturns. However, during downturns, banks may limit credit availability if they forecast a prolonged downturn and need to maintain sufficient capital levels. CECL requires recognition of possible loan losses at inception, potentially resulting in lower earnings than under incurred loss methodology. The CECL model requires banks to recognize possible loan losses at inception, potentially leading to lower earnings than under the incurred loss methodology. This could result in some lenders increasing reserves, which reduces profitability. However, setting aside sufficient credit loss reserves may enhance a bank's ability to absorb future losses and continue lending. The proposed replacement of ALLL with ACL in capital rules may help banks better match actual credit losses and avoid distress. If ACL is adopted, it could be included in a bank's tier 2 capital alongside ALLL. Banks must maintain tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 capital levels based on asset riskiness. ALLL covers credit losses on loans, while CECL's ACL covers a wider range of assets. Implementing ACL poses challenges like costs, data retention, and training for banks. Regulators urge banks to prepare for one-time transition costs and ongoing expenses for the new standard. Regulators encourage banks to capture historical data for CECL modeling without requiring unreasonable data reconstruction costs. Additional data retention requirements may increase operating expenses for banks, especially smaller ones that opt for third-party vendors to lower costs. Banks and service providers may incur one-time upgrade costs to meet data retention requirements. Implementation costs for CECL may be offset by its single impairment measurement objective compared to U.S. GAAP. Under CECL, banks may need to capture additional data and retain it longer than before to determine loss reserves. Some banks might have to migrate to newer systems, risking the loss of historical data. Smaller banks currently using spreadsheets for credit loss determination may need to switch to third-party vendor systems for CECL compliance. Under CECL, banks may need to upgrade systems and data retention for credit loss reserves. Smaller banks transitioning to vendor-based CECL models could lead to inaccurate reserve estimations and systemic risks. Additional data retention requirements also pose cybersecurity risks. Stakeholders must undergo training for the transition to CECL from incurred loss methodology. Regulators plan to propose changes to reflect the shift from ALLL to ACL. The transition from ALLL to ACL under CECL will require banks to make a onetime adjustment to credit loss allowance, impacting profitability and retained earnings. Recognizing lifetime credit losses for existing loans will reduce income earned, leading to increased credit loss reserves. Inadequate income to offset reserves will result in declined retained earnings, affecting a bank's Tier 1 capital. The transition to CECL will impact banks' retained earnings and require adjustments to credit loss allowances. This change will increase reserves and affect common equity ratios by 25-50 basis points. The upfront increase in ACL is estimated to be between $50 billion and $100 billion. The transition to CECL is principles-based, leading to varying effects on each bank. The transition to CECL will impact banks' retained earnings and require adjustments to credit loss allowances. Some banks may need to significantly increase reserves by 25-50 basis points, while others may need to adjust less. Banks are beginning to disclose the preliminary impact of implementing CECL, with some indicating a need to increase credit reserves by 10-20%. Concerns have been raised about the difficulty in planning for CECL adoption due to uncertainty about future economic conditions. Banking regulators are proposing to allow banks to address unexpected economic conditions that could result in higher than anticipated credit loss recognition. The banking regulators are proposing to allow banks to phase in adverse effects on regulatory capital requirements over a three-year period. Banks must disclose their three-year election and cannot retrospectively elect the phase-in option. The proposed CECL rule is estimated to not generate significant costs for small banks. The Federal Reserve conducts annual stress tests on the largest U.S. banks. The Federal Reserve conducts annual stress tests on the largest U.S. banks to assess their capital plans for viability during a financial crisis. Banks are required to have sufficient capital to withstand adverse operating conditions and continue lending. For the 2018 and 2019 stress test cycles, banking organizations are proposed to use ALLL instead of ACL to promote comparability of results across banks. In 2021, all banking organizations will be required to adopt CECL for stress tests, potentially increasing operational costs for banks that adopt it early. Differences in accounting standards may disadvantage U.S. banks, but modifications to capital requirements and stress tests could help alleviate concerns. The impact of changing to CECL will likely be determined by future economic conditions. The FASB created CECL and issued ASU 326 for credit losses, while the IASB issued IFRS 9. Both boards collaborated on revising credit loss models after the financial crisis, aiming for convergence but ultimately following separate stakeholder feedback. Foreign banking organizations (FBOs) operating in the United States must estimate credit losses under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. This results in multiple filing requirements and the need for different credit loss estimates. Some experts believe that IASB's credit loss model is more complex and may lead to lower reserves compared to FASB's CECL model. Stakeholders have different preferences, with IASB favoring a dual measurement approach and U.S. stakeholders preferring a holistic lifetime credit loss model. FASB concluded that convergence between U.S. GAAP and IFRS 9 credit loss models was unachievable due to differences in accounting practices and stakeholder preferences. The CECL model and IFRS 9 have clear similarities and differences, with U.S. GAAP placing greater emphasis on loss allowances on the balance sheet. The CECL model and IFRS 9 are credit loss models with differences in recognizing expected credit losses. CECL records full expected credit losses for all assets, while IFRS 9 recognizes losses for a 12-month period unless there is a significant increase in credit risk. Both models require credit loss evaluation over the life of the loan, with CECL implicitly considering the time value of money and IFRS 9 requiring explicit consideration. CECL mandates collective evaluation of credit losses for similar assets, while IFRS 9 allows collective evaluation based on shared-risk characteristics. IFRS 9 allows collective evaluation of credit losses based on shared-risk characteristics, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The housing finance system consists of a primary market where lenders make new loans and a secondary market where loans are bought and sold by banks and financial institutions, including government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Both entities are in conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency and are subject to GAAP as promulgated by FASB. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, like banks, must implement CECL, affecting their earnings and asset valuations. They may need additional credit loss reserves of $7.5 billion and $5 billion, respectively, and currently have $3 billion in capital reserves. To cover the shortfall, they might need to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. Congress and FHFA could allow them to accumulate the reserves over three years to avoid additional draws from the Treasury. Federal government entities lending or providing loan guarantees are not subject to CECL. If FASAB adopts CECL, credit loss reserves on federal government assets, including loans and loan guarantees, could increase. State and local governments, under GASB, may also see potential increases in credit loss reserves if they adopt CECL. Some states have laws requiring adherence to GASB accounting standards."
