    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Hepatitis C Epidemic Control and Prevention Act\". It includes findings related to hepatitis C. Congress finds that over 3 million individuals in the US are chronically infected with hepatitis C, making it the most common blood-borne viral infection. Nearly 2% of the population has been infected, with approximately 35,000 new infections each year. HCV can cause life-threatening liver disease, and there is no vaccine available for prevention. Infected individuals can unknowingly transmit the virus, as many are unaware of their infection. To combat the HCV epidemic in the United States, treatments are available to slow the progression of chronic HCV. An estimated 2.4 to 2.7 million chronically infected individuals are not receiving treatment, leading to significant costs in lost productivity and medical care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed recommendations and strategies to prevent and control HCV infection and related chronic diseases. The National Hepatitis C Prevention Strategy was established in 2001, with Consensus Development Conferences held in 1997 and 2002 by the National Institutes of Health. Federal support is crucial to increase awareness of HCV and aid State and local prevention efforts. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the prevention, control, and medical management of Hepatitis C. This federal plan aims to address the challenges posed by Hepatitis C. The Secretary is required to develop a plan for the prevention, control, and medical management of hepatitis C (HCV), including education, training, surveillance, early detection, and research. The plan must consider recommendations from the CDC and NIH, and consult with various federal agencies. The Secretary is mandated to develop a plan for the prevention, control, and medical management of hepatitis C (HCV), involving consultation with federal agencies, medical advisory bodies, and the public, including individuals infected with HCV and advocates. The plan must be updated biennially to incorporate new knowledge and observations related to HCV and chronic HCV. The Secretary is required to publish assessments results in the Federal Register biennially, including any revisions to the plan for hepatitis C prevention and control based on the assessments. The Secretary must publish biennial assessments in the Federal Register, including revisions to the hepatitis C prevention and control plan to further promote its goals, or explain if no revision is needed. The Federal Plan for the Prevention, Control, and Medical Management of Hepatitis C includes specific elements outlined in SEC. 399BB. The Secretary will implement programs to increase awareness and knowledge of HCV through health education, public awareness campaigns, and training of healthcare professionals on prevention, detection, and management of HBV and HCV. The Secretary will support activities to promote early detection of HCV infection, identify risk factors, and conduct surveillance of infection trends through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includes developing and distributing curricula for hepatitis counseling, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and treatment for individuals infected with HBV or HCV. The Secretary will support the development of voluntary HCV testing programs at the state, local, and tribal levels to identify infected individuals early. Test results will be kept confidential as protected health information. The Secretary supports HCV testing programs at state, local, and tribal levels to identify infected individuals early, with confidential test results. Programs may not be used for health insurance issues, employment screening, or discharge purposes. Counseling on viral hepatitis is provided in various healthcare settings. The Secretary supports HCV testing programs to identify infected individuals early, with confidential results. Client-centered education and counseling focus on changing risky behaviors and reducing harm and transmission. Vaccination against viral hepatitis is provided for infected or at-risk individuals. The Secretary supports medical referral for individuals infected with or at risk for HCV, including drug or alcohol abuse treatment where appropriate, medical evaluation for chronic HCV stage, and suitability for antiviral treatment. The Secretary supports medical referral for individuals infected with or at risk for HCV, including drug or alcohol abuse treatment where appropriate, medical evaluation for chronic HCV stage, and suitability for antiviral treatment. Additionally, the Secretary, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, can provide a Hepatitis C Coordinator to State health departments to enhance HCV prevention and control activities. The Secretary also promotes the establishment of State HCV surveillance databases to identify risk factors and trends in HCV infection incidence. The Secretary conducts studies to identify trends in HCV incidence and prevalence among high-risk groups, and to assess and improve HCV infection prevention programs. Population-based seroprevalence studies are conducted to estimate the economic and clinical impacts of HCV. The Secretary conducts epidemiologic research to identify best practices for HCV prevention, establishes a Hepatitis C Clinical Research Network for treatment research, and conducts basic research for new prevention and treatment approaches for HCV. Information in databases must be de-identified for confidentiality. The Secretary supports State, local, and tribal programs for HCV-positive individuals, especially those with limited access to healthcare. Benchmarks are developed to evaluate program effectiveness. The Secretary may award grants to entities with expertise in HCV for activities under this part. Eligible entities must submit an application. $90,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for fiscal years 2005-2008. A Liver Disease Research Advisory Board is established under the Public Health Service Act. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board is established under the Public Health Service Act. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established under the Public Health Service Act, advises the Director of the National Institutes of Health on liver disease research and develops the Liver Disease Research Action Plan. It consists of 18 members appointed by the Director, including 12 eminent scientists and 6 lay persons. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board advises the Director of the National Institutes of Health on liver disease research. The Board consists of 18 members, including scientists and lay persons. The Director selects the Chair, and ex officio members from national research institutes, CDC, FDA, and VA are appointed as nonvoting members. Each ex officio member can appoint a representative. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will develop a Liver Disease Research Action Plan within 15 months of enactment. The plan will focus on scientific opportunities and priorities for liver disease research to improve understanding, prevention, and treatment protocols. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will revise the Liver Disease Research Action Plan every 2 years, meeting annually to review progress and make amendments based on new scientific discoveries."
