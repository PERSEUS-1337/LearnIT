    "content": "The FY2019 appropriations process began with the Trump Administration submitting a budget request to Congress, proposing $41.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD, a significant reduction from FY2018. Program eliminations were a major factor in this decrease, including CDBG, HOME, Public Housing Capital Funding, Choice Neighborhoods grants, and others. The House Appropriations Committee approved a FY2019 THUD appropriations bill with $53.2 billion in gross funding for HUD, slightly more than FY2018. The bill maintained funding for CDBG and the Public Housing Capital Fund at FY2018 levels but reduced funding for HOME and SHOP accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2019 THUD appropriations bill with over $54 billion in funding for HUD, exceeding the President's request by 30%. The bill did not include proposed program eliminations and maintained funding levels for various programs. The Senate later approved the bill as part of the Financial Services Appropriations bill. On December 22, 2018, a funding lapse affected the unfunded portions of the federal government, including HUD, after a continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018. The House passed several full-year THUD funding bills during the funding lapse, but none were taken up in the Senate. The House passed multiple funding bills related to transportation and housing during a funding lapse, but the Senate did not take them up. These bills included omnibus funding bills and a supplemental appropriations bill for HUD in response to disasters in 2018. The Senate considered a supplemental appropriations bill on January 24, 2019, which included additional funding for border security and full-year appropriations for agencies affected by the funding lapse. A continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 28; P.L. 116-5) was enacted on January 25, 2019, providing funding through February 15, 2019, for transportation and housing, allowing agencies to resume full operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided full-year appropriations for agencies affected by the funding lapse, including the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies. Renewing Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers is a significant HUD funding issue annually, as it is the largest expense in HUD's budget. New funding is required each year to continue assisting low-income families with rental vouchers. New funding is needed each year to renew Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, the largest expense in HUD's budget. If the funding provided is insufficient, Public Housing Authorities may use reserve funds, apply for set-aside funding from HUD, or implement cost-saving measures. Conversely, if the funding exceeds the amount needed, PHAs may serve additional families from their waiting lists. Advocacy groups estimate that the $22.598 billion FY2019 funding for voucher renewals will cover existing voucher holders' leases and potentially serve additional families in low-rent public housing programs. PHAs' budgets for public housing come from tenant rent and federal grant funding. The federal government provides formula grant funding to public housing authorities (PHAs) to cover the gap between tenant rents and property maintenance costs. The main funding programs are the Operating Fund and Capital Fund programs, with additional grants available through the Choice Neighborhood Initiative. The largest source of federal funding comes from the Operating Fund account, allocated based on property characteristics. Insufficient appropriations lead to prorated allocations, impacting PHAs' ability to maintain public housing properties. Less than full funding for public housing authorities (PHAs) means they may not meet their operating needs or have to use reserves or seek other funding sources. The President's budget for FY2019 would only cover 54% of PHAs' formula eligibility. The final HUD appropriations law provided $4.65 billion for operating funding in FY2019, falling between the House and Senate proposed amounts. The Capital Fund provides federal funding for major modernization needs of public housing, with a backlog of $25.6 billion in capital needs. The President's budget for FY2019 requested no funding for the Capital Fund, aiming to reduce the footprint of Public Housing. The final FY2019 appropriations law provided $2.775 billion for the Capital Fund, including $25 million for grants to address lead hazards in public housing. The House committee and Senate bills proposed funding for Choice Neighborhoods grants, with the House bill maintaining funding at $150 million and the Senate bill proposing a $50 million reduction. The final FY2019 appropriations law funded the account at the FY2018 level of $150 million, despite a decrease in funding relative to FY2018. The President's budget request proposed eliminating funding for HUD grant programs supporting affordable housing and community development activities, including CDBG, HOME, and SHOP grants. These programs were also targeted for elimination in the FY2018 budget request but were ultimately funded. The House committee and Senate bills did not address the elimination of these grant programs. The final FY2019 appropriations law maintained funding for CDBG, SHOP, and HOME programs. CDBG and SHOP received level funding, while HOME saw an 8.2% decrease compared to FY2018. Discretionary appropriations are subject to funding limits under the Budget Control Act. In the THUD bill, appropriators can use various methods to stay within funding limits, including offsetting collections from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) generated by fees from insured loans. The THUD bill utilizes offsetting collections from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) to stay within funding limits. GNMA guarantees mortgage-backed securities of government-insured mortgages, generating receipts when fees collected exceed payments on its guarantee.Offsets from FHA and GNMA vary yearly based on mortgage estimates and market factors. For FY2019, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that offsetting receipts from FHA would decrease to $7.6 billion from $8.3 billion in FY2018, while Ginnie Mae's offsets would increase to about $2 billion from $1.7 billion. This resulted in a total combined offset amount of about $500 million less in FY2019 compared to the prior year. The net budget authority proposed in the House and Senate bills for FY2019, as well as in the final appropriations law, increased more than the gross appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2018."
