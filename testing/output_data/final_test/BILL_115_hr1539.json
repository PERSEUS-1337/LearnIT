    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2017\". Congress finds that deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children require specialized early intervention programs to reach their full potential. Families benefit from comprehensive early intervention programs that support their child's development in all areas. Best practices for early intervention include language acquisition, family support, and progress monitoring. Effective hearing screening and early intervention programs are essential to identify hearing levels in deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children for timely access to appropriate interventions. SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF PROGRAM FOR EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT REGARDING DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING NEWBORNS, INFANTS, AND YOUNG CHILDREN. Section 399M of the Public Health Service Act is amended to focus on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children. The Health Resources and Services Administration will award grants to develop statewide programs for hearing screening, diagnosis, and intervention for newborns, infants, and young children, as well as to train qualified personnel and healthcare providers. The Health Resources and Services Administration will award grants for early intervention programs for deaf or hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children, including language acquisition interventions and family support. This includes referral to specialized programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to meet their unique communication needs. The program aims to provide accurate and evidence-based information to parents for decision-making regarding assistive hearing technologies and communication modalities. It also includes mechanisms for family support and technical assistance to states through resource centers. To further enhance State early hearing detection and intervention programs, efficient models are being identified or developed to ensure deaf or hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children receive follow-up by qualified providers and referrals to early intervention services. State agencies are encouraged to increase the rate of follow-up and referral. Technical assistance, data management, and applied research are also provided. The Secretary will provide grants for technical assistance, data tracking systems, and applied research related to newborn, infant, and young childhood hearing screening and intervention services through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grants provided by the Secretary will support applied research, technical assistance, monitoring, and coordination of data management for newborn, infant, and young childhood hearing screening and intervention programs. The grants provided by the Secretary support technical assistance, data collection, and research on newborn, infant, and young childhood hearing screening programs. The curr_chunk focuses on research objectives related to congenital hearing loss, screening effectiveness, and data integration for early hearing loss. The curr_chunk discusses the exchange of information between clinical care and public health, focusing on research and development of new screening techniques for hearing loss. Coordination and collaboration between different health agencies are emphasized in carrying out programs related to early hearing loss detection.
