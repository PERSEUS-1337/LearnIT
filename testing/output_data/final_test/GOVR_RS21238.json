    "content": "Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union. President Islam Karimov has been in power since then, pursuing a policy of cautiously opening the country to global influences. In 2002, a new constitution was created, establishing a bicameral legislature with a seven-year presidential term. The legislature consists of a directly elected lower chamber and an upper chamber with members appointed by the president. The Senate in Uzbekistan is made up of 16 members appointed by the president and the rest chosen by local legislatures. The Legislative Chamber is responsible for drafting laws. Constitutional amendments in 2003 gave more power to the prime minister after the 2007 presidential election. President Karimov aimed to create three powerful branches of government to reduce his own influence. Only government-controlled parties like the People's Democratic Party, Adolat Social Democratic Party, Liberal-Democratic Party, Milliy Tiklanish Party, and Ecological Movement of Uzbekistan are legal, while opposition parties operate illegally. Opposition parties in Uzbekistan, such as Birdamlik, Birlik, Erk, Free Farmers, and the Sunshine Coalition, are illegal. The former Fidokorlar National Democracy Party merged with the National Revival Party in 2008 to form the \"Democratic Bloc.\" A constitutional law in 2008 allowed opposition party deputies in the Legislative Chamber to participate in debates and propose bills. President Karimov signed electoral legislation in December 2008, limiting candidate nominations to political parties only. The Uzbek Central Election Commission approved four candidates for the presidential election in December 2007, including incumbent President Karimov. The candidates were nominated by different political parties, such as the LDP, PDP, Adolat Social Democratic Party, and a citizen's initiative committee. The CEC disqualified candidates nominated by Milliy Taklanish and Fidokorlar parties for not gathering enough signatures. Despite the constitution limiting presidents to two terms, Karimov was deemed eligible for a \"second term\" in 2007. Election observation mission reported controlled public appearances and minimal media coverage. Candidates focused on economic development and democratization in their campaigns. The presidential candidates praised economic development and democratization under the incumbent president. State-owned media urged voters to support Karimov, who won with 88% of 14.8 million votes and a 90.6% turnout. The OHIDR election mission criticized the election for not meeting OSCE commitments. Issues included lax rules on early voting and low turnout. Legislative Chamber elections had over 500 candidates from four parties running for 135 seats, with an 88% turnout of 17.2 million voters. The Electoral Commission announced run-offs in 39 districts as no candidate had over 50% of the vote. The Liberal Democratic Party won 53 seats, the People's Democratic Party won 32 seats, the Milliy Tiklanish Party won 31 seats, and the Adolat Social Democratic Party won 19 seats. The OSCE did not send observers, citing a lack of a fair contest. U.S. embassy personnel observed voting, noting a lack of diverse viewpoints. Indirect Senate elections were held, with the president appointing 16 members from various branches of government. In late January 2010, President Karimov called for studying the activities of the U.S. Congress to enhance budgeting and oversight in the Uzbek legislature. In November 2010, he proposed constitutional changes, approved in April 2011, allowing the majority party in the lower chamber to nominate a prime minister. The constitutional changes in Uzbekistan allow the lower legislative chamber to nominate a prime minister, give the prime minister power to appoint regional administrators, and outline procedures for a vote of no confidence. In case of the president's incapacity, the chairman of the Senate will serve as interim head of state until a new election is held. Some view these changes as a response to potential civil unrest, while others believe they are linked to elite infighting. In mid-July 2011, the Uzbek legislature criticized an economic report by the prime minister. In December 2011, amendments to the constitution reduced the presidential term to five years. Legislative elections were set for December 2014, with the presidential election following in March or April 2015. There were discussions about succession planning, including the possibility of designating a heir. In April 2012, Uzbek officials in the US reported bills introduced to allow the legislature to question the prime minister, hold a vote of non-confidence, and strengthen NGO rights. President Karimov expressed a cautious approach towards democratization in June 2012, emphasizing the importance of peace, tranquility, and unity for the happiness of the Uzbek people. Analysts suggest that Uzbek society is becoming more religiously traditional, which may impact the political landscape. In December 2012, Karimov highlighted the country's \"evolutionary\" democratization path, aiming to increase checks and balances in the system. In December 2012, President Karimov emphasized Uzbekistan's \"evolutionary\" democratization path, aiming to increase checks and balances in the government. Despite this, Uzbekistan has been criticized for human rights abuses, including police brutality, torture in prisons, and harassment of activists and opposition members. The Uzbek government arrested and prosecuted human rights activists and political oppositionists, with many political prisoners held without jury trials. Verdicts were often based on coerced confessions and witness testimony obtained through abuse. In 2012, human rights activist Gulnaza Yuldasheva was convicted on politically motivated charges. Some high-profile prisoners were released, and a few police officers were convicted of torture. Legislation expanding habeas corpus was approved, but freedom of expression was severely limited by the government. The Uzbek government severely limited freedom of expression by imposing fines for libel and defamation, with insulting the president punishable by up to five years in prison. Journalists were arrested, harassed, and intimidated, with restrictions on media content and control over broadcasting. The government issued regulations to widen control over media, including the power to block or ban threatening content. Explicit instructions were given on permitted stories for publication. The Uzbek government restricted freedom of assembly and imposed strict regulations on NGOs. They also limited freedom of travel and emigration through exit visa requirements. Forced labor, including students, teachers, and retirees, occurred during the cotton harvest. The Uzbek government has been criticized for severe violations of religious freedom, including restrictions on unregistered groups and harsh treatment of Muslims. Despite being designated a \"country of particular concern\" by the State Department, no U.S. sanctions have been imposed since 2009. The Uzbek government faces criticism for severe violations of religious freedom, including harsh treatment of Muslims. Uzbekistan is designated as a CPC by the State Department for human trafficking and forced labor issues. Over 1 million people are estimated to be affected by these practices. The State Department estimates over 1 million individuals in Uzbekistan are subject to state-imposed forced labor. Uzbekistan has fluctuated between Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List, and Tier 3 rankings for human trafficking compliance since 2003. Uzbekistan was granted waivers in 2011-2012 for written compliance plans, despite previous Tier 3 listings. The government of Uzbekistan had plans to comply with human trafficking regulations, but they were not realized, leading to a Tier 3 ranking in 2013. Uzbekistan has been listed for using child labor in cotton picking, impacting U.S. government contractors. In April 2013, the U.S. International Labor Rights Forum (IRLF) testified to Congress about their efforts in the Cotton Campaign to end forced child and adult labor in Uzbekistan's cotton production. Despite diplomatic and economic pressure, forced labor continued in the autumn 2012 harvest, with security personnel enforcing production quotas and preventing documentation. \"Volunteers\" from various sectors, including schools, were actually forced laborers, with children as young as 11 observed in the fields. The U.S. International Labor Rights Forum (IRLF) reported that children aged 11-15 were observed in the fields during the Uzbek cotton harvest. Most individuals were afraid of repercussions if they did not participate. The IRLF called for the enforcement of the Tariff Act of 1930 to block the importation of Uzbek cotton produced by forced labor. The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) monitored the 2011 harvest but was barred from the 2012 harvest. The Uzbek Ministry of Labor denied the use of forced child labor in the agricultural sector. The Uzbek government controls cotton production on private family farms, where children are allowed to work. The U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan pledged to advocate for human rights and support civil society. In 2013, the father of an oppositionist was arrested on rape charges. Bahodyr Choriyev, a Uzbekistan refugee in the U.S., was arrested on rape charges following reports of his son's political ambitions. The charges were seen as politically motivated due to his health and previous detainment. In 2013, U.S. Senators urged President Karimov to release imprisoned human rights activists. The U.N. Human Rights Council also issued recommendations to improve human rights conditions in Uzbekistan, including eliminating forced labor and torture allegations. Uzbekistan rejected all recommendations to improve human rights conditions, claiming they are factually incorrect. They denied the existence of political prisoners and justified the imprisonment of journalists and human rights defenders. They stated that torture allegations are investigated, with some law enforcement officers being held accountable in 2012. Religious freedom is recognized, except for proselytism, missionary activities, and unregistered religious groups. The delegation from Uzbekistan denied allegations of human rights violations, including the existence of political prisoners and justified the imprisonment of journalists and human rights defenders. They claimed that torture allegations are investigated and some law enforcement officers were held accountable in 2012. They also stated that religious freedom is recognized except for missionary activities, proselytism, and unregistered religious groups. Additionally, Uzbekistan's economy began to turn around in 1996 after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 2003, Uzbekistan allowed full currency convertibility but hindered the reform by reducing money circulation, imposing tariffs, and closing borders. This led to organized crime, corruption, and shortages. Uzbekistan is the third-largest cotton exporter, with agriculture contributing significantly to the GDP. The government controls export earnings, with a focus on cotton, gold, and natural gas. A sizable portion of the population lives in poverty, and many have migrated abroad for work. The Uzbek government launched an anti-crisis program in response to the global economic downturn in 2008, using funds from the Fund for Reconstruction and Development. The program aimed to increase budgetary expenditures on infrastructure modernization, extend credit to export industries, restructure bank debts, boost investment in small-sized businesses, and augment public-sector wages and social welfare. Additionally, a new industrial and infrastructure modernization program was launched for 2011-2015 with a budget of $47 billion. An industrial and infrastructure modernization program with a budget of $47 billion was launched in Uzbekistan for 2011-2015, aiming to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). However, foreign investors have faced business seizures and allegations of torture for tax evasion. This has led to a significant decrease in FDI since 2011, with the Uzbek government's economic data being deemed untrustworthy by the EIU. The EIU estimates Uzbekistan's GDP increased by 8.0% in 2012, supported by remittances from migrant workers and growth in various sectors. However, falling world prices for gold and cotton may hinder GDP growth in 2013, projected to slow to 7.3%. President Karimov criticized Uzbeks working abroad, despite significant remittances totaling $2.3 billion in 2012. The EIU estimates inflation was 14.3% in Uzbekistan at the end of 2012. The government has tried to control inflation through price controls but also contributed to it by increasing public sector wages. Restrictions on foreign exchange purchases may raise import costs for businesses. Tashkent suspended its membership in the Eurasian Economic Community in 2008. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Zone in 2013 with Russian support, despite opposition to Putin's initiatives. Strict border controls and corruption hinder regional trade. US-Uzbekistan trade is minimal, with exports mainly in aircraft. Uzbekistan's trade initiatives include purchasing Boeing 767s and forming joint ventures with General Motors. There are allegations that Uzbekistan delays rail freight shipments to pressure Tajikistan regarding the Rogun hydro-electric power dam project. In early April 2012, Tajikistan accused Uzbekistan of imposing a rail restriction as part of an \"economic blockade\" to destabilize Tajikistan. Uzbekistan denied the accusations, stating that their actions were in accordance with bilateral agreements. In July 2013, Tajikistan released water from its reservoir into the Syr Darya River to prevent water shortages downstream, blaming Kyrgyzstan for impounding water in its reservoir for winter power generation. Uzbekistan has approximately 600 million barrels of proven oil reserves according to British Petroleum's Statistical Review of World Energy. Uzbekistan has 600 million barrels of proven oil reserves and 39.7 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves as of 2012. The country is a net importer of oil and its oil production has been declining due to lack of investment. Uzbekistan exports gas to Russia and other Central Asian states through Soviet-era pipelines, with exports reaching 441.4 bcf in 2012. Gas is provided to Russia and Kazakhstan through the Central Asia-Center Pipeline system. Uzbekistan exports gas through the Russian-owned Central Asia-Center Pipeline system to Ukraine. Uzbekistan has been unreliable in gas exports to other Central Asian states, diverting exports for domestic needs. Gazprom and Lukoil are major investors in Uzbek gas development. Uzbekistan signed an agreement with China in 2007 for building infrastructure. In 2007, Uzbekistan and China signed an agreement to build a section of the Central Asia-China Pipeline. Construction began in 2008, with two pipelines completed in 2009-2010 and a third under construction. In 2011, Uztransgaz and CNPC signed a contract for gas supply through the pipeline starting in 2012. China announced a $15 billion investment in oil and gas exploration in Uzbekistan in 2012. A production sharing consortium is exploring for gas in the Aral Sea region. Uzbekistan started exporting gas to China through the pipeline in August 2012, leading to a significant increase in energy exports in 2012. In 2012, Uzbekistan's exports nearly doubled to $5.03 billion, with China being a major contributor to the increase. Gas exports to China strained domestic supplies due to declining output from Uzbekistan's oil and gas fields. Uzbekistan exported 141 bcf of gas to China in late 2012 and planned to supply 353 bcf in 2013. The chairman of Uzbekneftegaz denied that gas exports caused shortages, attributing them to inadequate domestic gas distribution systems. Uzbekistan aims to play a prominent role in regional affairs, with foreign policy heavily reliant on presidential decisions. Uzbekistan's foreign policy, heavily influenced by presidential decisions, aims to strengthen independence, sovereignty, and international role. Emphasis is placed on relations with Central Asian states, prioritizing regional stability and cooperation. The country is committed to a friendly and pragmatic approach towards neighbors, avoiding involvement in armed conflicts. The concept of Uzbekistan's foreign policy emphasizes regional problem-solving without external interference, neutrality in security relations, and the country's right to join or leave interstate groups. Uzbekistan does not participate in military-political blocs, foreign military bases are not allowed on its soil, and it does not engage in peacekeeping operations abroad. After the mid-2005 events in Andijon, Uzbekistan shifted to closer ties with Russia and China. In 2001, Uzbekistan joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and in 2003 insisted on hosting its Regional Anti-Terrorism Center. President Karimov signed a declaration on strategic partnership with China in 2012. Uzbekistan has ongoing tensions with other Central Asian states over border issues. Tajikistan's relations with Uzbekistan have been strained due to disagreements over water-sharing, gas supplies, border issues, and environmental pollution. Uzbek security forces were accused of bombing the Tajik Supreme Court in 2008. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have tense relations over Caspian Sea resources and regional influence. Uzbekistan has also been at odds with Turkmenistan over water-sharing and accusations of conspiring to overthrow the Turkmen government. The Kyrgyz premier denied claims by Uzbekistan's president in 2005 and 2009, leading to strained relations. After a coup in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, Uzbekistan tightened border controls, causing economic harm. Conflict between ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in 2010 resulted in refugees fleeing to Uzbekistan. Border guards exchanged gunfire in 2012, killing one guard on each side. In 2013, there was gunfire at a Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border post, resulting in casualties on both sides. This led to border restrictions by Uzbekistan. Additionally, conflicts between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in the Sokh enclave escalated, with hostages taken and roads closed. In July 2013, Kyrgyzstan started building a fence around the Sokh enclave, and there were reports of Kyrgyz guards killing Uzbek guards in another border incident. President Karimov had some diplomatic engagements with other Central Asian leaders in 2012. In early September 2012, President Karimov visited Kazakhstan for a bilateral summit with President Nazarbayev. The two leaders aimed to enhance region-wide integration, address security threats like terrorism, and strengthen trade ties. They signed a strategic partnership treaty in mid-June 2013, emphasizing the importance of constant bilateral consultations to address the drawdown of ISAF operations in Afghanistan and promote economic development. Both leaders highlighted the economic complementarity of their countries. President Karimov of Uzbekistan and President Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan emphasized economic complementarity and peaceful resolution of regional water issues during their meetings. Karimov expressed concerns about the construction of dams due to earthquake risks and rejected the idea of trading water as a commodity. Relations between the two countries have improved, with discussions on boosting trade and cooperation. They also called for region-wide talks before Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan proceed with dam construction that could impact water-sharing. Karimov invited Berdimuhamedow for further discussions on joint projects. President Karimov of Uzbekistan invited President Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan to discuss joint projects, including ties with post-Taliban Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has developed a railway linking Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan as part of the Northern Distribution Network. Karimov has advocated for U.N.-sponsored \"6+3\" Afghan peace talks involving regional and outside powers. The United States has emphasized Afghan-led reconciliation efforts. The Uzbek armed forces are the largest in the region, with about 24,500 ground force troops, 7,500 air force troops, and 16,000 joint troops. They also have internal security and national guard troops. Uzbekistan spent about 3.1% of its GDP on defense in 2011. Their military doctrine emphasizes no territorial claims on other states and nuclear non-proliferation. Uzbekistan's military doctrine emphasizes no territorial claims on other states and nuclear non-proliferation. President Karimov opposes military hazing and supports social support for troops. Military cooperation with Russia is ensured through various treaties, including a Treaty of Alliance for mutual consultations in case of security threats. Uzbekistan rejoined the CSTO in 2006 but declined to participate in rapid reaction forces due to concerns about involvement in CIS disputes. Uzbekistan suspended its membership in the CSTO in 2012 due to disagreements over intervention procedures and hosting foreign military bases. Despite this, the country continued to participate in the CIS air defense system and other military affairs. Uzbekistan withdrew from the CSTO in 2012 due to disagreements over intervention procedures and foreign military bases. President Putin's visit in June 2012 led to a strategic partnership agreement with Uzbekistan, followed by similar agreements with China and Kazakhstan. These partnerships were seen as alternatives to the CSTO for cooperation in Central Asia as ISAF reduced its presence in Afghanistan. President Karimov expressed concerns about the ongoing war in Afghanistan in May 2013. The cruel war in Afghanistan has been ongoing for over 30 years, and conflicts are expected to intensify once ISAF leaves. Terrorism, drug addiction, drug trafficking, and religious and ethnic conflicts will escalate. Tension is likely to increase in Central Asian countries as the issue of Afghanistan remains unresolved. Uzbek officers have been observers at SCO military exercises, but Uzbek troops have not participated. In 1999, six bomb blasts in Tashkent killed 16-28 people and wounded 100-351. In 1999, six bomb blasts in Tashkent killed 16-28 people and wounded 100-351. Uzbek President Karimov labeled it an assassination attempt, blaming exiled Erk Party leader Solikh, Taliban, and IMU leaders Yuldashev and Namanganiy. Security threats included an invasion of Kyrgyzstan by IMU guerrillas aiming to create an Islamic state. They were expelled with Uzbek aid. In 2000, more guerrillas invaded Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan but were expelled by late October. In late March-early April 2004, a series of bombings and armed attacks in Uzbekistan killed 47 individuals. President Karimov stated that the attacks aimed to create panic and distrust in the government. The Islamic Jihad Union of Uzbekistan (IJU) claimed responsibility, with suspected terrorists revealing links to various extremist groups. Explosions occurred during a trial in mid-2004. The Taliban, Uighur extremists, and Al Qaeda were involved in attacks in Uzbekistan. Explosions occurred at the U.S. and Israeli embassies and the Uzbek Prosecutor-General's Office in Tashkent. The IMU and IJU claimed responsibility for the attacks. In May 2009, there were more attacks in Khanabad and Andijon, with deaths and injuries reported. President Karimov visited Andijon in response. Shootings in Tashkent in August 2009 resulted in the deaths of alleged IMU members. The Uzbek government blamed the group for past attacks and assassinations. The IMU, aided by the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, is designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department for actively threatening U.S. interests and attacking American citizens. The group's main goal is to topple the current government in Uzbekistan, linked to bombings and attacks in 1999-2000. IMU forces suffered losses in Afghanistan, and former CIA Director Porter Goss warned of their threat to U.S. interests. In 2005, the IJG/IJU was also designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. In June 2008, IJG head Jalolov and his associate Suhayl Fatilloevich Buranov were added to the U.N. 1267 Sanctions Committee's Consolidated List for their association with bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the Taliban. The U.S. Treasury Department froze their assets and prohibited financial dealings with them. IMU head Yuldashev was reportedly killed in 2009, followed by Jalalov. Yuldashev's deputy, Abu Usmon Odil, took over as IMU head. An Uzbek citizen was arrested in 2011 for plotting to assassinate President Obama under the direction of IMU terrorists. In 2012, an ethnic Uzbek was sentenced for collaborating with the IJU. Another Uzbek refugee was arrested in the US for planning to join IJU terrorists. In 2013, an ethnic Uzbek in Idaho was arrested for supporting the IMU. In 2005, Uzbek troops fired on demonstrators in Andijon, leading to civilian casualties. In May 2005, after Uzbek troops fired on demonstrators in Andijon, leading to civilian casualties, President Karimov restored order. In July 2005, 439 Uzbek refugees in Kyrgyzstan were airlifted to Romania for resettlement processing due to concerns of torture if returned. The international community called for an inquiry into the events, leading to visa bans and arms embargoes on Uzbek officials in November 2005. In October 2007 and April 2008, the EU Council suspended the visa ban for six months but kept the arms embargo. In October 2008, the visa ban was lifted due to positive human rights trends in Uzbekistan, while the arms embargo remained. In October 2009, the arms embargo was lifted. The trial of 15 individuals involved in the Andijon unrest revealed their affiliation with Akramiya, a branch of Hizb ut-Tahrira, receiving support from IMU for arms training. The defendants claimed financial aid and arms training from the IMU, alleging U.S. and Kyrgyz government involvement in their effort to overthrow the government. The trial resulted in the arrest and sentencing of over 100 individuals, including Uzbek opposition party members and media and NGO representatives. The U.S. Congress tightened conditions on aid to Uzbekistan in response, despite Uzbekistan's regional support for Afghanistan. Uzbekistan plays a central role in the NDN, aiding Afghanistan and addressing human rights concerns, including forced labor and religious freedom issues. The U.S. hopes for reforms in currency laws and corruption to increase investment, as well as promoting scientific and educational exchanges. During President Karimov's March 2002 U.S. visit, a Declaration on Strategic Partnership and Cooperation was signed between Uzbekistan and the United States, setting broad-scale goals for political, economic, security, and humanitarian cooperation. The accord pledged urgent consultations in the case of external security threats to Uzbekistan and committed Uzbekistan to intensify democratic transformation and protect human rights. Relations were strained in 2005 after the U.S. criticized Uzbekistan's crackdown in Andijon, leading to the closure of U.S.-based NGOs. The closure of U.S.-based or U.S.-supported NGOs in Uzbekistan, termination of U.S. basing rights at Karshi-Khanabad, and strained relations in 2005 led to a fall-off in official contacts. However, U.S.-Uzbek relations have improved recently, with Assistant Secretary Blake proposing high-level annual consultations to strengthen ties across various areas. The first Annual Bilateral Consultation (ABC) in late December 2009 involved a U.S. visit by an Uzbek delegation led by Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov. The two sides planned increased cooperation for 2010 in diplomatic visits, military-to-military contacts, and investment/trade. Assistant Secretary Blake testified in November 2010 about the Obama Administration's engagement with Uzbekistan on security, economic, and human rights issues, highlighting Uzbekistan's role as a key partner in regional security efforts in Afghanistan. Challenges remain, with continued encouragement for Uzbek authorities to address human rights concerns. During her December 2010 visit to Uzbekistan, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of an improved bilateral relationship with Uzbekistan. She thanked President Islam Karimov for Uzbekistan's support for the Northern Distribution Network and other assistance to Afghanistan. Human rights issues were also discussed, and a bilateral science and technology cooperation agreement was signed to promote positive cooperation between the two countries. The second U.S.-Uzbek ABC in February 2011 focused on security cooperation, trade, development, science and technology, counter-narcotics, and civil society development. During her visit to Uzbekistan, Secretary Clinton discussed trade ties and the U.S. \"New Silk Road Vision\" to turn Afghanistan into a regional hub. President Obama thanked President Karimov for cooperation in Afghanistan and urged facilitation of cargo transit. Secretary Clinton also warned about restrictions on religious freedom during her visit to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. During a congressional delegation visit to Uzbekistan in July 2012, President Karimov called for closer ties with the U.S. The third ABC in August 2012 covered various topics including support for U.S. operations in Afghanistan, energy, agriculture, health, and human rights. Assistant Secretary Blake raised concerns about currency convertibility and contract sanctity at a U.S.-Uzbek business forum. Due to Uzbekistan's poor human rights record, the U.S. only provided non-lethal security assistance. In mid-July 2013, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jane Zimmerman visited Uzbekistan to discuss human rights issues, while Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce Matthew Murray visited in May to discuss trade and investment. Assistant Secretary Blake visited Uzbekistan in late April 2013, addressing human trafficking and civil society problems. Discussions also included providing Uzbekistan with excess defense articles from Afghanistan and U.S. concerns about currency convertibility and repatriation. In April 2013, Assistant Secretary of State Mike Hammer visited Uzbekistan to discuss U.S. concerns about freedom of the press and praise Uzbek open government initiatives. Secretary Kerry met with Uzbek Foreign Minister Kamilov in March 2013, stating that U.S.-Uzbek relations were improving. In February 2013, a Congressional delegation headed by Representative Dana Rohrabacher visited Uzbekistan. The cumulative U.S. assistance budgeted for Uzbekistan from FY1992-FY2010 was $971.36 million, with a significant portion allocated for combating weapons of mass destruction and other security measures. In FY2011 and FY2012, budgeted assistance for Uzbekistan was $11.34 million and $16.7 million respectively. The Administration has requested $11.6 million for FY2014. The main priorities for U.S. assistance in FY2014 include technical advice for Uzbekistan's WTO accession and support for local NGOs and independent media. In FY2003, Congress prohibited assistance to Uzbekistan unless human rights commitments were met. Aid was withheld in FY2004 due to lack of progress on democratic reforms. In FY2008, a provision blocked Uzbek officials from entering the US for human rights violations. In late 2009, Congress allowed assistance for national security reasons to acquire supplies for U.S. and NATO operations in Afghanistan. In 2010, an expanded IMET program was approved for training Uzbek military officers on human rights and democracy. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2012 allows the Secretary of State to waive assistance conditions for national security reasons until September 30, 2013, to facilitate U.S. access to Afghanistan. The law requires a waiver for aid to Uzbekistan, assessing democratization progress and preventing corruption. The State Department issued waivers for assistance, citing human rights concerns. Foreign Military Financing was provided for FY2012 and requested for FY2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2013 continues assistance under previous conditions. In FY2012, Uzbekistan cooperated with the United States on anti-terrorism efforts, allowing the use of the Khanabad airbase for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The U.S. provided security assurances, military aid, and killed terrorists from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) was involved in terrorist activities in Uzbekistan. The United States operated a base in Uzbekistan but ceased operations in 2005 due to strained relations. Germany has a small airbase in Termez, paying for basing privileges. In 2008, Uzbekistan allowed U.S. military personnel to transit through the Termez airbase on a case-by-case basis. President Karimov attended the NATO Summit in Bucharest in April 2008 and expressed Uzbekistan's willingness to discuss transit of non-lethal goods by NATO through Uzbekistan to Afghanistan. Following visits by US officials, Uzbekistan began facilitating transit of US non-lethal supplies to Afghanistan in 2009. The first rail shipment entered Afghanistan in March 2009 after transiting Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. In May 2009, President Karimov announced permission for the US and NATO to use the Navoi airport. In 2009, the United States and NATO were allowed to use the Navoi airport in Uzbekistan for receiving non-lethal supplies for Afghanistan. General Petraeus visited in August 2009 and signed an accord for military exchanges and training. Uzbekistan also permitted military overflights carrying weapons to Afghanistan. President Karimov praised the visit as a sign of developing relations. In November 2010, U.S. Central Command Commander James Mattis signed a military cooperation accord with the Uzbek Minister of Defense. In 2011, there were various high-level meetings between US officials and Uzbekistan, including a military cooperation accord signed with the Uzbek Minister of Defense and discussions on assistance to Afghanistan. DEA training courses and cooperation efforts were also discussed in visits by US officials in 2012. In late March 2012, USCENTCOM Commander Mattis visited Uzbekistan to sign a military air transit accord for cargo and personnel from Afghanistan. NATO Secretary General announced agreements for land transit from Afghanistan with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan in June 2012. Deputy Secretary Bill Burns and National Security Council's Senior Director Alice Wells visited Uzbekistan to discuss security issues and civil society representation. USTRANSCOM Commander William Fraser visited in October 2012 to discuss NDN-related issues. In October 2012, Commander William Fraser visited Uzbekistan to discuss NDN-related issues. New USCENTCOM Commander Lloyd Austin visited in July 2013. Challenges with corruption and bureaucracy in Uzbekistan have hindered the use of NDN routes for shipping fuel to ISAF in Afghanistan. Only a small percentage of ISAF material is currently being transported along the NDN due to various reasons such as difficult terrain in northern Afghanistan, military operations in eastern Afghanistan, and restrictions by NDN transit states."
