    "content": "The \"Civic Participation Act of 2000\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress makes findings regarding the right to vote, emphasizing its importance in citizenship and reintegration of offenders. It asserts that the right to vote should not be denied based on race, color, gender, or previous servitude. Congress has supervisory power over Federal elections and must ensure state laws align with the Constitution. Currently, laws vary across the nation regarding voting rights for individuals with felony convictions, leading to discrepancies in Federal elections. Approximately 3.9 million adults in the US, including 500,000 women, are unable to vote due to felony convictions. State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately affect ethnic minorities, with 14 states disenfranchising ex-offenders even after completing their sentences. While the right to vote can technically be restored in these states, it is often difficult in practice. In some states, ex-offenders need a pardon from the Governor or action from the parole board to regain voting rights. Federal offenders face additional barriers, with only a Presidential pardon as a method to restore voting rights. Many lack the resources needed to succeed in restoring their right to vote. Thirteen percent of African-American adult males, or 1,400,000 men, are disenfranchised, with 3 in 10 expected to be disenfranchised in the next generation. Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately affected. Congress should address these discrepancies for fairness and equal protection. The purpose of the Act is to restore voting rights to ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. The Act aims to restore voting rights to ex-offenders who have served their sentences. The Act defines \"correctional institution or facility\" as a place for convicted individuals and \"election\" as various types of voting events. The Act defines \"election\" as various types of voting events, including a primary election for the nomination of persons for federal office such as President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner. It also defines terms like \"parole\" and \"probation\" in the context of court-imposed conditions. The Act defines \"election\" as different types of voting events, including primary elections for federal office. It also explains terms like \"parole\" and \"probation\" in court-imposed conditions, which may involve the individual paying damages, periodic reporting, or supervision by a court officer. Rights of citizens to vote in federal elections shall not be denied due to a criminal offense, except if the individual is serving a felony sentence or on parole/probation for a felony offense. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals affected by violations can notify the state election official and file a civil lawsuit if the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. Individuals affected by violations of the Act can file a civil lawsuit to obtain relief, especially if the violation occurs within 30 days before a federal election. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prohibit states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act are in addition to those under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993."
