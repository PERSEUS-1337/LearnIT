    "content": "President Ollanta Humala, of the left-wing Peruvian Nationalist party (PNP) and the Gana Peru coalition, is in the last year of his five-year term. President-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is set to take office on July 28 for a five-year term, as Humala is constitutionally barred from running for reelection. The elections in Peru were contentious due to two candidates being ruled ineligible just weeks before the elections. Humala's administration has seen accomplishments in poverty reduction and education improvements, but also faced challenges with frequent Cabinet changes and corruption scandals. President Ollanta Humala's administration has been marked by frequent Cabinet changes and corruption scandals. He appointed seven prime ministers in less than five years, with one being censured by congress for alleged spying on political opposition members. Humala is under investigation for allegedly receiving $3 million in bribes related to Petrobras contracts in Peru. The Peruvian public is disillusioned with the political class, as seen in the 2014 elections where over 100 candidates had ties to drug-trafficking cases. In October 2014, over 100 candidates in the 2014 elections were linked to drug-trafficking cases, with some winning. Five elected officials are under investigation for corruption and money laundering. President Humala's close associates are involved in corruption scandals. First Lady Nadine Heredia is being investigated for ties to a former adviser facing trial for espionage and money laundering. Humala's approval ratings are low due to scandals and economic issues. Heredia faces fraud charges for denying ownership of diaries related to Humala's campaign. She leads the PNP party and both Heredia and Humala considered changing electoral laws to allow her to run for president. The PNP withdrew its presidential candidate before the 2016 election due to low polling numbers. Parties must obtain 5% of the vote to remain registered, but can skip one election. President Humala's party has been losing members as he promotes more orthodox policies. Elections for the presidency and congress took place on April 10, 2016, with controversy arising from disqualifications of leading candidates just before voting. Peru's Special Elections Board disqualified presidential candidates Julio Guzm\u00e1n and Cesar Acu\u00f1a just before the 2016 election for technical irregularities and violating electoral laws. Guzm\u00e1n, a centrist economist, and Acu\u00f1a, from the Alliance for Progress party, were seen as outsiders and their disqualifications fueled anger against the political establishment. The public anger against the political establishment was fueled by the disqualification of outsider candidates Julio Guzm\u00e1n and Cesar Acu\u00f1a before the 2016 election. In the run-off election, Keiko Fujimori, daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori, faced Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Fujimori, a member of the conservative Fuerza Popular party, was protested against due to her association with her father's legacy. Fujimori was expected to take a hard-line approach to security issues and is under investigation for links to drug-related activities. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former prime minister and economy minister, is being investigated for links with drug traffickers. He is known for his orthodox economic views and appeals to the business sector. Kuczynski's past involvement with multinational mining companies raised concerns about favoring big business interests. Public suspicion arose when complaints were made against him for allegedly giving gifts to supporters. The disqualifications of Guzm\u00e1n and Acu\u00f1a were seen as politically motivated, especially after Keiko Fujimori was cleared of campaign corruption allegations. This raised concerns about inconsistent application of electoral law and possible corruption in electoral institutions. Other candidates under investigation include former presidents Alan Garc\u00eda and Alejandro Toledo, who claim the investigations are politically driven. Garc\u00eda is being investigated for illicit enrichment and a payment-for-pardons case, while Toledo has been indicted for money-related charges. Toledo indicted for money laundering in real estate deal. Polls before April elections showed Kuczynski would win by narrow margin against Fujimori. Acu\u00f1a endorsed Kuczynski after disqualification. Mendoza also supported Kuczynski, potentially gaining rural votes. Kuczynski will need to negotiate with Fujimori's Popular Force party, which holds majority in congress. Keiko Fujimori faces challenges to her leadership after losing presidential bid twice. Her brother, Kenji, won a seat in congress with most votes. President-elect Kuczynski aims to work with left and Fujimori's party for consensus on legislative agenda. He may offer compromise on fate of former president Alberto Fujimori to gain Fujimoristas' support. President-elect Kuczynski prioritizes economic reforms and social services, aiming for consensus on a program called \"popular capitalism.\" Peru's economy has shown strong growth since 2001, with fluctuations but a predicted average growth of 4.7% from 2017 to 2018. However, the current El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern may negatively impact economic growth in 2016 due to floods and landslides. The heavy rains in Peru have caused floods, landslides, and economic damage, including oil spills. The state of emergency was declared after a spill from the Petroper\u00fa pipeline. President Humala aims to address economic disparities and social exclusion in the country. Political stability in Peru is undermined by deep social divides over development strategies. The political stability in Peru is undermined by deep social divides over development strategies. President-elect Kuczynski is expected to promote orthodox market-friendly economic policies, including lowering the sales tax and reducing red tape for small businesses. He also plans to address poverty by raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing women equal pay. President-elect Kuczynski in Peru plans to address poverty by raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing women equal pay. Social unrest and disputes over mining projects, particularly concerning indigenous rights, have been ongoing challenges for the government. Despite a prior-consultation law, mining projects have proceeded without clear consultation processes, leading to violent protests and political difficulties for President Humala. In 2016, protests erupted in Peru over pollution from new oil spills in the Amazon region, affecting indigenous communities and thousands of people. The government declared a \"water quality emergency\" and promised a cleanup, but criticism arose over the slow response. Indigenous and human rights groups demand repair of damaged pipelines and compensation for affected communities. President-elect Kuczynski is expected to continue Peru's economic development policies focused on mining and extractive industries. Fujimori would have taken a hard line against local community opposition, potentially leading to more protests. Left-wing candidate Ver\u00f3nika Mendoza's party may form an anti-mining coalition in congress. Poverty levels in Peru have been decreasing for over a decade. Poverty levels in Peru have been decreasing for over a decade, with rates cut by half between 2005 and 2014. Extreme poverty has also significantly decreased, particularly in rural areas. Income inequality has decreased, but remains high overall. President-elect Kuczynski plans to address poverty by increasing the minimum wage and implementing other measures. President-elect Kuczynski aims to reduce poverty in Peru by raising the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay for women. He emphasizes the importance of providing basic necessities like water and education for a successful market-oriented economy. Peru has lower crime rates compared to other Latin American countries, with a low murder rate but a high incidence of robberies. Despite occasional violent demonstrations in mining areas, the government has been reported to not commit arbitrary or unlawful killings, although incidents like the police killing three people during a protest at a copper mine have been noted. The regional prosecutor investigated incidents at the Las Bambas copper mine where 26 people were injured during a protest in September 2015. The Shining Path terrorist insurgency operates in the central-southern Valley of the Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM), relying on cocaine trafficking for funding. The group's strength has decreased since the late 1980s and early 1990s, posing a major security threat only within the VRAEM region. According to the State Department's human rights report for 2015, the Shining Path carried out various abuses, including killings and forced recruitment of child soldiers. Despite insurgency attacks, Peruvian military forces regained control of areas in the valley previously held by the Shining Path. Gas and mining firms in the VRAEM face threats of extortion and kidnapping. President-elect Kuczynski plans to combat corruption and crime through judicial reform and improving the police force. Peru, a developing country heavily reliant on natural resources, has a significant poverty rate and is vulnerable to climate change. Peru is highly vulnerable to climate change, with seven out of nine identified characteristics. The country faces obstacles such as low coastal areas, natural disasters, and pollution in urban areas. A joint study predicts that the fishing, agriculture, and high Andes livestock sectors will be most affected by climate change in Peru. The study predicts that Peru's high Andes livestock sector will suffer significant economic losses by 2100 due to climate change. Other sectors like hydroelectric power, mining, tourism, health, and infrastructure could also be negatively impacted. Proper strategies and policies for adaptation are crucial to counter these effects. Peru has been actively involved in climate change negotiations and signed the Paris Agreement in 2016. Peru ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from the \"business as usual\" scenario. They aim to achieve zero emissions from land use by 2030 and have implemented various climate change policies, including a National Energy Policy supporting wind and solar development. Peru is also working on a national adaptation plan for climate change. In January 2016, Peru reported its first case of the Zika virus, brought in by a man from Venezuela. Peru reported its seventh case of the Zika virus on April 16, with the first local transmission occurring through sexual contact. The Health Ministry plans to control infection rates using measures similar to those used for mosquito-borne diseases. Condoms and information pamphlets are being distributed to prevent sexual transmission of Zika, especially among travelers arriving from Zika-infected countries. The current El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern has caused above-average rainfall and flooding in the country. The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern in Peru has caused above-average rainfall and flooding, increasing the risk of mosquito-borne diseases like Zika. The United States and Peru have a strong relationship, cooperating on various issues including democratic institutions, human rights, environmental protection, and trade relations. President Humala met with President Obama in 2013 to discuss these matters. During the meeting, President Humala and President Obama discussed U.S. support for Peru's agenda of social inclusion, economic growth, and citizen security. They also talked about joint efforts on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, education, energy, climate change, science, and bilateral trade. President Humala was in the U.S. to launch partnerships with universities. The U.S. State Department congratulated President-elect Kuczynski and expressed interest in enhancing bilateral relations. U.S. assistance to Peru aims to combat organized crime and improve citizen security. Foreign assistance for Peru has been declining since FY2010, with funding decreasing from almost $120 million to $84 million in FY2015. The Obama Administration requested $96 million for Peru in FY2016 and $81 million in FY2017, with allocations for Development Assistance, Economic Support Funds, Foreign Military Financing, International Military Education and Training, and International Narcotics Control. Peru receives foreign assistance for various purposes, including efforts to combat the flow of illegal drugs, particularly cocaine. The country is a major producer of coca and cocaine, along with Colombia. Peru also imports precursor chemicals for cocaine production and has reported issues with money laundering. Peru's national police reported money-laundering transactions linked to narcotics trafficking amounting to $250 million in 2015. The cultivation of coca and cocaine production in Peru has led to social problems such as domestic drug consumption, environmental damage, and corruption. U.S. counternarcotics programs in Peru focus on eradication, interdiction, and alternative development, with the Peruvian government dedicating substantial resources to implementing its counternarcotics strategy. In 2015, Peru funded a significant portion of alternative development and eradication operations. Peru's congress approved a law allowing the air force to resume shooting down suspected drug trafficking airplanes, despite opposition from the United States. The joint U.S.-Peruvian aerial interdiction program was terminated 15 years ago after a tragic incident involving the accidental shooting down of a civilian plane. Peru implemented a law allowing the shoot-down of suspected drug trafficking aircraft in 2016. The policy has led traffickers to use boats and foot for smuggling. Peru's most wanted drug trafficker, Gerson Galvez, was arrested in Colombia and deported back to Peru. Peru is a source, destination, and transit country for human trafficking, according to the State Department's 2015 report. Obama Administration designated Peru as a Tier 2 country for not fully complying with anti-trafficking measures. The United States designated Peru as a Tier 2 country for not fully complying with anti-trafficking measures. Efforts to identify and assist forced labor victims in Peru were deemed inadequate. Peru and the United States have a bilateral free trade agreement and are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement will address barriers on goods, services, and agriculture, covering issues such as intellectual property rights protection, investor-state disputes, state-owned enterprises, and workers' rights. Negotiations were concluded in 2015, and Peru is expected to ratify the agreement, expanding access to new markets. The TPP may benefit Peru's agricultural sector, agribusiness, fishing, manufacturing, and clothing industries. The agreement is not expected to have a significant impact on U.S-Peruvian trade, but it may change some rules governing trade and investment. Proponents of the TPP believe it can boost regulatory reforms in Peru, provide access to new Asian markets, increase exports, diversify the economy, and support innovation and job creation. Opponents argue that Peru has violated environmental and labor commitments under previous agreements and should address these issues before approving the TPP. The U.S. and Peru have had meetings to oversee the implementation of the FTA, including discussions on labor cooperation and capacity building for labor inspections in Peru. U.S. assistance programs aim to promote inclusive economic growth in Peru. In 2015, Peru ranked 41st among U.S. import suppliers and 30th among U.S. export markets. Total trade with Peru decreased by 13.7% due to a decline in oil prices. U.S. imports from Peru totaled $5.1 billion, with major items including gold, petroleum products, vegetables, grapes, and silver. U.S. exports to Peru totaled $8.8 billion, with major items being petroleum products, cell phones, corn, data processing machines, and gas turbines. Bilateral trade between the U.S. and Peru has grown by over 50% since the FTA, with U.S. exports increasing more rapidly than imports. The United States ranks second after China in Peru's trading partners. U.S. exports to Peru increased by 78.9% between 2009 and 2015, while imports increased by 20.9%. The U.S. has become one of Peru's largest investors. The U.S. Department of Labor expressed concerns about Peru's Decree Law 22342 potentially violating labor provisions of the U.S.-Peru FTA. This was in response to a complaint filed by the International Labor Rights Forum and other groups. The OTLA report raised concerns about Peru's compliance with the U.S.-Peru FTA, specifically regarding the use of short-term contracts in nontraditional export sectors. Labor groups are calling for substantial changes to the trade promotion legislation. A debt-for-nature swap between Peru and the United States aimed to reduce Peru's U.S. debt by over $25 million in exchange for funds to protect tropical forests. The United States and Peru are working together to monitor Peru's environmental commitments under the U.S.-Peru FTA. They have agreed on an action plan to address challenges in the forestry sector, including improving timber export tracking systems. The U.S. has provided $75 million in assistance for capacity building, including developing an electronic timber-tracking system. Despite progress in combating illegal logging, challenges persist. In February 2016, the USTR requested verification from Peru regarding a timber shipment's compliance with laws. Peruvian officials, accompanied by USTR officials, conducted an accreditation process in April 2016. Peru intensified efforts against illegal logging, with a major enforcement action seizing illegal timber in April 2016. U.S. assistance also aids Peru in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The USAID and U.S. Department of Agriculture support Peru in climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, focusing on strengthening the Ministry of Environment's capacity and promoting climate-resilient development in the highlands."
