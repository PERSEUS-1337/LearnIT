Senior Level (SL) and Scientific or Professional (ST) employees in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can receive basic pay up to Level II of the Executive Schedule ($179,700), while those without certification can receive up to Level III ($165,300). SL and ST employees no longer receive locality pay. Total compensation for certified employees can be up to the Vice President's salary ($230,700) and up to EX Level I ($199,700) for non-certified agencies.
