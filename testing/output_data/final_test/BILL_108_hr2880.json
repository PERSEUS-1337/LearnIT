The Foster Care Mentoring Act of 2003 highlights the positive impact of mentors on children in foster care, including improved academic performance, goal achievement, and relationships with adults. It also mentions the high number of young children in the foster care system in 2001. Children United Nations has been effective in recruiting mentors for foster care children, with as many as 3,000 children being matched with mentors on the International Day of the Child. States, like California, should incorporate mentor programs into their foster care services, with half a million mentors already matched with needy children. These mentor programs are unique and require specialized training and support to maintain long-term relationships for children in care, offering a cost-effective approach to addressing social issues.
