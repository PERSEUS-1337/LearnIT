The \"Community Protection and Hazardous Fuels Reduction Act of 1997\" includes provisions for the management of wildland/urban interface areas, fire danger reduction, regulations, and authorization of appropriations. The Congress acknowledges the significant challenges faced in managing Federal lands, including cyclical variations in fire suppression policies and timber harvesting levels. Forests on Federal lands are currently experiencing disease epidemics and insect infestations, leading to a hazardous fuels buildup that poses a threat of catastrophic wildfires, especially in areas near communities. The prevention of catastrophic wildfires in these high-risk areas is crucial. Wildfire threats in wildland/urban interface areas near communities on non-Federal lands require aggressive management to eliminate hazardous fuel buildup and reduce the risk of destruction to human life, property, water supplies, wildlife habitat, and air quality. The highest priority must be given to protecting human life and property. The purpose of this Act is to provide new authority to protect noncommodity resources in wildland/urban interface areas on Federal lands, including riparian zones and wildlife habitats, by addressing the backlog of unfunded forest management projects. Congress must provide innovative tools to reduce hazardous fuels buildup and undertake forest management projects at least cost during a period of fiscal austerity. The Act aims to give new authority to the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to protect communities from catastrophic wildfires and carry out forest management projects in wildland/urban interface areas on Federal lands. The Act aims to give new authority to the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to protect communities from catastrophic wildfires and carry out forest management projects in wildland/urban interface areas on Federal lands. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal lands\" as lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Secretary of Agriculture, \"forest management project\" as projects aimed at protecting noncommodity resources on Federal lands, and \"land management plan\" as plans for Federal lands. The Act defines \"Federal lands\" as lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Secretary of Agriculture. It specifies that for Federal lands described in paragraph (1)(A), a land use plan prepared by the Bureau of Land Management is required, and for lands described in paragraph (1)(B), a land and resource management plan prepared by the Forest Service is necessary. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the relevant Secretary overseeing the Federal lands. The term \"wildland/urban interface area\" refers to Federal land near communities. The term \"congressional committees\" includes specific House and Senate committees. The term \"hazardous fuels buildup\" is also defined in the Act. The term \"hazardous fuels buildup\" refers to an accumulation of forage, woody debris, and dead timber with the potential to ignite. SEC. 101. IDENTIFICATION OF WILDLAND/URBAN INTERFACE AREAS. Annual Identification: District Managers of the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Supervisors of the Forest Service must identify wildland/urban interface areas on Federal lands with hazardous fuels buildups and forest management needs. This identification process is not considered agency action. The identification process of wildland/urban interface areas with hazardous fuels buildups on Federal lands is not considered agency action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Contracting to reduce hazardous fuels and undertake forest management projects in wildland/urban interface areas is addressed in Section 102. The Secretary concerned is authorized to enter into contracts for the sale of forest products in a wildland/urban interface area to reduce hazardous fuels buildup. The purchaser may be required to undertake forest management projects in the area as a condition of the sale. The Secretary can authorize contracts for the sale of forest products in a wildland/urban interface area to reduce hazardous fuels buildup. Forest management projects may be required as part of the sale contract, with financing accomplished through forest management credits issued to the purchaser. Forest management credits offset the cost of required projects for purchasers of forest products. Appropriated funds can be used to assist with projects if they directly benefit from the sale and are available in the annual budget. Assistance amounts are specified in the sale prospectus. Prior to a sale authorized by subsection (a), the Secretary determines forest management credits for each project. These credits can be transferred to another sale if the purchaser holds unused credits and buys the subsequent sale. The subsequent sale must be purchased by the same purchaser, and the sale parcel must be located on Federal lands under the Secretary's jurisdiction. Forest management credits earned by purchasers on Bureau of Land Management lands are considered money received for distribution purposes. In the case of Federal lands described in section 3(1)(B), all amounts earned by purchasers in the form of forest management credits are considered money received for distribution purposes. Sales authorized for safety and environmental protection reasons may proceed even if costs exceed revenues. The text chunk discusses that revenues from sales of forest products on Federal lands will not be included in revenue calculations for the forest products sales program. It also states that the procedures for sales of forest products authorized by law, including the small business set-aside program, will not be altered. SEC. 103. The Secretary will monitor contracts and forest management projects to assess their effectiveness in achieving the Act's purpose. SEC. 104. Reporting requirements will be enforced. The Secretary must submit an annual report to congressional committees within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. The report should include a list of wildland/urban interface areas identified, a summary of contracts and forest management projects, and a discussion of any delays encountered in preparing and offering sales. The Secretary must submit an annual report to congressional committees within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, including details on contracts, forest management projects, and any delays. The fourth report should assess the need for reauthorization of contracting authority and provide recommendations if necessary. The Secretary may make changes to contracting authority as needed to better achieve the purpose of the Act. SEC. 105. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY. The authority to offer sales of forest products and require forest management projects will end after five fiscal years from the enactment of the Act. Existing sales contracts will continue as per their terms. Unused forest management credits will expire if not used before the termination date. Unused forest management credits may be used in future sales of forest products authorized by another law and conducted by the relevant Secretary. TITLE II--FIRE DANGER REDUCTION BY REMOVAL OF GRASSES AND FORBS\n\nSEC. 201. REMOVAL OF EXCESS LEVELS OF GRASSES AND FORBS. Title II of the document focuses on reducing fire danger by removing excess levels of grasses and forbs in wildland/urban interface areas. County commissions or local governments can request the removal of excessive vegetation on Federal lands to prevent fire hazards. Contracts can be made with livestock operators for grazing or other parties for mechanical removal methods. Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of this section. Title III of the document covers miscellaneous provisions. It includes a requirement for the Secretary concerned to create necessary regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there is an authorization of appropriations for the first five fiscal years to support the implementation of the Act."
