    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3513 of the Government Code is amended to define \"employee organization\" as any group representing state employees and \"recognized employee organization\" as one acknowledged as the exclusive representative of employees in a specific unit. The definition of \"State employee\" includes civil service employees of the state and teaching staff of schools under the State Department of Education. It excludes certain managerial, confidential, and supervisory employees, among others. Employees covered under the definition of \"State employee\" include those from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Office of the State Chief Information Officer, and intermittent athletic inspectors from the State Athletic Commission. The definitions of \"mediation,\" \"managerial employee,\" and \"confidential employee\" are provided in Section 3522.5. Mediation involves a third party assisting in resolving disputes between a public agency and employee organizations. Managerial employees have significant roles in policy formulation, while confidential employees handle confidential information related to employer-employee relations. The \"Supervisory employee\" is defined as an individual with authority over other employees, while the \"Board\" refers to the Public Employment Relations Board. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of \"maintenance of membership\" for employees in a recognized employee organization, outlining the conditions for remaining a member. It also defines \"State employer\" for bargaining purposes. The curr_chunk introduces the definition of \"fair share fee\" as a deduction from the salary of a state employee who does not join the recognized employee organization. It also includes the addition of Section 3522.5 to the Government Code, applying the chapter to the Judicial Council and its employees. The curr_chunk defines \"state employee\" for the Judicial Council, excludes certain employees, and clarifies the roles of the Administrative Director of the Courts and the Chairperson of the Judicial Council. The Judicial Council and its employees are exempt from certain sections. The board cannot include Judicial Council employees in bargaining units with other employees. The Judicial Council has the authority to designate excluded positions, not exceeding one third of total positions, without board review."
