    "title": "AB 1690",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 87482.3 of the Education Code requires community college districts without a collective bargaining agreement with part-time, temporary faculty to negotiate terms and conditions with the exclusive representatives. This negotiation process is intended to include the adoption of provisions in compliance with subdivision (b) as part of the usual negotiations. A community college district must meet minimum standards through negotiations with the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty. Starting January 1, 2017, districts with collective bargaining agreements must evaluate part-time faculty according to Section 87663 upon initial hire and thereafter. After six semesters or nine quarters of service, part-time, temporary faculty members with satisfactory evaluations will be placed on a seniority list for each assignment at each college. Seniority is based on the first date of hire at the college and lists are determined by campus unless negotiated otherwise. For semester seven or quarter 10 and beyond, community colleges aim to maintain the workload of part-time, temporary faculty members based on their assignments in semester six or quarter nine. New assignments are offered based on seniority to qualified faculty members, up to a maximum load of 60 to 67 percent of a full-time equivalent load. In cases of assignment reduction, part-time, temporary faculty members are first reduced based on qualifications and then in reverse seniority order. Rights to workload equivalent are maintained for 18 months. New assignments add to seniority list. Procedures for refusal or rejection of assignments, loss of seniority rights, and additional leave provisions are negotiated locally between the community college district and the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty. If a part-time, temporary faculty member receives a less-than-satisfactory evaluation, they will be given a written plan of remediation and evaluated again the following semester. If the subsequent evaluation is also unsatisfactory, the faculty member will lose all seniority rights and may be dismissed. Appeal and grievance rights are subject to local collective bargaining. (F) Part-time faculty assignments are temporary, contingent on enrollment and funding, with no guarantee of continued employment. Community college districts with specific provisions in collective bargaining agreements may be exempt from certain requirements for part-time faculty assignments and evaluations. A written agreement confirming the implementation of evaluation processes and due process for termination of part-time, temporary faculty must be included in collective bargaining agreements. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement for any state-mandated costs."
