    "content": "According to a 2019 study, 2 million Americans lack access to running water, indoor plumbing, or wastewater services, with many of these communities in rural areas or on tribal lands. Congress has authorized projects through federal agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation to address rural water supply needs since 1980. Reclamation, established in 1902, manages 491 dams and 338 reservoirs storing 140 million acre-feet of water for irrigation in arid western states. Reclamation-funded water projects deliver 10 trillion gallons of water annually for various purposes. Congress authorized Reclamation to design and construct rural water supply projects in western states from 1980 to 2009, benefiting tribal reservations and nontribal rural communities with water supply challenges. The Rural Water Supply Program, established in 2006, provides federal funding for rural water projects, with varying cost shares for tribal and nontribal communities. The program aims to address water supply challenges in rural areas by replacing the previous process of project development. The Rural Water Supply Program, established in 2006, aimed to address water supply challenges in rural areas by recommending projects through appraisal investigations and feasibility studies. However, Congress did not authorize any projects for construction through this process, and the program expired in 2016. Reclamation continues to construct rural water projects authorized outside of the program. In 2012, Reclamation developed prioritization criteria for budgeting projects outside the Rural Water Supply Program, including tribal components, financial resources, urgency, and potential economic impact. Congress appropriated $145.1 million for construction at seven rural water projects in FY2020, with $1.2 billion still needed for ongoing projects. The Administration requested $30.3 million for Reclamation rural water activities in FY2021. The Administration requested $30.3 million for Reclamation rural water activities in FY2021, with $8.1 million designated for construction. The report provides an overview of completed and ongoing rural water projects under Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program. Congress has a history of funding water supply projects in rural areas for over four decades, with various projects authorized for construction. Recent legislation addresses authorizing additional projects and reauthorizing the Rural Water Supply Program. Water supply projects in rural areas have individual authorizations and focus on M&I water uses. Reclamation oversees funding and construction of these projects, including the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Supply Project. Some projects did not undergo thorough analysis before authorization. After individual authorizations, rural water projects lacked thorough analysis and review, leading to concerns about cost-effectiveness and feasibility. Reclamation was required to adhere to project specifications post-authorization, including design standards and compliance with relevant laws. The cost ceilings for rural water projects need to be indexed for inflation, resulting in rising costs. As of early 2020, $1.2 billion was needed for ongoing projects, with a FY2021 budget request of $30.3 million for construction and operation. The FY2021 budget request for rural water projects is $114.8 million less than FY2020 enacted funding. Reclamation emphasizes accepting nonfederal contributions to expedite projects. In FY2020, Reclamation funded $125.4 million in construction work at five projects. The Administration allocated $117.4 million above the President's budget request for five authorized projects in FY2020. One of these projects is the Garrison Diversion Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri-Basin Program, which provides water supply facilities in North Dakota for tribal reservations. The Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System Act of 2000 authorized rural water projects in northeastern Montana for the Fort Peck Reservation and the Dry Prairie Rural Water Authority. The project aims to provide clean water from the Missouri River to a population of around 25,000 people, including commercial users and livestock, due to poor groundwater quality in the area. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, authorized in 2000, aims to distribute treated water to over 300,000 people in southeast South Dakota, southwest Minnesota, and northwest Iowa. The project addresses water quality concerns by utilizing sand and gravel aquifers of the Missouri River near Vermillion, SD. Completed facilities have already served more than 200,000 individuals in 14 out of 20 member municipalities. The Rocky Boy's/North Central Montana Regional Water System Act of 2002 authorized a rural water system to serve the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation and surrounding communities in northern Montana. The system is designed to serve a total projected population of 43,000 by providing infrastructure to ensure compliance with federal Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. A core pipeline will provide water from Tiber Reservoir to the reservation, with non-core pipelines serving surrounding towns and rural water districts. The Eastern New Mexico Water Supply project, authorized by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, aims to deliver water from Ute Reservoir to eight member communities to reduce groundwater dependence. Current funding covers planning, design, and construction of interim projects before treated surface water is delivered. The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 authorized the Rural Water Supply Program for this purpose. The Rural Water Supply Program, authorized by the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006, directed Reclamation to conduct feasibility studies and recommend projects for construction authorization and funding. A 2008 interim final rule established operating criteria for the program, prioritizing domestic and municipal uses for rural communities with populations under 50,000. Commercial irrigation purposes were prohibited. Reclamation implemented the Rural Water Supply Program in FY2010, providing assistance for appraisal investigations and feasibility studies. Congress allocated $7.9 million for the program between FY2009 and FY2012. Reclamation studied approximately 22 projects in different regions but discontinued funding after FY2012. Reclamation implemented the Rural Water Supply Program in FY2010, providing assistance for appraisal investigations and feasibility studies for various projects in different regions. However, Reclamation did not recommend any projects for authorization, citing existing rural water construction obligations. The authority for the program expired in FY2016 and has not been renewed, but legislation has been introduced in the 116th Congress to reauthorize the program and specific projects. Since the expiration of the Rural Water Supply Program in FY2016, Reclamation has mostly halted new project study and authorization activities. Congress may consider oversight or legislative changes to Reclamation's rural water activities, including funding prioritization and project authorizations. The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 mandated the assessment of demand for new rural water projects. Reclamation estimated $5-8 billion for nontribal potable water supply needs in rural areas and $1.2 billion for tribal water projects. No new Reclamation rural water projects have been recommended or authorized since 2009. The Rural Water Supply Program authorization expired in FY2016, leaving Reclamation without a structured program for new projects. Proposed legislation in the 116th Congress includes funding for feasibility studies and construction of rural water systems. The feasibility report for the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System was completed, but the project was not recommended for authorization. Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the Rural Water Supply Program through FY2026, with proposals like the Water Justice Act and the SAVE Water Resources Act. Other legislative proposals, such as the Disadvantaged Community Drinking Water Assistance Act, aim to address rural water assistance needs in the West. The grants aim to assist 60,000 residents facing water quality issues by funding technical assistance and facility costs. Legislative proposals like the Western Water Security Act seek to address rural water needs, with estimates of over $5 billion required for nontribal rural water supply. Reclamation stated $1.2 billion is needed to complete authorized rural water projects. In the 115th Congress, stakeholders requested increased funding for Reclamation rural water projects, urging Congress to implement the Rural Water Supply Program and explore loan programs for new water infrastructure projects. Reclamation has highlighted the challenges of funding rural water projects, citing competition with other priorities like aging infrastructure and environmental compliance. Reclamation's policy is that nontribal local sponsors should reimburse 100% of costs for rural water supply projects. Despite constrained federal budgets, nonfederal sponsors can still fund projects beyond the minimum contribution. Tribes and project beneficiaries are recommended to cover O&M expenses. Congress has provided funds for rural water projects as grants, but some sponsors lack funding. Congress may consider various options to support rural water projects through Reclamation, such as providing annual appropriations or establishing mandatory funding for individually authorized projects. For example, the Authorized Rural Water Projects Completion Act in the 115th Congress proposed creating a Reclamation Rural Water Construction Account to receive $80 million annually for construction. The Disadvantaged Community Drinking Water Assistance Act (H.R. 5347) would establish a grant program for rural communities with fewer than 60,000 residents to support local water projects. Various federal entities, including USDA, EPA, HUD, and DOC, provide funding for water supply and wastewater projects through standardized programs with competitive processes. Reclamation and USACE fund water projects in specific geographic areas authorized by Congress, while other federal agencies have standardized programs for funding water projects. Reclamation fills a gap for larger, more complex rural water projects that don't qualify for other programs due to cost and regional focus. Some argue these projects could be funded through existing federal water programs, but Reclamation assists rural areas with over 10,000 residents that may not be eligible elsewhere. Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program aims to serve rural areas with over 10,000 residents that may not qualify for funding from other federal agencies. The program focuses on regional projects and coordinates efforts with other agencies to avoid duplication. Coordination activities among agencies related to ongoing authorized projects are no longer required with the expiration of the program. Before the program authorization expired in FY2016, 22 appraisal investigations were conducted, with nine recommendations for a feasibility study. Five feasibility studies were conducted, but Reclamation did not recommend any projects for construction funding. Two studies found feasible alternatives for rural water supply, and concluding reports were issued for projects not recommended for funding due to various reasons such as incomplete studies, lack of feasible alternatives, funding constraints, and program expiration. Some concluding reports were not issued due to time or resource constraints. Reclamation considered appraisal reports as concluding reports for the Rural Water Supply Program. A feasibility report for the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System was completed. Legislation in the 116th congress would authorize the Central Montana Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System."
