    "content": "The \"Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2014\" allows for the disposal of isolated National Forest System land in Georgia to be used for more efficient purposes. Proceeds from the land sale will be used by the Forest Service to acquire land for National Forest purposes in the state. The term \"Secretary\" in the Act refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary is authorized to sell or exchange rights, title, and interest of the United States in National Forest System land in Georgia. The land subject to sale or exchange consists of 30 tracts totaling approximately 3,841 acres, depicted on maps dated September 24, 2013. The maps are available for public inspection at the Office of the Forest Supervisor, Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. The Forest Supervisor of Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest can modify boundaries based on land management considerations. Land sold under this Act will be conveyed by quitclaim deed, with the Secretary able to reserve rights-of-way or other interests for management purposes. The Secretary cannot sell land for less than market value, determined by appraisal or competitive bid. Appraisal for land sales must adhere to specific standards and be approved by the Secretary. Consideration for sales must be in cash, and the Secretary can accept cash payments exceeding 25% of the land value in exchanges. The Secretary has the option to sell land through various methods, including public or private sales. The Secretary has the authority to conduct auctions or solicitations for the sale of land, and may use brokers to facilitate the process and pay commissions from the proceeds. The Secretary deposits sale proceeds in the Sisk Act fund for land acquisition in Georgia without further appropriation. Funds cannot be used to acquire land without owner consent."
