    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2016\". Congress finds that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including against Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and members of other religious groups. Discrimination based on shared ancestry, ethnic characteristics, citizenship, or residence in a country with a dominant religion is also prohibited under Title VI. The Department of Education issues Dear Colleague letters to help schools comply with Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on religion, ancestry, or ethnic characteristics. Discrimination against Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and other groups violates Title VI if based on shared ancestry or ethnic traits. The Department of Education issued Dear Colleague letters in 2004 and 2010 regarding schools' obligations under Title VI to address incidents of religious discrimination, particularly against Arab Muslim, Sikh, and Jewish students. Title VI does not cover discrimination based solely on religion, but groups facing discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics are protected. Anti-Semitism remains a persistent issue in schools and campuses, with Jewish students facing threats and harassment based on their shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Title VI protects students from any religious group that shares these characteristics, such as Muslims or Sikhs. The 2010 Dear Colleague letter emphasized the need for schools to address anti-Semitic conduct that may be disguised as anti-Israel or anti-Zionist, providing valuable tools to identify and combat discriminatory behavior. Awareness of the definition of anti-Semitism will help identify contemporary anti-Jewish conduct and assist the Department of Education in determining if an investigation under title VI is necessary. The Act defines anti-Semitism based on the Special Envoy's definition and includes examples from the Fact Sheet. It also clarifies the application of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
