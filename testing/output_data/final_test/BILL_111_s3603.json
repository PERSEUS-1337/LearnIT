The Federal Oil Spill Research Committee, established under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is composed of representatives from various federal agencies including NOAA, Coast Guard, and EPA. The Chairperson is designated by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. The Federal Oil Spill Research Committee, established under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, includes members representing NOAA. The Committee meets quarterly and coordinates oil pollution research programs among federal agencies, industry, and other entities to foster cost-effective research mechanisms. The Federal Oil Spill Research Committee, established under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, coordinates research programs on oil pollution prevention and response capabilities, including joint funding of research and reporting on the current state of knowledge and technologies. The Federal Oil Spill Research Committee coordinates national and regional research priorities for oil pollution technology development, assesses discharge response equipment, and identifies areas for improvement. The Federal Oil Spill Research Committee evaluates real-time data availability to mariners, including water level, currents, and weather predictions, to assess the risk of oil discharges and recommends necessary technological improvements. The Committee is required to submit a report to Congress every 5 years updating oil spill research information. They are also tasked with establishing a program for oil pollution research and development, focusing on new technologies to prevent, detect, respond to, and restore damage from oil discharges. The Committee is mandated to report to Congress every 5 years on oil spill research and establish a program for oil pollution research and development. This includes research on high priority areas, environmental effects of oil discharges, long-term effects, new detection technologies, and response capabilities. The Committee is required to report to Congress every 5 years on oil spill research and establish a program for oil pollution research and development. This includes research on high priority areas, environmental effects, detection technologies, response capabilities, storage capacity, oil discharge risk assessment, environmental fate prediction, restoration methods, and research/training for effective oil discharge removal. The Committee must report to Congress every 5 years on oil spill research and establish a program for oil pollution research and development. This program includes research on high priority areas, environmental effects, detection technologies, response capabilities, storage capacity, oil discharge risk assessment, environmental fate prediction, restoration methods, and research/training for effective oil discharge removal. The Committee will also submit an implementation plan to Congress within 180 days of the report submission, including an assessment by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences provides advice and guidance on the oil spill research plan and assesses its adequacy. The Under Secretary of Commerce manages a grant program for universities and research institutions to conduct the research program. The Under Secretary establishes a notification and application procedure for a grant program, may set conditions and assurances for program efficiency, and can provide grants on a matching or nonmatching basis. The Committee accepts input from various stakeholders and may establish an Advisory Council for guidance. The Committee may form partnerships with institutions of higher education, States, and other entities to facilitate research programs. The Chairperson must submit annual reports to Congress detailing activities conducted and proposed under this section. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these activities. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary of Commerce to carry out research programs, with $200,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $2,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research is terminated. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research is terminated, and its authority will end on the date of enactment of this Act. Any remaining funds will be transferred to the Federal Oil Spill Research Committee for use without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation. SEC. 3. RESPONSE PLAN UPDATE REQUIREMENT. Section 311(j)(5) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require response plans to be updated every 5 years with the best available technology to contain and remove worst-case discharges. Plans must also address fire or explosion-related discharges and resubmitted for approval with each update. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act now requires response plans to be updated every 5 years with the best available technology for worst-case discharges, including fire or explosion-related incidents. The Coast Guard may establish technology standards for oil discharge response and prevention. The Coast Guard may establish technology standards for oil discharge response and prevention based on performance metrics and standards to the maximum extent practicable. SEC. 4. OIL DISCHARGE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT. The Secretary of the Department overseeing the Coast Guard must establish a program for evaluating and approving oil pollution containment and removal methods. This program includes a process for submitting and validating new methods and technologies for oil spill responses. After validation, the Secretary may designate a new standard for best available technology or methods. The lack of validation of a method or technology under this section does not prevent its use in response to an oil discharge or its inclusion in a response plan. Validated technologies and methods will be listed in the National Response Unit's comprehensive list. The Secretary must consult with various agencies when carrying out this section."
