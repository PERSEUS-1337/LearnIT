    "content": "In this work, the authors address the instability issue in GAN training by introducing a new architecture design. They demonstrate the benefits of a multi-generator architecture, showing that the minimax gap decreases to \\epsilon as the number of generators increases at a rate of O(1/\\epsilon). Their Stackelberg GAN model outperforms existing methods, improving Frechet Inception Distance by 14.61% on synthetic and real-world datasets. Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have shown significant advances in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. The new multi-generator architecture improves Frechet Inception Distance by 14.61% on benchmark datasets, playing a minimax game between generator and discriminator to enhance performance in generating images and texts. The focus of this work is on improving the stability of the minimax game in GANs training by addressing the large minimax gap. The study is inspired by the Stackelberg competition in game theory to alleviate issues caused by discrepancies between minimax and maximin objective values. In the Stackelberg leadership model of game theory, a leader firm moves first followed by multiple follower firms. This concept is applied to the architecture design of GANs, resulting in the Stackelberg GAN model with multiple generators teaming up against the discriminator. The model shows improved stability in training with smaller minimax gap and more stable performance. The Stackelberg GAN model introduces multiple generators in the GAN architecture, each learning one mode of the distribution without dropping any modes. This framework can be applied to various GAN variants, enhancing stability in training. The Stackelberg GAN model introduces multiple generators in the GAN architecture, optimizing an ensemble of GAN losses without assumptions on model capacity, unlike prior work such as MIX+GAN and MGAN. The Stackelberg GAN model introduces multiple generators in the GAN architecture, optimizing an ensemble of GAN losses without assumptions on model capacity. The minimax duality gap shrinks as the number of generators increases, and Stackelberg GAN can achieve \u270f-approximate equilibrium with e O(1/\u270f) generators. Training with 10 generator ensembles on real images shows each generator learns one mode of the distribution without dropping any modes. The Stackelberg GAN framework introduces multiple generators in the GAN architecture, optimizing an ensemble of GAN losses without assumptions on model capacity. It differs from prior work by jointly optimizing all pairs of discriminator and generator. The Stackelberg GAN framework introduces multiple generators in the GAN architecture, optimizing an ensemble of GAN losses without assumptions on model capacity. It differs from prior work by jointly optimizing all pairs of discriminator and generator. The minimax duality gap shrinks as the number of generators increases, with equal weights applied for all generators. This framework is general and can be applied to various GAN variants. The Stackelberg GAN model introduces multiple generators in the GAN architecture, optimizing an ensemble of GAN losses without assumptions on model capacity. It differs from prior work by allowing various sampling schemes and independent parameters for each generator. In the context of GAN models, the generator has free parameters and no assumptions are made on model capacity. Different approaches like MIX+GAN and GMAN use various techniques with multiple generators and discriminators. The Stackelberg GAN model applies equal weights for all generators, providing improved guarantees. The paper provides formal guarantees for their model, showing that the minimax duality gap decreases as the number of generators increases. This result does not rely on the expressive power of generators and discriminator, but instead on their properties. The Stackelberg GAN model achieves approximate equilibrium with fewer generators compared to previous models, thanks to a novel application of the Shapley-Folkman lemma. This improvement is based on the non-convexity of generators and discriminators, rather than their expressive power. The paper also contrasts the heuristic MIX+GAN model with the formal guarantees provided for Stackelberg GAN. The Stackelberg GAN model achieves better performance compared to other multi-generator GANs, with balanced modes and improved Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance on CIFAR-10 dataset. The model setup is formalized with notations for parameter vectors of discriminator and generator. The key ingredient in the standard GAN is to play a zero-sum two-player game between a discriminator and a generator, often parametrized by deep neural networks. The generator aims to map random noise to plausible images/texts, while the discriminator distinguishes real from generated content. The convex closure of functions is denoted as clf, and I represents the number of generators used in the model. The standard GAN involves a discriminator and generator playing a two-player game with a payoff value represented by a concave, increasing function. Different variants of GAN can be created by using different functions. The Stackelberg GAN model introduces I + 1 players with one discriminator and I generators, inspired by Stackelberg competition in game theory. The Stackelberg GAN is a framework built on top of standard GANs, with a unique discriminator for multiple generators. It solves saddle point problems and has a minimax gap. Unlike na\u00efve ensembling models, it requires joint training. Samples can be generated from Stackelberg GAN by having each generator learn. In Stackelberg GAN, samples are generated by using a mixed model with multiple generators. The theoretical contributions include studying the minimax gap, which decreases as the number of generators increases. The function h i, derived from the i-th generator, serves as an approximate convexification of \u2212\u03c6(\u03b3 i, \u00b7). The function h i is denoted as u i and acts as an approximate convexification of \u2212\u03c6(\u03b3 i, \u00b7). The convex closure of h i, clh i, represents the convex relaxation of h i. The non-convexity of the objective function w.r.t. argument \u03b8 is measured by DISPLAYFORM2. The duality gap in Stackelberg GAN can be bounded under certain conditions. Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 provide results independent of model capacity for generators and discriminators. Theorem 3 guarantees the existence of an approximate equilibrium under certain conditions. The discriminator and generators must be L-Lipschitz, and there are specific requirements for the generator's expressive power. In this section, the empirical investigation focuses on the impact of network architecture and capacity on mode collapse/dropping issues in various multi-generator architectures. The study aims to determine the number of generators needed to achieve equilibrium guarantees, building upon prior work by BID1. Theorem 3 improves upon previous results by requiring fewer generators and making advancements in the expressive power of generators. The study investigates the impact of network architecture and capacity on mode collapse and dropping issues in multi-generator architectures. It is found that network capacity is not crucial for resolving mode collapse but can alleviate mode dropping. The choice of generator architecture plays a key role in addressing these issues. Experiments on varying GAN architectures show different performance on a synthetic dataset with 8 modes. Increasing the capacity of a one-generator architecture does not solve mode collapse, but a multi-generator architecture in Stackelberg GAN effectively addresses this issue. While increasing capacity can help with mode dropping, it is not as effective for mode collapse. Even a small capacity in a multi-generator architecture can resolve mode collapse. Stackelberg GAN outperforms multi-branch models in addressing these issues. The Stackelberg GAN model, based on a Gaussian mixture distribution, outperforms multi-branch GAN models in generating diverse images. It shows better performance even with the same model capacity and outperforms larger capacity multi-branch GAN models. Each generator in Stackelberg GAN tends to learn an equal number of modes when modes are symmetric and capacities are the same. This experimental validation confirms the theoretical contributions of the model. The Stackelberg GAN model, based on a Gaussian mixture distribution, outperforms classic GAN in generating diverse images. The diversity of generated digits increases with the number of generators used. For the Fashion-MNIST dataset, each pixel is normalized before processing. The Stackelberg GAN model with multiple generators generates diverse images on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Pixel normalization is done before processing. The Stackelberg GAN model with multiple generators successfully generates diverse images on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model with 10 generators performs the best out of 5, 10, and 20 fixed-size generators tested. The model with 10 generators, specifically with 2 convolution layers, performs the best in generating diverse images on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Inception score and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance are used for quantitative evaluation, showing the quality of images produced by the model. Our Stackelberg GAN outperforms baseline models in generating diverse images on CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a score of 7.62. The model's performance is evaluated using Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, showing significant improvement over DCGAN. Our Stackelberg GAN model outperforms DCGAN and MGAN on CIFAR-10 dataset, reducing the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance by 20.74% and 14.61% respectively. The multiple light-weight generators in our model improve the quality of generated images. Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated on the Tiny ImageNet dataset. The study focuses on the use of Stackelberg GAN with multiple generators on the Tiny ImageNet dataset to address instability during GAN training. By utilizing a multi-generator architecture, the minimax gap decreases as the number of generators increases, improving over previous results. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the approach. The study introduces a new method that improves over existing results by utilizing a concave function. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The method is based on the weak duality theorem and involves proving inequalities using defined notations and lemmas. The proof involves applying Lemmas 4 and 5 to show the validity of Theorem 1, utilizing concave functions and defined notations. The equilibrium value V is shown to be 2f(1/2) by proving that V is both greater than or equal to and less than or equal to 2f(1/2) using concave functions and Lipschitz properties of the generator and discriminator. The equilibrium value V in the Stackelberg GAN setting is 2f(1/2), indicating that the discriminator cannot perform better than random guessing. The optimal implementation of parameters is achieved through concave functions and projection under a specific distance. The discriminator's capacity implies that the global minimum is achieved when P2 = P1 in the function L(P1, P2). The theorem is derived from this and the network setup details."
