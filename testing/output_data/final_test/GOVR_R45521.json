    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) spends over $300 billion annually on goods and services, with acquisitions governed by various statutes and regulations. Other transaction (OT) authorities allow DOD to bypass standard acquisition rules for research, prototyping, and production. This report explores how OTs work, their benefits and risks, and the availability of data to measure their effectiveness. In response to the Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik I in 1957, Congress passed the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, establishing NASA to develop a national space program quickly and efficiently. This legislation aimed to give NASA the freedom to conduct research, development, and exploration without unnecessary delays. The Space Act granted NASA broad authority to enter into contracts, leases, and agreements to further research and exploration. Other transactions are legally binding contracts exempt from federal procurement laws, allowing for more flexibility compared to traditional procurement contracts. DOD can use other transaction authorities for research, prototypes, and follow-on production. These authorities are granted in 10 U.S.C. 2371 and 2371b, allowing for flexibility in project funding and participation. OTs are treated as financial assistance instruments, not contracts, and have specific requirements for nontraditional defense contractors and small businesses. Other Transaction Authorities (OTs) allow DOD to purchase items for experimental or test purposes without following traditional procurement laws. OTs provide flexibility in contract clauses and requirements, allowing for direct relationships with nontraditional defense contractors and small businesses. Follow-on production can only occur if the prototype OT was competitively awarded and successfully completed. Other Transaction Authorities (OTs) offer flexibility in contracting for experimental or test purposes, allowing direct relationships with nontraditional defense contractors. OTs can involve various structures like joint ventures, partnerships, or consortia. Consortia, comprising nonprofits, academic institutions, or contractors, focus on specific technology areas and can have numerous members. They facilitate multiparty agreements where each member acts as a co-prime contractor with the government, submitting white papers for consideration. OTs serve to address government needs or problems efficiently. Consortia within Other Transaction Authorities (OTs) allow members to submit technology solutions for defined challenges, pooling resources and collaborating with the Department of Defense. This approach leverages the expertise of multiple entities to strengthen the defense industrial base and promote defense technology. Some argue that current consortia do not fully operate in this manner. Some analysts argue that consortia under Other Transaction Authorities (OTs) may not foster true collaboration, functioning more like managed contracts. They believe that consortia limit competition to members only, while others argue that OTs can increase competition by notifying all consortium members of opportunities. OTs are not bound by traditional procurement regulations, allowing for more flexibility in contracting. The statutes in Chapter 137 of Title 10 (Procurement Generally) do not apply to Other Transaction Authorities (OTs), which are not bound by standard contract laws. Examples of laws that do not apply to OTs include the Truth in Negotiations Act, Competition in Contracting Act, and select intellectual property statutes. OTs promote competition by requiring research and prototype projects to be competed to the maximum extent practicable. DOD policy emphasizes the benefits of competition in keeping prices low and quality high. OTs can be seen as promoting competition among entities that would not normally compete for DOD contracts. OTs promote competition among entities for DOD contracts, but lack defined competition requirements. They are subject to various statutes and regulations, including the Trade Secrets Act and the Anti-deficiency Act. GAO does not review protests of OT awards. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) does not review protests of Other Transaction (OT) awards, but will review protests if an agency is improperly using its OT authority. OT contracts can be protested to the Court of Federal Claims, with debate on the court's jurisdiction. GAO's limited protest jurisdiction is appealing to government procurement officials due to its faster process. GAO must issue an opinion on a protest within 100 days, with 70% of cases resolved in less than 60 days. OTs are exempt from GAO bid protests but not from GAO audits. OTs are not exempt from GAO audits if government payments exceed $5 million, allowing GAO to examine related party records. OTs offer benefits like pooling R&D resources, attracting nontraditional contractors, lowering costs, and speeding up the acquisition process. OTs provide a unique mechanism for DOD to invest in technology development, even when not directly tied to military capability. Experts argue that R&D accomplished through OTs benefits the technical and scientific communities, allowing for further research or demonstrating the value of a particular approach. Some believe OTs are crucial in the current defense technology race, where disruptive technologies are emerging rapidly. In a rapidly changing technological landscape, the Department of Defense (DoD) faces challenges in predicting future needs and adapting to new paradigms. Analysts argue that Other Transactions (OTs) and rapid acquisition authorities are essential for DoD to keep pace with industry and foreign competitors. The current acquisition system lacks agility to respond to emerging technologies like biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and robotics. In the past, the U.S. dominated global R&D, but now innovation is driven by external sources. The U.S. share of global R&D fell to 28% by 2016, with federal defense R&D accounting for 3.7% of total global R&D. Analysts suggest that the current procurement system is burdened by regulations, leading to increased costs and discouraging companies from working with the Department of Defense. Other Transactions (OTs) are seen as a faster alternative, attracting companies and promoting investment in defense capabilities. The current procurement system is burdened by regulations, leading to increased costs and discouraging companies from working with the Department of Defense. Other Transactions (OTs) are seen as a faster alternative, attracting companies and promoting investment in defense capabilities. OTAs help speed up the process, respect a company's IP through negotiation, and result in contracting under commercial terms and conditions. Congress has shifted its view on appropriate use of other transactions, expanding OT authorities in the FY2018 NDAA. The Secretary of Defense will establish a preference for using transactions other than contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants in technology and prototyping programs. While OTs offer benefits, there are concerns about oversight, transparency, and adherence to laws. OTs are viewed as a contracting method, not a replacement for good acquisition practices. A specific OT for cloud services was protested and canceled by DOD, highlighting the need for procurement reform. The problem with the OTA mechanism was a lack of transparency in its employment, raising concerns about potential waste, fraud, and abuse in Pentagon procurement. Congress has expressed worries that OTs could be used to bypass congressional intent, emphasizing the need for proper oversight and adherence to laws. The FY1999 NDAA and FY2019 NDAA emphasized limited use of authority for Other Transactions (OTs) to avoid circumventing standard acquisition controls. Concerns were raised about OTs bypassing Federal Acquisition Regulations and socioeconomic policies, potentially compromising integrity and fairness in the procurement process. Some analysts and officials have raised concerns about the use of Other Transactions (OTs) by the Department of Defense, including potential abuse of authority. Under Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy emphasized the need for judicious use of OTs to avoid losing the authority. Congress has implemented additional reporting and notification requirements in the FY2019 NDAA and appropriations legislation to address these concerns. The Department of Defense lacks authoritative data to assess the effectiveness of Other Transactions (OTs) due to a lack of transparency. Data on OTs is tracked by the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and the Defense Assistance Awards Data System, making it difficult to get a consolidated view. The Department of Defense faces challenges in assessing the effectiveness of Other Transactions (OTs) due to data tracking issues. OT data will be reported through FPDS-NG, but the reliability of procurement data is questionable. Data inconsistencies have been found in prototype OT agreements, and DOD officials acknowledge the lack of reliable data for analysis. In FY2017, DOD obligated $2.1 billion on prototype OT agreements, representing less than 1% of total contract obligations. The Department of Defense's use of Other Transactions (OTs) is growing rapidly, with OT obligations in FY2017 totaling approximately $2.1 billion, less than 1% of total contract obligations. The number of new prototype agreements increased significantly from FY2013 to FY2017, with the Army executing over 66% of these agreements. DOD officials intend to further expand the use of OTs due to increased statutory authority granted by Congress. The Department of Defense's use of Other Transactions (OTs) is increasing, with Army Contracting Command-New Jersey at Picatinny Arsenal executing many agreements. Private sector companies avoid federal contracts due to intellectual property rights and procurement regulations. OTs aim to broaden the defense marketplace by providing access to technologies and services from companies that wouldn't typically work with DOD. OT agreements offer less oversight and audit requirements compared to traditional contracts. CAS compliant financial systems can be costly for startups and small companies entering the government market, creating a barrier for nontraditional contractors. Despite claims that Other Transactions (OTs) attract nontraditional contractors to work with the Department of Defense, a DOD Inspector General report found that OTs did not significantly increase participation from nontraditional defense contractors. The report found that traditional defense contractors received 95% of the $5.7 billion in funds awarded out of 209 prototype agreements examined. While nontraditional defense contractors were awarded most of the new OTs, the dollar value of the OTs favored traditional contractors. Some observers question the accuracy of the data, highlighting the lack of participation from nontraditional contractors. The lack of authoritative data on Other Transactions (OTs) is highlighted, with nontraditional entities participating in only 12% of agreements. FPDS-NG does not collect data on subcontractors, making it hard to determine the extent of nontraditional contractors in OT agreements with DOD. A provision allows DARPA to recoup funds from OT agreements for advanced research projects. The Defense Department can recoup funds from Other Transaction agreements with a 'dual use' potential for commercial application and share costs with other parties. Congress authorized DOD to enter into cooperative agreements to develop critical dual-use technologies. The United States tends to underinvest in dual-use technologies, and OTs are seen as ideal for promoting DOD-industry collaboration in this area. The committee encourages the use of cooperative agreements and other transactions instead of grants or contracts, with a requirement for at least 50% of funding to come from non-federal sources. Some DARPA OTs in the 1990s required cost-sharing to benefit both government and industry goals. Present-day OTs also have cost-sharing requirements to promote collaborative research, but some analysts believe that DOD is not fully leveraging private capital or forming true consortia. Some analysts believe DOD should utilize consortia more to leverage private investment for dual-use technologies. They argue that cost-sharing provisions for prototype projects create an unfair playing field biased against traditional defense contractors. Traditional contractors are required to share costs, while nontraditional contractors and small businesses often do not have to. Critics suggest that this mandatory cost share should be reconsidered for fairness, especially for nontraditional contractors with significant revenue. Some argue that cost-sharing provisions for prototype projects put traditional defense contractors at a disadvantage, potentially limiting DOD's access to leading research and technology. Nontraditional and small businesses need exemptions from cost-sharing to work with DOD, as traditional contractors dominate OT funding. The Department of Defense (DOD) has not effectively tracked data on cost sharing for prototype agreements. Concerns have been raised about DOD potentially using Other Transactions (OTs) to avoid competitions, as OTs are exempt from the Competition in Contracting Act. Follow-on production using OT authority can only be awarded if the underlying R&D agreement was competed, and OTs must be competed to the maximum extent practicable according to 10 U.S.C. 2371b. Between FY2013 and FY2017, about 89% of new OT prototype agreements in DOD were competed. OT agreements are seen as a faster alternative to traditional contracts, with some believing they are the solution to acquisition challenges in a rapidly evolving technology landscape. Fast technology development has led to the need for faster DOD acquisitions to avoid falling behind. Some argue that Other Transaction (OT) contracts are not inherently faster than traditional contracts, but are executed quicker due to fewer bureaucratic hurdles. However, negotiations and terms in OT contracts could potentially prolong the process. The speed of award for OT contracts varies and is influenced by internal factors within the organization. DOD has not tracked data on the relative time it takes to execute OT contracts. Analysts and officials agree that the workforce is crucial for acquisition success. OT contracts, with fewer predefined requirements, can be challenging to negotiate, especially with intellectual property issues. This complexity requires experienced government representatives to ensure favorable agreements. Concerns exist about the workforce's readiness to negotiate OTs effectively. In response to concerns about workforce readiness for negotiating OTs, Congress mandated workforce education and training in the FY2018 NDAA. DOD officials acknowledge the need for more training. Analysts suggest establishing a centralized office within DOD to oversee all other transaction agreements to ensure acquisition workforce members are experienced and qualified. Analysts have highlighted issues with DOD's use of Other Transactions (OTs), including inconsistent data tracking, vague regulations, and workforce readiness. DOD has taken steps to address these concerns by issuing updated guidance and developing new training materials. However, some acquisition officials question the feasibility of quickly implementing training for OT preparation. Some DOD acquisition officials suggest limiting the number of OT agreements officers. OTs are seen as a tool for specific contracts, not to bypass regulations. There are differing opinions on using OTs to streamline acquisitions and potentially replace traditional contracting processes. Congress is urged to consider the benefits and risks of OTs in terms of cost, schedule, and capabilities. The FY2019 NDAA required DOD to submit annual reports on the use of OTs, including organizations involved, transactions, payments, and project details. Concerns were raised about transparency in OT employment, particularly for follow-on production. The conferees directed DOD to provide quarterly reports to Congress on the use of Other Transactions (OTs) and requested GAO to review DOD's OT usage for compliance with statutes. Questions remain about the need for streamlined reporting and specific data requirements for Congress. The conferees directed DOD to provide quarterly reports to Congress on the use of Other Transactions (OTs) and requested GAO to review DOD's OT usage for compliance with statutes. Congress needs specific data in these reports to effectively conduct oversight, such as the percentage of research OTs resulting in prototype projects and follow-on production. The reliability and accessibility of the data for ongoing oversight are also crucial. Additionally, questions arise about how OTs are being used and if the requirements process is being circumvented in awarding OT follow-on production contracts for major systems. The text discusses the authorization of personnel to procure and administer OT agreements, proposing the establishment of an acquisition innovation lab or center of excellence within DOD to oversee all OTs. This lab would be staffed by professionals with acquisition experience who can embrace new ideas and improve existing practices. Alternatively, similar centers could be set up within the military departments to cater to their specific missions and business approaches. Proponents suggest establishing a centralized office to oversee and approve all Other Transaction authorities in order to ensure experienced officials use them appropriately, prevent bureaucratic layering, propagate best practices, and provide timely information to Congress. This office could streamline approval processes and potentially modify existing statutory requirements. Establishing a centralized office to oversee and approve all Other Transaction authorities could potentially streamline approval processes and modify existing statutory requirements. However, opponents argue that centralizing OTs may increase bureaucracy and hinder the spread of expertise in executing OT agreements across the acquisition workforce. Establishing a centralized office for overseeing and approving Other Transaction authorities could raise concerns about its practical functioning. Alternative options include granting the office primary authority for executing OTs, establishing department centers with coordinating functions, or implementing the office as a pilot program for three years. The office for overseeing Other Transaction authorities is being created as a pilot program for three years to help DOD manage OTs until the workforce gains more experience. Other transaction authority first appeared in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, extended to 11 federal agencies and various federal offices. The legislative history of OT authorities and related statutes applicable to DOD are outlined in the appendix. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA to expand human knowledge and maintain US leadership in space science. NASA was given authority to enter contracts and agreements for its work. The Space Act granted NASA the authority to allocate contracts to enable small businesses to participate fairly. It also addressed intellectual property rights, stating that inventions made under contracts are the exclusive property of the United States unless waived by the Administrator. The FY1990 & FY1991 NDAA granted DARPA temporary authority to enter into \"cooperative agreements and other transactions\" for advanced research projects, with a funding restriction of $25 million. OTs should only be used when standard contracts or grants are not feasible. Cost Sharing The FY1990 & FY1991 NDAA allowed OTs to include a clause for payments to DOD. Funds were to support DARPA research projects with a cost-sharing requirement. The intent was to recoup funds for commercial use and reinvest in technology development. Reporting Requirements The NDAA mandated DOD to submit an annual report on OTs and cooperative agreements, detailing agreements and technologies involved. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991 increased funds for cooperative agreements and Other Transactions (OTs) from $25 million to $50 million, but no funding was appropriated. DOD was required to report on cooperative agreements and consortia for FY1991-1992 and provide 30 days' notice before signing any agreements under OT authority. The Senate report focused on consortia as a method to pool resources, share research among numerous participants, and promote critical dual-use technology. Section 8113A of P.L. 102-172 placed temporary limitations on the use of agreements undertaken pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2371, exclusively for DARPA in FY1992. DARPA was limited to obligating or expending no more than $37.5 million for cooperative agreements or OTs in FY1992. Additionally, DARPA could not exceed $75 million in obligations or expenditures for DOD dual-use critical technology partnerships in FY1992. The Authorization Act for FY1992 & FY1993 (P.L. 102-190) expanded authority for other transaction agreements in the military departments, established separate fund accounts for cost sharing, and made the authorities permanent. It authorized DOD to enter into agreements for dual-use technologies and encouraged the use of cooperative agreements and other transactions instead of grants or contracts. The United States tends to underinvest in dual-use technologies, and the provision requires at least 50% cost sharing. The provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1993 requires partnerships to have at least 50% funding from non-federal sources, focusing on security needs within DARPA. It allows for other transactions instead of grants or contracts, emphasizing the use of dual-use technologies through cooperative arrangements with industry, educational institutions, and federal labs. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1993 requires partnerships with at least 50% non-federal funding for security needs within DARPA, emphasizing the use of dual-use technologies. The Act authorized DOD to use grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or OTs for research. Section 827 established 10 U.S.C. 2358, allowing basic, advanced, and applied research. Section 845 granted DARPA authority to use OTs for prototype projects related to weapons, with competitive award requirements. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 redesignated the authority to use Other Transactions (OTs) to 10 U.S.C. 2371. Reporting requirements included submitting an annual report to the armed services committees detailing the technologies involved, military and commercial utility, reasons for not using a contract or grant, and payments received. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997 required a senior DOD official to develop policy for dual-use technology programs and use competitive procedures for projects. Section 743 granted DOD authority to use OTs for research on Gulf War Syndrome and its relationship to chemical warfare agents. Section 804 expanded prototype authorities for military departments. The FY1994 NDAA extended the authority to use OTs for prototype projects to military departments and officials designated by the Secretary of Defense until September 30, 1999. Reporting requirements were modified, and certain information submitted to DOD was protected from disclosure for five years. The Strom Thurmond NDAA for FY1999 extended the sunset date for OT authority to September 30, 2001. Section 817 of Title 10, United States Code was amended by the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1999 (P.L. 105-262) to protect information submitted in cooperative agreements for research. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Air Force's use of OT agreements for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000 required certification for the use of Other Transaction authorities in the EELV program and ensured GAO access to records for prototype agreements exceeding $5 million. The Senate report addresses the need for GAO audit access to other transactions as program size and complexity increase. Reporting requirements include assessing the utility of other transaction prototype authority and the Secretary of Defense reporting to congressional defense committees. The Senate report highlights the review of other transaction prototype authority by the Department of Defense Inspector General and the General Accounting Office. They will report to Congress on new commercial firms entering the DOD marketplace and cost-sharing practices. The committee is interested in lessons learned from exemptions to federal laws under other transaction authority. The government's interest in the absence of statutes applicability is questioned. Advocates propose extending other transaction authority to production. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide an updated report on the use of other transaction prototype authority. National Defense Authorization Act for FY2001 limits the use of OTs for prototype projects. The government can use other transaction authority for prototype projects if funded by non-federal parties or approved by senior procurement executive. Nontraditional defense contractors are entities that have not entered into certain contracts. The authority to use OTs for prototypes was extended until September 30, 2004. The intent is to attract new companies to work with the Department of Defense and promote cost sharing and experimentation for more efficiency. The Department of Defense utilizes other transaction authority to encourage cost sharing and incorporate commercial technology into military weapon systems. It is important to have flexibility in using innovative contractual instruments to access advanced commercial technology. Section 804 clarified GAO's access to records for parties involved in OT or cooperative agreements. National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 expanded authority for follow-on production. The Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 granted the Department of Defense authority to award follow-on production contracts for prototype projects funded by non-federal sources without competition under certain conditions. The Army Venture Capital Initiative was established with $25 million from the FY2002 funds. The Army Venture Capital Initiative (AVCI) was established with $25 million from the FY2002 funds for the purpose of funding a venture capital investment corporation. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 expanded the authority to use Other Transaction (OT) agreements for developing prototypes to improve weapons or weapon systems currently in use by the Armed Forces. Section 847 of the National Defense Authorization Act established a pilot program for transitioning prototypes to follow-on contracts for production for nontraditional defense contractors. The pilot program was restricted to contracts with nontraditional defense contractors valued at $50 million or less and set to sunset in September 2008. Section 1441 authorized agencies to engage in research and development projects for defense against terrorism or nuclear threats. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 established a pilot program for transitioning prototypes to follow-on contracts for nontraditional defense contractors. It also extended ethics requirements to Other Transaction (OT) prototype authority and required notification to congressional defense committees before exercising such authority. Section 823 of the FY1994 NDAA amended Section 845, requiring written determinations for prototype projects between $20 million and $100 million by a senior procurement executive, and for projects exceeding $100 million by the Under Secretary of Defense. The purpose of Section 845 is to engage nontraditional defense contractors for limited prototype projects. The committee is concerned about the use of Section 845 authority for a $20.9 billion agreement between the Army and the Lead Systems Integrator for the FCS program, as it is not consistent with the intended purpose of engaging nontraditional defense contractors for limited prototype projects. The FY2007 defense appropriations bill did not address OTs, but the conference report expressed concerns about their use by the Missile Defense Agency. The conferees urged the agency to convert large contracts to FAR-based contracts and directed them to submit a report on the use of OTs. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 extended the authority for prototype projects for five more years. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 extended the authority for prototype projects for five more years, required DOD to issue guidance on rights in technical data under non-FAR agreements, and expanded the scope of the pilot program for transition to follow-on contracts. The Act also mandated that OT data be included in the Federal Procurement Data System. Section 866 of FY2011 NDAA (P.L. 111-383) revised the definition of nontraditional defense contractor. Section 863 of FY2013 NDAA (P.L. 112-239) extended the authority for using OTs for prototype projects. Section 812 of FY2015 NDAA (P.L. 113-291) expanded the authority to use OT for prototypes related to enhancing military mission effectiveness. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 repealed reporting requirements for Other Transactions (OTs) related to weapons development or improvement. The Act also established Section 2371b for prototyping and follow-on production authority, expanding it to include small businesses and nontraditional contractors. Section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 eased restrictions on follow-on production contracts or transactions for nontraditional defense contractors, defined as entities not currently performing or having performed on any contract subject to full coverage under cost accounting standards. The Act also required DOD to update its guidance to reflect these changes, recognizing OTs as an attractive option for firms not typically involved in government contracting. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 expanded authority for nonprofit research institutions to enter into Other Transactions (OTs) with the Department of Defense (DOD) for prototype projects. Section 862 granted the Secretary of Defense and military departments the authority to pursue research and development projects under OT authorities. Additionally, DOD was required to establish a cadre of intellectual property experts to assist program offices in developing intellectual property strategies. Section 863 mandated training for personnel involved in Other Transactions (OTs) and innovative contracting methods. Section 864 adjusted dollar thresholds for prototype projects and defined a transaction for follow-on production. It also increased dollar thresholds for approvals and expanded the definition of small businesses to include those under Section 9 of the Small Business Act. The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs considered small businesses for cost-sharing requirements. Section 867 required a preference for OTs in science and technology programs. Section 1711 established a pilot program to increase manufacturing capability in the defense industrial base using OTs. NDAA for FY2019 clarified follow-on production rules for prototypes within a consortium. The FY2019 NDAA authorized the use of OTs for personal protective equipment and research under the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Defense Program. Reporting requirements included submitting reports to Congress on traditional and nontraditional defense contractors with DOD contracts resulting from initiatives. The Defense Innovation Unit and DOD were required to submit annual reports summarizing the use of OTs. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill did not address OTs, but the conference report expressed concerns about transparency. DOD was directed to provide quarterly reports listing active OTs, including funding details, vendors, and potential follow-on production options. GAO was tasked with reviewing DOD's use of OTs. The conferees directed GAO to review DOD's use of OTs to ensure compliance with statutes and guidelines, and report on OT usage since FY2016. The House report acknowledged OTs as vital for research and development projects but expressed concerns about transparency in follow-on production contracts. No funds could be used for follow-on production contracts until the Secretary of Defense notifies congressional defense committees 30 days prior. The House report acknowledged OTs as vital for research and development projects but expressed concerns about transparency in follow-on production contracts. No funds could be used for follow-on production contracts until the Secretary of Defense notifies congressional defense committees with a justification for using an OT for production. Non-DOD Federal Agencies also have varying OT or similar authorities, not a comprehensive listing. The FPDS-NG data on Other Transactions (OTs) have limitations and imperfections, but can still be used to identify trends and gather contract information. Despite shortcomings, the data is more comprehensive than in many other countries. Decisionmakers should be cautious when using FPDS-NG data for policy development, especially regarding OTs, as the reliability and accuracy of the data may vary. The FPDS-NG data for government procurement contracts and prototype OT agreements may have inconsistencies due to updates and delays. Prototype OT data includes additional elements like cost-share information not found in standard contract data. The FPDS-NG prototype OT data includes two similar data elements for identifying the fiscal year a prototype OT agreement was signed or modified. Users have interpreted these elements in conflicting ways, leading to inconsistencies in the data. For example, a Department of the Air Force OT agreement signed in February 2016 shows an obligation of $115 million in FY2020, which goes against fiscal law. The prototype OT agreements' fiscal year data elements can lead to different results depending on whether \"Fiscal Year\" or \"Contract Fiscal Year\" is selected for analysis. This has caused inconsistencies in the data, as shown in a Department of the Air Force OT agreement signed in February 2016 with an obligation of $115 million in FY2020, which violates fiscal law. In FY2016, DOD obligated $1 billion in section 2371b awards and received $68 million in cost-share contributions after excluding two significant trend outliers. DOD's analysis using FPDS-NG data excluded two $40 million OTAs with total cost-share of $270 million, likely referring to two DARPA prototype OT agreements initiated in FY2016. However, a CRS analysis identified inconsistencies in DOD's methodological approach. DOD's analysis using FPDS-NG data for FY2016 excluded two significant trend outliers, resulting in inaccurate attribution of prototype OT activities to the wrong fiscal year. By comparing disparate transaction types, DOD reported $1 billion in Section 2371b awards and $68 million in cost-share contributions. However, a CRS analysis identified inconsistencies in DOD's methodological approach. The Department of Defense obligated $1.4 billion for prototype OT agreements in FY2016, with $313.5 million in cost-share contributions from the private sector. By focusing on new prototype OT agreements, the department actually obligated $400 million with an additional $272.1 million in cost-share contributions. Other Transaction Authority allows for transactions other than contracts and grants. The Department of Defense can use transactions, contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants for research projects. The Secretary of Defense can delegate this authority to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Advance payments can be made without following certain regulations. Recovery of funds can be included in agreements for research projects. The Department of Defense can use transactions, contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants for research projects. The Secretary of Defense can delegate this authority to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Advance payments can be made without following certain regulations. Recovery of funds can be included in agreements for research projects, with payments to the Department of Defense or other federal agencies as a condition for support. The Department of Defense can use transactions, contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants for research projects. The Secretary of Defense can delegate this authority to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Advance payments can be made without following certain regulations. Recovery of funds can be included in agreements for research projects, with payments to the Department of Defense or other federal agencies as a condition for support. There are separate accounts for each military department and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for support. The Secretary of Defense can delegate authority for research projects to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Education and training for Department of Defense personnel involved in innovative contracting methods are required. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary of Defense to implement this section. The Secretary of Defense will prescribe regulations for this section, protecting certain information from disclosure for five years. This includes information submitted for research awards under specific programs. The Department of Defense has the authority to carry out prototype projects relevant to enhancing military mission effectiveness. This includes submitting proposals, business plans, and technical information confidentially. The Secretary of Defense will establish regulations to protect sensitive information for five years. The Department of Defense has the authority to conduct prototype projects for the armed forces, with cost limits set by senior procurement executives. The authority can be used for projects costing between $100,000,000 and $500,000,000 upon meeting specific requirements. For projects exceeding $500,000,000, the Under Secretary of Defense must determine the necessity in writing. The Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must determine in writing that the authority of conducting prototype projects is essential for meeting critical national security objectives. The authority cannot be delegated and competitive procedures should be used whenever possible. The Comptroller General has access to oversee projects carried out under this authority. The Comptroller General has access to oversee projects carried out under agreements exceeding $5,000,000, allowing examination of records of involved parties. The Comptroller General has limited access to examine records of parties involved in agreements exceeding $5,000,000, with restrictions on the types of agreements and transactions that can be reviewed. The head of the contracting activity may waive the requirement for the Comptroller General to examine records of agreements if it's not in the public interest. The waiver must be transmitted to Congress and the Comptroller General with a rationale. The Comptroller General can't review records more than three years after final payment is made. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that no agency official enters into a transaction for a prototype project unless certain conditions are met, such as the involvement of nontraditional defense contractors or small businesses, or a portion of the project cost being covered by non-Federal sources. The procurement executive can authorize innovative business arrangements for prototype projects under certain conditions, excluding costs incurred before the transaction is effective. The procurement executive can authorize innovative business arrangements for prototype projects under certain conditions, excluding costs incurred before the transaction is effective. Nontraditional defense contractors and small businesses are defined in this section. Follow-on production contracts or transactions are also addressed. Follow-on production contracts or transactions for prototype projects may be awarded to participants without competitive procedures if they successfully completed the project and were selected through competitive procedures.
