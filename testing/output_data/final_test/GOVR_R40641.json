    "content": "The 110th Congress enacted legislation requiring the Office of Management and Budget to develop a single consistent definition of \"inherently governmental functions\" to prevent the contracting out of these functions by agencies like the Department of Defense. In response, OMB issued a proposed policy letter on March 31, 2010. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy proposed adopting the FAIR Act definition as the single definition for inherently governmental functions. This report discusses the background, issues, and options for Congress in defining these functions within the context of DOD operations. It addresses the broader debate on the roles of the public and private sectors, existing definitions of inherently governmental functions, and options for Congress to ensure alignment with the executive branch's categorization. The focus is on DOD due to its specific functions, role in federal contracting, and unique workforce. The current debate surrounds the proper role of the federal government in contracting out inherently governmental functions, with a focus on the Department of Defense (DOD) and its workforce. The debate includes categorizing government functions into those that must be performed by government employees, those that should be, and those suitable for the private sector. This debate has evolved throughout American history, with fluctuations in the size and content of these categories. The debate over the proper role of the federal government in contracting out functions has a history that has evolved over time. The Department of Defense (DOD) must determine which workforce, military or civilian, will perform functions in different categories. This decision is crucial for functions categorized as \"must\" or \"should\" be performed by either DOD employees or the private sector. The Department of Defense (DOD) must decide whether functions should be performed in-house or by the private sector, including manufacturing ammunition and armaments. Arguments for in-house manufacturing have varied, with some suggesting it is an inherently governmental function. The federal government has consistently debated the role of contracting out functions over time. The federal government maintains two parallel acquisition systems, civilian and defense, with different rules for DOD. The Constitution outlines inherently governmental functions for Congress and the President, recognizing the public/private tension. The Constitution recognizes the public/private tension with limitations on public functions affecting private interests, such as takings of private property for public purpose. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the United States to the States or the people. The Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison acknowledged the President's inherent powers based on discretion and accountability. The Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison discussed the President's discretion and accountability in exercising political powers. The President is accountable only to the country and his conscience when using his own discretion in appointing officers. These issues have remained central to government functions. Various commentators debate the executive branch's discretion in classifying functions as governmental or commercial, seeking accountability. Post-Marbury courts developed theories and tests, including the \"affected with the public interest\" test, to determine government regulation of private-sector entities. The courts developed tests to determine government regulation of private-sector entities based on public interest and public functions, including the \"affected with the public interest\" test and the \"private delegation doctrine.\" These tests focused on when private-sector entities were accountable for public-sector protections and precluded Congress from delegating legislative power to third parties. Since World War I, the public/private debate on inherently governmental functions in federal contracting has been ongoing. The preference for public or private entities as sources of goods or services has varied with different administrations and agencies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed the use of civilian and military contractors compared to the 1920s. During World War II, there was a shift towards using the private sector for defense needs, leading to changes in government contracting. The Truman Administration saw significant changes in procurement laws, including the enactment of key statutes. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the Defense Production Act of 1950 changed federal procurement, focusing on who should perform specific functions rather than what is inherently governmental. President Eisenhower declared a policy of not competing with the private sector in 1955. The Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-76, established in 1966, is a key policy for determining whether government activities should be performed in-house or contracted out. The Reagan Administration in the 1980s advocated for smaller government and privatizing functions, leading to conflicts with Congress over the issue. The Clinton Administration was involved in the public/private debate, sponsoring plans that could expand the public sector while also promoting initiatives to reduce \"big government.\" The FAIR Act aimed to increase contracting out of government functions. The George W. Bush Administration proposed amending OMB Circular A-76 to presume functions as commercial unless agencies justified otherwise. Critics questioned the propriety of contracting out functions like acquisition and armed security. President Obama's memorandum in 2009 hinted at a potential shift towards increased governmental performance of certain functions. President Obama's 2009 memorandum outlined priorities in contracting policy, emphasizing increased competition, fixed-price contracts, workforce oversight, and limiting outsourcing of inherently governmental functions. The memorandum raised concerns about Government reliance on private sector services and referenced OMB Circular A-76's premise on separating governmental and commercial activities. Government employees and taxpayers may benefit from increased value by outsourcing non-inherently governmental activities to the private sector. However, the distinction between inherently governmental and commercial activities is unclear, leading to contractors possibly performing inherently governmental functions. Clear rules are needed for agencies and departments to determine when outsourcing is appropriate. Secretary Gates' budget announcement in 2009 proposed reducing support service contractors to impact defense organizations' staffing and operations. The government plans to reduce support service contractors from 39% to 26% of the workforce and hire 13,000 new civil servants in FY10 and up to 30,000 over the next five years. Two definitions of inherently governmental functions exist in federal law and policy. The definition of inherently governmental functions in federal law and policy is based on the FAIR Act and OMB Circular A-76, which are incorporated into the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Various statutes, regulations, and policies designate specific functions as inherently governmental. The definition of inherently governmental functions is established by statutory, regulatory, and policy provisions, as well as tests used by the Government Accountability Office and federal courts. These entities identify specific functions as inherently governmental or commercial, based on various definitions and declarations. The FAIR Act provides definitions of inherently governmental functions, along with other statutory definitions and declarations from administrative law and federal court decisions. It was introduced to promote compliance with OMB Circular A-76, which outlines the government's policy on competitive sourcing. The FAIR Act complements OMB Circular A-76 by requiring agencies to compile annual lists of commercial activities they perform and make them available to Congress and the public. It aims to promote competitive processes for government activities but does not mandate contracting out specific activities. The FAIR Act focuses on promoting competitive processes for government activities and defines inherently governmental functions as functions that require performance by Federal Government employees. It includes lists of functions that are considered inherently governmental and those that are excluded from the definition. The FAIR Act defines inherently governmental functions as those requiring discretion or value judgments for the Federal Government, including actions like binding the U.S., protecting interests, affecting private individuals, appointing officers, and exerting control. The FAIR Act defines inherently governmental functions as those involving ultimate control over the property of the United States, excluding functions like gathering information or providing advice to federal officials. Examples of excluded functions include building security, mail operations, and housekeeping. The FAIR Act's definition of inherently governmental functions applies to various executive branch agencies, military departments, and independent establishments, but exempts certain entities like GAO, government corporations, and agencies with fewer than 100 employees. Other statutes also define inherently governmental functions or closely associated functions. The Coast Guard appropriations authorization act for FY2004 and FY2005 and the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 define an inherently governmental function as any activity intimately related to the public interest, mandating performance by a Federal Government officer or employee, involving discretion or judgment. The definition of inherently governmental functions departs from OMB Circular A-76 by using \"officer or employee of the Federal Government\" instead of \"Federal Government employees.\" This definition includes exercising discretion and using judgment, as mentioned in OMB Circular A-76. While some statutes have different definitions, many refer to OMB Circular A-76 when defining inherently governmental functions. The definition of inherently governmental functions departs from OMB Circular A-76 by using \"officer or employee of the Federal Government\" instead of \"Federal Government employees.\" It includes exercising discretion and using judgment. Federal law declares specific functions as inherently governmental without defining them, such as preparing agency strategic plans and operating hydroelectric power facilities. Certain groups of employees are classified as inherently governmental under the FAIR Act. Congress can signal concerns about the executive branch's classification of specific functions as inherently governmental without enacting legislation or restricting funds. This can be done by expressing the sense that certain functions are inherently governmental or imposing additional restrictions on contracting out activities. The FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76, and the FAR are used to determine if activities are closely associated with inherently governmental functions. OMB Circular A-76 and Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92-1 provide definitions of inherently governmental functions. OMB proposed a policy letter in 2010 to adopt the FAIR Act definition as the single definition of inherently governmental. The current OMB Circular A-76 establishes federal policy for the competition of commercial activities, guiding agencies on whether to outsource commercial services to the private sector or keep them in-house. It requires agencies to list and classify all activities they perform. OMB Circular A-76 requires agencies to classify activities as commercial or inherently governmental. Inherently governmental activities must be performed by government personnel, while commercial activities can be contracted out. The current version defines inherently governmental activities as those so closely tied to the public interest that they must be done by the government. The OMB Circular A-76 defines inherently governmental functions as activities requiring substantial discretion in applying government authority. These activities involve binding the United States to take certain actions and advancing interests through military or diplomatic means. The OMB Circular A-76 defines inherently governmental functions as activities involving binding the United States to take certain actions and advancing interests through military or diplomatic means. It includes actions such as exerting control over property, affecting private persons' life, liberty, or property, and establishing policies for federal funds. The FAIR Act's examples largely align with this definition, but it also includes commissioning or controlling officers or employees of the United States. The OMB Circular A-76 distinguishes between the exercise of discretion and substantial discretion in determining inherently governmental functions. It also outlines factors agencies should consider to avoid transferring these functions to contractors. The current version of OMB Circular A-76 explicitly defines commercial activities as recurring services that could be performed by the private sector. The OMB Circular A-76 defines commercial activities as services that could be performed by the private sector and are controlled by the agency through government personnel, contracts, or fee-for-service agreements. It applies to all executive departments and independent establishments, but is a statement of policy, not law. OMB Circular A-76 does not have the force of law as it was not the product of a congressional grant of legislative authority. It prescribes federal policy and procedures for agencies' contracting out, which do not affect individual rights. Contractors do not have due process or other rights to prospective contracts with the federal government. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued a proposed policy letter adopting the FAIR Act definition as the government-wide definition for inherently governmental functions. It provides guidance for agencies to determine if a function meets this definition and introduces two tests for functions not on the list. The \"nature of the function\" test considers the direct exercise of sovereign power, while the \"discretion\" test evaluates if contractor discretion would make a function inherently governmental. The proposed policy letter provides guidance on identifying functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions and critical functions. Public comment is requested on specific aspects of the letter until June 1, 2010. The letter will not become final until 30 days after issuance. Prior to the 2003 revision of OMB Circular A-76, OFPP Letter 92-1 defined inherently governmental functions to avoid transferring official responsibility to government contractors. The OFPP Letter 92-1 defined inherently governmental functions as functions so closely related to the public interest that they must be performed by Government employees. This definition is similar to OMB Circular A-76, with some differences in wording. The 2003 revision of OMB Circular A-76 incorporated parts of OFPP Letter 92-1 and superseded it. DODI 1100.22 also provides a definition of inherently governmental functions for Department of Defense functions. DODI 1100.22, similar to OMB Circular A-76, defines inherently governmental functions as activities requiring discretion or value judgments for the Federal Government. It includes detailed lists of qualifying functions within DOD operations. Military personnel functions are classified as inherently governmental or commercial in Appendix C. The classification of personnel as inherently governmental or commercial within DOD is outlined in DODI 1100.22. Various sources such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and executive orders determine specific functions as inherently governmental or commercial. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is a key source of federal law on this matter, with Subparts 7.3 and 7.5 addressing contractor versus government performance and inherently governmental functions. Subpart 7.3 and 7.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation address the classification of functions as inherently governmental or appropriate for private-sector performance. They reference OMB Circular A-76, which mandates that inherently governmental functions must be performed by government employees. The definition of inherently governmental functions is based on policy, not legality. An inherently governmental function involves activities requiring discretion or value judgments for the Government, such as interpreting and executing laws to bind the United States or protect its interests through military, diplomatic, or judicial actions. Inherently governmental functions involve activities that require discretion or value judgments for the Government, such as interpreting and executing laws to bind the United States or protect its interests through military, diplomatic, or judicial actions. These functions do not include gathering information or providing advice to Government officials, or ministerial and internal tasks like building security, mail operations, and housekeeping. The FAR provides lists of functions that are inherently governmental or may approach being in that category. It lacks elaboration on the meaning of these functions compared to the FAIR Act or OMB Circular A-76. The FAR does not prohibit agencies from contracting out these functions. The FAR and DFARS provide guidance on inherently governmental functions and contracting out these functions. The DFARS places limits on contractors serving as lead system integrators on DOD contracts. The DFARS establishes limits on contractors performing functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions and requires written determinations before contracting out any functions. It also prohibits awarding contracts for functions exempted from private sector performance or inherently governmental. Defense agencies consider protection of property and persons by private security contractors as a commercial activity. The DFARS sets limits on contractors performing functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. Executive orders have designated certain functions as inherently governmental or commercial. GAO decisions have addressed this issue in various contexts. The GAO's decisions in bid protests do not have the force of law but are considered in cases where agencies propose contracting out inherently governmental functions. The GAO uses a test based on OMB Circular A-76 and the FAR to identify such functions, looking for substantial discretionary authority or value judgments made on the government's behalf by contractors. This test aligns with definitions in the FAIR Act and OMB Circular A-76, as well as examples in the FAR. The GAO uses a test based on OMB Circular A-76 and the FAR to identify inherently governmental functions in agency contracts. In a specific case regarding NRC Contracts for Reactor Licensing Tests, GAO found that the proposed contract did not involve inherently governmental functions because agency personnel would ultimately decide who received licenses. The GAO distinguishes between performing a function and advising on it when identifying inherently governmental functions. In a case involving GSA Transportation Audit Contracts, GAO found that two functions were inherently governmental, two were commercial, and three were unclear. The decision shows how GAO considers the context of contractual performance. The GAO examines the context of contractual performance to determine if contractors are assisting government agencies in performing inherently governmental functions. GAO classifications are not legally binding but serve as advice to agencies. Federal courts also determine if functions are inherently governmental or commercial, with two main contexts for litigation. The litigation concerning constitutional rights involves cases on the \"state action doctrine\" and the \"private delegation doctrine,\" which focus on whether private actors are performing governmental functions and if private parties have been given authority to legislate on behalf of the government. Courts do not have an independent definition of inherently governmental functions. In cases involving the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76, or the FAR, courts defer to the executive branch's classification of functions as inherently governmental or commercial. For example, in Arrowhead Metals, Ltd. v. United States, the court found coinage of money to be inherently governmental but allowed the U.S. Mint discretion in determining if stamping blanks constitutes coinage. This deference is due to the political question doctrine, which avoids legislative-executive controversies. The classification of functions as inherently governmental or commercial is determined by courts in cases involving the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76, or the FAR. Functions like conducting elections, providing police services, and exercising prosecutorial discretion are considered inherently governmental, while providing transportation services and selling government land are categorized as commercial. The classification of functions as inherently governmental or commercial is determined by courts in cases involving the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76, or the FAR. Designations of specific functions as inherently governmental in judicial decisions have the force of law, meaning contractors performing these functions must uphold constitutional rights and can claim sovereign immunity. The \"private delegation\" doctrine allows contractors to issue regulations that do not apply constitutionally to private individuals. The 110th Congress mandated the OMB to develop a consistent definition of inherently governmental functions by October 14, 2009, to address concerns about contracting out these functions due to multiple definitions. Policy and legal issues could arise from amending the definitions of \"inherently governmental functions\" in response to OMB's proposal or other options Congress could use to prevent alleged contracting out of these functions. One option for Congress is to hold off on new legislation until changes from existing laws or proposed by the Obama Administration are fully implemented. The 110th and 111th Congresses passed statutes addressing contracting out and inherently governmental functions, such as the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 and the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, imposed a moratorium on new public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76. This moratorium was extended beyond FY2009 by subsequent appropriations acts. Legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the replacement of contract work with military or civilian personnel in certain activities. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 imposed a moratorium on new public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76, extended beyond FY2009. Legislation requires the Department of Defense to use appropriated funds for contract services to compensate civilian employees for performing certain functions. It classifies specific functions as inherently governmental and requires clear distinctions between DOD employees and DOD contractors. The protection of resources in high-threat environments should be performed by Armed Forces in hazardous public areas. Regulations must ensure private security contractors do not perform inherently governmental functions in combat zones. Congress expresses the need to prevent conflicts of interest in acquisitions closely related to governmental functions. The protection of resources in high-threat environments should be carried out by the Armed Forces in hazardous public areas, and private security contractors should not perform inherently governmental functions in combat zones. DOD is required to develop guidelines for using civilian employees for functions closely associated with inherently governmental tasks and ensure the acquisition workforce is skilled for major system acquisitions. The Commission on Wartime Contracting is tasked with making recommendations on determining inherently governmental functions in contingency operations, including security in combat areas. OMB is required to track contracts involving these functions. The Obama Administration aims to have more functions performed by the federal government and prevent improper contracting of inherently governmental functions. Some critics have raised concerns about the alleged outsourcing of these functions. The Obama Administration aims to in-source inherently governmental functions as a policy shift from the Bush Administration's competitive sourcing initiative. OMB guidance cautions against overreliance on contractors and emphasizes the need for federal employees to perform critical but not inherently governmental functions to retain control of agency mission and operations. The Obama Administration is shifting policy from the Bush Administration's competitive sourcing initiative by aiming to in-source inherently governmental functions. Executive agencies are making plans for in-house performance of acquisitions work and security services, indicating a potential decrease in contracting out functions deemed inherently governmental. Congress may wait to see if previously enacted legislation and the change in administration lead to desired changes in agencies' treatment of specific functions. The Obama Administration is transitioning from the Bush Administration's competitive sourcing initiative by focusing on in-sourcing inherently governmental functions. Congress may consider additional oversight or statutory changes to support current policy initiatives and prevent future administrations from contracting out such functions before congressional review. The recent literature highlights the challenge of defining inherently governmental functions within federal law and policy. Various definitions exist in different regulations and acts, making it difficult to determine which functions must be performed by government employees. The challenge of defining inherently governmental functions within federal law and policy is highlighted in the recent literature. Different regulations and acts have various definitions, making it hard to determine which functions should be done by government employees. The phrase \"inherently governmental functions\" appears multiple times in the United States Code without a clear or consistent definition, leading to concerns about agencies contracting out these functions. However, there are only two main definitions of inherently governmental functions in federal law and policy, which are arguably compatible. The definitions of inherently governmental functions in federal law and policy are arguably compatible, with only minor differences in wording. The FAIR Act and OMB Circular A-76 define these functions similarly, with slight variations in terminology. The compatibility between these definitions is not surprising given the history of the documents establishing federal law and policy. The FAIR Act and OMB Circular A-76 define inherently governmental functions similarly, with minor differences in terminology. Some suggest using phrases like \"core functions\" instead. The substitution's intent is unclear - whether it's just a semantic change or a shift in the contracting debate. Proposals to replace \"inherently governmental functions\" with a phrase defining which functions can be contracted out aim to help agencies determine their in-house responsibilities more easily. This shift in terminology may clarify decision-making grounds for agencies. The shift in terminology aims to help agencies determine their core, mission essential, and critical functions more easily, which could clarify decision-making grounds for agencies. The shift in terminology aims to help agencies determine their core, mission essential, and critical functions more easily, which could clarify decision-making grounds for agencies. Translating directions from a foreign language into English could be mission essential without being inherently governmental, potentially expanding the range of functions exempt from contracting out. However, this approach may not address which functions government employees must perform in the public interest. The CLEAN-UP Act of 2009 aims to limit agencies from contracting out inherently governmental functions by defining other categories of functions related to them. It includes functions closely associated with inherently governmental ones and mission essential functions. This could impact the ability of agencies to contract out certain functions. The CLEAN-UP Act of 2009 aims to restrict agencies from outsourcing inherently governmental functions by defining other related categories. It would require executive agencies to ensure that these functions are performed by Federal employees, insulating them from potential contracting out. This proposal would give less significance to executive branch categorizations of functions compared to current law. The CLEAN-UP Act of 2009 aims to restrict agencies from outsourcing inherently governmental functions by defining other related categories. Provision of security services in combat zones is one function that might be more easily kept in-house under the Act. DOD would have to find that these functions are not inherently governmental, closely related to inherently governmental, or mission essential in order to contract them out, potentially increasing the likelihood of certain functions being performed in-house. Private security contractors may not perform inherently governmental functions, but their functions may be closely associated with inherently governmental functions or mission essential. This shift could lead to disagreements over the categorization of functions as mission essential, requiring resolution through the legislative or political process. One option to address disagreements over categorizing functions as mission essential is to define key terms within the existing definition of inherently governmental functions. This could clarify what it means for a function to be \"intimately related to the public interest\" or \"performed by the federal government,\" potentially removing distinctions between performing and assisting with inherently governmental functions. For example, defining \"performance by the federal government\" could help resolve issues like the IRS's proposed private debt collection program. The potential effectiveness of definitional changes in categorizing functions as inherently governmental may be limited due to the complexity of distinguishing between governmental and non-governmental functions. Congress has attempted to address alleged deficiencies in agencies' application of the definitions of inherently governmental functions by requiring the Commission on Wartime Contracting to include recommendations on determining which functions are inherently governmental in contingency operations. The 110th Congress enacted legislation classifying functions as inherently governmental, including providing security in combat operations. Congress could require mandatory training for contracting officers on this topic. Recommendations from the Commission on Wartime Contracting will be context-specific. The Commission on Wartime Contracting recommendations may guide DOD in similar situations but may not be sufficient for other agencies or dissimilar situations. Enacting legislation to classify functions as inherently governmental is ad hoc and costly, with challenges in ensuring consistent training and categorization. The executive branch has its own interests in contracting, making a comprehensive listing of functions difficult. The debate over contracting out inherently governmental functions during the Bush Administration was exacerbated by agencies categorizing functions without knowing all the details. The involvement of Blackwater employees in shooting incidents in Iraq raised questions about whether private security contractors perform inherently governmental functions. Prohibiting agencies from contracting out specific functions, or using appropriated funds to contract out certain allegedly inherently governmental functions, can help ensure that these functions are not outsourced. For example, Section 730 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 restricts funds from being used for competitive sourcing activities related to rural development or farm loan programs without specific authorization from Congress. Such measures do not require changes to the definition of inherently governmental functions and eliminate potential questions. Prohibitions on agencies contracting out specific functions or using appropriated funds for certain inherently governmental functions can be tailored responses to concerns. These measures, often used ad hoc by Congress, may be limited to specific agencies or time periods. For example, restrictions in a DOD appropriations bill may not apply to the Department of State. Such prohibitions can be included in appropriations bills and may persist beyond the initial issue that prompted them. A general prohibition on using the OMB Circular A-76 process may not effectively prevent the contracting out of inherently governmental functions. The circular outlines the competitive process for agencies to consider when contracting with private sector sources for various government activities, including non-inherently governmental functions like custodial services. A general prohibition on using the A-76 process may not effectively prevent the contracting out of inherently governmental functions. It does not address new functions or provide a mechanism for \"insourcing.\" Some suggest Congress could make agencies less prone to contract out such functions. The Department of Defense (DOD) may hire contractors without public-private competitions under certain circumstances, such as when converting functions from military to DOD civilian performance if civilian employees cannot be hired. Personnel ceilings are identified as a factor that may lead agencies to rely on contractors instead of military personnel or civil servants. Recently enacted legislation removed personnel ceilings imposed by the executive branch and Congress for the Department of Defense (DOD). However, there are still limitations on hiring civilian personnel due to budget constraints and concerns about agency budgets. Hiring and firing government personnel also present challenges in utilizing DOD civilian employees in place of military personnel. The ease of hiring and firing government personnel can pose challenges for agencies in matching personnel to their functions during sudden changes in missions. Congress is considering giving agencies expedited hiring authorities to address this issue. Under the FAIR Act, agencies must provide annual lists of activities they perform that are not inherently governmental to Congress and the public. However, these lists may not include new functions or provide enough information for Congress to determine if a function is commercial. There is no specific procedure for congressional review or response to these lists, although Congress can still exercise oversight functions in response to specific items on the inventories. The FAIR Act requires agencies to disclose non-inherently governmental activities to Congress and the public. However, congressional involvement is ad hoc, limiting effective oversight. The OMB Circular A-76 process also lacks systemic congressional involvement. Proposed legislation like the CLEAN-UP Act aims to increase transparency in agencies' contracting decisions. The FAIR Act requires agencies to disclose non-inherently governmental activities to Congress and the public. Proposed legislation like the CLEAN-UP Act aims to increase transparency in agencies' contracting decisions by requiring agency heads to report annually to the head of OMB on each contract, with the report being posted on the Internet and notice of the report's availability being published in the Federal Register. Increased awareness of potentially problematic decisions may lead to congressional oversight or legislation to address improper classification of activities. The FAIR Act and proposed legislation like the CLEAN-UP Act aim to increase transparency in agencies' contracting decisions. Congress may shift focus from contracting law to contracting policy and determine which non-inherently governmental functions should be performed in-house. Current discussions do not address what to do with functions that are not inherently governmental, leading agencies to make ad hoc decisions without clear congressional guidance. No legislation, regulation, or policy document systematically addresses how agencies should determine which non-inherently governmental functions they perform should be performed in-house due to concerns about transparency, accountability, and employment policy. Proposed frameworks suggest separating questions of contract law from contract policy and emphasize the need for balance and reasonableness in agencies' use of contractors while maintaining agency capability for core functions. The Freedom from Government Competition Act of 2009 takes the view that there is under-use of the private sector in government functions. The A-76 process assesses the cost of performing functions, but concerns exist about its accuracy. Congress is paying increased attention to contract policy, with the CLEAN UP Act encouraging agencies to pursue cost-savings through business process engineering. Congress is focusing on cost-savings in operations and contracting policy. Additional actions could include holding hearings for agencies to discuss their frameworks, mandating officials to develop a framework, or legislatively establishing one. This focus may help address management and oversight issues with contractors' work. Some suggest expanding the category of inherently governmental functions due to past problems. Expanding the category of inherently governmental functions is being considered to address contractor performance issues. Categorizing functions as inherently governmental ensures contractors cannot perform them. Distinguishing between functions that \"shall\" and \"should\" be performed by the government allows for flexibility in contracting out functions in emergencies. Congressional and Executive Branch interactions in defining inherently governmental functions during the 1980s are provided in Appendix A. During the 1980s, Congress used appropriations riders to counter contracting-out decisions by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations. Appropriations riders placed conditions on outsourcing functions, such as specifying that \"no funds shall be used for\" certain functions or requiring conditions to be met before funds could be expended. This legislation was tailored to specific concerns but was only effective for the period of the appropriation. During the 1980s, Congress used appropriations riders to counter contracting-out decisions by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations. An example of a general prohibition on contracting out was seen in the Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY1983, which restricted funds for the General Services Administration (GSA) from being used to contract out services performed by GSA employees. Another instance was in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act for FY1989, which prohibited funds from being used to contract out functions performed by federal employees at the Kansas City National Weather Service Training Center. The 1984 appropriation for GSA also included specific restrictions on contracting out. During the 1980s, Congress used appropriations riders to counter contracting-out decisions by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations. Specific restrictions on contracting out were included in the 1984 appropriation for GSA. The continuing resolution for FY1984 prohibited GSA from contracting out guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodian functions performed by GSA employees, with exceptions for services contracted out to sheltered workshops employing the \"severely handicapped.\" The Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act for FY1989 also prohibited contracting out positions at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police Force. Congress required agencies to meet certain conditions before using appropriated funds for outsourcing decisions. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY1989 and the Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriation Act for FY1989 included restrictions on contracting out activities without notifying Congress. Congress also prescribed procedures for agencies to follow when making outsourcing decisions. Congress enacted statutes to address contracting out generally and specific functions, setting criteria for agencies, procedures for public/private cost comparisons, definitions of key terms, penalties for violations, and exemptions. Chapter 146 of Title 10 of the United States Code governs DOD contracting for civilian commercial or industrial functions, with provisions for studies, core functions, cost comparisons, and exemptions. Chapter 146 of Title 10 of the United States Code governs DOD contracting for civilian commercial or industrial functions, with provisions for studies, core functions, cost comparisons, and exemptions. This chapter resulted from provisions enacted during the 1980s, including the Department of Defense Authorization Act for FY 1980, which prohibited DOD from converting commercial or industrial functions to contractors without notifying Congress and conducting cost evaluations. The Department of Defense Authorization Act for FY 1981 imposed restrictions on contracting out civilian commercial or industrial functions, considering the impact on employees, the community, and the federal government, the military mission, private bids, and costs. It also prohibited conversions to circumvent personnel ceilings, with exemptions for DOD research and development funds. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1981 imposed permanent restrictions on contracting out civilian functions, requiring cost comparisons and certification for privatization. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1981 imposed permanent restrictions on contracting out civilian functions, requiring cost comparisons and certification for privatization. The Department of Defense Authorization Act for FY 1983 further specified the criteria for converting functions to private contractors, including economic impact assessments and reporting to Congress. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1983 amended the previous restrictions on contracting out civilian functions by specifying that prohibitions applied only to functions performed by civilian employees of DOD. It exempted functions performed by 10 or fewer DOD civilian employees and prohibited modification to take advantage of this exemption. The act also prohibited contracting out firefighting or security-guard functions at military facilities, except for renewing existing contracts, and placed a moratorium on new studies of contracting out functions performed by DOD civilian employees. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1983 restricted contracting out civilian functions to those performed by DOD civilian employees, with exemptions for certain functions. The Act also prohibited contracting out firefighting and security-guard functions at military facilities, except for renewing existing contracts. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1984 extended the prohibition on contracting out DOD firefighting and security-guard functions for two years. The Act did not apply to contracts outside the US, situations affecting unit readiness, contracts on government-owned but privately operated installations, or renewal of existing contracts. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1985 required the Secretary of Defense to identify essential logistics activities for national defense and prohibited contracting out these activities. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 1986 declared certain DOD functions as essential logistics activities for national defense, including depot-level maintenance at specific facilities. Restrictions on contracting out DOD activities were codified in various acts during the 99th and 100th Congresses. The Defense Authorization Act for FY1987 continued the prohibition on contracting out DOD firefighting and security-guard functions, with exceptions for certain situations. The act also codified the general policy on contracting out. The Defense Authorization Act for FY1987 continued the prohibition on contracting out DOD firefighting and security-guard functions, with exceptions for certain situations. The act also codified the general policy on contracting out, including guidelines for determining cost savings. Permanent laws were enacted to limit outsourcing, such as the Veterans' Compensation, Education, and Employment Amendments of 1982 prohibiting contracting out medical care provided by the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration could contract out activities not related to direct patient care if cost savings of 15% or more were projected, and quality of care would be maintained. The Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 required notification before awarding contracts. The House Committee on Science and Technology required notification 30 days before awarding contracts for commercial activities, with details on costs, services, and benefits. The Sikes Act Extension allowed cooperative plans for wildlife conservation on military reservations, exempt from OMB Circular A-76, prioritizing federal and state agencies. The curr_chunk provides a list of appendices that classify functions as inherently governmental or commercial under various guidelines and regulations."
