    "title": "AB 1117",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) Program was established in response to the 2014-15 outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in California. Only 71 percent of young children in the state are immunized, below the national average of 75 percent. In 2013, 39,000 two-year-olds lacked recommended immunizations. The social and economic costs of providing CDC-recommended vaccines outweigh not vaccinating. For every $1 spent on vaccinations, up to $29 can be saved. California requires full vaccination for kindergarten entry, but younger children have fewer official requirements. The Legislature aims to ensure all two-year-old children in Medi-Cal managed care receive recommended immunizations. Children enrolled in Medi-Cal managed care receive all recommended immunizations. The California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) program aims to improve childhood immunization rates. The department will apply for a waiver or demonstration project to implement the program within 270 days of the operative date of this article, operating for five years. The demonstration project for the California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) will operate for five years. The department will consult with stakeholders and develop a plan for the collection and expenditure of CCIQIF moneys, including financing through voluntary contributions from Medi-Cal managed care plans. 33.3 percent of CCIQIF expenditures will be allocated for provider support payments and administrative resources. The California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) will be used for administrative staff, training, and resources to support providers in improving immunization rates. The funds will also cover department staffing and administrative costs. 66.7 percent of expenditures will go towards reward payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans at a rate of $125. The California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) will provide $125 for each enrollee who completes all recommended vaccinations by age two, based on the Childhood Immunization Status measure. Unearned reward payments will carry over to the next project year, and 20% of expenditures will be passed to contracted providers with Medi-Cal enrollees under two years old. The department will contract with researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of the demonstration project using data from the first three years. The evaluation will assess administrative support strategies and be financed with up to five percent of the total annual CCIQIF program expenditure. Provider support expenditures will be reduced to offset the cost of the evaluation. The chapter/article will be implemented based on federal financial availability and approvals. It will become inactive when the Director of Health Care Services declares the conclusion of the project, to be repealed six months later. The declaration will be posted online and sent to legislative committees."
