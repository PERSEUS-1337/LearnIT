If the taxpayer is not engaged in the trade or business for 2 consecutive taxable years, the balance in the SUSA Account is deemed distributed.\" Rules similar to those in sections 408(e)(2), 408(e)(4), 408(g), and 408(h) apply for SUSA Accounts. Payments to an SUSA Account are considered made on the last day of the taxable year if made within 3.5 months after the close of the year. The trustee of an SUSA Account must report contributions, distributions, and other matters to the Secretary and the account beneficiary. Regulations dictate the timing and manner of these reports. Additionally, excess contributions to an SUSA Account are subject to tax under section 4973 of the Code. Section 4973 of the Code defines excess contributions to SUSA Accounts as the amount exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the taxable year.

Subsection (c) of section 4975 of the Code is amended to exempt individuals with SUSA Accounts from tax on certain transactions if the account ceases to be an SUSA Account. Additionally, section 4975(e) is amended to reorganize subparagraphs and add a new subparagraph after subparagraph (D). The tax code is amended to include new subparagraphs for SUSA Accounts in section 468C and failure to provide reports on these accounts in section 6693(a). Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C of part II of subchapter E of chapter 1. The tax code is amended to include new subparagraphs for SUSA Accounts in section 468C, with the amendments applying to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
