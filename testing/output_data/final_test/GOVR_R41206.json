    "content": "Congress passed the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) on April 14, 2011, funding the ATF salaries and expenses account slightly below its FY2010 level. The FY2011 appropriation for ATF is $1.113 billion. The House adopted an amendment on February 19, 2011, to prohibit funds from requiring gun dealers in Southwest border states to submit multiple sales reports, but the Senate rejected the bill on March 9, 2011. No similar rider was included in P.L. 112-10. The ATF, part of the DOJ, is responsible for enforcing federal laws on firearms, explosives, alcohol, and tobacco. Congress did not include a rider in P.L. 112-10 regarding ATF's multiple rifle sales reporting proposal or the \"Operation Fast and Furious\" investigation in Phoenix, AZ. The Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) oversees alcohol and tobacco laws, while ATF's main focus is preventing terrorist attacks and combating illegal firearms and explosives trafficking. ATF agents also investigate criminal activities involving alcohol and tobacco products being used to fund terrorist operations. The majority of ATF's resources are dedicated to firearms compliance and investigations. In the 10-year period from FY2001 through FY2010, Congress increased direct appropriations for the ATF by 50.2%, from $771.0 million to $1.158 billion, with a focus on reducing firearms-related violence and trafficking. Funding has been dedicated to ATF efforts to reduce firearms trafficking from the United States to Mexico, including providing ATF software and establishing a ballistic evidence exchange capability under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. In FY2010, Congress provided ATF with funding for a National Center for Explosives Training and Research. The House passed a bill to increase ATF appropriations for Southwest border gun trafficking. ATF's authorization of appropriations expired for FY2010. The 111th Congress did not take action on bills to reauthorize or increase ATF appropriations, but granted ATF greater authority to inspect businesses and records. The Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (P.L. 111-154) granted ATF greater authority to inspect businesses and records of \"cigarette deliverers.\" In 2009, the DOJ Office of Inspector General released reports on ATF operations, including Project Gunrunner and contraband cigarette trafficking investigations. In 2010, the OIG recommended ATF work with DOJ to require reporting of multiple long gun sales in Southwest border states. Congress appropriates funding annually for ATF. Congress appropriates funding annually for ATF in the Southwest border states. Funding is allocated in a salaries and expenses account, with line items for firearms compliance, arson and explosives investigations, and alcohol and tobacco diversion. Appropriators consider program increases requested by the Administration for salaries and expenses. The FY2011 budget request for ATF included $1.163 billion, a $42.2 million increase from the previous year. The firearms compliance and investigations decision unit received the majority of funding at 72%. Statutory budget reprogramming requirements are triggered if funding is shifted between decision units. The FY2011 budget request for ATF allocated 72% of funding to the decision unit, with $1.115 billion for salaries and expenses and $6 million for construction in FY2010. The Administration requested a net increase of $48.2 million and 86 full-time equivalent positions for ATF in FY2011, including funding for Project Gunrunner and Emergency Support Function #13. The FY2011 budget request for ATF allocated 72% of funding to the decision unit, with $1.115 billion for salaries and expenses and $6 million for construction in FY2010. The Administration requested a net increase of $48.2 million and 86 full-time equivalent positions for ATF in FY2011, including funding for Project Gunrunner and Emergency Support Function #13. The proposed program increases for FY2011 are $13.0 million, with $1.2 million allocated for Emergency Support Function #13 across different budget decision units. The House CJS subcommittee held a hearing on the ATF FY2011 budget submission, addressing concerns about gun trafficking, regulatory backlogs, violent crime impact teams, and inter-agency coordination on gang violence. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its FY2011 CJS appropriations bill on July 22, 2010. The FY2011 CJS appropriations bill (S. 3636; S.Rept. 111-229) would have provided ATF with $1.163 billion, matching the Administration's request. An FY2010 supplemental appropriation of $39.1 million for ATF was requested for Southwest border gun trafficking investigations. The House and Senate passed border security supplemental bills (H.R. 5875, H.R. 6080) with funding for ATF. The House passed H.R. 6080 on August 10, which mirrored Senate-passed H.R. 5875. The bill was given a new number to avoid a dispute over revenue measures. The Senate also passed H.R. 6080 on August 12, and it was signed into law by the President on August 13 (P.L. 111-230), providing ATF with an additional $37.5 million for Project Gunrunner. This brought ATF's total FY2010 funding to $1.158 billion. The 112th Congress passed a series of CRs to fund federal agencies, including ATF, in the absence of an enacted FY2011 CJS appropriations bill. In FY2011, Congress funded ATF at slightly below its FY2010 level, with an appropriation of $1.113 billion. From FY1999 to FY2010, ATF's appropriations more than doubled, with staffing increasing by 28%. The FY2010 appropriation initially funded 5,101 permanent positions, including 2,485 special agents. In FY2010, Congress provided ATF with additional positions through a $35.5 million supplemental appropriation to address Southwest border gun trafficking. This included 105 positions for special agents, industry operations investigators, and other positions. The House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee noted a lack of positions dedicated to regulation writers in the FY2011 ATF budget request. The ATF requested additional regulation writers to address a regulatory backlog, with concerns raised about the adequacy of their request. ATF's ability to regulate firearms and explosives commerce relies on clear regulations drafted by subject area experts. ATF is responsible for enforcing criminal statutes related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. They focus on reducing firearms-related violence and investigating criminal activities of violent street gangs. Gun trafficking on the Southwest border, violent crime impact teams, and inter-agency coordination on gang violence are also key issues discussed. The ATF focuses on investigating violent street gangs, ensuring gun dealers comply with the law, and suppressing gun trafficking. Their authority comes from three statutes, with a proposed budget allocation of $837.4 million for FY2011. They are also involved in the President's Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative. The ATF collaborates with various law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute armed violent and career criminals. They lead Violent Crime Impact Teams in 31 cities to reduce homicides and violent crimes involving firearms by systematically investigating leads, targeting criminals, tracing recovered guns, and storing ballistic evidence. Under the Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCIT) initiative, ATF has significantly increased the prosecution of gang-related defendants, with referrals rising from 403 in FY2000 to 4,381 in FY2007. In FY2008, over 4,100 gang members and associates were referred for prosecution. Congress allocated an additional $10 million to expand VCITs in FY2010. ATF and FBI divide their anti-gang responsibilities geographically when operating in the same city, with ATF focusing on one high-crime area and FBI on another. In FY2008, Congress allocated $373,000 for ATF to assign two positions to GangTECC, which was incorporated into ATF's base budgets for FY2009, FY2010, and the FY2011 request. ATF coordinates with the FBI and other DOJ entities to maximize anti-gang efforts, reporting back to the Appropriations Committees within 120 days. ATF's budget increase for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011 included funds for inspecting federal firearms licensees to prevent illegal firearm diversion. Despite tensions with the firearms industry, ATF Special Agents and Investigators can inspect FFLs without search warrants for criminal investigations or compliance checks. ATF investigators inspect firearms transfer records maintained by FFLs to trace crime guns and uncover evidence of illegal activities. DOJ OIG reported on ATF inspections of FFLs in July 2004. In July 2004, the DOJ OIG reported on ATF inspections of FFLs, revealing that only a small percentage of FFLs were inspected in FY2002. Subsequently, ATF increased the number of firearms compliance inspections in FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009, covering around 9-10% of FFLs each year. Despite progress, ATF Deputy Director Melson testified in March 2010 that many FFLs are not inspected for five years or more due to a lack of personnel. Additionally, firearms violence has surged on the Southwest border with Mexico in recent years due to competition among drug trafficking organizations for control of smuggling corridors into the United States. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n deployed military and police to combat drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) on the northern frontier in response to increased firearms violence. DTOs are acquiring military-style firearms in the United States, leading to firepower parity in shootouts with Mexican authorities. President Calder\u00f3n urged the U.S. to curb illegal firearms flow into Mexico. ATF reports 6,647 FFLs in the Southwest border region, with DTOs using surrogates for gun purchases. ATF reports DTOs using surrogates in the US to buy military-style firearms, smuggled into Mexico in small shipments. Project Gunrunner aimed to disrupt illegal gun flow, with increasing agents and prosecutions. ATF spent $32.2 million on the initiative, focusing on investigating individuals. ATF's Project Gunrunner has five main objectives: investigate illicit firearms trafficking along the Southwest border, coordinate with U.S. and Mexican law enforcement, train officials, provide outreach to gun dealers, and trace firearms. The FY2009 budget request was $1.028 billion, with a focus on funding 12 industry operations investigator positions. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $1.054 billion for ATF, including an increase for Project Gunrunner. In FY2009, Congress allocated a total of $21.9 million for Project Gunrunner, including funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Supplemental Appropriations Act. ATF Deputy Director Kenneth Melson reported significant impact on trafficking, with 984 cases recommended for prosecution and 636 defendants sentenced to an average of 86 months. In FY2009, Congress allocated $21.9 million for Project Gunrunner, leading to significant impact on trafficking. 636 defendants have been sentenced to an average of 86 months incarceration. 307 cases and 881 defendants recommended for prosecution involve gang-related offenses. 497 cases have been charged with violations related to trafficking 14,923 firearms, with 159 cases involving gang-related trafficking of over 3,665 firearms. Over 6,688 firearms have been seized in all investigations. The ATF FY2010 budget request was $1.121 billion, including $17.9 million for Project Gunrunner, which was matched by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. The House Committee approved an increase in funding for Project Gunrunner to $59.9 million, including $10 million from the ARRA. ATF deployed 190 SAs, 145 IOIs, and 25 support staff to the project. The final FY2010 allocation included 224 SAs, 165 IOIs, and 32 other positions. The ATF FY2011 budget request was $1.163 billion, with $11.8 million to annualize positions previously funded under the ARRA. Representative Mollohan questioned ATF Deputy Director Melson during a CJS appropriations hearing in March 2010. During a CJS appropriations hearing, Representative Mollohan questioned ATF Deputy Director Melson about gun trafficking patterns and ATF initiatives like Project Gunrunner. Melson noted firearms were trafficked from Southwest border states into Mexico and other states within the US. Despite ATF's efforts, no additional positions were requested to address illegal gun trafficking. Congress provided $37.5 million in supplemental appropriations for Project Gunrunner in FY2010. ATF maintains a foreign attach\u00e9 in Mexico City for the eTrace program to assist Mexican law enforcement. The eTrace program, also known as the Trace Submission System (ETSS), assists Mexican law enforcement authorities in tracing firearms. Around 90% of the traced firearms recovered by Mexican authorities were either made in or imported into the United States. However, caution is advised when interpreting this data as it does not necessarily represent the overall origin of all crime guns in Mexico. Statistical significance is often difficult to determine due to issues with data collection and controls. The demand for certain firearms available in the U.S. has led to illegal trafficking to Mexico. Successful firearm traces help in homicide and gun trafficking investigations, uncovering corrupt FFLs involved in smuggling firearms. ATF deployed e-Trace technology to nine U.S. consulates in Mexico in 2008. In FY2008, ATF traced 7,743 firearms for Mexican authorities, with 63.5% made in the U.S. and 29.5% imported. ATF released a Spanish version of eTrace 4.0 to Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica in 2010, expecting increased trace requests. The ATF is establishing a U.S.-Mexico ballistic information exchange capability through the NIBIN program. Canada already participates in the program. The OIG released a review of Project Gunrunner in November 2010, reporting updated Mexican firearms trace data. ATF traced 64,510 firearms for Mexican authorities seized during FY2006-FY2009. Traced firearms included 973 rifles (77%) and 279 handguns (23%), with long guns having a shorter time-to-crime interval than handguns. The OIG was critical of ATF's eTrace program for yielding little results. The OIG recommended that ATF develop a reporting requirement for multiple long gun sales due to Mexican DTOs' preference for military-style firearms. ATF was urged to focus on complex criminal conspiracies involving high-level traffickers rather than low-level straw purchasers. DOJ and ATF requested expedited approval for an information collection on multiple rifle sales from federal firearms licensees. The ATF proposed a reporting requirement for multiple rifle sales in Southwest border states, limited to specific types of firearms. Despite OMB's denial of emergency approval, a comment period was initiated, followed by a subsequent 30-day comment period. Following the initiation of the ATF proposal on April 29, 2011, OMB will have up to 30 days to issue a decision by the end of June 2011. Some Members of Congress oppose the proposal, arguing that ATF should seek similar statutory authority for multiple rifles sales reporting as they did for handguns in 1986. Operation Fast and Furious in Phoenix, AZ, raised concerns in February 2011, with ATF whistleblowers alleging that firearms were allowed to be trafficked before suspects were arrested. ATF arrested suspects and seized contraband firearms, some possibly smuggled into Mexico. AK-47 style rifles found at scene of shootout near U.S.-Mexico border where Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed. 195 firearms purchased under Operation Fast and Furious recovered in Mexico. Questions raised about AK-47 style handgun used to murder ICE Special Agent Jamie Zapata in Mexico. U.S. and Mexican policymakers express dismay over Operation Fast and Furious. Senator Charles E. Grassley has raised concerns. Senator Grassley raised concerns about Operation Fast and Furious and whistleblower allegations, prompting calls for independent reviews by the DOJ OIG and House Judiciary Committee. Attorney General Holder instructed the DOJ OIG to investigate ATF's gun trafficking investigations. Representative Lamar Smith commended the review, while Representative Darrell... In April 2011, Representative Darrell Issa issued a subpoena to DOJ and ATF for documents related to Project Gunrunner. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported the M\u00e9rida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008, authorizing funds for ATF positions and agents in Mexico. The bill passed in the House in June 2008. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to continue the M\u00e9rida Initiative. ATF's arson and explosives budget program enforces federal laws on explosives. The Explosives Control Act of 1970 regulates explosives commerce in the US. The Anti-Arson Act of 1982 created a federal crime of arson. The Anti-Arson Act of 1982 created a federal crime of arson and was further amended by the Safe Explosives Act in 2002. The proposed FY2011 allocation for the ATF arson and explosives program is $302.4 million, with a program increase for Emergency Support Function #13. The ATF is known for its expertise in investigating arson and explosive incidents, with the Attorney General assigning them to maintain a consolidated database of such incidents in the US. The Safe Explosives Act of 2002 gave ATF responsibility for regulating the explosives industry, including investigating thefts and conducting background checks for licensees. In FY2008, ATF completed over 68,000 employee background checks and over 3,000 responsible person background checks. The Safe Explosives Act of 2002 gave ATF responsibility for regulating the explosives industry, including conducting background checks for licensees and permittees. ATF conducted 3,291 explosives compliance inspections in FY2007, 3,055 in FY2008, and 2,640 in FY2009. Despite being transferred to DOJ in 2003, tensions between ATF and FBI over jurisdiction remained. Attorney General John Ashcroft convened an Explosives Review Group in 2003 to improve coordination between the two agencies. The Attorney General directed the ATF and FBI to consolidate arson and explosives databases, coordinate training, and assign lead roles in investigations. Despite directives, collaboration between the two agencies on federal explosives-related cases remains a challenge. The FBI and ATF's rivalry in federal explosives-related investigations is marked by competition for resources. The Senate Judiciary Committee urged an end to this rivalry, while FBI and ATF officials highlight their daily cooperation through the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center. The FBI and ATF lack coordination in explosives investigations, hindering the DOJ's ability to effectively respond to and prevent explosives crimes. This includes separate databases, jurisdictional disputes, and a lack of information sharing and coordination in training. The OIG highlighted concerns about the lack of coordination between the FBI and ATF in explosives investigations, which could hinder the DOJ's ability to prevent explosives crimes. The ATF's Alcohol and Tobacco program budget covers expenses related to countering illegal diversion of tobacco and alcohol products. The FY2010 allocation for the program is $22.3 million, about 2% of ATF's total budget. The proposed FY2011 allocation is $23.3 million, also about 2% of the requested budget. The ATF's budget request is $23.3 million, representing about 2% of the total request. The DOJ OIG report highlighted that tobacco diversion investigations are given low priority at ATF compared to other mission areas, despite their connections to terrorist financing and organized crime. Between FY2004 and FY2008, ATF conducted 645 alcohol and tobacco diversion investigations, with tobacco cases being more lucrative for criminal enterprises due to ease of transport. Alcohol diversion cases are limited geographically and often handled by state and local authorities. The FY2011 budget includes a $24,000 increase for Emergency Support Function #13, while the FY2010 budget request to OMB included $28.3 million for tobacco diversion. The request for $28.3 million for tobacco diversion was denied by OMB and not included in ATF's FY2010 budget submission. Federal statutes addressing alcohol diversion include the Internal Revenue Code, Federal Alcohol Administration Act, 21st Amendment, Webb-Kenyon Act, Federal Criminal Code, and federal Indian laws. ATF has primary jurisdiction for illegal interstate liquor transportation, while regulatory statutes are in the IRC under the Department of the Treasury. ATF's origins trace back to battling organized crime during prohibition. Since its transfer to DOJ, ATF's role in enforcing liquor laws has been diminished, with most personnel dedicated to alcohol and tobacco regulation remaining at Treasury. ATF has primary jurisdiction over criminal provisions related to tobacco in the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act of 1978. Illegal diversion and smuggling of cigarettes in the US result in significant tax revenue losses, with ATF noting that cigarette bootlegging is a lucrative criminal venture used by terrorist groups for financing. Terrorist groups use various criminal activities to finance their operations, including trafficking contraband cigarettes. This has become lucrative due to high cigarette taxes, with potential profits ranging from $18,000 to $465,000 per load. ATF has investigated organized crime groups involved in this illegal trade. The Inspector General criticized ATF's tobacco diversion efforts as \"ad hoc\" and highlighted the lack of systematic intelligence sharing within the agency. Legislation like the PACT Act was introduced to address contraband cigarette trafficking, with the House passing it in 2009 by a large majority. The House passed the bill in 2009 by a large majority, and Senator Herb Kohl introduced a similar measure in the Senate. The bill was amended by the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate in 2010. President Obama signed the bill into law on March 31, 2010. The bill addressed ATF's tobacco diversion mission, with one section included in the final law. The ATF established regional contraband tobacco trafficking teams in six cities over three years, a tobacco intelligence center, a covert national warehouse, and a database to track tobacco sales. Section 7 authorized $8.5 million for five years starting in FY2010. Another section in P.L. 111-154 allowed ATF to inspect delivery sellers' premises and impose penalties for non-compliance. In the 110th Congress, a bill was passed to compel inspections and impose penalties for non-compliance. The House passed a similar bill (H.R. 4081) by a recorded vote of 379 to 12. The Senate Judiciary Committee also reported a similar bill but took no further action. Congress last authorized appropriations for ATF in 2005, but the authorization lapsed for FY2010. Authorization for ATF appropriations lapsed for FY2010, as Congress has not reauthorized funding for DOJ or ATF. Congress typically appropriates more money for ATF than authorized."
