    "content": "Since FY2008, federal highway user taxes and fees have not been enough to fund the surface transportation program authorized by Congress. The 2015 surface transportation act addressed the revenue shortfall through FY2020 by allowing the use of general funds for transportation purposes. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $20 billion annual gap between dedicated surface transportation revenues and spending after FY2020. This may lead to a renewed interest in tolling as a way to finance transportation projects without federal expenditures. Federal law limits tolls on existing federal-aid highways, especially on the Interstate Highways. The current federal policies governing tolling discuss issues related to using tolls as revenue for transportation projects. Many highways in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic were originally toll roads built by private investors. Toll roads faced challenges like optimistic revenue expectations, lack of investment for improvements, and toll avoidance. Congress emphasized free roads in the past, but there is a growing interest in tolling to finance transportation projects due to a projected annual funding gap after FY2020. Federal law limits tolls on existing federal-aid highways, especially on Interstate Highways. The Aid Road Act of 1921 prohibited tolls on roads constructed under its provisions. The Oldfield Act of 1927 allowed toll bridges with federal funds if operated by states. Despite opposition from the Bureau of Public Roads, toll roads were built in the Northeast without federal aid after World War II. By 1955, there were over 1,200 miles of completed toll roads in the US, many on planned Interstate routes. The Bureau supported toll-free Interstate Highways but recommended maintaining existing toll roads. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 prohibited tolls on new Interstate Highways and incorporated existing toll roads meeting standards into the network. The Act authorized funding for Interstate construction, created the Highway Trust Fund, and raised fuel taxes to finance it, effectively halting new toll road development by states. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) allowed tolling on non-Interstate federal-aid highways after reconstruction, linking tolling to capacity additions or road improvements. Subsequent acts like TEA-21, SAFETEA, and MAP-21 further expanded tolling options, including tolling on HOV lanes and congestion pricing. The FAST Act of 2015 clarified that public authorities, not just state agencies, can impose tolls on single-occupant vehicles in HOV lanes. It also modified a pilot program allowing tolls on existing Interstate Highway segments for reconstruction, with federal approval expiring if construction doesn't start within three years. The FAST Act of 2015 allows public authorities to impose tolls on single-occupant vehicles in HOV lanes and requires construction to start within three years of approval to avoid federal approval expiration. It also mandates equal access and rates for intercity buses on toll roads and consultation with planning organizations for HOT lanes. Federal tolling policy generally does not regulate toll rates, except for conversions of federal-aid highways to toll facilities. The decision to convert a free facility to a tolled facility must be made before the completion of the qualifying reconstruction project, according to the Federal Highway Administration. A toll road must have sufficient traffic willing to pay high tolls to cover costs, but most roads on the federal-aid system may not be financially successful due to lack of traffic. Rural areas often lack the traffic volume needed to support toll collection infrastructure, while urban roads typically have more traffic. Some publicly owned toll roads have been financially successful, generating revenue to cover costs and contribute to other highway activities. However, some public toll facilities, like the 8 miles of express toll lanes on I-95 north of Baltimore, have struggled to generate enough revenue to cover project costs, requiring state government intervention. Some private toll roads, like the Pocahontas Parkway in VA and SH-130 near Austin, TX, have faced financial difficulties due to low traffic volumes. The operators of these toll roads have struggled to service debt and some have filed for bankruptcy protection. Several toll roads, including the Pocahontas Parkway in VA and SH-130 near Austin, TX, have faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy protection. These failures were due to overly optimistic revenue forecasts from tolls in public-private partnerships (P3s). Investors are now more cautious about projects relying on toll revenue, leading to some private investors requiring \"availability payments\" from the government. Using tolls for transportation funding may be inefficient due to high administrative costs. The process of collecting federal motor fuels taxes is administratively simple and cost-effective, with most taxes collected at terminals from a small number of registered taxpayers. In contrast, toll collection incurs higher administrative costs, which are often underestimated due to hidden expenses. The study estimated that toll collection costs range from 16.5% to 92.6% of the amount collected at seven agencies. Most toll facilities now use electronic tolling systems, but some still employ collectors for cash tolls. Recent financial reports show that collecting highway tolls costs between 8% and 11% of the amount collected. The cost of collecting highway tolls ranges from 8% to 11% of the amount collected. Electronic tolling costs include bank and credit card fees, transaction processing fees, and transponders for drivers. Total operating costs for electronic tolling in FY2015 were 10.6% of revenues collected. Nationwide toll revenue was $14.35 billion in FY2014, with toll revenue as a share of total highway spending remaining steady at 5% to 6%. On average, facility owners collected $2.36 million per mile. In FY2014, toll revenue was $14.35 billion, with revenue per mile averaging $2.36 million. Toll roads make up 0.6% of public roads, with 6,088 tolled miles in 2015, showing a 29% increase since 1990. Toll revenue goes to state or local agencies, not the federal government, but expanding tolling could reduce federal road expenditures. Toll-road mileage is only 0.6% of public roads eligible for federal highway aid. Proposals to toll existing roads face opposition in several states. Despite a recent increase in vehicle miles traveled, future growth may be slower due to demographic and social changes. In the future, motor vehicle use may grow more slowly, impacting toll revenues. Toll rates are political issues, especially when revenue is used for non-toll facility purposes. Trucking interests oppose rate changes that increase truck tolls. Political concerns can lead to toll reductions on publicly owned facilities. Private concessionaires have contracts specifying maximum toll rate increases to prevent motorists from using non-tolled routes. Imposing tolls on transportation facilities may have limited use in helping states overcome reductions in federal grants. Tolls can be effective for financing specific facilities like major roads, bridges, or tunnels, but may be less effective for broad financial support for surface transportation programs. Tolling Interstate Highways could generate revenue by assuming the public would pay the same average annual amount per mile. Tolling all Interstate Highways could raise around $104 billion per year, but maintaining this average revenue per mile across the entire system is doubtful due to varying traffic levels and potential for users to seek alternative routes. One option for expanding tolling on the Interstates would be for Congress to require tolling only as Interstate system roads and bridges are rebuilt with federal assistance. Bonds might be issued to fund construction costs up-front, with toll revenues from the newly rebuilt facilities then used to pay for the interest and bond retirement costs. A less ambitious alternative would be to convert only the urban Interstates. Tolling urban Interstates could potentially generate nearly $40 billion in annual revenue, but operating and collection costs may reduce this amount. Some roads may not generate enough revenue to cover all costs, raising concerns about cross-subsidization. Federal funds currently account for 27% to 32% of total annual Interstate system project costs. Projects on the Interstate system account for 27% to 32% of total annual federal-aid highway obligations, around $11 billion to $12 billion annually. Converting all Interstates to toll roads could reduce federal highway program spending from $42 billion to $30 billion per year, aligning it with motor fuels tax revenues. However, the costs of establishing tolling across the Interstate system would be significant. States would need to construct gantries for toll collection. The conversion of a significant portion of the Interstate Highway system from free roads to toll roads would require constructing gantries and toll-collection equipment at thousands of locations, with estimated costs ranging from $1 trillion to $3 trillion. Congress would need to conduct studies to identify toll collection locations, order equipment, and design and construct physical infrastructure, which would take several years to complete. Increased tolling usage may not reduce taxpayer funding needs over 5-10 years. Toll revenues can support highway projects through debt finance and private equity. Congress promotes innovative financing like public-private partnerships using toll revenues to service municipal bonds. This results in a tax exclusion for interest paid on the bonds, causing a loss of revenue for the federal government. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for projects with dedicated revenue streams like toll revenues. TIFIA can support loans for highways and bridges, potentially leading to an expansion of toll roads if a National Infrastructure Bank is established. The establishment of a well-funded National Infrastructure Bank could potentially result in an increase in toll roads through innovative financing for highway projects. This expansion would likely occur gradually over time, with toll-supported financing only meeting a small portion of highway spending needs unless Congress mandates its use for Interstate Highway reconstruction. States currently have control over federal-aid highways within their borders, so any immediate conversion to toll roads would be at the discretion of individual states, with limited federal involvement. This decentralized approach could lead to varying conversion timelines among states. Congress could require states to convert Interstate Highways to toll roads in exchange for federal highway grants, with FHWA determining the conversion sequence. This approach would prevent toll wars among states and ensure a coordinated implementation of tolls. States would still oversee the converted highways, either directly, through a toll authority, or via a private operator. The implementation of tolls on roads and bridges would require upfront investments in infrastructure and equipment. FHWA approval is needed for toll implementation on federally aided roads, but the federal government has no jurisdiction over toll rates. The use of tolls may raise equity concerns, especially for motorists from states with lower tolls. Some states offer preferential toll rates to residents, potentially burdening interstate travel and commerce. There is a concern that tolls at state borders could tax interstate travel more than in-state travel, putting out-of-state companies at a disadvantage. Truck tolls are significantly higher than car tolls, with trucking interests opposing additional tolling. Trucking interests generally oppose additional tolling due to concerns about political influence on toll increases. They prefer higher fuel taxes dedicated to highway improvement, as studies show that fuel taxes provide trucks with a subsidy from car users. Proposals for expanded tolling may lead to federal involvement in rate-setting, as seen in the FAST Act's mandates on toll rates for intercity buses and high-occupancy toll lanes. Deeper federal involvement in tolling may include establishing regulatory standards and enforcing the requirement that tolls be \"just and reasonable.\" Congress would need to clarify which federal agency would oversee tolling regulations and rates. Advocates suggest tolling as a way to increase infrastructure spending, but this could be offset by reduced spending at local, state, and federal levels. Congress has considered tying federal support for highway spending to maintenance of effort requirements, which could be expanded with increased tolling usage. A major expansion of Interstate Highway tolling could lead to increased use of toll credits nationwide, potentially reducing taxpayer funding for state matching shares of federal grants. This could be mitigated by implementing a mileage-based road user charge. A mileage-based road user charge is proposed as an alternative to fuel taxes for highway funding. It would be imposed on all roads, unlike tolls which are only on specific segments. This charge could also be used for congestion pricing, but concerns about privacy and payment methods have been raised. The vehicle tracking system raises privacy concerns and is less discussed in tolling conversations."
