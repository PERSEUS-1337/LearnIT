    "content": "The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 established national regulatory policies for cable television. In 1992, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act addressed issues like cable rates and service standards, with regulations enforced by the FCC. The FCC implemented cable rate rules in stages, with the first set taking effect on September 1, 1993. They aimed for a 10% reduction in overall cable bills, but not all rates decreased. After a review, new rules were issued on March 30, 1994, to further cut rates by an average of 7%, effective on May 15. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminated most cable television rate regulations beyond the basic tier as of March 31, 1999. Small cable operators were freed from rate regulation immediately, while rates for the basic tier continue to be regulated by local franchising authorities or state authorities. The FCC monitors cable rate activity and issues annual reports on cable industry prices and competition in video markets. According to the 2005 FCC Annual Report on Cable Industry Prices, the average monthly price for basic-plus-expanded basic cable service increased by 5.2% to $43.04. Cable companies cited rising costs of sports and entertainment programming as reasons for rate hikes. Congress mandated a study on cable rates in 2003 to examine the impact of competition on prices. The GAO report examined the impact of competition on cable rates, questioned the reliability of the FCC's annual report on cable industry prices, and identified factors contributing to recent rate increases, such as rising programming costs and system upgrades. GAO recommended improvements to the FCC's data reliability and highlighted the significant increase in sports programming costs. The GAO report discussed converting cable system pricing to \u00e0 la carte pricing, which could increase customer choice but also lead to additional costs and impact advertising revenues. The FCC's Twelfth Annual Report stated that 65.4 million homes in the US subscribed to cable television in June 2004. Subscriptions to DBS have rapidly increased in recent years, with over 26.1 million subscribers as of June 2005, accounting for 27.7% of all MVPD subscribers. MVPD subscribers, including cable and noncable, total approximately 94 million homes. Other technologies make up the remaining 2.9% of MVPD subscribers. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows telephone companies to compete with cable TV providers, offering video services and potentially merging with them. Cable companies can also provide local phone and broadband Internet services, including VoIP. The Cable Act of 1992 addresses concerns about program access in the cable television industry, preventing exclusive contracts between cable operators and affiliated programmers for satellite-delivered programming. The FCC was instructed to reexamine the need for this prohibition after 10 years, with the prohibition set to expire in 2002. The FCC extended the statutory prohibition on exclusive contracts between cable operators and programmers until 2007 to preserve competition and diversity in video programming distribution. Broadband services are offered through various technologies, including cable, DSL, satellite TV, and fixed wireless. Classifying cable broadband as an information service has regulatory implications for minimal federal regulation and open access requirements. The FCC ruled that cable broadband services are classified as an interstate information service, not subject to common carrier regulation or open access requirements for competing ISPs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed with this classification in a ruling on October 6, 2003. The Ninth Circuit ruled that cable modem services are partially classified as a telecommunications service, potentially requiring cable operators to open their lines to competing ISPs. This decision overturned part of the FCC's 2002 declaratory order. The FCC appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of cable companies, stating they do not have to open their lines to ISPs. The Supreme Court supported the FCC's decision to classify cable modem service as an information service, ruling that cable companies do not have to open their lines to ISPs. The FCC's fact sheets provide information on cable television regulation and channel distribution to consumers. The fact sheet from June 2000 on the evolution of the cable industry in the US includes details on the Communications Act of 1934, must-carry regulations, and state/local regulation. Federal regulation of expanded basic cable rates ended in March 1999 as mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Additional cable TV topics can be found on the FCC website. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, P.L. 104-104, led to the end of federal regulation of expanded basic cable rates in March 1999. Various reports by CRS cover topics such as broadband internet regulation, cable and satellite television network tiering, digital television overview, digital TV transition, satellite television reauthorization, FCC's \"a la carte\" reports, and the role of the Federal Communications Commission in the changing telecommunications landscape."
