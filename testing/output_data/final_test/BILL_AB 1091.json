    "title": "AB 1091",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following: Section 69432.9 of the Education Code is amended to require Cal Grant applicants to submit a complete official financial aid application. Financial need will be determined using federal financial need methodology for initial eligibility and continued eligibility for Cal Grant awards. The expected family contribution for Cal Grant applicants is determined using federal methodology. Financial need is the cost of attendance minus the expected family contribution. The minimum financial need for Cal Grant A or C awards includes the maximum annual award value plus an additional $1,500. The minimum financial need for Cal Grant B awards is $700. The commission requires a grade point average for all Cal Grant A and B applicants, except for those who can provide test scores instead. The commission requires a grade point average to be submitted electronically for all grade 12 pupils at public schools, excluding social security numbers. Permission may be obtained to submit a social security number if needed for financial aid applications. The commission mandates that grade point averages be submitted with a certification by a school official, subject to review. Regulations allow for a grace period and alternative test scores. The Legislature intends for timely certification to meet application deadlines. The Legislature mandates the commission to provide reports to high schools and school districts identifying grade 12 students who have and have not completed financial aid applications. The school district or charter school must notify grade 12 students by October 15 that they will be considered Cal Grant applicants unless they opt out within a specified time frame. Parents can opt out for students under 18, while students over 18 can opt out themselves. Students can also opt in before the notice period ends. The commission may require electronic submission of high school graduation verification for former grade 12 pupils from public schools, excluding those who opt out. The Legislature intends for schools to verify graduation in time to meet deadlines. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
