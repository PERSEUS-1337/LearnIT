The public lands in California's Carrizo Plain are crucial for preserving endangered species and native wildlife, including the San Joaquin kit fox, blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and pronghorn antelope. The Carrizo Plain in California contains culturally significant sites for indigenous peoples, showcases the San Andreas fault, offers research and recreational opportunities, and has been managed cooperatively since 1985. The Carrizo Plain in California is managed cooperatively by the Bureau of Land Management, the California Department of Fish and Game, and The Nature Conservancy. They work closely together with a joint management plan for public use and enjoyment, focusing on maintaining a fully functioning ecosystem for indigenous species. The management plan for the Carrizo Plain aims to maintain a dynamic ecosystem while allowing for compatible resource uses like livestock grazing and recreation. Establishment of the National Conservation Area. The Carrizo Plain National Conservation Area is established to preserve significant biological, geological, cultural, and recreation values in California. It consists of approximately 250,000 acres of lands and waters, designated for future generations to experience biological diversity and natural beauty. The Secretary must file a legal description of the conservation area with the House and Senate Committees. The description has the same legal effect as if included in the Act. The Secretary can make minor boundary revisions and correct errors in the map and legal description. The map and legal description must be available for public inspection.
