    "content": "The Act titled \"Safe Communities and Safe Schools Mercury Reduction Act of 2005\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings of the Act. The Congress finds that mercury is a bioaccumulative toxin that has increased in concentration due to mining and industrial activities. Common sources of mercury release include breakage of mercury-containing products, manufacturing, and incineration. Mercury deposits pose a significant public health threat in many States, especially to fetuses, infants, and young children. Mercury exposure poses a significant risk to fetuses, infants, and young children in the United States. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of women of childbearing age have mercury levels exceeding safe limits, putting approximately 60,000 babies at risk of developmental harm each year. Elevated mercury exposure from seafood is also linked to an increased risk of infertility in both men and women. Mercury pollution is widespread, with various sources contributing to the problem. Mercury pollution is widespread in the United States, with 43 states issuing fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. The number of mercury advisories has increased by 138% from 1994 to 2002, covering 12,000,000 lake acres and 470,000 river miles. Mercury from thermometers contributes 17 tons to solid waste annually, and mercury spills in schools have led to costly clean-ups. Mercury pollution in the United States is a significant issue, with a spill in Washington, D.C. in 2003 costing over $1,000,000 to clean up and causing a temporary school closure. Mercury-containing thermostats have enough mercury to poison a 60-acre lake for a year, and automobile scrapping is a major source of mercury pollution, releasing about 20,000 pounds of automotive mercury annually in the U.S. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.\" is a concise statement about a grant program without providing specific details. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a program for renewable grants to reduce mercury, educate about its harmful effects, and eliminate mercury from schools. The Administrator will establish procedures for selecting grant recipients to facilitate the recovery and safe disposal of mercury-added components from automobiles. Criteria for selection include project strengths, design adequacy, staff competency, available resources, project duration, and budget appropriateness. The Administrator may use grant funds for recycling programs with over 50% mercury recycled. States are encouraged to develop programs for safe disposal of mercury components from automobiles. $75,000,000 is authorized for this section annually from 2006 to 2009. SEC. 3024. MERCURY. Effective 180 days after enactment, the sale of mercury fever thermometers to consumers is restricted to prescription only. Manufacturers must provide clear instructions on safe handling and cleanup. After 2 years, contractors replacing building thermostats must recycle the old thermostats. Manufacturers of building thermostats must establish recycling programs for old thermostats and educate sellers and installers about the program. A conforming amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act requires this action. The Administrator will publish guidance to help schools remove mercury within a year of the Act's enactment. Thermostats, computers, and vehicles are not included in this guidance. The Administrator will provide an annual report to Congress on the progress of the Act, including a State-by-State summary of mercury reduction efforts, grants awarded, and successful reduction programs. The annual report to Congress will include details on grants received, program success or problems, financial reporting of administration costs, coordination progress between Federal and State Governments, and recommendations for improving the Act's administration. SEC. 7. MERCURY AMALGAM REDUCTION. The Administrator must issue guidelines within 3 years of this Act's enactment for dentists to capture 90% of mercury-laden amalgam when administering or recovering it from patients. Considerations include existing mercury-laden amalgam programs, current dentist practices, waste management, technology availability, and economic costs to meet capture requirements. The curr_chunk discusses structural designs of office buildings, exemption waivers for meeting mercury capture requirements, geographic areas prone to mercury bioaccumulation, and lack of recycling infrastructure for mercury-laden amalgam."
