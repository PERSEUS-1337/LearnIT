Section 604 of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 is amended to require each manufactured home to be supplied with a weather radio capable of broadcasting emergency information related to local weather conditions, equipped with a tone alarm, SAME technology, and compliant with CEA Standard 2009-A. The weather radio required for each manufactured home must comply with CEA Standard 2009-A and is not subject to certain liability protections. The consensus committee must develop a proposed Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must issue a final order for the standard within 90 days of receiving the proposed standard. Additionally, a study is required.

The study will consider severe weather conditions and data from the National Weather Service. The results will be submitted to the Committee on Financial Services within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The study on supplying weather radios in new homes will be conducted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the results will be submitted to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
