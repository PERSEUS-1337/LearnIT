    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Recruiter Secondary Schools Access Act of 2000\". Congress finds that the strong economy, low unemployment rate, and decreased interest in military service make recruiting for the Armed Forces challenging. Intense competition exists for high-quality personnel from other branches, private sector, and educational institutions, making it difficult to meet recruiting goals despite innovative approaches and benefits available. Recruiters face challenges in meeting monthly recruitment goals due to denial of access by some local educational agencies. In 1999, there were thousands of instances of denial for Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force recruiters. Additionally, a significant number of secondary schools nationwide did not release student directory information for recruiting purposes as of 2000. Military recruiters face obstacles in recruiting new enlisted accessions due to the denial of access to directory information about secondary school students. This denial unfairly harms students by limiting their access to information on educational and training incentives offered by the Armed Forces, thus impairing their career decision-making process. The denial of access for Armed Forces recruiters to secondary school students or student directory information hinders national defense by impeding recruitment efforts needed to maintain readiness for national defense. SEC. 3. Local educational agencies denying equal access to secondary schools for military recruiting purposes. The amendment to Section 503 of title 10, United States Code, denies Federal Educational Assistance Funds to local educational agencies that deny recruiting access to the armed forces. The Secretary of Defense maintains a list of such agencies, and they are required to be listed if they deny recruiting access. The Secretary of Defense is required to arrange a meeting with representatives of a local educational agency if they deny recruiting access to the armed forces. If access continues to be denied, the Secretary will notify the Chief Executive of the State where the agency is located. The Secretary of Defense must notify the Chief Executive of the State if a local educational agency continues to deny recruiting access to the armed forces after one year. The term 'local educational agency' includes the governing body of a private secondary educational institution. 'Recruiting access' refers to the Department of Defense's request for access to secondary school students for military recruiting purposes. The term 'State' includes various regions like the District of Columbia and Guam. The local educational agencies in certain regions, including American Samoa, Guam, and Puerto Rico, are subject to transition provisions regarding recruiting access for the Department of Defense. This includes a meeting requirement with an appropriate armed force officer as determined by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense determines appropriate agencies for recruiting access, with a 90-day notification requirement instead of 60 days. The agency is not subject to certain provisions until included on a list by the Secretary of Defense. Terms like \"local educational agency\" and \"recruiting access\" are defined in section 503(d)(4) of title 10, United States Code. Technical amendments are made to section 503 of title 10, United States. Technical amendments are made to section 503 of title 10, United States Code, including changes to subsections (a), (b), and (c) related to recruiting campaigns, compilation of directory information, and recruiting access to secondary schools. SEC. 4. Repeal of exception for student financial assistance from ban on federal grants and contracts to institutions of higher education denying access to ROTC or military recruiters. Section 8120 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 is repealed."
