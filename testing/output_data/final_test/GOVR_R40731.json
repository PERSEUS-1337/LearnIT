    "content": "President Barack Obama did not submit a detailed appropriations request during the first weeks of his administration, instead forwarding an outline of a budget request. Detailed information on the FY2010 Department of Defense (DOD) request was released on May 7, 2009. Representative Chet Edwards (TX/17) reported an original measure, H.R. 3082, to the House on June 26, 2009. On July 9, H.Res. 622 was reported for consideration of H.R. 3082, allowing one hour of general debate. The rule passed on July 10, and the bill was brought to the floor for consideration. The measure passed with a vote of 415-3. Senator Tim Johnson introduced S. 1407 to the Senate on July 7, 2009. H.R. 3082 was received in the Senate on July 13, 2009. The bill was debated in the Senate on November 6. On November 6, 2009, the Senate debated H.R. 3082, which was later passed on November 17 by a vote of 100-0. The bill became part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, after being included in the conference report for H.R. 3288. The House adopted the conference report on December 10 with a vote of 221-202-1. The Senate debated and passed H.R. 3082 on November 17, 2009, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Floor action continued through December 13, culminating in the bill being signed into law as P.L. 111-117 on December 16, 2009. The conference report specified compliance with specific language and allocations unless addressed otherwise. The explanatory statement approved by the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress reiterates some report language for emphasis. Detailed appropriations account-level data for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Related Agencies, and Military Construction and Family Housing are provided in tables. Representative Ike Skelton introduced H.R. 2647, the National Defense Authorization Act for 2010, which was referred to the House Committee on Armed Services. The House Committee on Armed Services reported bill H.R. 2647 on June 16, 2009. The House passed the bill on June 25, and it was received in the Senate on July 6. The Senate introduced S. 1390 on July 2, and after amendments, passed the bill on July 23. The Senate then substituted the language of S. 1390 into H.R. 2647 and requested a conference with the House. The House passed bill H.R. 2647 on June 25, 2009, and the Senate introduced S. 1390 on July 2. After amendments, the Senate passed the bill on July 23 and requested a conference with the House. The House disagreed to an amendment on October 6, 2009, and agreed to a conference. Conferees filed the conference report (H.Rept. 111-288) on October 7, and the House agreed to the report on October 8 by a recorded vote of 281-146. The House and Senate passed bill H.R. 2647, leading to a conference report being agreed upon by both chambers. The Senate invoked cloture on the report, which was then agreed to by both chambers and cleared for the President's signature, becoming P.L. 111-84 on October 28, 2009. Military Construction accounts funded new construction and support for military forces, including the NATO Security Investment Program. The NSIP program in the U.S. covers costs for construction to support NATO commands, including family housing, maintenance, utilities, and military housing privatization. The DOD Housing Improvement Fund supports privatization, while the Homeowners Assistance Fund aids personnel unable to sell homes near closing installations. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account is for defense-wide purposes. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account funds disposal facilities for chemical weapons stockpiles. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 1990 covers environmental remediation from previous BRAC rounds. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 2005 supports military construction and relocation for BRAC and global defense strategy implementation. Funding details are listed in Appendix A of the report. The Secretary of Defense must justify construction projects for the upcoming fiscal year to military committees. Congress requires the Secretary to project future budget plans and review national defense strategy through the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) and Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The FYDP outlines anticipated appropriations requirements for the next five or six years, aiding oversight by tracking changes in DOD plans. President Barack Obama published a budget overview, A New Era of Responsibility: Renewing America's Promise, on February 26, 2009, instead of submitting a complete appropriations request for FY2010 shortly after taking office. Detailed information on the FY2010 DOD request was released on May 7, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates not projecting the Department's future requirements due to the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Congressional defense committees criticized the lack of future planning information provided by the Secretary. The Senate and House Committees on Armed Services criticized the Department of Defense for not including Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) data in the fiscal year 2010 budget, hindering their ability to assess large-scale initiatives and military construction programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee also highlighted the absence of FYDP in the budget submission regarding the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive U.S. investment plan. The Department of Defense is currently undergoing its fourth strategic reassessment, the 2010 QDR. The Secretary of Defense deferred detailed budget documentation submission due to ongoing QDR planning. Section 1002 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 clarified that QDR development should not delay budget submission. The 2010 QDR may impact future military construction programs, including Army modularization, redeployment of forces from Germany, and stationing of new troops. The Secretary of Defense announced a cap on Army Modular Brigade Combat Teams at 45, below the planned 48. $2.10 billion was appropriated in 2009 for military construction to support these BCTs. The decision not to activate three BCTs would reduce the need for new military construction at the sites. The redeployment of existing BCTs from German garrisons to the US and 7th Army Headquarters to a new facility in Wiesbaden, Germany, has been delayed pending the completion of the QDR and a reevaluation of overseas deployment requirements. DOD estimated one-time implementation costs for BRAC 2005 at $34.8 billion, with cost estimates changing as plans are developed for BRAC actions. The DOD estimated one-time implementation costs for the 2005 BRAC round at $34.8 billion, with estimates increasing to over $30.7 billion by FY2008 and $32.0 billion by FY2009. The Obama Administration requested $7.48 billion for FY2010, with the total cost reaching $34.2 billion over the FY2006-2011 period. The House and Senate supported the request for appropriations. The House and Senate supported the request for appropriations for the 2005 BRAC round, agreeing to appropriate $7.46 billion. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act contained language that would have amended the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, redefining the role of the Economic Development Conveyance and restricting the Secretary of Defense's ability to negotiate the fair market value of surplus property. The enacted version of the bill (P.L. 111-84) amended Section 2905 of the BRAC Act to give the Secretary of Defense discretion in assessing the amount of consideration for surplus property, taking into account local economic conditions and infrastructure needs. The Secretary can now accept various forms of consideration instead of cash value. The BRAC Commission recommends establishing a joint pilot training school for the F-35 Thunderbolt II at Eglin AFB. The FY2010 budget includes funding to relocate Marines and their families from Okinawa to the U.S. Territory. House Committees recommend fully funding construction projects through the Air Force account. The relocation of Marines and their families from Okinawa to Guam is funded by Japan and the United States. A replacement facility for the Marine aviation facility at Futenma will be built in Okinawa, with units redeployed to Camp Schwab. The Office of Management and Budget objected to a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 regarding the certification of the Futenma Replacement Facility. Over $10.2 billion in joint construction funding is allocated for the relocation. The relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam is funded by Japan and the United States, with over $10.2 billion allocated for joint construction funding. Negotiations between the two countries have been delayed due to the recent election in Japan, but the relocation is expected to be completed by 2014. The House-passed version of H.R. 2647 includes provisions related to construction supporting the relocation, such as ensuring construction workers are paid at least the lowest wage rates for comparable work in Hawaii. Admiral Robert F. Willard, USN, highlighted the significant wage rate difference between Hawaii and Guam for construction work. The estimated $10.27B cost to relocate Marines to Guam was based on historical Guam wages. Japan's fixed funding agreement means any additional costs will require more U.S. funding. Applying Hawaii wage rates to Guam could increase labor costs by $4.7B. Section 2833 limits construction work hours for H2B visa holders. The SASC noted an ongoing Environmental Impact Statement for Guam construction. Construction on Guam is underway, but a comprehensive master plan detailing military construction and infrastructure upgrades required for the relocation has not been submitted. The Guam Master Plan is further delayed, with some construction projects deferred pending the submission of the plan. The Navy construction authorization was reduced by $211.0 million, and Japan has appropriated $366.0 million for Guam development. Local wage rates apply to military construction contracts for the realignment. The bill requires local wage rates for military construction contracts related to the realignment of military installations and personnel relocation to Guam. It also allows for an unlimited number of visa holders to work on construction projects, with visas issued after a temporary labor certification by the Governor of Guam. Acceptance of the Futenma Replacement Facility is contingent on a report by the Secretary of Defense confirming compliance with naval aviation safety requirements. The FY2010 appropriations request includes $1.41 billion for overseas contingency construction projects. The FY2010 appropriations request includes $1.41 billion for overseas contingency construction projects, including funding for construction at a new site in Oman requested by the Omani government. The FY2010 appropriations request for construction projects in Oman, totaling $116 million, was denied due to lack of a base master plan, incomplete agreements with the Omani government, and absence of Omani contributions. The authorization act did not approve the funds, and DOD was advised to secure a host nation agreement before resubmitting the project in the future. The SASC report on S. 1390 highlighted the Integrated Global Posture and Basing Strategy (IGPBS) released by President George W. Bush in 2004, later renamed the Global Defense Posture Realignment Strategy (GDPRS). Section 2704 of S. 1390 would have required the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on overseas base closures and realignments resulting from changes in DOD's basing strategy. This section also aimed to amend the governing law of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) to require an additional report on the global impact of each QDR. The National Defense Authorization Act required an additional report on the impact of each Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) on the global posture of U.S. military forces. The report also addressed the plan for basing forces outside of the United States, focusing on supporting international security agreements and assessing the impact of any permanent changes in unit basing on overseas base closure and realignment actions. The report on overseas base closure and realignment actions includes the Secretary's recommendations and notifications to Congress. Construction at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti has been supported by emergency appropriations, with new projects requested in 2010. AFRICOM headquarters is located in Stuttgart. The SAC observed that AFRICOM headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany, with Camp Lemonier as its sole installation in the AFRICOM area. The committee delayed construction pending the 2010 QDR release and instructed DOD to submit a strategic infrastructure plan by April 30, 2010. The SASC expressed concern about CJTF-HOA's future mission and directed the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on AFRICOM's ability to sustain operations. The final authorization act did not include this language. The Department of the Army reported on housing for 65,000 new troops at initial training facilities. The House recommended $450 million for troop barracks modernization, reduced to $350 million in the conference agreement. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative has transferred responsibility and cost to private enterprise for military family housing at 100 installations, reducing the need for appropriated funds. The total military family housing appropriation request for FY2010 is $1.96 billion, 62% of the FY2009 level. The military family housing appropriation request for FY2010 is $1.96 billion, which is 62% of the FY2009 level. Military construction projects are often requested and funded in discrete phases, with each phase considered independent. The use of phased construction can lead to inefficiencies on large-scale projects. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) supported full authorization for major projects but only authorized partial funding based on the military department's ability to execute annual increments. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) objected to incremental funding, preferring \"full funding.\" The House Appropriations Committee (HAC) emphasized the drawbacks of phased construction on large-scale projects. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and the Senate committee support incremental funding for certain large military construction projects, despite administration policy favoring full funding. The conferees believe projects should be fully funded or phased when practical, but incremental funding can be beneficial in some cases. Six construction projects were identified for incremental funding in the final bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 authorized full funding and incremental appropriations for hospital replacement projects on Guam and at Ft. Bliss, TX. Navy and Marine crews practice shipboard landing techniques at Outlying Landing Fields like OLF Fentress in Virginia Beach, VA. The airstrip near Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, VA, used for training purposes, is being relocated due to residential encroachment. The Navy's plan for a new airfield between Plymouth, VA, and Pantego, NC was rejected, leading to a search for alternative locations. Congress repealed the Navy's authorization to acquire the land, prompting the Department to explore other Outlying Landing Field (OLF) options. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) recommended specific measures in their statutory language regarding the establishment of Navy Outlying Landing Fields (OLF). Section 2818 of H.R. 2647 would prevent the Secretary of the Navy from establishing an OLF at a location where local political jurisdiction opposes it. Section 2819 would prohibit OLFs at Sand Banks or Hale's Lake, NC. The enacted version of H.R. 2647 did not include these provisions. In the 1980s, the Department of the Army acquired land near Ft. Carson, CO, for troop maneuvering. The Department of the Army acquired land near Ft. Carson, CO in the 1980s for troop maneuvering. Efforts to add 450,000 acres to the Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMTA) raised concerns of public condemnation. Legislation in FY2008 and FY2009 restricted military construction funds for Pi\u00f1on Canyon expansion. This restriction continues in the enacted appropriations bill. The Department of Defense requested relief from restrictions on new military construction projects in the absence of annual appropriations. Military installations are expected to see an increase in personnel due to various factors. Impact Aid Program payments support school attendance for military personnel's children in areas where federal property is exempt from local taxation. The Impact Aid Program provides federal support for school attendance in local districts with military family school children. Challenges arise with retroactive payments based on annual census data, making it difficult for jurisdictions to prepare for sudden influxes of students. The HAC directed DOD to explore proactive assistance for school construction and renovation. The Obama Administration announced a restructuring of the defense plan in Europe, opting for a Navy-based missile defense system over fixed sites in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Senate accepted an amendment to rescind funds for a missile defense plan and allocate $68.5 million for a new Aegis Ashore Test Facility. The Obama Administration requested $46.0 million for a Cooperative Security Location at Palanquero Air Base in Colombia for various operations in South America. The appropriations provided $43.0 million for a Cooperative Security Location at Palanquero Air Base in Colombia, which includes operations facilities, aircraft infrastructure, and utility improvements. The funding is not meant to establish a permanent U.S. military presence in Colombia. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs for veterans through three primary organizations. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs for veterans through three primary organizations: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and benefits available to veterans include service-connected disability compensation, pensions for low-income elderly or disabled veterans, vocational rehabilitation, medical care, life insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational/training benefits. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased from $58.10 billion in FY2003 to $95.95 billion in FY2009, with a proposed budget of $108.9 billion for FY2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, with increases in compensation, pension, and readjustment benefits. H.R. 3082 and S. 1407 proposed funding for VA medical care and education benefits. H.R. 3082 allocated $108.86 billion for FY2010 and $48.18 billion for FY2011, while S. 1407 allocated $109.06 billion for FY2010. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117) provided approximately $45.1 billion for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in advance FY2011 funding for medical care, including increases in funding for compensation, pensions, and readjustment benefits. This amount includes funding for medical services, support, compliance, facilities, and research accounts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117) provides approximately $48.2 billion in advance appropriations for the VA in FY2011, with an equal split between mandatory and discretionary funding. The American Battle Monuments Commission is responsible for maintaining U.S. monuments and memorials honoring the achievements of the armed forces since World War I. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversees monuments and markers honoring U.S. armed forces in foreign countries and on U.S. soil. It maintains 24 cemeteries and 25 memorials. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, established in 1988, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals and compel action by the VA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has the authority to review and overturn decisions made by the VA or the Board of Veterans' Appeals. It is currently looking for a permanent location as its lease expires in September 2010. Arlington National Cemetery, managed by the Secretary of the Army, hosts numerous ceremonies and millions of visitors annually. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports the operation of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC. The Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC and Gulfport, Mississippi provide housing and medical care for needy veterans. The Gulfport facility was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and residents were transferred to the DC location. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed for the rebuilding of the Gulfport facility with a target completion date in 2010, funded by the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund. The Home Trust Fund is funded through gifts, bequests, and a $0.50 per month assessment on military personnel. FY2009 appropriations and FY2010 funding for related agencies are shown in Table 6. President George W. Bush submitted his FY2009 appropriations request to Congress in February 2008. The House passed H.R. 6599 on August 1, 2008, after extensive debate. The Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies reported out its version of the appropriations bill without amendment by a unanimous vote on July 17, 2008. Senator Tim Johnson introduced the measure on July 22, 2008. The military construction appropriations bill was incorporated into an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, and signed into law on September 30, 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was introduced to Congress by Representative David R. Obey and signed into law on February 16, 2009. It added $4.28 billion to military construction, family housing, and veterans affairs appropriations, increasing DOD accounts by $2.88 billion and Department of Veterans Affairs accounts by $1.40 billion. The House passed a supplemental appropriations bill (H.R. 2346) introduced by Representative Obey on May 12, 2009, consolidating funds requested by the Administration for various purposes.
