    "title": "AB 1688",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 361.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to address the court's process when ordering the removal of a child. The court must first determine if there is a non-residing parent who wishes to take custody of the child. If so, the child may be placed with that parent unless it is deemed detrimental to the child's well-being. The parent's enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program that allows for child residency is not automatically considered harmful. If the court places the child with a parent, it may order legal and physical custody to that parent, with visitation rights for the noncustodial parent. The court's jurisdiction over the child will end, and the custody order can only be changed by the superior court. The juvenile court's order must be filed in any domestic relation proceeding between the parents. The court may order a parent to assume custody of the child, subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, with a home visit required within three months. The court will consider any concerns raised by the current caregiver before making a decision. After the social worker's home visit and report, the court may take action as described in previous paragraphs, but it is not required as a prerequisite. The court may order a parent to assume custody of the child under juvenile court supervision. Reunification services may be provided to the parent or guardian, or solely to the parent assuming custody. The court will determine custody at review hearings. The court must provide a written or recorded basis for its decision. Family Code provisions apply to child placement. When the court orders removal under Section 361, the child's care is supervised by a social worker and can be placed in the home of a noncustodial parent, a relative, a nonrelative extended family member, a resource family, a foster home, or a home/facility under the Indian Child Welfare Act. The child can be placed in a licensed community care facility or with a foster family agency in a suitable family home certified by the agency. A child placed in a licensed community care facility must have a case plan for short-term, specialized treatment, including transitioning to a less restrictive environment within six months. Placement must be approved by the county child director. The placement of a child in a licensed community care facility must have a case plan for short-term treatment and be approved by the county child welfare department. A child under six years old can only be placed in certain licensed facilities with approval from the county child welfare department. The specialized treatment period for a child in certain licensed facilities should not exceed 120 days unless progress is made towards transitioning the child to a family setting. Extensions require approval every 60 days by the county child welfare department. The facility must offer family reunification services tailored to the child and family, allowing parents 24-hour access, promoting parental involvement, and employing trained staff. This is required when a case plan indicates placement for family reunification services, and if the child's parent is under court jurisdiction or participating in a treatment program at the facility. Placement in the facility allows parents 24-hour access to the child to meet daily needs and access reunification services. Children aged 6 to 12 can be placed in a licensed group home or residential treatment center. The specialized treatment period for children in placement should not exceed six months unless progress is being made towards transitioning the child to a family setting. Extensions require approval every 60 days by the county child welfare department. Children placed in short-term residential treatment centers must meet specific placement requirements. Social workers are not allowed to place dependent children outside the United States unless a judicial finding deems it in the child's best interest, as required by federal law or treaty. The party requesting placement of a child outside the US must prove it is in the child's best interest. Factors considered include placement with relatives, siblings together, contact with potential guardian, physical and medical needs, psychological and emotional needs, social, cultural, and educational needs, and desires of children 12 years and older. The court may authorize placement of a child outside the US if it is in the child's best interest, with consideration for the child's desires if they are 12 years or older. This does not apply to placement with a parent. If a child is removed from their parent's custody, they will be placed in foster care in the parent's county of residence to facilitate reunification, unless there are no suitable placements available. In that case, the child may be placed in a neighboring county. The social worker must consider the potential harm of disrupting the child's placement before making any changes. When a child needs to be placed in a county different from their parent's due to lack of resources, the specific reason for the out-of-county placement must be documented in the child's case plan. If the sending county lacks resources to meet the child's needs, those specific resource needs should also be documented. When a child is placed out of county, the sending county must develop a plan for supervision and visitation, documenting any dangerous behavior that may pose a safety concern. This information will be available in the Child Welfare Services Case Management System. When a child is placed out of county, information regarding any known or suspected dangerous behavior must be provided to the receiving county promptly, even on weekends or holidays. When a child is placed out of county, a formal agreement specifying supervision and visitation must be developed between sending and receiving counties. The receiving county is responsible for providing supervision and visitation, and a completed case plan, including information on dangerous behavior, must be shared with the receiving county. Whenever a social worker needs to place a child outside the county due to lack of suitable placement options within the county, written notice must be given to the parent, child's attorney, and child (if 10 years or older) at least 14 days prior to the placement, unless the child's health is at risk. The notice should explain the reasons for the out-of-county placement. The child or parent can object within seven days, leading to a court hearing within five days. The court may approve out-of-county placement if the child's specific needs require it. (i) When a child is removed from their parents' custody, the court may grant visitation rights to the child's grandparents. The court must specify these rights to the social worker.\n(j) If a child is removed from their parents' custody, the court must consider the presence of siblings and the impact of sibling relationships on the child's placement and legal permanence planning. An agency must place a child in a home that best meets their day-to-day needs, ensuring the caregiver can meet health, safety, and well-being needs, maintain a family setting promoting normal childhood experiences, and allow age-appropriate activities. The foster child's caregiver must use a reasonable and prudent parent standard to determine age-appropriate day-to-day activities. This section will be effective on January 1, 2017. This section of the act, effective January 1, 2017, states that any increase in costs for local agencies due to the act must be funded by the state. Local agencies providing new programs or services beyond funded levels do not require state funding."
