    "content": "Agricultural production can have varying impacts on the environment, such as soil erosion, farm chemical runoff, and overgrazing. Converting grassland prairies and wetlands to crop production can also impact wildlife populations. Farm and ranch operations have traditionally been exempt from many federal environmental regulations, with some pointing out the relatively small number of regulations affecting agriculture compared to other industries. The current federal farm policy addressing environmental concerns is largely voluntary, aiming to encourage agricultural producers to adopt conservation practices through economic incentives. Agriculture's impact on the environment is significant due to its size in the landscape, leading to interest in managing potential environmental impacts while maintaining economic viability. The U.S. EPA and USDA play key roles in environmental protection and agricultural production. State and local governments handle most environmental regulation, while USDA offers assistance for sustainable practices. Some question the effectiveness of voluntary conservation programs, and EPA has faced criticism from lawmakers and industry leaders. Some lawmakers and industry leaders criticize EPA for focusing on agriculture in recent regulatory efforts, claiming overreach. Agricultural industry groups express displeasure with regulatory proposals and associated costs. Environmental groups support some actions but voice concerns about insufficient protection of public health and the environment. Legislative proposals aim to restrict certain actions, while calls for broad regulatory reforms persist. Calls for regulatory reforms, including economic considerations and increased Congressional oversight, are ongoing. Both Senate and House Committees on Agriculture are closely monitoring EPA's regulatory impacts on agriculture. This report discusses selected environmental regulations affecting agriculture without implying their effects. This report focuses on federal regulatory actions impacting agriculture, excluding state and local regulations. It does not cover voluntary actions or USDA programs. The majority of regulations discussed are administered by the EPA, with agriculture being either the direct focus or one of many. The regulatory development and compliance process for federal regulations impacting agriculture can be complex and time-consuming. EPA rules must be adopted by states for regulations to become effective, and state legislatures often review new regulations before they take effect. Implementation of regulations can take years, especially for environmental regulations that must adhere to court-ordered requirements and deadlines. This report has been revised multiple times since its initial release in 2011, with some issues no longer active due to legislation or changes in administration. Congressional interest in environmental regulations affecting agriculture remains, with ongoing oversight. The report is organized under four subheadings: Air, Water, Energy, and Pesticides. Each section includes regulatory actions, current status, and issues raised by the agricultural community. Contact information for additional details is provided. Agricultural production practices generate various substances. Agricultural production practices generate substances that impact air quality, with historical significance dating back to the Dust Bowl era. Federal regulations address issues such as greenhouse gas reporting, emissions from engines, and air quality standards. Issues like soil erosion, particulates, and livestock odor remain concerns. The EPA developed the final Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule in response to the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above certain thresholds in all sectors of the US economy. Covered entities, including suppliers of fossil fuels, manufacturers of vehicles, and owners of electric power plants, are required to report their emissions annually to the EPA if they emit 25,000 tons or more. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, established in 2011, mandates reporting of emissions exceeding certain thresholds. Covered entities must report if they emit 25,000 tons or more of carbon dioxide or equivalent amounts of other GHGs. Initially covering 10,000 facilities in 31 categories, the rule expanded to include 11 additional categories. Agricultural sources subject to the rule include manure management systems emitting methane and nitrous oxide above the threshold. Specifically, beef cattle feedlots, dairy cattle facilities, hog farms, chicken egg production facilities, turkey production, and meat chicken production are identified as potential sources. Approximately 107 livestock facilities nationwide are estimated to require reporting under the rule. Despite being included in the regulated entities, no agricultural sources are currently required to comply with the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule due to funding restrictions imposed by Congress. The rule only requires monitoring and reporting, with no direct measurement of emissions needed. EPA considered but rejected the idea of requiring direct measurement of GHG emissions from manure management systems. The EPA rejected the idea of directly measuring GHG emissions from manure management systems due to cost and complexity. Instead, they allow the use of default factors and site-specific data for calculations. Some agricultural stakeholders questioned why manure management was included in the proposal when other agricultural sources emit larger amounts of methane and nitrous oxide. EPA estimated the annual cost of the rule for affected facilities at $300,000. EPA modified the proposal to remove manure sampling requirements and allow facilities to use default values for estimating emissions. The final rule includes a threshold table (Table 2) to determine reporting requirements based on animal population levels. EPA promulgated standards for GHG emissions from new light duty motor vehicles on May 7, 2010, triggering requirements of the Clean Air Act for stationary sources emitting air pollutants subject to regulation. Agricultural sources like confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) may need a Title V permit if they emit over 100 tons per year of regulated pollutants. The Clean Air Act requires new or modified stationary sources emitting over 100 or 250 tons annually of regulated pollutants to obtain pre-construction permits and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). EPA set higher thresholds for Title V and PSD/BACT requirements for GHG emissions, exempting agricultural sources from needing permits for GHG emissions. Under the GHG \"Tailoring Rule,\" only the nation's largest emitters like power plants and refineries are required to obtain permits for GHG emissions, with a threshold of 75,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. This exempts farms, smaller businesses, and residential structures from permitting requirements and fees. The EPA's June 2010 Tailoring Rule sets a threshold of 75,000 tons of GHG emissions for permits, exempting smaller sources. The agency initially planned to lower the threshold but decided against it. A study will be conducted within five years to assess permitting authorities' ability to administer more inclusive permit programs. Agricultural sources' impact from potential rule changes remains unclear. The FY2010 appropriations act for EPA included a provision prohibiting the issuance of CAA Title V permits for GHG emissions from livestock production. This prohibition was extended in subsequent appropriations measures. Concerns remain about whether agricultural sources will be subject to regulation under future Clean Air Act GHG rules. On June 15, 2004, EPA issued emission control standards for hazardous air pollutants from gasoline- and diesel-powered stationary engines, primarily affecting agricultural operations. The rules, known as the RICE rules, exempted engines from emission controls during startup, shutdown, and malfunction. However, on December 18, 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that emissions must be addressed during all phases of operation, leading to the vacating and remanding of the rules to EPA. The EPA issued final emissions standards for existing stationary engines burning gasoline, natural gas, and landfill gas on August 20, 2010, after the court vacated and remanded the rules due to emission control issues. The rules apply to over 900,000 stationary engines used in various industrial and agricultural settings. EPA stated that most engines used in agriculture are smaller than 300 horsepower and will only be subject to required management practices, not requiring additional control equipment. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are standards for outdoor air intended to protect public health from pollution. Once a NAAQS is set, nonattainment areas must reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve it. State and local governments have up to three years to produce plans outlining measures to reduce pollution levels. The EPA published a final rule revising the PM NAAQS in response to a court order, lowering the allowable average concentration of fine particulate matter in the air. The agricultural community has shown particular interest in these standards due to the impact of particulate matter and ozone on agricultural productivity. The EPA revised the PM NAAQS, reducing the allowable average concentration of PM 2.5 in the air to 12 \u00b5g/m 3. The existing standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 were retained, with the 2006 revisions focusing on strengthening PM 2.5 standards. EPA initiated a periodic review of the PM standards in January 2013. The EPA revised the PM NAAQS in 2006, setting stricter standards for PM 2.5. Nonattainment areas must develop plans to reduce pollutant concentrations to meet the standard by 2020. EPA predicted that only seven counties in California would not meet the new standard by 2020. The EPA designated 120 counties as nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 based on 2006-2008 air quality data. States had until November 2012 to submit plans to bring these areas into compliance with the standard. No new nonattainment areas were designated for PM 10 NAAQS due to unchanged standards in the 2013 revision. Since the 2013 NAAQS revision, no new areas were designated for PM 10 nonattainment. Many counties previously nonattainment have now achieved attainment status. As of February 6, 2014, 49 out of 89 original nonattainment areas for PM 10 were redesignated to maintenance. The remaining 40 areas are either meeting the standards or awaiting redesignation. The PM 10 NAAQS nonattainment areas in California and Arizona, often near populated areas with PM monitors, have SIPs with requirements for various sources, including agricultural operations. The agricultural community is more concerned about potential changes to the PM 10 NAAQS than the PM 2.5 NAAQS. Thoracic coarse particles (PM 10) can come from mechanical processes or dust resuspension, including \"farm dust,\" but also from sources like unpaved roads and traffic emissions. The EPA has noted that urban areas have higher exposures to PM 10 due to traffic emissions, industrial operations, construction activities, and mining operations. Concerns have been raised about the health effects of PM 10 from vehicular, industrial, and construction emissions. Research is ongoing on the toxicity of urban versus rural particles. The EPA is reviewing the PM 10 NAAQS standards and considering the potential impacts on the agricultural industry. Some Members want to retain the current standards, while others suggest including PM 2.5 as an option. Proposed legislation during the 112th Congress addressed the PM NAAQS review, and the final PM NAAQS rule in January 2013 revised the PM 2.5 standard but did not modify the PM 10 standards. EPA is required to review the NAAQS every five years under the Clean Air Act. The EPA reviewed the ozone NAAQS in 2008, making standards more stringent but not within recommended ranges. Court challenges led to a reconsideration in 2010, proposing to strengthen primary standards and revise the secondary standard as advised by scientific experts. Under proposed revisions, most counties with ozone monitors would be in nonattainment of the primary standard, with potential violations of the secondary standard. The EPA delayed finalizing the decision in 2011 at the President's request, aiming to complete a review by October 2015. New monitoring requirements are proposed for states, including more monitors in rural areas. Despite the withdrawal of a stricter standard, air quality is expected to improve due to regulations for vehicles and power plants. The 2015 ozone NAAQS revision could be a significant regulation by EPA, highlighting air quality issues in agricultural areas. Reporting requirements under EPCRA and CERCLA are triggered by releases of substances like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from livestock manure. Citizen suit provisions in both acts have been used against poultry and swine operations. In 2005, poultry producers requested an exemption from EPCRA and CERCLA reporting requirements for air releases from livestock operations. EPA granted a partial exemption for reporting releases to state and local emergency officials, but large CAFOs are still required to report under EPCRA. The final rule exempts smaller CAFOs from EPCRA reporting requirements, effective January 20, 2009. Industry groups challenged the 2008 rule, arguing that CAFOs should be exempt from reporting due to no threat from air emissions. Environmentalists disagreed, stating that air emissions from CAFOs pose a risk to public health and the environment. Legal challenges were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals approved the government's request to remand the 2008 rule for reconsideration. EPA is expected to propose a new rule, but no schedule has been set. The 2008 exemption rule for animal feeding operations remains in effect. Legislation was introduced in Congress to exclude \"manure\" from hazardous substance definitions, but no further action was taken. EPA does not plan to directly regulate air emissions from CAFOs but seeks reporting requirements. Opponents argue that enacting an exemption for animal agriculture operations would hinder government and citizen response to hazardous substance releases. The agriculture industry is concerned about complying with EPCRA reporting requirements, despite exemptions for facilities not subject to Clean Water Act permitting. Critics of the 2008 rule argue that CERCLA and EPCRA reports provide valuable information on emissions. The CERCLA and EPCRA reports provide valuable information on emissions for holding companies accountable. The agriculture industry is worried about potential liability for animal operations if manure is labeled as a \"hazardous substance.\" Agriculture practices can degrade water quality, but there is no comprehensive national study on its impact. Federal environmental laws, like the Clean Water Act, often delegate regulatory responsibilities to states, leading to constraints on agricultural production to reduce pollution. Regulations include Clean Water Act permit requirements for CAFOs, Chesapeake Bay protection, Florida nutrient water quality standards, defining \"waters of the United States,\" and spill prevention plans. Large CAFOs are subject to the act's prohibition against discharging pollutants into U.S. waters without a permit. EPA took action in October 2008. In October 2008, EPA issued a regulation to revise a 2003 Clean Water Act rule governing waste discharges from CAFOs, following a federal court decision. The 2008 rule details requirements for permits, annual reports, and plans for handling manure and wastewater, applying to about 15,300 CAFOs. In response to legal challenges, EPA issued a regulation in 2008 requiring CAFOs to develop nutrient management plans by February 27, 2009. Agricultural industry groups and environmentalists filed lawsuits, which were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In December 2009, EPA settled with environmental plaintiffs and issued guidance in May 2010 to clarify CAFO compliance with clean water regulations. In May 2010, EPA issued guidance to help CAFO owners determine permit needs and settled a lawsuit by agreeing to propose a rule for collecting facility information. In October 2011, EPA proposed the CAFO reporting rule, requiring CAFOs to submit basic operational information to EPA, drawing criticism from industry groups. The EPA proposed a rule for CAFOs to report facility information, which was criticized by industry groups. Environmental advocates supported EPA's authority but felt the rule did not meet requirements from a 2009 settlement agreement. After reviewing public comments, EPA decided not to issue a regulation, citing the ability to obtain necessary information from other sources. The EPA proposed a rule for CAFOs to report facility information, which was criticized by industry groups. In 2010, a settlement agreement committed EPA to proposing a rule, but not to any specific final action. The 2008 CAFO rule faced challenges from agricultural industry groups, leading to a federal court ruling in 2011 that upheld some aspects and vacated others. EPA modified the 2008 CAFO regulations in July 2012 to comply with the court's ruling, while the rest of the rule remained unaffected. The 2008 CAFO rule was partially upheld and partially vacated by a federal court ruling in 2011. The ruling simplified permitting by clarifying the \"duty to apply\" for a permit. The EPA is revising guidance for CAFOs in light of the ruling, but questions remain about implementation, particularly regarding self-certification for farms to avoid permit applications. The 2008 CAFO rule was partially upheld and partially vacated by a federal court ruling in 2011, simplifying permitting for CAFOs. EPA is revising guidance for CAFOs, with concerns about self-certification to avoid permit applications. Some agricultural industry groups fear new rulemaking by EPA could add permit and pathogen control requirements, especially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. EPA's development of new CWA requirements for CAFOs in the Chesapeake Bay region may lead to more regulated CAFOs and stricter permit standards. Many in the agriculture sector worry that these region-specific rules could prompt revisions to the broader 2008 rule. Despite efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay watershed, restoration goals have not been met. While some indicators like blue crabs and bay grasses have shown slight improvement, water quality remains a major concern. The Bay and its tributaries continue to suffer from polluted water, declining fish and shellfish populations, and degraded habitat. Nutrients are the primary pollutants causing impairments. EPA will decide by June 2018 whether a national rulemaking is necessary. The Chesapeake Bay suffers from degraded habitat and resources due to pollutants like nutrients and sediment from various sources. President Obama declared the Bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009, leading to the establishment of a Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay to develop a restoration strategy. This strategy, released in 2010, includes initiatives to regulate stormwater and pollution discharges, implement agricultural conservation practices, and restore land and water habitat. Agriculture is identified as the largest source of nutrients in the Bay. The EPA identifies agriculture as the main source of nutrient and sediment pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, with livestock waste accounting for half of the pollutants. A total maximum daily load (TMDL) is established by the EPA to regulate pollution levels and ensure water quality standards are met. The EPA establishes a total maximum daily load (TMDL) to regulate pollution levels in the Chesapeake Bay, with agriculture identified as the main source of pollutants. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is the largest developed to date, addressing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment discharges to meet water quality standards by 2025. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL aims to have implementation measures in place by 2025 to ensure water quality standards are met. Reductions of pollutants are allocated to all jurisdictions in the watershed, not individual segments. States must prepare Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs) to achieve needed reductions from point and nonpoint sources, with EPA having potential actions if states fail to meet commitments. The EPA has various actions available if a state fails to comply with the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, including expanding permit coverage, requiring offsets, conditioning grants, or increasing federal enforcement. The TMDL was issued ahead of schedule in December 2010, with jurisdictions preparing Phase I WIPs to achieve water quality goals by 2017. The Bay region exceeded its nutrient and sediment reduction goals for 2012-2013, with states reducing nitrogen reaching Chesapeake Bay by 17 million pounds from 2009-2013. Phosphorus reductions were also ahead of schedule. However, reductions from agriculture and stormwater are not on track to meet cleanup goals for 2017 and 2025. Control measures for these sectors will need to be improved. The Bay region exceeded its nutrient and sediment reduction goals for 2012-2013, but reductions from agriculture and stormwater are not on track to meet cleanup goals for 2017 and 2025. Control measures for these sectors will need to be accelerated. EPA agreed to propose Bay-specific rules to expand the universe of regulated CAFOs and propose more stringent permitting requirements for land application of manure, litter, and process wastewater in the Bay watershed. EPA will review compliance with the settlement. Groups announced a revised agreement regarding CAFOs in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. EPA will review compliance with existing permits, assess state programs, and inspect unregulated feedlots. By June 30, 2018, EPA will decide on the need for a national rulemaking. The focus will be on pollution from CAFOs in the Bay region, rather than proposing revisions to the 2008 national CAFO rules. Agricultural groups are concerned about potential increased regulation in the Bay watershed. A federal court upheld the TMDL for the Chesapeake Bay watershed, despite legal challenges from agricultural and home builder groups. Concerns were raised about potential increased regulation in the Bay region, but environmental activists support the federal government's leadership in restoring the Bay. Legislation supporting Bay TMDL requirements and grants for restoration was introduced in the 111th and 112th Congresses. House Agriculture Committee approved legislation expanding USDA's role in Bay restoration. Legislation giving states authority over nutrient and sediment limits for the Bay was introduced in the 112th Congress but not enacted. The Clean Water Act directs states to adopt water quality standards, with EPA able to intervene if necessary. Florida's water quality issues stem from nutrient pollution, leading to EPA action in 2009 to address existing standards. In 2009, EPA determined that Florida's water quality standards for nutrients needed to be revised with numeric criteria. A consent decree with environmental litigants required EPA to establish these standards by November 15, 2010. The standards do not directly impose requirements on polluters until translated into permit limits by the state. EPA prefers Florida to implement its own criteria. In 2009, EPA determined Florida's water quality standards needed revision with numeric criteria. EPA delayed the 2010 rule's effective date multiple times to allow the state to complete its process. In March 2013, EPA and the state agreed for Florida to determine numeric limits on nutrient pollution in waterways. Florida pledged to set criteria for waterways through rulemaking and legislation. The proposed state legislation in Florida aims to establish numeric nutrient criteria for waterways by December 1, 2014. EPA approved the state's plan for controlling nutrient pollution and petitioned the federal court to approve the water quality standards. The court agreed to amend the 2009 consent decree, lifting the requirement for EPA to issue numeric nutrient standards. EPA proposed to withdraw its numeric nutrient criteria for Florida waters in April. Industry groups endorsed the agreement and court's modification of the consent. The court's modification of the consent decree for Florida waters was endorsed by industry groups, but criticized by environmental advocacy groups for lacking essential elements and exempting certain water bodies. The legal challenge to the plan was rejected in January 2014, but environmental groups have appealed. Disputes over the data, costs, and administrative flexibility of EPA's rule on nutrient reduction in Florida's waters continue, with concerns from agricultural groups about numeric standards. Some groups fear EPA's numeric nutrient standards in Florida will lead to costly pollution controls, but EPA argues it's necessary for waterway health and the economy. Concerns about setting a precedent for similar regulations elsewhere have been raised, with petitions for numeric nutrient standards in other states. EPA Administrator reassures that EPA is not overstepping its authority. In testimony before the House Agriculture Committee, the EPA Administrator stated that EPA is not working on federal numeric nutrient limits, emphasizing that states should handle nutrient pollution through various tools. Congress has also addressed these issues, with oversight hearings held in 2011. Legislation in the 113th Congress (H.R. 1948) aims to restrict EPA's oversight of state water quality standards. Controversies persist despite EPA's approval of Florida's rules. Controversies persist over Florida's wetlands regulations, particularly regarding the Clean Water Act's Section 404 permitting requirements. The Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 have shaped the interpretation of the CWA's regulatory scope, specifically in determining which waters fall under the \"waters of the United States\" designation. The Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 narrowed the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act (CWA), leading to confusion. To address this, the Bush and Obama administrations issued guidance documents, but questions remained. In 2014, the EPA and Army Corps proposed a rule to define the scope of protected waters under the CWA, aiming to clarify regulations in place for over 25 years. The EPA and Army Corps proposed a rule to clarify regulations for protected waters under the Clean Water Act, relying on scientific reports and seeking review from the Science Advisory Board before issuing a final rule. They believe the proposed rule aligns with the Supreme Court's narrow reading of jurisdiction. In 1977, Congress amended the Clean Water Act to exempt farming, ranching, and silviculture activities from certain permit requirements. The act also excludes agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture. Prior converted cropland is also excluded from the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" The 2014 proposed rule does not change these exemptions. Additionally, an interpretive rule identifies 56 conservation practices approved by the USDA that qualify for exemption under the \"normal farming\" activities exclusion. The interpretive rule clarifies that producers using 56 identified conservation practices according to USDA standards are exempt from seeking CWA permits. The agencies are accepting public comments on the rule until October 20, 2014. The process of finalizing a rule can take about a year, with complex rules potentially taking longer. Legal challenges post-finalization can further delay implementation for years. The agriculture sector has been critical of EPA regulations, particularly concerning the impact on agricultural operations. Concerns about potential modifications to exemptions for agricultural discharges under the new \"waters of the United States\" rule have been raised, but the proposed rule does not change these exemptions. The Clean Water Act mandated regulations to prevent oil discharge from various sources, with EPA crafting regulations for non-transportation-related facilities in 1973. Facilities must prepare and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plans if they could discharge oil to U.S. navigable waters or shorelines. Some in agriculture find the interpretive rule confusing, which clarifies exemptions for agricultural conservation practices under Section 404. The SPCC regulations require facilities with certain oil storage capacities to have secondary containment measures and certified plans. Changes and clarifications to the regulations were finalized in July 2002, with compliance deadlines extended multiple times. The deadline for complying with changes made in 2002 was November 10, 2011, but EPA extended it for farms to May 10, 2013. Congress enacted P.L. 113-6 on March 26, 2013, prohibiting EPA from enforcing SPCC provisions at farms until September 22, 2013. Recent SPCC issues focus on program scope and applicability, resulting in legislation altering the rules for farms subject to SPCC. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) changed the applicability of SPCC regulations for farms. Farms with storage capacities below certain thresholds are now exempt from SPCC regulations or can self-certify their SPCC plan without hiring a professional engineer. In April 2011, EPA exempted milk and milk product containers from SPCC requirements due to industry standards and regulation by other agencies like USDA. In November 2009, EPA exempted pesticide application equipment and clarified nurse tanks as mobile refuelers exempt from secondary containment rules. The agricultural industry is sensitive to energy source fluctuations and costs, with federal policies promoting bioenergy as an alternative to fossil fuels. Amendments exempting milk containers and pesticide equipment from SPCC requirements have resulted in cost savings for farm owners. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel standard, requiring U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum amount of biofuel to support domestic production. The 2013 mandate was 16.55 billion gallons of biofuels, increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022, with a focus on advanced biofuels. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel standard, requiring U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum amount of biofuel to support domestic production. The 2013 mandate was 16.55 billion gallons of biofuels, increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022, with a focus on advanced biofuels. EPA classifies biofuel production based on lifecycle emissions, with advanced biofuels needing a 50% reduction in GHG emissions relative to petroleum fuels. Cellulosic biofuels must achieve a 60% reduction, while new corn ethanol plants must achieve a 20% reduction. EPA sets annual standards under the RFS each November based on gasoline and diesel projections from the EIA. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel standard, requiring U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum amount of biofuel to support domestic production. EPA sets annual standards under the RFS each November based on projections from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). EPA is required to set the cellulosic biofuel standard each year based on projections and assessments of production capability from industry. EPA proposed substantial reductions to the statutory RFS mandates for cellulosic biofuels from 2010 to 2014 due to insufficient production capacity. Cellulosic biofuel production failed to meet standards for 2010-2013, leading to fuel companies purchasing waiver credits from the EPA. In February 2013, EPA revised the 2012 RFS for cellulosic biofuels to zero under remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals. In response to challenges in meeting biofuels mandates, EPA revised the 2012 and 2011 RFS for cellulosic biofuels to zero. The 2013 cellulosic biofuel standard was reduced to approximately 810,000 ethanol-equivalent gallons. The blend wall and declining national transportation fuel consumption have limited renewable fuel consumption. EPA is expected to announce the final 2014 RFS mandate in June, supporting U.S. biofuels industries, especially corn-based ethanol producers. The expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is seen as crucial for supporting U.S. biodiesel production capacity and driving the development of biofuels from cellulose, algae, and other non-food/feed commodities. However, challenges such as infrastructure limitations and the blend wall may hinder the achievement of biofuels blending and consumption goals, potentially leading to unintended economic consequences if the RFS is imposed under such conditions. The initial biofuels expansion from 2006 to 2010 faced less obstruction by the blend wall, contributing to pressure on the industry. The increased usage of biofuels before the blend wall led to higher prices for agricultural commodities, particularly corn, which affected the livestock sector. This cost squeeze was exacerbated by a severe drought in 2012, raising concerns about ethanol-induced corn shortages for livestock and poultry producers. Since 2010, corn use for ethanol and production have plateaued. The blend wall and normal weather conditions have reduced corn shortages, making ethanol consumption more feasible. However, without infrastructure developments, reaching the RFS ceiling of 15 billion gallons by 2015 may be challenging. Corn ethanol's impact on other markets is diminishing as corn yields surpass biofuels. The cellulosic biofuels industry faces challenges in meeting RFS mandates due to infrastructure constraints and past failures in production. Policy makers may consider scaling back or eliminating mandates. Industry argues it can meet mandates if obstacles like high conversion costs and financing access are addressed. The cellulosic biofuels industry faces challenges in meeting RFS mandates due to infrastructure constraints and past failures in production. Policy makers may consider scaling back or eliminating mandates. Industry argues it can meet mandates if obstacles like high conversion costs and financing access are addressed. Government approval, environmental regulations, feedstock supply uncertainties, tax incentives, and the blend wall are key factors affecting the future of the industry. EISA requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, with ethanol being a major component. However, the use of ethanol in gasoline is limited to 10% (E10) due to EPA guidance and vehicle warranties. The RFS mandates over 16 billion gallons of ethanol in 2013, but the volume is constrained by gasoline consumption. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates over 16 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2013, but ethanol blending is limited to 10% due to the \"blend wall.\" EPA has proposed a total RFS of 15.21 billion gallons for 2014, lower than required in 2013, due to concerns about infrastructure limitations. The EPA granted a partial waiver in 2010 allowing the use of E15 in newer vehicles, with a decision on older vehicles delayed until testing was completed. In 2011, the waiver was expanded to include older vehicles as well. The EPA granted a partial waiver in 2010 allowing the use of E15 in newer vehicles, with a decision on older vehicles delayed until testing was completed. However, concerns over potential damage by E15 to equipment not designed for its use led to a denial of a waiver for MY2000 and older vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles, and non-road applications. Despite the waiver, other factors such as retail and blending infrastructure, state and local laws, and manufacturers' warranties still needed to be addressed. The waiver decision faced legal challenges but was ultimately upheld. In the 112th Congress, there was an attempt to block EPA from implementing the waiver decision using FY2011 funds. In the 113th Congress, legislation has been proposed to overturn EPA's E15 decision and bar further waivers. EPA approved a misfueling mitigation plan submitted by the Renewable Fuels Association, allowing companies to develop their own plans. This could signal federal support for meeting RFS mandate levels and stimulate new investment in the biofuels sector, benefiting the corn ethanol industry. EPA approval of the waiver request could help open the door to E15 blending. In the short run, the corn ethanol industry would benefit from expanding RFS mandates, potentially intensifying agricultural resource use. EPA's proposed 2014 RFS mandate is lower than statutory levels, hindering E15 rollout. Addressing concerns over E15 use in legacy equipment is crucial for its expansion to retail stations. The expansion of E15 faces challenges including state laws, vehicle warranties, and fuel suppliers' reluctance. Legal challenges to the EPA's E15 waiver were dismissed by the courts. Agricultural pests, such as insects, plant pathogens, weeds, and vertebrates, can harm crop yields. Pesticides are used in agriculture to prevent these pests, but they pose risks to human health and the environment. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) regulates pesticides at the federal level through the EPA. Regulation of pesticides requires routine re-evaluations of risks to reflect the latest scientific understanding. Key issues include Clean Water Act permits for pesticide application, pesticide spray drift, atrazine, and pesticide registration under the Endangered Species Act. EPA previously did not require CWA permits for FIFRA-approved materials. EPA's interpretation and operating practice regarding the need for CWA permits for FIFRA-approved pesticides have been challenged in court cases. The issue arose over pesticide application in waters and whether CWA permits are necessary. Litigation created uncertainty over the requirement for CWA water discharge permits for pesticide application. In 2006, EPA issued a regulation to clarify the need for CWA permits for pesticides applied to waterbodies. However, a federal court vacated the rule in 2009, requiring those who spray pesticides near water to obtain a CWA permit. EPA then issued a pesticide general permit in 2011 to comply with the court's ruling. The EPA issued a pesticide general permit in 2011 to comply with a court ruling, affecting approximately 5.6 million applications annually for mosquito control, aquatic weed control, aquatic animal control, and forest pest control. The permit covers 500 pesticide active ingredients and applies to various entities including agricultural interests, pesticide manufacturers, vector control districts, and utilities. The EPA pesticide general permit issued in 2011 covers various entities such as agricultural interests, pesticide manufacturers, vector control districts, and utilities. Operators are required to minimize pesticide discharges to waters and prepare pesticide discharge management plans. Monitoring for adverse effects in treatment areas and water bodies is mandatory. Agricultural stormwater runoff and irrigation return flow are exempt from the permit, as well as terrestrial pesticide applications for agricultural crops and forest floors. The EPA pesticide general permit issued in 2011 covers various entities such as agricultural interests, pesticide manufacturers, vector control districts, and utilities. The permit applies in states where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority and serves as a model for other states to develop their own permits. Most entities are automatically covered, while some pesticide applicators with significant discharges must submit a notice of intent to be covered. Federal or state agencies conducting pest management and special-purpose districts responsible for pest control must comply with the permit. In January 2012, a permit was issued requiring entities like agricultural interests, pesticide manufacturers, and special-purpose districts to submit a notice of intent for pesticide application activities. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to exempt certain pesticide uses from permit requirements, but these bills have not been enacted. General permits cover categories of point sources with common elements and discharge the same types of wastes, allowing efficient resource allocation by permitting authorities. Streamlined procedures compared to individual permits are a benefit, but concerns from agricultural industry groups exist regarding potential burdensome and costly requirements. Pesticide spray drift, movement of pesticides through the air post-application, is a concern for stakeholders, including the agricultural community. Many stakeholders, including those in the agricultural community, have expressed concerns to states and EPA about the risks of exposure to pesticide spray drift. These risks include potential harm to applicators, bystanders, non-target animals, and plants. Stakeholders are cautious about the restrictions EPA may impose to prevent adverse effects from spray drift. Citizen petitions and lawsuits have been filed against EPA by environmental advocacy groups regarding pesticide spray drift. EPA evaluates potential risks from spray drift when registering pesticides under FIFRA and may require specific tests for proposed application methods that could result in spray drift. EPA regulates pesticide spray drift to protect against potential harm to applicators, bystanders, and the environment. The agency may require specific tests for application methods that could result in drift, and manufacturers must comply with label restrictions. EPA has proposed guidance to reduce spray drift and initiated a voluntary program for drift reduction technology. EPA is evaluating a drift reduction technology verification protocol for spray drift. They have proposed guidance for evaluating risks from pesticide spray drift and are seeking feedback on refining models for estimating drift exposure. Pesticide manufacturers and applicators are concerned about potential overly restrictive measures resulting from the proposed risk assessment methodologies. The EPA is considering a drift reduction technology verification protocol for spray drift, with proposed guidance for evaluating risks from pesticide spray drift. Concerns have been raised by pesticide manufacturers and applicators about potential restrictive measures resulting from the proposed risk assessment methodologies. Environmental advocacy groups argue that the EPA's proposal does not adequately address off-target spray drift concerns, particularly in relation to neighboring organic farm operations. The herbicide atrazine, widely used in the US, has raised concerns due to its presence in surface and drinking water and potential hormonal disruption in animals. The EPA has extensively reviewed the herbicide atrazine due to concerns about its potential hormonal disruption in animals. In 2006, the agency issued a re-registration eligibility decision for atrazine, requiring certain risk mitigation measures for continued registration. In 2009, the EPA requested assistance from its FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel to review new information about atrazine. The EPA requested assistance from its FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) to review new information about atrazine from human epidemiological studies, laboratory animals, and wildlife. Six SAP meetings were held from 2009 to 2012 to consider this information. In 2011, a citizen petition requested a federal ban on atrazine, which was denied in August 2013. EPA initiated a periodic review of atrazine's registration in June 2013, with a decision expected in 2016. The EPA is conducting a registration review of atrazine, with separate assessments on ecological, human health, and other risks. Registrants are not required to provide new information. The public can comment on draft risk assessments and the proposed decision. EPA will determine if further regulatory restrictions are needed. A \"Special Review\" initiated in 1994 on atrazine and related pesticides is ongoing. Manufacturers and users have concerns about frequent EPA reviews. Agricultural users of atrazine are concerned about potential new restrictions or cancellation of its uses by the EPA. They argue that atrazine is a cost-effective measure that helps increase crop yields. On the other hand, public health and environmental advocates believe that new restrictions may be necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment. The Endangered Species Act aims to protect endangered species and their habitats. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for certain species. Dwindling species are listed as endangered or threatened, allowing legal tools for recovery and habitat protection. The ESA prohibits activities like harming or killing listed species on privately owned land. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is enforced by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for endangered or threatened species. Federal actions must undergo a biological assessment to determine if consultation is needed to ensure actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. This process is known as a Section 7 consultation and includes activities authorized, funded, or carried out by federal agencies. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS and/or NMFS on potential impacts of pesticides on listed species and critical habitat. EPA's decisions on pesticide regulation have led to citizen lawsuits for non-compliance with ESA requirements. EPA announced the availability of a final paper in 2013 describing these issues. In 2013, EPA, USDA, NMFS, and FWS jointly prepared a final paper outlining changes to EPA's registration review process to facilitate ESA consultations. The paper aims to enhance stakeholder input and promote earlier and more wide-ranging consultations among federal agencies during pesticide risk assessments. EPA's obligation to consult with FWS and/or NMFS on actions and avoid jeopardy under ESA remained unchanged. Additionally, in 2013, the National Research Council (NRC) published a report with recommendations on scientific and technical issues. The NRC recommended a common approach for EPA, NMFS, and FWS to conduct risk assessments for species listed under the ESA from pesticide exposures. Progress has been made in implementing these recommendations, including the development of interim approaches for pesticide registration reviews. The Agriculture Act of 2014 directs EPA, USDA, NMFS, and FWS to submit reports on the implementation of NRC recommendations. The EPA, USDA, NMFS, and FWS are implementing NRC recommendations that may impact how pesticides are assessed for risk to listed species. This could lead to restrictions on pesticide applications, including in agricultural areas. Stakeholders are expressing concerns about the revised approach for integrating ESA requirements into the pesticide registration process. The environmental community is actively litigating against the EPA to protect listed species from pesticides registered under FIFRA.
