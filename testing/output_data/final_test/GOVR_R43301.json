    "content": "Many federally funded programs for unemployed workers are coordinated through state- and locally run American Job Centers (AJCs). These centers offer income support, reemployment, and training services, operated by state and local workforce development boards. Approximately 2,500 AJC locations nationwide provide services to meet the needs of the local labor market, established by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 established federal funding streams coordinated through state and locally run American Job Centers (AJCs). The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 amended and reauthorized many programs under WIA. This report provides an overview of programs administered through the AJC system, focusing on eligibility requirements and available benefits and services. It does not cover the roles of state agency grantees and local workforce boards. Readers can consult CRS products for more information. AJC partner programs are divided into groups and subgroups, with unemployment insurance offering weekly cash payments. Unemployment insurance provides cash payments to workers who lost their job involuntarily. Grant programs support employment and training services at a national level, with some being more narrow in scope. Mandatory partner programs in the AJC system focus on providing workforce-related benefits to individuals. Unemployment insurance (UI) provides weekly cash payments to workers who involuntarily become unemployed. There are two programs authorized within the UI system: Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Extended Benefits (EB). Federal laws provide guidelines on UC benefit coverage, eligibility, and determination, with each state having its own program. When eligible workers lose their jobs, UC benefits may provide income support. The UC program provides benefits to workers who become involuntarily unemployed for economic reasons, based on state eligibility rules. EB benefits may be available to those who exhaust UC benefits, depending on worker eligibility and economic conditions. No EB benefits were available in FY2016 or FY2017 so far. To receive Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits, claimants must meet state earnings requirements and are typically ineligible if they quit voluntarily, were discharged for misconduct, or refused suitable work. UC is funded by federal and state taxes, with maximum weekly benefits ranging from $133 to $742 in January 2017. The average weekly benefit in April 2017 was $348, with regular benefits available for up to 26 weeks. The Extended Benefits (EB) program can extend benefits based on state economic conditions, triggered by the insured unemployment rate. The Extended Benefits (EB) program is permanently authorized and triggered by state unemployment rates reaching certain levels. States must pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the insured unemployment rate (IUR) is at least 5% and meets specific criteria. Optional thresholds allow for additional weeks of benefits based on different unemployment rate thresholds. Claimants must meet EB program requirements in addition to regular UC eligibility criteria. The EB program requires claimants to have 20 weeks of full-time insured employment in their base period and conduct a sustained work search. EB benefits are equal to regular UC benefits, with the federal government financing 50% of payments and 100% of administrative costs. States fund the other 50% of benefit costs. The AJC network coordinates federally funded employment and training programs, which may have funding limitations. The AJC network coordinates federally funded employment and training programs with funding limitations. Table 3 provides descriptions of partner programs and their funding levels. AJC funding comes from grants present in all states, providing funding through various processes. Partner programs are divided into three groups based on eligibility criteria: Programs for all jobseekers, Programs for specific job loss circumstances, and Programs for jobseeker characteristics. Table 2 summarizes eligibility criteria. The WIOA-authorized formula grant program provides funds to states for employment and training services for individuals ages 18 and older, with no additional eligibility requirements other than age. Services include job search assistance, skill assessment, career planning, case management, and training. Funding levels are capped by annual appropriation levels, leading to potential limitations in services during high demand periods. The Wagner-Peyser Act established the Employment Service (ES) to facilitate the match between job seekers and employers. ES offers services like career counseling, job search workshops, and referrals to job openings. Training is provided through a voucher system at eligible training providers. Jobseekers, including UI recipients, can register with ES for assistance. The Employment Service (ES) provides job listings, applicant screening, and referrals to job openings through three tiers of service delivery. ES offices also administer the UC \"work test\" requirements for UC claimants to ensure they are able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. Education activities under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) are a mandatory partner for ES. AEFLA provides formula grants to states for basic educational services and English language courses. The Dislocated Worker program provides services to workers who are involuntarily separated from their jobs. To qualify, individuals must have been laid off, eligible for unemployment benefits, and unlikely to return to their previous occupation. Services include job search assistance, skill assessment, career planning, and case management. The Dislocated Worker program offers job search assistance, skill assessment, career planning, case management, and training. 80% of funds go to states for training unemployed individuals, while the rest is for National Dislocated Worker Grants for major economic dislocations. TAA benefits may be available for workers affected by outsourcing or increased imports. The TAA program provides reemployment services, training subsidies, and income support for eligible workers, including a wage insurance program for workers aged 50 and over. State VR agencies offer customized employment services to individuals with disabilities funded by federal grants and state funds, requiring applicants to demonstrate a barrier to employment due to a physical or mental impairment. Services may include counseling and other support. The Job Corps program offers customized services such as counseling, job search assistance, training, and workplace support to low-income individuals aged 16-24. Its goal is to equip disadvantaged youth with skills for employment, military service, or further education. Additionally, the program provides academic support, work-based learning, and counseling services. This state grant program, authorized by WIOA, funds training and related services for eligible youth aged 14 and above. Eligible individuals aged 14-21 (or 24 for out-of-school youth) can receive services funded by the program based on income and barriers to employment criteria. Services include academic and employment assistance, skill development, employer connections, and support services. CSEOA (SCSEP) provides part-time employment opportunities for low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The CSEOA program offers subsidized employment for low-income individuals aged 55 and older who have limited job prospects. Participants engage in community-service activities and receive training, counseling, and placement assistance. JVSG grants fund state personnel positions to provide employment services for veterans, including Disabled Veteran Outreach Program (DVOP) and Local Veterans' Employment Representative (LVER) personnel. DVOP personnel assist disabled and high-need veterans directly, while LVER personnel outreach to local employers. The JVSG program funds state personnel positions to provide employment services for veterans, including DVOP and LVER personnel who assist disabled and high-need veterans. Veterans receive priority of service in DOL-administered employment and training programs. Competitive grant programs authorized by WIOA fund projects that provide education and construction skills training for disadvantaged youth. The competitive grant programs authorized by WIOA provide training and related services for disadvantaged youth, low-income Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, and individuals preparing for reentry after incarceration. Several federally funded programs, including CSBG, support a wide range of community-based activities to reduce poverty and may also support employment and training activities. These programs are required partners under Section 121 of WIOA and have accountability measures related to non-employment outcomes. Funding figures for these programs are not included in this report as only a portion of the funding supports employment and training activities. The CSBG program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and requires partnership with AJCs. The Perkins Act provides funds for vocational programs at postsecondary institutions, with activities supported under this act being a mandatory AJC partner. TANF block grants provide benefits to low-income families and aim to increase state flexibility in meeting statutory goals. Unlike some grant programs, Perkins funds support institutions rather than individual students. The TANF block grants aim to increase state flexibility in meeting statutory goals related to assisting needy families, reducing dependency on government benefits, and promoting two-parent families. These grants are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services."
