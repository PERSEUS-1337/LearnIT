    "content": "The proposed neural language model, PRPN, can induce syntactic structure from unannotated sentences and improve language modeling by leveraging this structure. It allows direct back-propagation of gradients from the language model loss into the neural parsing network, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The model can discover syntactic structure and achieve top performance on language tasks by combining tokens with specific syntax. Neural language models provide meaningful word representations but struggle with syntax. Developing a deep neural network to leverage syntax for better semantic representation is a current focus. Integrating syntactic structure into language models is crucial for obtaining hierarchical representations with increasing levels of abstraction, capturing complex linguistic phenomena, and providing shortcuts for gradient back-propagation. Syntactic parsers are commonly used to extract structure information, especially for major languages with treebank data. Unsupervised syntactic structure induction is a challenge in computational linguistics due to the limitations of supervised parsers. Researchers are interested in this problem for various reasons, such as parsing languages without annotated treebanks, creating dependency structures for specific NLP applications, and examining cognitive issues in language learning. A novel neural language model called Parsing-Reading-Predict Networks (PRPN) is proposed to simultaneously induce syntactic structure from unannotated sentences. The Parsing-Reading-Predict Networks (PRPN) model aims to induce syntactic structure from unannotated sentences by utilizing a tree-structured graph representation. It consists of three components: a Parsing Network for computing syntactic distance, a Reading Network for adaptive memory representation, and a Predict Network for predicting the next token. The model is evaluated on word-level language tasks. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results in word-level and character-level language modeling, as well as unsupervised constituency parsing. It outperforms baseline models and shows similarity to human expert structures. Various approaches have explored incorporating tree structures into language understanding for downstream tasks. Our model, unlike others, uses a recurrent network to implicitly model tree structure through attention. While some research focuses on learning recurrent features at multiple scales, our model learns structure from data instead of predefining it. The BID11 model proposes a hierarchical multi-scale structure with binary gates learned from data, controlling intralayer connections. In contrast, our model uses an attention mechanism to control updates of higher layers softly. Previous work like BID7, BID6, and BID44 have also explored language modeling with top-down parsing mechanisms. Neural networks have been introduced to learn discriminative and generative models in this space. Dependency-based approaches using neural networks, such as BID4, BID16, and BID54, are also relevant. Parsers, like our model, infer grammatical tree structures. The curr_chunk discusses the use of parsers in inferring grammatical tree structures, with a comparison to unsupervised parsers. It mentions SPINN as a shift-reduce parser supervisedly trained on Stanford PCFG Parser output. Additionally, it refers to BID25 and BID23 as unsupervised parsers for learning dependency structures and natural language syntax. The parsing quality is compared with these models in Section 6.3. The text also includes a visual representation of syntactic tree structures and dependency relations. The curr_chunk discusses modeling sequential data using tree structures and recurrent models. Tree structures require supervision and may not be robust with ungrammatical sentences, while recurrent models provide a more convenient way to model sequential data. The curr_chunk introduces skip-connections in a recurrent neural network to integrate structured dependency relations in natural language sentences. The model's hidden states depend not only on the last state but also on previous states with direct syntactic relations. Skip connections are controlled by gates and are built according to the latent structure of the model. The model integrates skip-connections controlled by gates to capture structured dependency relations in natural language sentences. Hidden states are updated recurrently based on syntactic relations, with a focus on related information through a structured attention mechanism. The structured attention mechanism in the model focuses on related information by modeling the local structure of language using a probabilistic approach. The Stick-Breaking Process is proposed to model the distribution of local structures, with gate values determined by a Cumulative Distribution Function. The model uses a soft gating vector to update the hidden state and predict the next token, inferring tree structure with syntactic distance. The Stick-Breaking Process assigns high probability to the closest constituent-beginning word and larger probabilities to words beginning new constituents. The model considers longer dependency relations for the first word in a constituent. At time step t = 6, the model parametrizes \u03b1 t j based on syntactic proximity between words in the same constituent. Syntactic Distance is introduced as a feature to measure the relation between adjacent words, with the goal of finding words x j with larger syntactic distance than d t for \u03b1 t j. The Syntactic Distance is used to parametrize \u03b1 t j based on the proximity between words in the same constituent. It has properties that allow inferring a tree structure and being robust to non-valid structures. Parameterizing Syntactic Distance helps identify the beginning and ending words of a constituent using local information. The Reading Network uses convolution to compute syntactic distances between tokens in a sequence. It maintains memory states with hidden and memory tapes, capturing dependency relations with structured attention. The Reading Network utilizes structured attention to model dependency relations between tokens in a sequence. This mechanism summarizes previous recurrent states and updates the LSTM model accordingly. The structured attention layer links the current token to previous memories, yielding a probability distribution over hidden state vectors. This allows for the computation of adaptive summary vectors for the previous hidden tape and memory. The Reading Network uses structured attention to model dependency relations between tokens in a sequence. It computes values of c t and h t through LSTM recurrent update BID20. The Predict Network models the probability distribution of the next word x t+1. The model estimates syntactic distance using a Parsing Network trained on PTB dataset at the character level. The proposed model uses structured attention to infer a tree structure based on distances. It evaluates character-level language modeling and unsupervised constituency parsing tasks. The model handles longer-term dependencies and is evaluated on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets. The model is trained on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets using truncated back-propagation. Optimization is done with Adam using specific parameters, and gradient clipping is applied. Layer normalization is used for the Reading Network, while batch normalization is used for the Predict Network and parsing network. Learning rate is adjusted based on validation performance, and experiments vary in hidden units, batch size, and dropout rate. The Reading Network and Predict Network are trained on the Penn Treebank dataset with specific parameters. The model has two recurrent layers for character-level PTB and uses a batch size of 64 with truncated backpropagation. Dropout is applied on input/output embeddings and recurrent states. Syntactic distance is visualized by the Parsing Network for sequences from the PTB test set. The model autonomously discovered to avoid inter-word attention connection by using hidden states of space tokens. This understanding of latent data structure led to state-of-the-art performance on the Penn Treebank test set, outperforming baseline models. The HM-LSTM BID11 model outperformed baseline models on the Penn Treebank test set. Word-level language modeling deals with complex syntactic structures and linguistic phenomena but has fewer long-term dependencies. The word-level variant of the language model was evaluated on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets using the same procedure as the character-level model. Optimization was done with Adam with \u03b2 1 = 0, adjusting hidden units, mini-batch size, and dropout rate for different tasks. The Penn Treebank dataset was processed using a Reading Network with two recurrent layers and a Predict Network without a residual block. The model had a hidden state size of 1200 units, input and output embedding sizes of 800, and utilized a batch size of 64 with truncated back-propagation. Various dropout values were used, and the model achieved a perplexity rate of 92.0. Other models like LSTM and Variational LSTM also achieved competitive perplexity rates. The Penn Treebank dataset was used for an ablation test, evaluating different models such as Variational RHN, NAS Cell, and 4-layer skip connection LSTM. The Text8 dataset, with 17M training tokens and a vocabulary size of 44k words, was also mentioned. The Text8 dataset is used for performance evaluation, with a development set for reporting. The model uses hyper-parameters similar to character-level PTB, with dropout values specified. Results show comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, with potential for improvement through hyperparameter tuning. Our method outperforms baseline methods after aggressive hyperparameter tuning. The continuous cache pointer can be applied to the output of our Predict Network without modification. Visualizations of tree structures generated from the learned PTB language model are included. Different variants of PRPN are compared in terms of test perplexity, showing the importance of structure information in controlling attention. An unsupervised constituency parsing task is performed on the WSJ10 dataset, comparing model-inferred tree structures with human annotations. The model generates a binary tree for constituency parsing, compared with baseline methods. Each sentence is treated independently during training and testing, with shorter sentences padded with 0 in batches. The model's initial hidden states are filled with zero at the beginning of each iteration. During testing, sentences are fed one by one to the model, which recursively combines tokens into constituents based on gate values. Parsing performance results show that the model outperforms the RANDOM baseline and is comparable to the CCM model, focusing on the relation between successive tokens by computing syntactic distances and assembling tokens into constituents recursively. The proposed neural language model, Parsing-Reading-Predict Network, utilizes a structured attention mechanism to improve syntactic structure induction from unannotated sentences. It outperforms DMV+CCM and UML-DOP models by making differentiable parsing decisions and leveraging inferred structure for better language modeling. The proposed neural language model, Parsing-Reading-Predict Network, utilizes a structured attention mechanism to improve syntactic structure induction from unannotated sentences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on language modeling tasks and shows high correlation with human expert annotation. The inferred tree structure is derived from syntactic distances yielded by the Parsing Network, sorting and separating constituents until only one word remains. This probabilistic approach models the local structure of language. The text discusses a probabilistic approach to modeling the local structure of language using a Dirichlet Process. It focuses on how to improve generalization and interpretability of the model by enforcing sparse connectivity as a prior. The model assigns probabilities to different local structures at each time step, allowing for flexibility in attending to as many words as there are in a sentence.

It focuses on improving generalization and interpretability by enforcing sparse connectivity as a prior. The model assigns probabilities to different local structures at each time step, allowing flexibility in attending to words in a sentence. The connectivity is realized through attention weight and masking vectors, with Bayesian nonparametric assumptions requiring approximate inference. Relaxations include parameterizing \u03b1 as a function of previous words and using a soft attention mechanism for graph structure decisions. The text discusses using a soft attention mechanism to update hidden states and predictive functions in a probabilistic model for language structure. It emphasizes the importance of no partial overlapping in dependency ranges for recovering a valid tree structure. The masking vector introduced determines the range of dependency, with disjoint ranges indicating words belong to different subtrees. The text discusses using a soft attention mechanism to update hidden states and predictive functions in a probabilistic model for language structure. It emphasizes the importance of no partial overlapping in dependency ranges for recovering a valid tree structure. The masking vector introduced determines the range of dependency, with disjoint ranges indicating words belong to different subtrees. The binary version of dependency range can be obtained by setting a parameter to infinity, ensuring that the dependency range of any two tokens won't partially overlap. The hyperparameter \u03c4 affects the tree structure, with a value of 0 resulting in a flat tree and larger values increasing hierarchy levels. As \u03c4 approaches infinity, the dependency ranges form a valid tree. The gating mechanism benefits training, and when \u03c4 is between extremes, the truncation range is determined. At test time, \u03c4 is set to +inf to ensure a valid tree structure. Syntactic distance values become more intuitive, with zero for siblings and larger distances for words in different subtrees. The model's performance is compared with baseline methods, including RANDOM, LBRANCH, and RBRANCH, in generating binary trees. The unsupervised baseline for generating binary trees includes LBRANCH and RBRANCH, which represent left- and right-branching structures. An upper bound on binary system performance is set by the Treebank sentences' flat structure. Comparison with other unsupervised constituency parsing methods like DEP-PCFG, CCM, DMV, and a combined DMV+CCM model is also conducted."
