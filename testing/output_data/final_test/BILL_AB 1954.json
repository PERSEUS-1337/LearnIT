    "title": "AB 1954",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Direct Access to Reproductive Health Care Act, also known as the Direct Access to Reproductive Health Care Act, emphasizes the importance of timely access to comprehensive reproductive health services for women. It highlights the high rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States and the negative health outcomes that can result from the inability to access such care promptly. The act aims to address these issues and promote cost-effective reproductive health services. California has a history of expanding access to reproductive health services to reduce unintended pregnancies and improve outcomes. Legislation allows women to access care from obstetricians and gynecologists without a referral. However, there are variations in health benefit plans regarding referral requirements, leading women to seek care from other licensed providers like family practice physicians and nurse practitioners. The Legislature aims to enhance access to reproductive and sexual health care services by prohibiting health care plans from requiring referrals for coverage. This applies to all plans issued on or after January 1, 2017. For the purposes of enhancing access to reproductive and sexual health care services, health care plans are prohibited from requiring referrals for coverage, regardless of the patient's age. A health care service plan may establish reasonable provisions for obtaining reproductive and sexual health care services without requiring prior approval from another physician or provider. These provisions must be consistent with those applied to other health care providers and not more restrictive. A health care service plan may establish provisions for communication with the enrollee's primary care physician and surgeon regarding the enrollee's condition, treatment, and follow-up care. Section 10123.202 of the Insurance Code exempts certain health care service plans from requiring referrals for specialist care and limits utilization protocols for contraceptive drugs. It does not apply to specialized plans governed by Section 14131 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Every health insurance policy issued, amended, renewed, or delivered on or after January 1, 2017, shall be prohibited from requiring a referral for reproductive and sexual health care services. This applies to all patients, including minors, and includes services described in specific legal codes. In implementing this section, a health insurer may establish reasonable provisions governing utilization protocols for reproductive and sexual health care services, consistent with other health care providers, without requiring prior approval. Insurers can also set provisions for communication with the insured's primary care physician and surgeon. Health insurers are not allowed to impose utilization protocols for contraceptive drugs beyond what is outlined in Section 10123.196. This section does not apply to certain types of health insurance policies. No reimbursement is required by this act under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
