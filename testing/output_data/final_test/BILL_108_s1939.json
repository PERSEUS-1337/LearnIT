    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Health Advisory Act of 2003\" and includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that mercury is a harmful heavy metal that poses risks to human health, wildlife, and the environment. Mercury discharges have significantly increased due to human activities, leading to widespread exposure to methyl-mercury in the general public, especially through contaminated fish and seafood in the United States. The 1997 EPA Mercury Report to Congress highlighted high mercury levels in various fish, prompting the FDA to advise pregnant women and childbearing age women to avoid certain fish and limit overall consumption to 12 ounces per week. The FDA advises limiting shark and swordfish consumption to 7 ounces per week. The EPA recommends pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children limit fish intake to 6 meals per week of cooked fish or an 8-ounce meal for adults. In 2003, 44 states issued health advisories on mercury-tainted fish. Eleven states caution against excessive canned tuna consumption for pregnant women and young children. The FDA advises limiting canned tuna consumption to 1 or 2 cans per week due to high mercury levels in \"white\" albacore tuna. Data shows 7.8% of women of childbearing age have unsafe mercury levels, putting over 300,000 babies at risk annually. Many women are unaware of the risks of mercury exposure from contaminated fish. The FDA was criticized for not guiding the fishing industry to prevent mercury-contaminated fish from reaching consumers. Evidence links mercury exposure to increased risk of heart disease. Health advisory information on contaminated fish is not widely known, potentially endangering millions of Americans. The Act aims to inform the public about the risks of mercury exposure from consuming fish and seafood, and to create advisories for distribution. It addresses the lack of awareness that puts millions of Americans at risk of ingesting harmful amounts of mercury. The Act requires collaboration between the Environmental Protection Agency and State fish and game officials to create a guide on the dangers of consuming recreationally-caught fish. It also mandates the FDA to resume monitoring mercury levels in seafood, implements a National Public Education Program on methyl-mercury in seafood, and requires an annual report on the impacts of mercury on human health and the environment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Administrator is the head of the EPA, the Commissioner is the head of the FDA, a health professional is a licensed medical or dental professional, and the Secretary is the head of HHS. The Administrator and the Commissioner will develop fish consumption advisories for methyl-mercury in fish based on EPA's Reference Dose for different populations. The Secretary will prepare a consumer's mercury advisory notice for distribution to health professionals. The fish consumption advisories for methyl-mercury will explain the dangers of mercury exposure through fish consumption to women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and young children. The advisories will also describe the most current mercury health advisories in an easily understandable manner. The Federal Government's mercury health advisories for fish consumption include a toll-free telephone number for additional information and must be printed in multiple languages. The Secretary will establish the toll-free number to provide information on mercury exposure from fish consumption and other sources. The information provided will be regularly updated. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, will prepare a consumer's guide to mercury and health advisory for consuming recreationally-caught fish. The guide will be distributed to State departments, fishing license applicants, and the public upon request in English and Spanish. The guide developed under paragraph (1) shall be printed in large type in English, Spanish, and other culturally appropriate languages. It will also include a toll-free telephone number for further information. The guide will be periodically updated as necessary by the Secretary. Additionally, the Secretary will work with States and other entities to develop and distribute regional and national consumption advisories. The Secretary will develop and distribute advisories on methyl-mercury in seafood, create standardized formats for advisories, update fish tissue test results and consumption advisories, coordinate with State and local advisories, and work with the retail food industry on posting advisories. The Secretary will develop advisories for informing about mercury in fish for women of childbearing age, pregnant, nursing women, and parents of young children. The advisories will include information on limiting consumption of high mercury fish for the general population and stress the importance of limiting consumption for sensitive populations. The government agencies will collaborate to create and update consumption advisories for fish and seafood products, focusing on the dangers of mercury ingestion for women of childbearing age, pregnant women, young children, and other at-risk groups. The government will distribute advisories on fish and seafood consumption to at-risk groups and local establishments in multiple languages as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will implement a national public education program on methyl-mercury in seafood, providing information on Federal standards, good practices, and promoting public awareness. Information will also be provided to health professionals. The Commissioner will resume the seafood methyl-mercury monitoring sampling program to document mercury levels in fish species for improved diagnosis and treatment of mercury-related illness. Monitoring will provide statistically valid data on mercury levels in fish. The Commissioner will compile annual reports tracking changes in dietary exposure to mercury from fish and seafood, based on valid monitoring data. Efforts will be made to avoid duplication of sampling programs by coordinating with other seafood sampling programs. The Secretary will finalize a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point assessment within 1 year to determine if methyl-mercury exposure from fish consumption is a public health hazard. Authorization of appropriations is also included in the Act. Authorization of appropriations is included in the Act for various purposes such as developing a public education system, carrying out sampling, and supporting States in sampling noncommercial fish for mercury. $500,000 is allocated for the public education system, $1,000,000 for sampling, and $2,000,000 for State-specific health advisories related to mercury. The funds will be distributed equitably among States."
