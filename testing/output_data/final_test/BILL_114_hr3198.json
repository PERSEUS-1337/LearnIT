It includes a provision for a credit for certain individuals hired by a small employer under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2015 provides a small employer hiring credit for eligible employers based on wages paid to covered employees.

If a small employer was not in existence the previous year, their eligibility is based on the expected number of employees for the current year. The subsection provides special rules for determining the definition of an employer for the purposes of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2015. It includes references to predecessors and successors of employers, aggregation rules for entities treated as a single employer, exclusion of governmental employers, and the determination of the unemployment rate by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2015 includes special rules for defining covered employees, specifying that the credit applies for only one year.
