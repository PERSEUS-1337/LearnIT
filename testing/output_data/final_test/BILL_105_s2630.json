    "content": "The curr_chunk is about the treatment of interest expense of qualified infrastructure indebtedness. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of interest expense related to qualified infrastructure indebtedness within the United States. The curr_chunk defines qualified infrastructure indebtedness as debt incurred for property used in the trade of electrical energy or natural gas in the US. The determination is made at the time the debt is incurred. The curr_chunk specifies that rate regulation for the trade or business of furnishing electrical energy or natural gas must be established or approved by specific entities, including the District of Columbia, States, agencies of the United States, or public service commissions. Qualified infrastructure indebtedness for the trade or business of furnishing electrical energy or natural gas is limited by the ratio of outstanding debt to assets used in that specific part of the business subject to rate regulation. The amendments made by this section apply to debt incurred in taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. The determination of whether debt constitutes \"qualified infrastructure indebtedness\" for outstanding debt as of the date of enactment of this Act is made by applying the rules of section 864(e)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
