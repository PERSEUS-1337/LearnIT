Additionally, it allows refunds of Hope and Lifetime Learning credits to be used as collateral for short-term student loans. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow eligible educational institutions to provide tuition tax credit assignment loans to taxpayers. The loan amount is disbursed directly to the lender from the taxpayer's next refund due to a credit under this section. Taxpayers eligible for tuition tax credit assignment loans must be either eligible students for the Hope Scholarship Credit or taxpayers eligible for the Lifetime Learning Credit. The maximum loan amount is $1,000 or $1,500 for first or second-year students. An origination fee of up to 5% of the loan amount may be charged by the educational institution. The amendment allows educational institutions to charge an origination fee of up to 5% on tuition tax credit assignment loans. If a taxpayer does not receive a refund within three years, the loan becomes due. Effective for credits claimed after December 31, 2005."
