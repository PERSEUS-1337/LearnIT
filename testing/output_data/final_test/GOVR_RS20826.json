    "content": "The Federal Reserve, established in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act, operates independently to manage the nation's credit and monetary needs. Its monetary policy aims to stabilize the economy, while its regulatory functions ensure a safe banking system. The Fed's income comes from interest on government securities and banking fees, with excess funds returned to the Treasury. The Federal Reserve System, established in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act, consists of a Board of Governors overseeing monetary policy, 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks supervising commercial banks, and member banks including national and state-chartered banks. The Board of Governors is a federal government agency with members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for 14-year terms. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System consists of members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for 14-year terms. Governors may be named to a vacant seat at any point during the term, with staggered appointments expiring every two years. The leadership positions of chairman and vice chairman are designated by the President, with a four-year term that can be reappointed. Each governor has one vote on the board, with selection based on fair representation of various interests and geographical divisions. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is responsible for formulating monetary policy and serving as the \"lender of last resort\" to the nation's financial system. The leadership includes Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Vice Chairman Janet L. Yellen, with specific terms and responsibilities outlined. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the policy-making body for open market operations in the nation's financial system. It consists of seven board members and five of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, with the president of the New York Fed being a permanent member. The remaining four seats are filled by the other 11 presidents on a rotating basis. The committee elects a chairman and vice chairman, with the chairman traditionally being the chairman of the Board of Governors. Open market operations involve the purchase and sale of government securities. Open market operations by the Federal Reserve involve buying and selling government securities in the secondary market to maintain the federal funds rate close to a target rate set by the FOMC. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York manages the portfolio, which includes U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency securities, and bankers acceptances. Legal reserve requirements and the discount window are other monetary policy instruments that may be used by the Federal Reserve to influence credit conditions. Increasing reserve requirements would limit the funds available for lending by banks and thrifts. Reserve requirements are rarely changed as they are considered too blunt of a monetary policy tool. The discount window is a Federal Reserve facility for lending to eligible depository institutions, with the interest rate set by each Bank. Currently, the discount window mainly serves a signaling function. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve implemented new tools to support liquidity and improve financial conditions. These actions led to significant changes in the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed used emergency authority to target non-banking parts of the financial system. It plans to continue using policy tools to aid economic recovery. The Board of Governors has supervisory and regulatory responsibilities affecting the U.S. banking system. The Federal Reserve Board has a broad range of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities for the U.S. banking system, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They implement policies set by Congress and coordinate with other regulatory agencies. The board examines member banks, requires reports, and supervises bank holding companies and state-chartered banks in the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board oversees U.S. banks, including state-chartered banks in the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. operations of foreign banks. They delegate supervisory duties to the 12 Reserve Banks, appoint directors, approve major expenditures, and conduct financial examinations. The Reserve Banks handle day-to-day operations within each geographic district. The Federal Reserve System consists of 12 Banks located in different cities across the country, with branch offices to support operations. Each Bank is managed by a nine-member board of directors divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Class A and B directors are elected by member banks, while Class C directors are appointed by the Board of Governors to represent the general public. The Federal Reserve Banks are managed by a nine-member board of directors divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Class B and C directors have restrictions on their roles and holdings. Each Reserve Bank is headed by a president nominated by the directors. The Banks conduct examinations of member banks and provide fiscal agency services to the federal government. The Federal Reserve Banks serve as fiscal agents for the government, providing services such as issuing, transferring, and redeeming government securities. They also act as depositories, handling transaction accounts for the Treasury and collecting/disbursing funds for the federal government. Additionally, the Banks offer banking services to financial institutions, maintain reserve and clearing accounts, and play a crucial role in the nation's payment system. Their income primarily comes from interest on government securities and fees charged for various services as required by the Monetary Control Act of 1980. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 mandates the Federal Reserve to charge fees for services, with earnings used to cover expenses. Reserve Banks pay the Board of Governors' costs and turn over residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury. In 2009, payments to the Treasury totaled $47.4 billion. National banks must be members of the Federal Reserve System, while state-chartered banks have optional membership. As of June 30, 2009, there were 1,502 national banks and 844 state-chartered Federal Reserve member banks, holding about 80% of all insured bank assets. The 12 Reserve Banks are \"owned\" by member banks, holding 80% of insured bank assets. Member banks buy stock equal to 6% of their capital and surplus, with 3% paid-in and 3% subject to call. Stock cannot be sold or pledged, and dividends are set at 6% per year. Congress aims to balance Federal Reserve independence and accountability. The Federal Reserve has increased disclosure and dialogue with Congress on monetary policy and operations. Congress exercises oversight through various avenues, including the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act. The General Accounting Office audits the Board of Governors and Reserve Banks. Congressional oversight includes reports and semi-annual monetary policy hearings. The Federal Reserve publishes important reports for Congress oversight, including an annual report of activities and compliance with consumer regulations. They issue reports on various subjects like bank fees and credit card profitability. The Fed testifies on economic and banking issues and has a monetary policy reporting system mandated by legislation. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 enhances dialogue on monetary policy between Congress and the Federal Reserve through detailed reporting and oversight hearings. Provisions in various acts reinstated requirements for semi-annual monetary policy reporting and annual reports by the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, changed the supervisory authority of the Federal Reserve Board. It now regulates both bank and thrift holding companies, in addition to state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. The law also authorizes the Federal Reserve to regulate systemically significant firms identified by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the Federal Reserve Board's supervisory authority to regulate bank and thrift holding companies, as well as state-chartered banks in the Federal Reserve System. It also allows the Federal Reserve to regulate systemically significant firms identified by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Additionally, the Act establishes a vice chairman for supervision on the Board of Governors, who will develop policy recommendations and report to Congress on supervision and regulation efforts. The law includes oversight and disclosure provisions to increase transparency in Federal Reserve operations, such as requiring a GAO audit of emergency lending during the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the Federal Reserve Board's supervisory authority to regulate bank and thrift holding companies, as well as state-chartered banks. It established a vice chairman for supervision and increased transparency in Federal Reserve operations. P.L. 111-203 changed the procedures for choosing Federal Reserve Bank presidents, removing the voting power of Class A directors and requiring a GAO study on director appointments. The law mandates a GAO study on the current system for appointing directors to ensure effective representation of the general public."
