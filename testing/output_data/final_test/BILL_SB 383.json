    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 430.41 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires parties to meet and confer before filing a demurrer, in an effort to resolve objections raised in the pleading. (1) During the meet and confer process, the demurring party must specify the causes of action subject to demurrer with legal support. The party filing the complaint must provide legal backing for its sufficiency or suggest amendments to address any deficiencies. The demurring party must meet and confer at least five days before the responsive pleading is due. If unable to do so, a 30-day extension can be granted by filing a declaration. The demurring party must also file a declaration with the demurrer stating specific information. The demurring party must meet and confer with the opposing party before the responsive pleading is due. Failure to reach an agreement or respond in good faith may result in a court determination that the meet and confer process was insufficient. Additionally, a party cannot demur to any portion of an amended pleading on grounds that could have been raised in an earlier demurrer. If a court sustains a demurrer and grants leave to amend, a conference may be ordered before filing an amended complaint. The court cannot prevent a party from filing a demurrer, and the time to file one starts after the conference. This section does not apply to certain civil actions, including those involving incarcerated parties or forcible entry cases. In response to a demurrer, a complaint or cross-complaint can only be amended three times before the case is at issue. Amendments made without court permission before a demurrer is filed do not count towards the limit. The rights to amend pleadings or respond to amendments after the case is at issue are not affected by this rule. Appellate review and party rights under Section 430.80 are also not affected by this section. Section 472 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows for the preservation of the right to appeal after a demurrer is overruled, without the need for filing another demurrer. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless a later statute extends or deletes this date. Section 472 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows for amending pleadings without court permission before the answer or demurrer is filed. Amendments can be made after the demurrer is filed but before it is heard, with the amended pleading served by the opposition deadline.

If a motion to dismiss is denied, a pleading can be filed. Section 472a states that a demurrer is not waived by filing an answer simultaneously.
