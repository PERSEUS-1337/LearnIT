It also mentions the prevalence of ethno-national conflicts, terrorism by organizations like al-Qaeda, and threats to American interests. The future national security and economic well-being of the United States relies on understanding and responding to ethno-national conflicts and factors that support international terrorism. American economic interests also hinge on citizens' ability to communicate and compete in other countries. The Federal Government aims to ensure its employees are equipped to address these challenges. The Federal Government is interested in preparing employees with national security responsibilities for the changing international environment. American colleges and universities need to improve teaching in foreign languages and international fields to help students meet global challenges. Members of minority groups with expertise in foreign languages and cultures can provide valuable insights into global developments. The Federal Government should encourage them to pursue careers in foreign affairs, security, or intelligence agencies to enhance national security. Utilizing the diversity of the American population is crucial for combating terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and other adversaries to prevent future attacks on the United States and its interests. The purposes of this Act are to provide resources for national security education, increase diversity in teaching foreign languages and area studies, produce more applicants for government roles related to national security, and expand international perspectives for the American citizenry. The Act aims to enhance opportunities for minority groups to contribute to national security by working in foreign affairs, security, or intelligence agencies of the Federal Government. The Act establishes a scholarship, fellowship, and grant program to increase opportunities for minority groups to work in federal agencies related to foreign affairs, security, or intelligence. The Secretary of Education will establish a program to award scholarships and fellowships to minority undergraduate and graduate students, respectively, to study in foreign countries or pursue education in critical disciplines related to foreign languages and area studies. Students must be U.S. citizens and may be required to work for a federal agency or office. The program established by the Secretary of Education awards scholarships and fellowships to minority students for studying in foreign countries or critical disciplines related to foreign languages and area studies. Recipients may be required to work for a federal agency or office. Funding allocations aim to allocate one-third for scholarships and one-third for fellowships. The Secretary of Education may enter contracts with national organizations for awarding scholarships, fellowships, and grants without competitive procedures. Recipients of scholarships or fellowships may be required to work for a federal agency. Recipients of scholarships or fellowships must agree to maintain academic progress and work for the Federal Government or in education after completing their degree. Failure to meet academic progress may result in termination of assistance. Recipients of scholarships or fellowships must maintain academic progress and work for the Federal Government or in education after completing their degree. Failure to meet obligations may result in reimbursement to the United States Government. Recipients are selected for awards based on specific criteria outlined in the Act. The Secretary of Education or a contract organization must consider equitable geographic distribution and cultural diversity when awarding scholarships, fellowships, or grants. Awards are based on a merit review process. SEC. 3. POLICY GUIDANCE. The Secretary of Education will provide guidance on implementing the Act by developing criteria for scholarships, disseminating information, setting qualifications for students and institutions, and determining countries not emphasized in other study abroad programs. The United States study abroad programs focus on critical countries for minority students and areas of study where they are deficient in learning. The text chunk discusses the importance of United States institutions of higher education that serve minority students, the encouragement of minority students to work for federal agencies involved in national security after completing their education, and the review of a program required by the Act. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS\n\nThe Secretary of Education may accept gifts and use voluntary services to conduct the program required by this Act. Gifts can be received without conditions other than being used for the program, and property can be sold or disposed of for that purpose. Additionally, voluntary and noncompensated personnel can be utilized. The Secretary of Education must submit an annual report to the President and Congress on the program required by this Act. The report should include an analysis of trends in language, international, and area studies, minority participation in these studies, the impact of program activities on trends, assistance provided in the previous fiscal year, and the performance of individuals involved. The annual report on the program must include an analysis of the performance of individuals who received assistance, termination rates, and compliance with obligations. It should also analyze the results of the program, including the percentage of individuals who became employees of the US Government and reasons for those who did not. The annual report on the program must include an analysis of the performance of individuals who received assistance, termination rates, compliance with obligations, uses of assistance by recipients, uses of grants to educational institutions, and any legislative changes recommended by the Secretary. The first report under this section is due when the budget for fiscal year 2005 is submitted to Congress. SEC. 6.

They have access to all Department of Education documents for auditing purposes.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorization for appropriations:\n- $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007\n- $12,000,000 for each fiscal year after 2007\nFunds can carry over until expended.\n\nSEC. 8.
