Congress finds that Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through the windshield of his police car, highlighting the need for bullet-resistant equipment to protect law enforcement officers. Studies show that between 1990 and 2000, 1,700 officers in the United States were shot and killed in the line of duty, emphasizing the importance of providing additional protective gear to reduce fatalities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates the risk of fatality to law enforcement officers without proper equipment. The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law enforcement officers by providing them with bullet-resistant equipment and video cameras. Studies show that the risk of fatality to officers without proper equipment is 14 times higher, and there is a public safety crisis in Indian country due to rising violent crime rates. The Act aims to provide law enforcement officers with bullet-resistant equipment through a matching grant program. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance can grant funds to States, local governments, and Indian tribes to purchase bullet-resistant equipment for law enforcement officers. Grants must be used for buying such equipment and may prioritize jurisdictions with the greatest need based on officer percentage. The Bureau of Justice Assistance grants funds to purchase bullet-resistant equipment for law enforcement officers based on specific criteria, including violent crime rates and access to vests. States and local governments must receive a minimum allocation of 0.50 percent of total funds each fiscal year. In each fiscal year, states and local governments must receive a minimum allocation of 0.50 percent of total funds for grants under this section. The maximum amount a qualifying entity can receive is 5 percent of the total funds, with a state and its grantees limited to 20 percent. Matching funds for a program under this section cannot exceed 50 percent of the costs. Indian tribal government or the Bureau of Indian Affairs may provide the non-Federal share of matching funds for law enforcement functions on Indian lands. At least half of the funds in this subpart will go to local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents. \"SEC. 2512. APPLICATIONS.\" To request a grant under this subpart, the chief executive of a State, unit of local government, or Indian tribe must submit an application to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The Director will promulgate regulations within 90 days to implement this section, including the required information and eligibility criteria for submitting applications. The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 states that a unit of local government applying for a grant must certify that it considered using block grant funds for bullet-resistant equipment but did not or does not plan to do so. The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 requires a unit of local government to certify that it did not consider using block grant funds for bullet-resistant equipment.
