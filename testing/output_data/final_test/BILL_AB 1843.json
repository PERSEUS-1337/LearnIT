    "title": "AB 1843",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 432.7 of the Labor Code is amended. Section 432.7 of the Labor Code prohibits employers from asking job applicants about arrests or detentions that did not result in conviction, or information about participation in diversion programs or sealed convictions. This information cannot be used in employment decisions. Employers are prohibited from inquiring about arrests, detentions without conviction, participation in diversion programs, or sealed convictions when making employment decisions. Employers cannot ask job applicants about any juvenile court records or arrests when making employment decisions. The section clarifies that a \"conviction\" does not include actions taken by juvenile courts or other court orders for individuals under juvenile court jurisdiction. It also allows disclosure of certain information to government agencies for peace officer employment purposes, but prohibits using arrest reports alone for employment decisions. Arrest reports can be used as a starting point for internal investigations of peace officers. (c) If a person violates this section or Article 6 of the Penal Code, the applicant can seek damages of $200 or actual damages, plus costs and attorney's fees. Intentional violations result in treble damages of $500 or actual damages, plus costs and attorney's fees. Intentional violations are misdemeanors with fines up to $500. (d) These remedies are in addition to other rights and remedies available under the law. (e) This section does not apply to persons seeking employment as peace officers or positions in criminal justice agencies. (f) Employers at health facilities can ask applicants for positions with patient or medication access to disclose arrests under specific penal codes. An employer cannot inquire about an applicant's juvenile court history unless the applicant has been found guilty of a felony or misdemeanor within five years of applying. Additionally, employers cannot ask about sealed juvenile offense records. Employers seeking disclosure of offense history must provide a list of specific offenses to the applicant. Peace officers cannot disclose information about arrests or detentions that did not result in a conviction to unauthorized individuals. No unauthorized person can disclose information about arrests or detentions that did not lead to a conviction, including participation in diversion programs. No unauthorized person can receive or possess criminal or juvenile justice records information related to arrests or proceedings that did not result in a conviction, including participation in diversion programs. (h) \"A person authorized by law to receive information means any person or public agency authorized by a court, statute, or decisional law to access criminal or juvenile offender records maintained by a local law enforcement agency. This includes individuals listed in Section 11105 of the Penal Code and employees of law enforcement agencies who handle criminal record information. \n(i) The Department of Justice is not required to remove entries related to arrests or detentions that did not result in conviction from criminal history records provided to employers.\" (j) Defines \"pretrial or posttrial diversion program\" as programs authorized by specific statutes. \n(k) Exempts certain entities from complying with subdivision (a) when screening concessionaires. For the purposes of this subdivision, \"screening\" refers to a written request for criminal or juvenile history information from a local law enforcement agency. A \"prospective concessionaire\" is any individual or entity seeking approval to acquire a beneficial ownership interest in a public agency's concession, lease, or property right, excluding lenders acquiring interests as security for loans or through foreclosure. The curr_chunk defines terms related to control and ownership in the context of acquiring a beneficial ownership interest in a public agency's concession. It includes definitions of \"affiliate,\" \"associate,\" and \"control\" in relation to the prospective concessionaire. The curr_chunk specifies that a public agency can deny consent or approval for a concession based on the criminal history of the prospective concessionaire or their affiliates, focusing on offenses involving moral turpitude. The agency must consider the relevance of the crime to the proposed business. If a prospective concessionaire's application is denied due to criminal history, they must be given a written explanation. The concessionaire can request a review within 10 days, submitting any corrected records or evidence within 90 days. The public agency must make a decision within 20 days of receiving the evidence. The employer can ask about an applicant's criminal conviction if required by law or if the position involves using a firearm. A conviction may disqualify an applicant from certain positions, even if expunged or sealed by the court. The employer is prohibited from hiring an applicant convicted of a crime. No reimbursement is required for this act as it creates new crimes or infractions."
