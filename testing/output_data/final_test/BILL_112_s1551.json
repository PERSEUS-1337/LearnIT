The program aims to improve care quality, billing accuracy, reduce identity theft, and combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare program. The pilot program aims to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare by implementing a smart card system for beneficiary and provider identification in high-risk areas. The smart card will have security features and protect personal privacy. The smart card for Medicare providers will not display Social Security numbers or provider numbers on the front but will securely store them on the smart card chip along with other necessary information. The enrollment process includes identity and certification verification. The smart card for Medicare providers securely stores necessary information, including fingerprints for identification. It is used by both beneficiaries and providers to verify eligibility, prevent fraud, and authorize transactions. Necessary equipment is distributed at no cost, and regular monitoring is done to identify billing discrepancies. The pilot program aims to review Medicare records for accuracy and to address fraud, waste, and abuse. It includes reporting mechanisms to measure cost savings and ensures compliance with identity credential standards and information security requirements.

The pilot program informs Medicare beneficiaries and providers about the program's purpose, enrollment processes, use of biometric data, and measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access. The pilot program for Medicare beneficiaries and providers includes measures to protect personal information, such as addressing unauthorized access and disclosure, equipment issues, developing a hotline for assistance, and addressing care access outside the pilot area. Information on the smart card is limited to privacy concerns. The smart card information is protected under privacy regulations and exempt from disclosure. The Secretary has the authority to expand the pilot program and waive certain provisions of the Social Security Act.
