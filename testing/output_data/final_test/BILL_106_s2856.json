    "content": "The Act titled \"International Television Broadcasting Act of 2000\" is cited as the short title. The Voice of America (VoA) is now using the NewsNow format, which broadcasts news repetitively in a continuous cycle. This format limits the coverage of American thought and institutions, hindering the clear presentation of United States policies as mandated by the VoA Charter. Traditionally, editorials have been used to fulfill this mandate by providing rationales for US policy to radio and TV audiences, and should not be marginalized. Television is crucial for presenting US policies as mandated by the VoA Charter. The Broadcasting Board of Governors plans to merge Worldnet television into VoA soon to sustain explicit treatment of American thought and policies. The purpose of this Act is to establish a new international television service under the Broadcasting Board of Governors to replace Worldnet and VOA-TV. It aims to ensure that international television broadcasts effectively represent the United States and its policies. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as Board, Bureau, Director, Television Service, VOA-TV, and Worldnet. SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION SERVICE. Upon the effective date of this Act, the International Television Service is established within the Bureau, headed by a Director of International Television. Sixty days later, the Board must submit a report to Congress outlining plans for the Television Service, including programming, staffing, budget, and reporting structure. Worldnet and VOA-TV will terminate upon the Act's effective date. Upon the effective date of this Act, Worldnet and VOA-TV shall terminate, and no funds available to the Board may be used for them. SEC. 6. BROADCASTING PRINCIPLES; PROGRAMMING. The Television Service must adhere to broadcasting principles outlined in the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994. The Director of International Television must allocate resources equally based on these principles. Regular programming of the Television Service includes programs produced by the service. The Director of Policy of the Bureau, in consultation with the Director of International Television, may develop additional programs relating to United States policies. The frequency of programming will be determined by the Director in consultation with the Director of Policy. Nothing prohibits the Director from requiring specific programs. The Director of Policy may develop additional programs related to US policies, with programming frequency determined in consultation with the Director of International Television. Programs must also be carried by VOA Radio and Internet. Upon the effective date of this Act, personnel, assets, liabilities, contracts, property, records, and funds from Worldnet and VOA-TV will be transferred to the Television Service. Worldnet will continue to be funded at the same level as in fiscal year 2001 until the Act's effective date. Any references to Worldnet or VOA-TV in federal laws or documents will refer to the Television Service after the Act's effective date. The effective date of the Act is January 1, 2001."
