    "content": "The \"Federal Energy Bank Act\" aims to promote energy conservation investments in Federal facilities by recognizing energy conservation as crucial for national energy security, highlighting the Federal Government's significant energy consumption, and emphasizing the need for energy cost savings and investments in energy-saving systems and products. The \"Federal Energy Bank Act\" defines key terms such as \"agency\" as including Executive, legislative, and judicial entities, \"Bank\" as the Federal Energy Bank, and \"energy efficiency project\" as assisting agencies in meeting energy efficiency requirements. The \"Federal Energy Bank Act\" defines key terms and includes provisions related to total utility payments for agency facilities. The Act also references the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and applicable Executive orders. The \"Federal Energy Bank Act\" establishes a bank for energy-related purposes. The \"Federal Energy Bank\" is established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by appropriations, transfers, repayments, and interest earnings. Agencies are required to transfer 5% of their total utility payments to the Bank annually. The Secretary will establish a formula for considering the utility portion of rental payments. The Treasury Secretary will invest excess funds in interest-bearing US obligations. Loans from the bank are addressed in Section 5. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers appropriated amounts from the Bank to finance energy efficiency projects for agencies. Performance contracting funding should not be used if available. Loans can cover project costs or development/administration. An agency can use up to 15% of a loan for administration and proposal development costs. Repayments of the principal loan amount plus interest are required, with the possibility of interest waiver by the Secretary. The Bank does not require agencies to pay interest for energy efficiency project loans. Agency budgets cannot be reduced by energy savings until the loan is repaid. Agencies cannot rescind or reprogram funds provided by the Act, and loaned funds must be retained until expended without fiscal year limitations. The Secretary will establish criteria for selecting energy efficiency projects eligible for loans, including technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, measurement and management components, and a project payback period of 3 years or less. Additionally, reports and audits are required. SEC. 7. REPORTS AND AUDITS.\n\nAgencies must submit annual reports to the Secretary on energy efficiency projects costing over $1,000,000, detailing whether they meet savings projections and providing reasons and remedies for any failures. The Secretary may audit funded projects for performance evaluation. Additionally, the Secretary must report to Congress annually on the Bank's operations, including total receipts and expenditures to each agency. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
