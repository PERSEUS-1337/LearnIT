    "content": "The \"Fostering Innovation in Medical Imaging Act of 2017\" approves applications for certain diagnostic medical imaging devices intended for use with contrast agents. The Secretary may approve applications for medical imaging devices without contrast agents if the proposed use aligns with approved labeling specifications. The Secretary may approve applications for medical imaging devices with contrast agents if used in new patient populations or different imaging modalities not specified in the approved labeling. The agency center responsible for premarket device review has primary jurisdiction over such applications. The agency center responsible for premarket device review may consult with the center for drugs and biological products and review data provided by the sponsor of a contrast agent. Applications for medical imaging devices are subject to specific requirements and not to certain sections of the law. An application for a medical imaging device using a contrast agent must refer to the specific contrast agent by trade or brand name, not a class of drugs. The term \"applicable medical imaging device\" refers to a device used with a contrast agent for an unapproved use, and \"contrast agent\" refers to a drug used for imaging purposes. A contrast agent is a drug that is either radioactive or approved for use with a diagnostic imaging device to enhance contrast in the body. SEC. 3. APPLICATIONS FOR APPROVAL OF CONTRAST AGENTS INTENDED FOR USE WITH CERTAIN DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL IMAGING DEVICES. Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to allow sponsors of contrast agents to seek approval for new contrast indications through a supplement to the application. The agency may consult with the center for device premarket review and review data submitted by the sponsor of the medical imaging device. Sponsors of contrast agents can seek approval for new contrast indications through a supplement to the application, as long as the sponsor of the medical imaging device has provided a right of reference or use. The terms 'new contrast indication', 'applicable medical imaging device', and 'contrast agent' are defined in section 520(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
