In 1991, Yeltsin overthrew Gorbachev and dissolved the Soviet Union peacefully. Yeltsin later resigned, appointing Putin as Acting President, who then easily won elections in 2000 and 2004. Putin's presidency brought stability, but as his second term ended, the succession question became a major issue. Putin remained popular with approval ratings of 70%-80%. Putin's presidency saw nation-wide public approval ratings in the 70%-80% range. The question of whether he would step down at the end of his second term arose, with many urging him to stay on as president. In 2007, Putin surprised many by dismissing Prime Minister Fradkov and nominating Victor Zubkov in his place. Putin surprised many by nominating Victor Zubkov, 65, with no political power base, as Prime Minister in 2007. Speculation arose that Zubkov might be Putin's choice for president in 2008, potentially as a \"place holder\" to retain control. The 2007 parliamentary election was seen as a referendum on Putin and Putinism, leading up to the presidential vote in March 2008. In the lead-up to the 2007 Duma election, Putin and his government used various tactics to ensure a victory for United Russia, including controlling the media, seizing opposition literature, and disbanding liberal democratic parties. Putin's announcement to run for parliament with United Russia further solidified the outcome. Russian authorities prevented the OSCE from effectively monitoring the 2007 Duma election by limiting observer numbers and delaying visas. United Russia won a majority with 64.3% of the vote, securing 315 seats, while A Just Russia, believed to be pro-Kremlin, won 7.74% of the vote and 38 seats. In the 2007 Duma election, United Russia won 64.3% of the vote and 315 seats, while A Just Russia secured 7.74% of the vote and 38 seats. The LDPR, with 8.14% of the vote, won 40 seats. The Communist Party won 11.57% of the vote and 57 seats, making them the only opposition party in the Duma. Voter turnout was 63%, with other parties failing to cross the 7% threshold to win seats. Despite allegations of irregularities, United Russia won the 2007 Duma election with 64.3% of the vote. Putin's popularity ensured their victory, with little doubt that an honest count would still have favored them. The main issue was the process leading up to the election, with the executive branch heavily influencing the outcome. Putin later announced Dmitri Medvedev as his choice for president, a long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who had served as First Deputy Prime Minister since 2005. Dmitri Medvedev, a native of St. Petersburg, is seen as one of the more liberal figures in Putin's inner circle. He was appointed as First Deputy Prime Minister in 2005 and announced his intention to have Putin serve as prime minister if elected. This move was meant to ensure political continuity and reduce infighting within Putin's camp, but the future political landscape remains uncertain. Putin's selection of Medvedev as his successor for the March 2 presidential election was met with widespread support from Russia's political elites, including leaders from various parties. Medvedev was praised for being a candidate that appealed to different political forces and segments of society, showing a maturing political system in Russia. Putin's choice of Medvedev as his successor for the March 2 presidential election received broad support from Russia's political elites. Federation Council member Yury Sharandin predicted Medvedev's victory in the first round due to the transfer of Putin's popularity to him. Putin also approved a law eliminating minimum voter turnout requirements for elections, and in 2007, he removed Aleksandr Veshnyakov as head of the Central Election Commission for criticizing legislation that could lead to disqualifying inconvenient candidates. Veshnyakov warned of Russia becoming a one-party state. The new Chairman, Vladimir Churov, emphasized his focus on getting things done rather than commenting on election legislation. Mikhail Kasyanov, a credible rival to Medvedev, was barred from participating in the Duma election due to technical issues with his party's registration documents. After Kasyanov's petitions were submitted, the Central Election Commission ruled that 13% of his 2.4 million signatures were invalid, leading to his disqualification from the election. Only pro-Kremlin parties and Zhironovsky's LDPR and the Communist Party had the right to nominate candidates. Zhironovsky and Zyuganov were nominated, along with Andrei Bogdanov from the Democratic Party, who won control with Kremlin support. The Democratic Party, considered a Kremlin-backed pseudo-opposition group, garnered fewer than 90,000 votes in the 2007 Duma election but managed to secure 2 million signatures for their candidate, Bogdanov. Observers noted biased news coverage in favor of Medvedev, with state-controlled TV networks heavily promoting him. Medvedev avoided public debates and restrictions were imposed on election observers. Moscow imposed restrictions on OSCE election observers, leading to their refusal to send observers. Election commissions from several countries declined to observe the presidential ballot. Medvedev won with 70.28% of the vote, followed by Zyuganov with 17.2%. Zhirinovskiy and Bogdanov received 9.34% and 1.29% respectively. Zyuganov claimed election rigging cost him 5%-10% of the vote. Russian and western observers acknowledged the election outcome was not in doubt. Some speculate that Putin's obedient Duma majority may amend the constitution, shifting power from the president to the prime minister. The Presidential Administration was ordered to prepare a draft law requiring approval from the Duma and Federation Council to dismiss the prime minister, a move that would require a major re-write of the constitution. Some suggest President Medvedev may cede power to Prime Minister Putin, creating a \"dual power\" arrangement viewed as unstable. The key issue is who will be number one, as the Kremlin inner circle is split into competing factions. This could lead to another center of influence, legitimate as Putin, causing potential conflicts. Some scenarios suggest Medvedev resigning, leading to a new presidential election where Putin could run. The uncertainty lies in Medvedev's loyalty to Putin, as power is hard to let go of. Putin's popularity and connections with security services could allow him to remain the de facto national leader despite weak political institutions in Russia. Putin may plan to stay as a powerful prime minister for a while, ensuring Medvedev is a loyal successor. If Medvedev proves worthy, Putin could gradually hand over control. Russia's significance to the US lies in its nuclear power, economic strength, and influence in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Russia's importance to the US lies in its nuclear power, economic strength, and influence in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The future of NATO, energy security, and other global issues may be impacted by developments in Russia. The identity of the leader in the Kremlin post-2008 is debated, with some believing Putinism will prevail regardless of who is in power, while others argue that the leader's policies can shape Russia's path and its relations with the US. The question of whether Medvedev's election victory results in an actual transfer of power is important. If Medvedev replaces Putin, it will strengthen the rule of law in Russia. A more democratic Russia may be a more friendly partner for the United States. Putin's administration is characterized by statism and centralized authoritarianism, with key members being from the security services. Medvedev, who is seen as relatively liberal compared to others, stands out for his background as an attorney and law professor. Medvedev's position in the Kremlin is debated, with some believing he aligns with Putin's authoritarian tendencies. As First Deputy Prime Minister, he oversaw major government projects focused on improving housing, healthcare, agriculture, and education. In his 2008 presidential campaign, Medvedev emphasized socioeconomic issues and avoided Putin's aggressive tactics against opponents and the West. Medvedev's potential presidency raises questions about his stance on U.S. policies and NATO, with implications for the United States."
