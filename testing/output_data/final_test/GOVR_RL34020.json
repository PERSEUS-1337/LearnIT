    "content": "Among the creative works protected by U.S. copyright law are sound recordings, defined as works resulting from the fixation of sounds. Copyright owners have exclusive rights to reproduce, adapt, distribute, or perform their works digitally. Statutory licenses allow third parties to use copyrighted sound recordings by paying prescribed fees without private negotiations. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) amended these provisions in 1998. In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) amended statutory licensing statutes for Internet broadcasting, clarifying exemptions from the public performance right for certain types of transmissions. Interactive services must negotiate licenses directly with copyright owners, while some webcasting qualifies for a compulsory license. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) amended statutory licensing statutes for Internet broadcasting in 1998. Two categories of webcasting qualify for a compulsory license: \"preexisting\" subscription services and \"an eligible nonsubscription transmission.\" Webcasters who transmit music on a nonsubscription, noninteractive basis may also qualify for a statutory license. Additionally, licensees may make temporary copies of sound recordings for transmission purposes. The initial ratemaking proceeding for statutory royalty rates for webcasters from 1998 to 2005 (referred to as \"Webcaster I\") was controversial. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) recommended initial statutory royalty rates for nonsubscription webcasters in 2002, which were objected to by small-scale webcasters. The Librarian of Congress revised the rates downward, and Congress enacted the Small Webcasters Settlement Act (SWSA) of 2002, providing more options for small webcasters to pay royalties based on revenue or expenses. The Small Webcasters Settlement Act (SWSA) of 2002 provided options for small webcasters to pay royalties based on revenue or expenses. The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 abolished the CARP system and established a Copyright Royalty Board. Rates established under SWSA were to remain in effect through 2005, with new royalty rates announced in March 2007 for the period from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. The Copyright Royalty Board issued a Final Rule and Order on May 1, 2007, establishing new rates for commercial and noncommercial webcasters under the \u00a7 114 compulsory license. The rates for commercial webcasters are $.0008 per performance for 2006, $.0011 per performance for 2007, $.0014 per performance for 2008, $.0018 per performance for 2009, and $.0019 per performance for 2010, effective on July 15, 2007. The Copyright Royalty Board established new rates for commercial and noncommercial webcasters under the \u00a7 114 compulsory license. For commercial webcasters, the rates are $.0008 per performance for 2006, $.0011 per performance for 2007, $.0014 per performance for 2008, $.0018 per performance for 2009, and $.0019 per performance for 2010. Noncommercial webcasters have different rates based on the number of Aggregate Tuning Hours (ATH) per month. The Copyright Royalty Board sets rates for commercial and noncommercial webcasters under the \u00a7 114 compulsory license. The rate structure does not cater to \"small\" webcasters as addressed in the SWSA based on revenues. The standard for rate determination is the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard, influenced by the Webcaster I initial royalty proceedings of the CARP. The CRB interprets this standard as determining rates that a willing buyer and seller would agree upon in the marketplace, considering factors in section 114(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). The Copyright Royalty Board considers factors in section 114(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) along with other relevant factors to determine rates under the willing buyer/willing seller standard. Proposals for a fee structure based on revenue by \"small\" webcasters were rejected, as they do not align with the standard. Only Small Commercial Webcasters proposed a revenue-based fee structure, but their proposal was ultimately disregarded. The Copyright Royalty Board rejected proposals for a revenue-based fee structure by small webcasters, as it does not align with the standard. Small Commercial Webcasters focus on the fee amount rather than the structure, with no evidence provided for applying a revenue-based structure to them. The board expressed a lack of statutory authority to create royalty rate niches for small webcasters. The Copyright Royalty Judges cannot guarantee a profitable business to every market entrant, as free market processes weed out inefficient entities. Allowing inefficient market participants to use music without compensating copyright owners undermines property rights. The board set rates based on benchmark agreements, rejecting proposals from radio broadcasters and small webcasters. The Copyright Royalty Board rejected proposals from radio broadcasters and small webcasters for using analog over-the-air broadcast music radio as a benchmark. Instead, they found that the most appropriate benchmark agreements are those in the market for interactive webcasting covering the digital performance of sound recordings. The decision also declined to delineate a separate class or integrate a separate market analysis for \"small\" webcasters. The expiration of the option to pay a percentage of revenues for webcasters was replaced by a per-song per-listener formula, causing backlash. Negotiations between SoundExchange and webcasters were initiated to reach a compromise royalty rate agreement. SoundExchange offered to extend terms for Small Webcasters in response to a request from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. SoundExchange proposed extending the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 with modifications for small webcasters with annual revenues under $1.25 million. They could pay royalties based on a percentage of revenue model, facing criticism for potentially limiting growth. A $50,000 per year cap on the minimum fee was agreed upon by some large webcasters and SoundExchange. The webcasters agreed to provide SoundExchange with an annual accounting of all songs performed and to form a committee to address streamripping. Small webcasters earning $1.25 million or less can stream SoundExchange members' recordings by paying royalties under the old scheme. The Copyright Royalty Board issued retroactive decisions from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2010. Parties in the \"Webcaster II\" proceeding appealed the board's decision, leading to a lawsuit filed by various parties in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The court denied an emergency motion to delay the CRB decision, consolidating five separate appeals into one case. On July 10, 2009, the federal court of appeals issued an opinion. The federal court of appeals affirmed most aspects of the \"Webcaster II\" royalty rate proceeding but remanded the $500 minimum annual fee per channel for reconsideration by the CRB. The court followed the APA standard of review and upheld the CRB's rates, stating that the webcasters failed to show any criteria under the APA to set them aside. The court upheld the CRB's decision on royalty rates for small commercial webcasters, stating they are not required to accommodate every participant in the market. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the royalty rates but vacated the minimum fee provision of $500 per channel. The court upheld the CRB's decision on royalty rates for small commercial webcasters but vacated the minimum fee provision of $500 per channel. The issue was not moot as not all parties had contracted around the statutory minimum fee requirement. The court expressed concern about potential high minimum fees depending on the interpretation of \"per channel or station.\" The appellate court remanded the minimum fee provision of $500 per channel to the CRB for further reconsideration. A one-month negotiation period was established for parties to settle the minimum fee issue for commercial webcasters. SoundExchange and DiMA submitted a settlement calling for each commercial webcaster to pay an annual fee under the compulsory license. The CRB required commercial webcasters to pay an annual minimum fee of $500 per channel and station, with a cap of $50,000 per year. Proposed regulations were published in December 2009, with public comments due by January 2010. Two bills in the 110th Congress aimed to nullify the decision but were not passed. Instead, the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 authorized SoundExchange to make settlement agreements with webcasters. The Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 (WSA of 2008), H.R. 7084, reinstated SoundExchange's authority to negotiate settlement agreements with webcasters, replacing rates set by the CRB. It was signed into law on October 16, 2008, by President Bush. The WSA of 2008 reinstated SoundExchange's authority to negotiate settlement agreements with webcasters, replacing rates set by the CRB. It terminated SoundExchange's authority to make settlements with webcasters on February 15, 2009, and amended 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(f)(5) to pertain to all webcasters regardless of size. The WSA of 2008 allowed for negotiated royalty agreements based on revenue or expenses, with a minimum fee, effective for up to 11 years. Agreements could be used as precedents in future CRB ratemaking proceedings. The act stated that agreements made under it would not be considered in the U.S. Court of Appeals review of royalty rates. Three agreements were made under the WSA, including one between CPB and SoundExchange in 2009. CPB and SoundExchange reached a comprehensive agreement in 2009 on royalty rates for Internet streaming by public radio webcasters. CPB is required to pay SoundExchange a flat fee of $1.85 million for the period of 2005-2010, covering 450 public radio stations with a provision for growth. In 2009, CPB and SoundExchange agreed on royalty rates for Internet streaming by public radio webcasters. CPB is to provide SoundExchange with consolidated usage and playlist reporting to ensure accurate payment to performers and copyright owners. NPR dropped its appeal of the CRB's royalty rate decision as part of the agreement. NAB and SoundExchange also reached an agreement for terrestrial AM or FM radio broadcasters to pay an annual minimum fee of $500 per channel for simulcasting their signal or streaming over the Internet from 2006 to 2015. Broadcasters must pay an annual minimum fee of $500 per channel, with a cap of $50,000. They also need to pay royalty rates per performance and submit monthly \"census\" reports to SoundExchange detailing songs played online. Small broadcasters streaming less than 27,777 hours per year can pay $100 for a waiver from detailed reporting. Some webcasters reached an agreement with SoundExchange for royalty rates from 2006-2015, with fees ranging from $500 to $5,000. Small webcasters must comply with census reporting requirements and pay annual minimum fees ranging from $500 to $5,000 based on revenue limits. The negotiated royalty rates for these webcasters are nonprecedential and not admissible as evidence in any legal proceedings. While some webcasters reached agreements with SoundExchange for royalty rates, larger commercial webcasters like Pandora and Live365 did not reach agreements before the sunset of SoundExchange's settlement authority in 2009. SoundExchange appealed to Congress to renew its authority due to positive developments. The Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009 (WSA of 2009) was introduced in Congress to renew SoundExchange's authority to negotiate settlement agreements with webcasters. It was passed by the House and Senate in June 2009 and signed by President Obama. This reinstated SoundExchange's authority to negotiate agreements for a 30-day period starting on July 1, 2009, resulting in five royalty agreements being negotiated. Commercial webcasters like Pandora, AccuRadio, and Live365.com can choose to opt-in to a pureplay agreement covering different rate classes. The agreement applies from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015, with an earlier expiration for small webcasters. To benefit from the rates and terms, webcasters must submit an election to SoundExchange. The pureplay webcaster agreement requires annual submission of an election form to SoundExchange. It warns transmitting entities to comply with statutory licenses and reserves the right to enforce compliance. Rates are detailed in Table 3 under the agreement. Under the pureplay webcaster agreement, commercial webcasters must provide monthly census reports to SoundExchange for every sound recording performed, with rates and terms not admissible in legal proceedings. The agreement emphasizes that the rates are a compromise due to unique circumstances, not a result of typical marketplace negotiations. The college webcaster agreement covers the period from January 1, 2011, until December 31, 2015, with a minimum annual fee of $500 for each channel. Additional usage fees apply for webcasters exceeding 159,140 aggregate tuning hours. College webcasters exceeding 159,140 total ATH per month must submit census reporting, detailing each song performed and the number of listeners. The agreement also includes an annual minimum fee of $500 per channel. Religious webcasters must pay SoundExchange an annual minimum fee of $500 per channel for streaming sound recordings online. This fee covers streaming up to 159,140 monthly ATH per channel. If they exceed this limit, additional royalties apply. Webcasters exceeding 44,000 ATH per year can pay a $100 proxy fee to waive reporting. Reporting requirements vary based on usage levels, with census reporting required for those exceeding 159,140 total ATH per month. Unlike noncommercial educational webcasters, noncommercial religious broadcasters have different reporting agreements. The noncommercial religious broadcaster agreement with SoundExchange does not set precedential rates for future royalty rate proceedings. The agreement with Sirius XM covers streaming over the Internet or mobile phones, with a minimum fee of $500 per channel and a $50,000 cap per year. Sirius must also pay royalties at a per-performance rate and provide monthly statements. The agreement allows for future use in ratemaking proceedings. Under the WSA of 2009, Sound Exchange and CPB extended their agreement from 2008, covering the royalty period from 2011 to 2015. CPB must pay $2.4 million in five installments starting in 2010 for 490 public radio stations, with a growth allowance of up to 10 stations per year. Additional fees apply if music ATH exceeds certain limits, with reports required quarterly from CPB-affiliated broadcasters. The Copyright Royalty Board announced the start of \"Webcaster III\" to determine royalty rates for Internet transmissions of sound recordings from 2011 to 2015. Webcasters not opting into settlement agreements must abide by CRB's determined rates and terms."
