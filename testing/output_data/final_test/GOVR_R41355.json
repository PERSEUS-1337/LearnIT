    "content": "The U.S. Department of Education released a Blueprint for reforming the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is the main source of federal aid for K-12 education. The Blueprint builds on existing reforms and funding initiatives from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Blueprint for reforming the Elementary and Secondary Education Act focuses on key priorities such as College- and Career-Ready Students and Great Teachers and Leaders in Every School. It includes funding programs like the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, Race to the Top Program, and Investing in Innovation Fund. The Blueprint for reforming the Elementary and Secondary Education Act outlines key priorities including College- and Career-Ready Students, Great Teachers and Leaders in Every School, Equity and Opportunity for All Students, Raise the Bar and Reward Excellence, and Promote Innovation and Continuous Improvement. These priorities focus on effective teachers and principals, equitable resource distribution, accountability, student success, and fostering innovation. The Blueprint discusses these priorities in detail, emphasizing the importance of achieving these goals through various initiatives. The Blueprint for reforming the Elementary and Secondary Education Act outlines key priorities including College- and Career-Ready Students, Great Teachers and Leaders in Every School, Equity and Opportunity for All Students, Raise the Bar and Reward Excellence, and Promote Innovation and Continuous Improvement. The topics discussed in the Blueprint are not consistently organized in the same order as the priorities, and details of the reauthorization proposal vary in depth. The Blueprint is seen as a starting point for discussions on ESEA reauthorization. The report prepared in response to congressional demand maps the proposals in the Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization. It relies on the Blueprint and other sources to identify precise proposals and general directions. The document aims to map themes introduced in the Blueprint against current law. The report examines ED's ESEA reauthorization proposal, comparing it to current law based on themes from the Blueprint. It is organized around College- and Career-Ready Students and Additional Cross-Cutting Priorities, drawing comparisons where possible. Some sections of the Blueprint lack direct comparisons to the ESEA. The Blueprint lacks detail for some elements compared to current policy in the ESEA. Additional sources like the FY2011 budget request were used for more information. A concise side-by-side comparison is provided in Table A-2 for key provisions. Table A-2 provides a summary of key provisions in the Blueprint, while Table A-3 examines the consolidation of programs proposed in the FY2011 budget request. Table A-4 looks at funding for ESEA programs not subject to consolidation, and Table A-5 lists programs slated for elimination in the FY2011 budget. President Obama and the Secretary announced an ESEA flexibility package for states, offering waivers from academic accountability, teacher qualification, and funding requirements. States can apply for waivers for school years 2011-2014, with an option for a one-year extension. SEAs must meet four principles for improving education to receive the waivers. The ESEA flexibility package offers waivers to states from academic accountability, teacher qualification, and funding requirements. States must meet four principles set by ED to receive the waivers, including college- and career-ready expectations, differentiated recognition, effective instruction support, and reducing unnecessary burden. As of December 2012, 34 states and the District of Columbia had received approval for the ESEA flexibility package, with more applications under review. The ESEA flexibility package offers waivers to states from academic accountability, teacher qualification, and funding requirements. Congress may override these waivers with new provisions in the future. The focus is on current law, not the details of the flexibility package. More attention has been on accountability in education over the past decade. The No Child Left Behind Act introduced new provisions for academic standards, assessments, and accountability in education. These strategies include developing clear academic standards, aligning instruction to these standards, and using test-based accountability to measure student progress. Schools are rewarded for boosting student achievement or face consequences for failing to do so. The No Child Left Behind Act held schools and states accountable for student academic achievement through state-developed standards and assessments in language arts and mathematics. States were required to set proficiency benchmarks for students, aiming for all students to reach proficiency by 2013-2014. Schools and LEAs were annually assessed on student proficiency, participation in assessments, and additional academic indicators. The Blueprint proposes changes to academic accountability requirements, including eliminating AYP, altering standards and assessments in language arts and math, and modifying actions for schools not meeting performance targets. The goal of all students reaching proficiency by 2013-2014 would be replaced. The Blueprint proposes changes to academic accountability requirements, including replacing the goal of all students reaching proficiency by 2013-2014 with the goal of all students being college- and career-ready by 2020. It focuses on using Title I-A funds for standards, assessment, and accountability, renaming the program College- and Career-Ready Students. The Blueprint emphasizes the need for state-developed, college- and career-ready standards and assessments, rewarding schools for progress, addressing low-performing schools, and closing achievement gaps. The Blueprint proposes changes to Title I-A accountability requirements, focusing on college- and career-ready standards. Prior to NCLB, states had to adopt standards and assessments in language arts and math at three grade levels. States had to develop curriculum content standards and academic achievement standards to be eligible for Title I-A grants. Under the NCLB, states were required to develop and adopt standards and assessments in mathematics, language arts, and science at various grade levels. Achievement standards with three performance levels were established for all students. The Blueprint proposed states to adopt state-developed standards in language arts and mathematics that progress across grade levels. States would now be required to adopt standards for grades 3-12 in language arts and mathematics, with assessments aligned to these standards. High school assessments would determine if students are college- and career-ready. States have the option to upgrade existing standards certified by a four-year public university system. The Blueprint requires states to adopt standards for grades 3-12 in language arts and mathematics, with assessments aligned to these standards. States can upgrade existing standards certified by a four-year public university system or work with other states to create common standards for college- and career-readiness. The new standards must be evidence-based to ensure students graduate high school prepared for college and careers. However, there is a lack of clarity on what constitutes career-readiness and how those standards would be established. The Common Core State Standards Initiative is a grassroots effort led by the National Governor's Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to develop common standards for language arts and mathematics in grades K-12. Supported by 48 states and the District of Columbia, the initiative aims to build towards college- and career-readiness. States will have the option to adopt and implement these standards once the final version is released in 2010. Some states, like Massachusetts and Minnesota, have expressed concerns about the standards' quality. The Common Core Initiative aims to develop common standards for language arts and mathematics in grades K-12. States adopting the standards can add 15% to reflect state priorities. The federal government supports the initiative, which aligns with proposed Title I-A accountability requirements. States must also implement science standards and assessments. The Blueprint allows states to include science assessments in the accountability system, expanding beyond language arts and math. The proposal eliminates AYP, allowing states to create new accountability systems with assessments in various subjects. States must develop English language proficiency standards based on speaking, listening, reading, and writing domains. The Blueprint requires states to develop English language proficiency standards aligned with college- and career-readiness standards for ELLs. NCLB strengthened accountability provisions under Title I-A, requiring a single statewide system for all students. Under the ESEA, states must have a single accountability system for all schools and LEAs based on academic assessments and indicators. AYP is determined by student scores on state assessments and must include additional indicators like graduation rates for high schools and attendance rates for elementary and middle schools. The AYP calculations for schools and LEAs must be disaggregated by demographic groups, including economically disadvantaged students, LEP students, students with disabilities, and major racial and ethnic groups. To meet AYP standards, at least 95% of students overall and in each demographic group must participate in assessments, with required threshold levels of performance. States and LEAs must meet AYP standards by achieving required performance levels on assessments and other academic indicators for designated student groups. Annual report cards with academic achievement data must be disseminated, and states must submit reports to the Secretary for compilation into national and state-level data. ED has announced a shift away from using the current AYP system for identifying low-performing schools and LEAs. The Blueprint proposes a new accountability system that rewards schools for growth and success, with rigorous interventions for low-performing schools. States must have data systems to track progress in preparing students for college and career readiness, and make student performance data public. Unlike the current AYP system, strategies for improving schools would be determined at the local level. The Blueprint proposes public data on student performance in language arts, mathematics, and science, including graduation rates and college enrollment. Data must be disaggregated by race, gender, ethnicity, disability status, English learner status, and family income. This expands on current law which only requires graduation rates to be made public by subgroup. The Blueprint proposes collecting additional data on teaching and learning conditions, including school climate, attendance rates, disciplinary incidents, and survey data. This information would need to be reported regularly by states and LEAs to address gaps in performance between male and female students. The Blueprint proposes collecting data on teaching and learning conditions, including school climate, attendance rates, and disciplinary incidents. Student performance goals and measurement methods are outlined, with rewards for meeting targets and requirements for low-performing schools. Under current law, AYP standards aim for all students to reach proficiency by 2013-2014, with incremental increases in achievement levels over time. The Blueprint proposes replacing the goal of all students reaching proficiency in language arts and mathematics by 2013-2014 with the goal of all students being on track to graduate high school college- and career-ready by 2020. Performance targets would be based on the achievement and growth of all students in a school and in subgroups. Performance targets for the 2020 goal of all students being on track to graduate high school college- and career-ready would be established based on student achievement and growth, including graduation rates. States, LEAs, and schools meeting these targets would be recognized and rewarded. However, it is unclear who would set the targets, the level of achievement and growth required annually, and whether targets would be based on 100% college- and career-ready students by 2020. Additionally, accountability measures for states, LEAs, and schools during the transition to college- and career-ready standards are unclear. Under current law, the primary basic structure for AYP under the NCLB is specified as a \"group status model.\" States set a threshold percentage of students at proficient levels each year for all student subgroups. Threshold levels are set separately for language arts and mathematics, and may vary by K-12 level. Averaging scores over two to three years is allowed for determining group achievement levels. The NCLB statute includes alternative provisions for schools that do not meet AYP requirements, such as a 10% reduction in the number of failing students in each group compared to the previous year. This adds a \"successive group improvement\" model as a secondary AYP model. Another AYP model is the individual/cohort growth model, focusing on the rate of change in achievement over time among the same students. In November 2005, a growth model pilot program was announced by the Secretary for up to 10 states to use growth models for AYP determinations. In December 2007, the cap on states participating in the pilot was lifted. In October 2008, regulations were issued allowing states to request authority to include student growth measures in AYP definitions. The Blueprint released by the ED in January 2009 discusses the use of growth models in AYP determinations. By 2010, 15 states had included growth models in their AYP definition. The Blueprint emphasizes the importance of considering individual student growth and school progress over time in evaluating performance. Currently, only a few states are using growth models in their AYP determination process. The ESEA establishes a system of rewards and sanctions to hold schools and LEAs accountable for their performance. States are required to establish Academic Achievement Awards Programs to recognize schools and LEAs that have closed achievement gaps or exceeded AYP requirements. Awards may also be given to teachers and principals. States can fund these awards by reserving up to 5% of Title I-A funding. The Blueprint proposes an increased focus on rewarding schools, LEAs, and states that meet performance targets, significantly improve student performance, close achievement gaps, and turn around low-performing schools. These entities would be referred to as \"Reward\" schools, LEAs, and states, with funds provided to design innovative programs for them. The Blueprint proposes rewarding schools, LEAs, and states that meet performance targets, improve student performance, and turn around low-performing schools. Rewards may include financial incentives, participation in communities of practice, and flexibility in using ESEA funds. Competitive preference may be given to Reward states, high-need LEAs, and schools in federal grant competitions. Reward LEAs would have flexibility in implementing interventions in their lowest-performing schools, but the specifics are not detailed. It is unclear if Title I-A funds would be used for innovative programs and rewards. Under current law, Title I-A schools not meeting AYP for two consecutive years are identified for school improvement. This designation requires developing or revising a school plan for improvement, with LEAs providing technical assistance. Schools in improvement status must allocate at least 10% of Title I-A funds for professional development. Students in these schools have the option of public school choice, allowing them to transfer to another public school within the same LEA that is not in improvement status. LEAs must provide transportation for students transferring to different schools and prioritize low-achieving children from low-income families. Lack of capacity cannot be used as a reason to deny transfer requests. Schools failing to make AYP for two consecutive years are identified for school improvement and must allocate 10% of Title I-A funds for professional development. Students in schools identified for a second year of improvement must continue to be offered public school choice. Students attending a school in its second year of improvement must be offered the option to transfer to another eligible public school within the same LEA. Low-income students at the school must also be given the opportunity to receive supplemental educational services (SES), such as tutoring, outside of regular school hours. SES can be provided by nonprofit or for-profit entities, or the LEA, unless deemed unavailable by the SEA. The SEA must maintain a list of approved SES providers for parents to choose from. LEAs may need to allocate up to 20% of their Title I-A grants for this purpose. If a school fails to make AYP for two years, it must be identified for corrective action, which can include replacing staff, implementing a new curriculum, or restructuring the school's organization. LEAs must provide technical assistance, public school choice, and supplemental educational services. If a school does not make AYP for a third year after being identified for school improvement, the LEA must plan for restructuring, which can involve reopening as a charter school, replacing staff, contracting with an education management organization, turning over to the SEA, or implementing a major governance restructuring. If AYP is still not met after another year, restructuring must be implemented. Sanctions can be delayed for a year if AYP is met or due to unforeseen circumstances. Failure to make AYP for two consecutive years may exempt schools from school improvement sanctions. AYP standards apply to all public schools and LEAs receiving Title I-A grants. States failing to meet AYP standards only receive technical assistance. The Blueprint introduces \"Challenge\" states, requiring specific assistance for lower-performing schools. The Blueprint introduces \"Challenge\" schools, which include the lowest-performing 5% of schools in each state based on student achievement, growth, and graduation rates. States must identify schools in need of specific assistance, with unclear requirements for identifying these schools. The lowest-performing 5% may include schools receiving Title I-A funds and non-Title I-A schools. Under recent changes to the SIG program, non-Title I-A secondary schools meeting specific criteria can now receive SIG funds. Challenge schools must choose one of four school turnaround models: transformation, turnaround, restart, or closure. Restrictions on model usage under SIG may not apply to Challenge schools. Reward LEAs have flexibility to implement different intervention models. The lowest-performing schools, known as \"warning category,\" would receive assistance through research-based strategies. Another category, \"Challenge schools,\" includes those failing to close achievement gaps, with no specific percentage limit. States and LEAs have flexibility in providing assistance, not limited to the four turnaround models. The Blueprint proposes identifying Challenge schools based on specific criteria, with no set percentage limit. LEAs would need to implement data-driven interventions to help low-performing students and close achievement gaps. Strategies like expanded learning time and public school choice would be available. The use of these strategies would become optional under the proposal. Challenge LEAs and states would also be subject to provisions outlined in the Blueprint. The Blueprint proposes identifying Challenge schools based on specific criteria, with no set percentage limit. Challenge LEAs and states could face significant governance or staffing changes if schools, principals, or teachers are not receiving necessary support. Restrictions on ESEA funds and potential collaboration with outside organizations to improve student achievement may also be imposed, with details unspecified. Under current law, there is uncertainty regarding the percentage of Title I-A funds that would need to be reserved to support Challenge schools, LEAs, and states in the warning category. Depending on the amount or percentage of funds reserved, schools and LEAs not in the Challenge or Reward categories may receive less Title I-A funding. Under current law, funds are not specifically available for capacity building at the state and LEA levels to assist failing schools. States can reserve 4% of their Title I-A funds for school improvement efforts, but these funds are not reserved for building the capacity of states and LEAs to help schools in need of improvement. The Blueprint allows states and LEAs to reserve funds for various purposes to assist schools in need of improvement, including supporting the adoption of college- and career-ready standards, using data to improve student outcomes, enhancing technology in instruction, coordinating with early childhood programs, implementing family engagement strategies, and improving student performance in high-need schools. The percentage of funding that may be reserved is not specified. The Blueprint allows LEAs to reserve funds for school improvement strategies and equitable distribution of effective teachers. \"Reward districts\" get flexibility with this reservation, but the percentage to reserve is unclear. LEAs no longer need to provide public school choice and supplemental educational services. Title I-A comparability requirement ensures equivalent funding levels in Title I-A schools compared to non-Title I-A schools in the same LEA. The Title I-A comparability requirement ensures that state and local funds are provided equally to schools receiving Title I funds and other public schools within the same LEA. It aims to prevent federal funds from simply replacing state and local funds for Title I-A schools. There are concerns about LEAs using Title I-A funds to subsidize general operations instead of enhancing services for disadvantaged students. The comparability requirement in Title I-A aims to ensure equal funding for Title I-A schools and other public schools within the same LEA. Many LEAs meet this requirement without comparing expenditures or resources between the two types of schools. However, the lack of comprehensive school-level budgeting and accounting systems makes it challenging to report detailed financial data for comparability. This raises questions about the significance of the requirement as currently implemented. The Title I-A comparability requirement aims to ensure equal funding for Title I-A schools and other public schools within the same LEA. Comprehensive school-level budgeting and accounting systems are needed to effectively implement this requirement. Data on per-student expenditures from state and local sources are required to assess comparability, with the Education Department focusing on collecting this information. The Blueprint outlines ED's focus on comparability issues, collecting data on school expenditures, measuring resource disparities, and providing flexibility to LEAs supporting disadvantaged students. States must administer assessments in language arts, mathematics, and science to determine AYP. The ESEA requires states to administer science assessments in three grade bands. Two grant programs support states in developing and administering these assessments. Current law provides funding for state assessments through formula and competitive grants. The competitive grant program, known as grants for Enhanced Assessment Instruments, aims to improve the quality, validity, and reliability of state assessments. These funds can be used to develop various types of assessments, including those for special populations like English language learners and students with disabilities. States would use formula funding to align assessments with college- and career-ready standards in language arts and mathematics, measuring student academic achievement and growth. The Blueprint aims to improve academic achievement through assessments aligned with college- and career-ready standards. States would use funds to develop various assessments in different subjects and for special populations. Formula funds would only be available to states implementing these standards. Competitive grants would support research and development of additional assessments in various areas. The Blueprint for improving academic achievement through assessments aligned with college- and career-ready standards does not specify changes to current ESEA assessment requirements. It continues to support assessing language arts, mathematics, and science at specific grade levels. However, the Blueprint does not address how to assess students with disabilities, leaving a gap in providing assessment options for those for whom the state assessment is not suitable due to their disability. The Blueprint for improving academic achievement through assessments aligned with college- and career-ready standards does not specify changes to current ESEA assessment requirements. It continues to support assessing language arts, mathematics, and science at specific grade levels. However, the Blueprint does not address how to assess students with disabilities, leaving a gap in providing assessment options for those for whom the state assessment is not suitable due to their disability. Options for two groups of students with disabilities are discussed: (1) students with the most significant cognitive disabilities (AA-AAS), and (2) students with disabilities whose disabilities may prevent them from achieving grade-level proficiency within a year but who do not have the most significant cognitive disabilities (AA-MAS). ED has indicated support for alternate assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities (AA-AAS) but has not confirmed support for other students with disabilities (AA-MAS). Instead, ED stated that new state assessments developed through the Assessing Achievement formula grant program would consider the needs of students with disabilities. The Achievement formula grant program considers the needs of students with disabilities in assessment development. Federal funds are provided under School Improvement Grants to assist failing schools. The Blueprint proposal builds on changes to target funds on the lowest-performing schools. The ESEA authorizes a separate formula grant program for state School Improvement Grants to support school improvement activities. At least 95% of each state's funds are allocated to LEAs to serve schools in need. The School Improvement Grants program provides funds to LEAs to help schools in need of improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. States prioritize grants for schools with the greatest need and commitment to improving. Schools eligible for assistance under Title I-A that have not met AYP for two years or are in the lowest performance quintile can receive these grants. Each school served must receive at least $50,000 from the state. The School Improvement Grants program requires states to provide LEAs with $50,000 to $2 million annually, renewable for two years. Priority is given to the lowest-performing schools, defined as Tier 1 or Tier 2 based on specific criteria. The School Improvement Grants program focuses on the lowest-achieving schools, with Tier 1 and Tier 2 schools receiving funds for specific intervention models. Tier 3 schools may also receive grants based on state-established criteria. The program targets schools identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring, with a graduation rate below 60% or in the lowest-achieving 5%. The Blueprint proposes similar measures for low-performing schools as the School Improvement Grants program. States must allocate funds to LEAs committed to implementing one of four models in Tier 1 and Tier 2 schools: turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation. The turnaround model involves replacing the principal and providing more flexibility in staffing and budget. The Blueprint proposes measures for low-performing schools, including four models for Tier 1 and Tier 2 schools: turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation. The restart model involves converting or closing and reopening a school under new management selected through a rigorous process. The closure model requires closing a school and enrolling students in higher-performing schools within the LEA. The transformation model under the Blueprint requires implementing strategies to increase teacher and school leader effectiveness, using research-based instructional programs, increasing learning time, and creating community-oriented schools. The program would be renamed School Turnaround Grants under the reauthorization proposal. States would receive funds by formula and could reserve some funds to build state capacity for improving low-performing schools. The Blueprint proposes using funds to improve low-performing schools through various intervention models like transformation, turnaround, restart, and school closure. LEAs and nonprofit organizations could receive grants to implement these models for three years, with the possibility of two additional years of funding for schools showing improvement. The Administration proposes changes to the School Improvement Grants (SIG) program, including reserving funds for the Secretary to support activities to improve low-performing schools. States would be required to develop standards in language arts and mathematics for grades 3-12, continue annual assessments in grades 3-8, and create assessments for college- and career-readiness in high school. The proposal aims to replace the current AYP system with a new goal for all students to be college- and career-ready by 2020. There will be a focus on rewarding schools that meet performance targets, improve student performance, close achievement gaps, and turn around low-performing schools. Different categories of low-performing schools will have specific requirements for improvement, with continued funding and specific models for turnaround. The federal government historically had limited involvement in teacher policy, but with the No Child Left Behind Act, new provisions were added to ensure teacher quality. States and LEAs were required to develop plans to meet minimum teacher quality requirements by the 2005-2006 school year. The NCLB highly qualified teacher requirement shifted to focusing on effective teachers and leaders based on student academic growth. The Blueprint emphasizes federal teacher and leadership programs, particularly the ESEA, Title II-A, Improving Teacher Quality State Grants. The Blueprint emphasizes the importance of teacher and leader effectiveness, focusing on improving evaluation, rewarding effective educators, and strengthening recruitment and preparation programs. It aims to consolidate and refocus current programs to support teachers and leaders in providing effective instruction for all students. The ED proposes to rename the formula grants under ESEA, Title II-A to Effective Teachers and Leaders State Grants, focusing on improving school staff effectiveness. Grants are awarded to SEAs, which then distribute funds to LEAs based on a formula considering school-aged population and poverty levels. The Blueprint proposes a formula grant allocation to states based on school-aged population and poverty levels, with states required to subgrant at least 90% of funds to LEAs. The Secretary can reserve 1.5% of funds for national activities, and funds may also support continuation grants for various current programs. Quality Partnerships, Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, and Transition to Teaching programs under Title II-A focus on improving teacher quality through activities like professional development and class-size reduction. NCLB required core subject-matter teachers to meet new highly qualified teacher requirements by possessing a bachelor's degree and state teaching certificate. The Blueprint proposes the Effective Teachers and Leaders program. The Blueprint proposes the Effective Teachers and Leaders program, which would mandate reform of teacher and principal evaluation systems. It includes requirements for statewide definitions of effective teachers and principals, state-level data systems linking teacher preparation programs to outcomes, and district-level policies. The Blueprint proposes the Effective Teachers and Leaders program, which mandates reform of teacher and principal evaluation systems. It includes requirements for statewide definitions of effectiveness, state-level data systems linking teacher preparation programs to outcomes, and district-level evaluation systems that differentiate teacher and principal effectiveness in multiple performance levels. The majority of Title II-A funds are currently used for professional development, replacing class-size reduction as the largest area of spending. The Blueprint aims to improve teacher and leader effectiveness by reforming evaluation systems. Current professional development lacks effectiveness, with only 43% of teachers receiving more than 16 hours of training annually. The program also lacks teacher collaboration and curriculum development. The Blueprint seeks to address these issues by focusing on the outcomes of supported activities. The Blueprint focuses on improving teacher and leader effectiveness through enhanced evaluation systems. Grantees would develop fair and meaningful evaluation systems, provide collaboration and development opportunities, build instructional teams, and offer job-embedded professional development. These activities must align with evidence of student learning improvements and aim to distribute effective teachers and principals equitably. Districts with required evaluation systems may have flexible spending options. The Blueprint aims to improve teacher and leader effectiveness by requiring the publication of key indicators of program success in state and district report cards every two years. These reports must include information on teacher qualifications, effectiveness designations, support levels, working conditions, teacher and principal attendance, retention rates, and more. Additionally, the Blueprint proposes merging two competitive grant programs that reward teacher performance and career advancement. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) and Advanced Credentialing programs will be merged into the new Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund, which supports teacher and principal compensation reform based on performance, student achievement gains, and leadership roles in challenging schools. The Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund merges the Teacher Incentive Fund and Advanced Credentialing programs to support compensation reforms, teacher and principal development, and evaluation. Applicants must demonstrate a significant investment in their project's sustainability. The Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund merges programs to support compensation reforms, teacher and principal development, and evaluation. States and districts can implement ambitious reforms to identify, recruit, prepare, retain, reward, and advance effective educators. Nonprofit organizations can partner with states and LEAs for grants under Advanced Credentialing and compete for an Innovation Fund grant. Existing competitive grant programs will be combined into a new program called Teacher and Leader Pathways. The Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund merges programs to support compensation reforms, teacher and principal development, and evaluation. States and districts can implement ambitious reforms to identify, recruit, prepare, retain, reward, and advance effective educators. Nonprofit organizations can partner with states and LEAs for grants under Advanced Credentialing and compete for an Innovation Fund grant. Five current competitive grant programs would be combined under this new program into two activities: Teacher Pathways and Transformational Leaders. The HEA authorizes grants to Teach for America, Inc. and the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program to enhance teachers' content knowledge. The Blueprint aims to consolidate programs to strengthen pathways into teaching by providing competitive grants to prepare teachers for college- and career-ready standards. The Secretary may reserve up to 5% of funds for a national teacher recruitment campaign to recruit talented candidates into the teaching profession. The current School Leadership program assists high-need LEAs in recruiting, training, and retaining principals and assistant principals. The Blueprint under the School Leadership program aims to strengthen pathways into school leadership by providing grants to prepare principals for improving student outcomes in low-performing schools. It also focuses on conditions that increase success, such as autonomy over staffing and budget. Up to 5% of funds may be reserved for recruiting and supporting state and district leaders. The Administration proposes changes for teachers, requiring states to define effective teachers and principals based on student growth and other measures. States must develop district-level evaluation systems that differentiate effectiveness, provide feedback for professional development, and involve stakeholders. New indicators of program success would be published at the state level. The Blueprint proposes new indicators of program success in state and district report cards every two years. It merges existing grant programs into the Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund and Teacher and Leader Pathways. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act supports programs for student groups facing challenges in education. The Blueprint proposes to thematically group existing educational programs that support access to high-quality education for student groups facing unique challenges. These programs include support for migrant, neglected, delinquent, English language learners, rural education, Native American education, homeless students, and children connected with federal activities. The Blueprint aims to strengthen elementary and secondary education programs targeting diverse learners under the new heading of Meeting the Needs of English Learners and Other Diverse Learners. The Blueprint proposes to group existing educational programs supporting diverse learners, including students with disabilities, ELLs, migrant workers' children, homeless children, neglected and delinquent children, American Indians, rural area children, and children connected with federal activities. It highlights changes to ESEA programs related to diverse learners, emphasizing the importance of preparing all students for college or a career. The ESEA influences the education of students with disabilities by requiring their participation in state assessments and accountability systems. The Blueprint does not suggest changes for students with disabilities under a reauthorized ESEA. Title III of the ESEA mandates language instruction programs for limited English proficient students to meet state academic standards. The Blueprint proposal aims to establish consistent statewide criteria for identifying and placing LEP students in language instruction programs, addressing concerns about current criteria not considering various factors. This would require states to set criteria for both identifying and exiting LEP students from language programs. Under current law, SEAs can require failing LEAs to develop improvement plans if they do not meet their AMAOs for two consecutive years. LEAs failing for four consecutive years may face consequences such as modifying their language instruction program, fund withdrawal, and personnel replacement by the SEA. The Blueprint proposal suggests that LEAs consistently failing to meet their AMAOs would have less flexibility and be required to work with the SEA to implement more effective strategies. The SEA would provide a list of effective programs for the LEA to choose from. The Blueprint proposal would require states to create a system to evaluate the effectiveness of language instruction educational programs, increasing accountability for ensuring that LEP students are supported. States would provide a list of effective programs for LEAs to choose from, aiming to improve outcomes for English language learners. The Blueprint proposal aims to increase state accountability for LEP students' English proficiency and academic achievement. States must lead in improving language instruction programs, disaggregate LEP students by subgroups, and fund competitive grant programs. The Blueprint proposal includes a competitive grant program to support innovative programs for LEP students, such as graduate research fellowships and teacher preparation. The Migrant Education Program provides grants to SEAs based on the 2000-2001 count of eligible migrant children. The Migrant Education Program provides grants to states based on the 2000-2001 count of eligible migrant children, with adjustments made for inaccurate data. The program aims to assist states in improving coordination of educational programs for migrant students. The Blueprint proposal suggests updating the formula grant program with more accurate and timely data. The Education for Homeless Children and Youths program provides assistance to ensure homeless children have equal access to education. Grants are used for enrollment, attendance, and academic success, including tutoring and medical services. The Education for Homeless Children and Youths program provides assistance such as tutoring, medical services, and referral services. States must submit a plan to identify homeless children, ensure their participation in food programs, and address issues like transportation and immunization. The Blueprint proposes renaming the program to Homeless Children and Youth Education and changing the allocation formula based on the number of homeless students in each state. The program prohibits segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for emergencies. An exception was made for four counties in FY2000. The Blueprint aims to eliminate the exception for separate schools for homeless children. Current Law authorizes programs for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students. The Blueprint proposes to retain programs for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students, including Title I-D Subpart 1 and Subpart 2. Subpart 1 provides formula grants to states based on student numbers and expenditures, while Subpart 2 awards grants to LEAs with high numbers of students in correctional facilities. Additionally, the ESEA Title VII authorizes supplemental educational programs for Native American children and families. The Indian education formula grant program allows funds to be used for language needs and culturally relevant curriculum for Native American students. Special programs also support bilingual and bicultural education for Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native students. The Blueprint aims to expand funding for native language immersion and restoration programs. Under the Blueprint, education programs for native language immersion and restoration would receive expanded funding. Funds from Indian education programs could be used to develop tribal-specific academic standards and assessments. Eligibility for Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native programs would be extended to LEAs and public charter schools. BIE-funded schools currently receive ESEA program funds through set-asides or competing as an LEA, but are not eligible for most programs that fund states or specific organizations. Tribal groups have requested eligibility for all ESEA programs and more oversight of Indian students in the public school system. Some tribal education departments provide resources and services to public schools educating tribe's students. The relationship between LEA/public school and TED depends on preference. Blueprint aims to increase access to ESEA funding for BIE-funded schools and codify TEDs' role. ESEA Title VI-B provides funding for rural education through REAP. SRSA and RLIS grants would be retained with level funding. The Rural School Achievement (SRSA) program and the Rural, Low-Income School (RLIS) program allocate funds to eligible LEAs based on student attendance and previous federal funding. Eligible LEAs must serve rural schools or areas defined as rural by the state. LEAs with small REAP allocations can use funds for Title I-A and Title III activities. The RLIS program allows funds to be used for authorized activities under Title I-A, Title III, or Title IV-B. Funds are allocated to states based on ADA in eligible LEAs. LEAs must serve schools with locale codes of 6, 7, or 8 to be eligible. The Blueprint proposes to split funds evenly between SRSA and RLIS, with grant amounts determined by existing formulas. The method to identify eligible LEAs may be updated for better fund targeting. The Blueprint proposes updating the method to identify rural districts for better fund targeting. This could impact LEA eligibility for REAP programs. The \"REAP Flex\" authority would be expanded to include RLIS-eligible LEAs, with funds reserved for national activities to support rural districts. The Blueprint proposes continuing formula grants for Impact Aid programs, providing flexibility in fund usage for LEAs. No major changes are suggested for programs supporting diverse learners, students with disabilities, neglected and delinquent children, and migrant children. The Blueprint proposes grouping various instructional programs under thematic headings that reflect the content area being taught, such as literacy, science, technology, engineering, and more. These programs are supported throughout different Titles of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Blueprint aims to consolidate academic programs under the heading of A Complete Education, which includes improving teaching and learning across various content areas like literacy, STEM, history, civics, and more. Thematic areas addressed by the Blueprint include Literacy, STEM, Ensuring a Well-Rounded Education, College Pathways and Accelerated Learning, and Activities to Strengthen a Complete Education. The ESEA currently supports federal literacy programs like Striving Readers and Even Start. Striving Readers grants help implement reading curricula for middle and high school students, while Even Start grants support family literacy programs for low-income children and their parents. The Even Start program supports family literacy by integrating early childhood education, adult education, and parenting education. Under the Blueprint, various literacy programs would be consolidated into a new program called Effective Teaching and Learning: Literacy. This program would award competitive grants to states to assist in supporting high-need LEAs and partnerships. The Blueprint proposes a Literacy program that would provide competitive grants to states for developing evidence-based pre-K through grade 12 literacy plans. States would prioritize college- and career-ready standards and subgrant funds to high-need LEAs for comprehensive literacy programs, including professional development and high-quality curricula. States must align federal, state, and local funds for high-quality literacy instruction. The Blueprint proposes a Literacy program that would provide competitive grants to states for developing evidence-based pre-K through grade 12 literacy plans. States would prioritize college- and career-ready standards and subgrant funds to high-need LEAs for comprehensive literacy programs, including professional development and high-quality curricula. States must align federal, state, and local funds for high-quality literacy instruction. Grants will be awarded to LEAs that plan to align resources, implement effective programs, target schools with the greatest need, or have a plan for program sustainability. The current MSP program under ESEA focuses on STEM programs and requires partnerships to engage in various activities to improve math and science education. The Blueprint proposes renaming the MSP program to the STEM program, awarding competitive grants to assist states in strengthening STEM education. States must align funds for STEM instruction, improve teachers' skills, and prioritize college- and career-ready standards. Priority will be given to states using technology for student learning. The Blueprint proposes renaming the MSP program to the STEM program and awarding competitive grants to assist states in strengthening STEM education. States must align funds for STEM instruction, improve teachers' skills, and prioritize college- and career-ready standards. Priority will be given to states using technology for student learning and cooperating with outside partners to prepare more students for advanced study and STEM careers. States would award competitive subgrants to high-need districts to support comprehensive STEM instruction, including professional development for teachers, high-quality curricula, instructional materials, and assessments. The current formula-based state grant program would be replaced by a competitive state grant program under the Blueprint. The Blueprint proposes renaming the MSP program to the STEM program and awarding competitive grants to assist states in strengthening STEM education. States must align funds for STEM instruction, improve teachers' skills, and prioritize college- and career-ready standards. Priority will be given to states using technology for student learning and cooperating with outside partners to prepare more students for advanced study and STEM careers. States would award competitive subgrants to high-need districts to support comprehensive STEM instruction, including professional development for teachers, high-quality curricula, instructional materials, and assessments. The Administration's budget justification states that the activities supported by the new STEM program would be more competitive, accountable, and likely to result in significant achievement gains than those carried out under previous Federal math and science programs. The Blueprint proposes creating a new competitive grant program to support the teaching and learning of various subjects, including arts, foreign languages, history, and civics. Grants would focus on developing instructional practices that benefit all students, such as professional development, improved assessments, and innovative technology. Priority would be given to proposals that integrate teaching across subjects, use technology, and align high school coursework with college readiness. The Administration's FY2011 budget request proposes consolidating current competitive grant programs into a new program called Effective Teaching and Learning for a Well-Rounded Education. Programs to be combined include Excellence in Economic Education, Teaching American History, Arts in Education, Foreign Language Assistance, Academies for American History and Civics, Close Up Fellowships, Civic Education: We the People, and Civic Education: Cooperative Education Exchange under the ESEA. The ESEA authorizes programs for accelerated learning opportunities like the High School Graduation Initiative, Advanced Placement, and Javits Gifted and Talented Education. The Blueprint proposes the College Pathways and Accelerated Learning program to provide grants for increasing accelerated learning opportunities for elementary and middle school students. The High School Graduation Initiative aims to provide access to gifted and talented education programs for high school students, especially in high-poverty schools. Grantees are encouraged to expand programs like Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate, offer early-college or dual-enrollment options, and provide support services like counseling and mentoring. Priority is given to schools with low graduation rates and partnerships with higher education institutions to make credits transferable. The Administration's FY2011 budget request proposes consolidating current programs into a new competitive grant program called College Pathways and Accelerated Learning. Programs to be combined include the High School Graduation Initiative, Advanced Placement program, and Javits Gifted and Talented Education program. The Ed-Tech program aims to improve student academic achievement through technology in schools. The Administration's FY2011 budget request proposes consolidating current programs into a new competitive grant program called College Pathways and Accelerated Learning. The Ed-Tech program aims to ensure technological literacy for students by eighth grade and integrate technology resources with teacher training and curriculum development. The Blueprint allows the Secretary to set aside funds for activities like grants for educational digital content creation and improving technology use in instruction. Ed-Tech would no longer be a separate program, but activities could still receive funding under other programs. The Administration proposes consolidating ESEA programs into new programs like Literacy, STEM, Ensuring a Well-Rounded Education, and College Pathways and Accelerated Learning. The Ed-Tech program would no longer be authorized as a separate program. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act focuses on improving student achievement and creating a safe learning environment. The Blueprint proposes increasing funding for programs supporting safe learning environments and consolidating existing programs to meet students' needs. This includes changes to ESEA Title IV programs such as 21st Century Community Learning Centers and the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act. The Blueprint proposes a new program called Supporting Student Success to fund innovative approaches for children's needs, including Promise Neighborhoods, before- and after-school programs, full-service community schools, and activities for student safety and health. The Promise Neighborhoods program, funded under demonstration authority, aims to provide high-quality educational opportunities, community services, and family support to help children succeed in school and beyond. It builds on the success of the Harlem Children's Zone in improving outcomes for children and youth in high-need communities. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program provides academic enrichment and additional services for children and youth in high-need communities. Funding supports planning and implementation grants for community-based organizations serving these areas. The Blueprint for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program proposes changing it to a competitive grant program, prioritizing support for Challenge schools and comprehensive programs. It is unclear how often competitions would occur or if they would be open to all eligible entities. In addition to current out-of-school-time activities, the program aims to offer literacy and educational development opportunities for students and families. The restructured 21st CCLC program would fund extended learning time opportunities and full-service community schools, with a proposed budget of $1.166 billion in FY2011. It is unclear how funds would be allocated between different programs or if they would compete for the same pool of money. The Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) is a federal initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. Prior to elimination of the State Grants program, critics argued that funds were spread too broadly. In FY2010, National Activities received $191 million in funding while State Grants received none. The program was restructured into Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students, providing competitive grants to SEAs and Title I-eligible LEAs. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposal would consolidate existing programs into the new Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students program, providing competitive grants to SEAs and Title I-eligible LEAs. Grantees must conduct a school climate needs assessment to improve safety, well-being, and engagement. Funds can be used to address substance use, violence, bullying, and strengthen family and community engagement. Priority will be given to partnerships with nonprofit organizations and schools with the greatest need. Proposed funding for FY2011 is $410 million. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposes consolidating existing programs into the Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students program with $410 million in funding. Key changes include expanding the Promise Neighborhood program and enhancing the 21st CCLC to provide comprehensive support for children and youth in high-need communities. The 21st CCLC program would transition from a formula grant to a competitive grant program under the Blueprint. The Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities National Activities program would be consolidated into a new program called Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students, offering competitive grants to SEAs and Title I-eligible LEAs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act supports educational programs through both formula and competitive funding, with a focus on continuing competitive grant programs alongside formula grants. Under the Blueprint, ED is interested in offering public school choice options like charter schools and magnet schools, in addition to existing formula grant programs. The Blueprint proposal focuses on supporting innovative programs for college- and career-ready students, including an expanded Race to the Top program, additional funding for the Investing in Innovation Fund, a modified Charter Schools Program, and funding for public school choice and magnet schools. Division A, Sections 14006 and 14007 of the ARRA authorized State Incentive Grants and the Innovation Fund, now known as Race to the Top and i3, respectively. Under the ARRA, $53.6 billion was allocated for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to support education. $5 billion was set aside for the Race to the Top (RTTT) program, with an option to use $650 million for the Investing in Innovation (i3) program. RTTT grants are given to states, with at least 50% of funds going to LEAs under Title I-A of the ESEA. The RTTT program, part of the ESEA Title I-A program, includes four priorities from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. Modifications were made for the first round of competition, with added eligibility priorities and areas for educational plans. The Blueprint proposes expanding the program to allow states and LEAs to compete for grants under the ESEA. States would compete for grants based on their educational plans. States and LEAs would compete for grants under the ESEA, with a focus on improving student outcomes through college- and career-ready standards, better data for students and families, support for teachers and school leaders, intervention in low-performing schools, and innovative reform models. The proposed RTTT program would require states to award at least 50% of funds to LEAs participating in the state plan, with flexibility in fund usage. Grantees must meet annual performance targets and improve outcomes for students. Continuation funding would depend on effective plan implementation. States and LEAs could receive multi-year grants, but the Blueprint does not specify the duration. All grantees must invest in rigorous evaluation. The i3 program, established under the ARRA, awards competitive grants for innovative practices in education. Grantees must invest in rigorous evaluation and adhere to four absolute priorities outlined by the Secretary. The i3 program, established under the ARRA, awards competitive grants for innovative practices in education. Applicants must choose one absolute priority to address in their application, along with optional competitive preference priorities. Grants are awarded based on a three-tiered evidence framework for different types of grants (Development, Validation, and Scale-Up) depending on the level of evidence for the educational practice or program. The i3 program, part of the ESEA, requires applicants to conduct independent evaluations and secure matching funds. The program provides competitive grants for innovative practices that improve student outcomes, using a three-tiered evidence framework for funding allocation. The i3 program under ESEA requires grantees to conduct independent evaluations, form partnerships, and secure matching funds. The Secretary has discretion to prioritize applications addressing specific pressing needs in education. The program aims to improve STEM teaching, early learning outcomes, support English language learners and students with disabilities, and serve rural schools. The FY2011 budget requests $500 million for i3, with $150 million allocated for inducement prizes to incentivize interventions. The i3 program under ESEA, newly authorized, would allocate $500 million in the FY2011 budget, with $150 million for STEM education projects. States could apply for special projects to expand educational options through competitive grants. The Blueprint aims to promote educational entrepreneurship and increase high-quality public school options. Existing federal grant programs for charter schools, public school choice, and magnet schools would be expanded under the Blueprint. The Charter Schools Program (CSP) provides grants for planning, program design, and implementation of charter schools. In FY2010, $256 million was allocated to CSP programs. States with charter school laws can apply for grants and then distribute them to charter schools. Changes were made to the CSP through the FY2010 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants program provides matching funds to states for per-student facilities allowances for charter schools. Only four states have received grants under this program: California, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Utah. The Credit Enhancement program offers grants to entities for credit enhancement initiatives to help charter schools with facility costs. Eligible entities include public or private nonprofit entities. The Blueprint expands grants to high-performing charter and autonomous public schools with similar autonomy. The Blueprint expands grants to high-performing charter and autonomous public schools, requiring them to adhere to the same accountability system as traditional public schools. Grantees must demonstrate a track record of supporting high-performing schools and improving student academic achievement, with a focus on serving all students, including those with disabilities. The Blueprint supports grants for high-performing charter and autonomous public schools, requiring them to follow the same accountability system as traditional public schools. Grantees are expected to show a history of supporting high-performing schools and improving student academic achievement, with a focus on serving all students, including those with disabilities. The Blueprint also mentions that charter management organizations collaborating with LEAs to enhance schools operated by the LEA may qualify for larger grants. Additionally, the Secretary could reserve funds to improve charter schools' access to facilities or funding for facilities. The ESEA, Title V-B-3 authorizes the Voluntary Public School Choice program, providing competitive grants for up to five years to support public school choice. Priority is given to applications offering a wide variety of choices, helping students move from low-performing to high-performing schools. Grant recipients must use funds for transportation costs, and partnerships for interdistrict choice are encouraged. The Voluntary Public School Choice program provides competitive grants to support public school options for students, especially those in low-performing schools. Grantees must involve parents, communities, and educators in program development and notify parents about program availability. The program focuses on interdistrict and intradistrict choice programs, with potential expansion to include theme-based schools, online education, and academic pathways. Grantees are required to provide information to students, families, and communities on accessing high-quality education. The Magnet Schools Assistance program aims to desegregate schools by providing financial assistance for innovative educational methods that promote diversity and increase school choice. Grants are awarded for three years to LEAs implementing desegregation plans. The Magnet Schools Assistance program provides financial assistance for desegregation plans approved by the Secretary, bringing together students from diverse backgrounds through specialized curriculum or instructional methods. The program is a competitive grant program under the Blueprint, emphasizing funding for magnet schools. The Administration proposes changes to the Magnet Schools Assistance program, emphasizing funding for whole-school magnet programs that improve academic achievement and reduce minority group isolation. The program would be expanded to include support for high-performing charter schools and autonomous public schools. The Blueprint outlines additional priorities for reauthorized programs under the ESEA, aiming to redefine the federal role in education by promoting state and local innovation and rewarding success. Comparisons between current law and these priorities are challenging due to the lack of a parallel section in the ESEA. The Blueprint from the Department of Education aims to redefine the federal role in education by promoting state and local innovation, rewarding success, and fostering collaborative relationships with states, districts, and nonprofit partners. It proposes granting more flexibility to states and LEAs in exchange for improved outcomes, expanding programs that show results, and focusing on key priorities. The discussion of cross-cutting priorities is meant to unite proposed educational programs and policies during the reauthorization of the ESEA, although details on how each priority is reflected in the proposed programs are lacking. The Blueprint discusses cross-cutting priorities such as Flexibility for Success, Growing Success, Evaluation, and Building the Knowledge Base. Federal K-12 education assistance program requirements aim to establish accountability for fund usage, focusing on eligible localities, student outcomes, and financial integrity. The ESEA contains special flexibility authorities for K-12 instruction quality and fiscal accountability, allowing exceptions to general requirements. These authorities increase states' and LEAs' ability to use federal funding according to their priorities but are limited in participation and waivers. The Blueprint aims to provide additional flexibility to states and LEAs. Under the Blueprint, the Department of Education (ED) would offer states and LEAs more flexibility in using federal funds to improve student outcomes. This includes using administrative funds to support reform and improvement efforts. Grantees showing significant improvement in student outcomes would be eligible for continuation funds and funds to expand their strategies to more students, schools, LEAs, or states. The Blueprint proposes using federal funds to target successful projects and expand strategies to more students, schools, LEAs, or states. It suggests collaboration at federal, state, and local levels to use data for continuous improvement, test innovative ideas, evaluate and replicate promising approaches, and scale-up programs with improved results. The Department of Education has begun establishing competitive grant programs under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to further school reform goals and evaluate progress. The Blueprint may seek to expand current evaluation mechanisms or align state, local, and federal evaluation efforts. The Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development (OPEPD) and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) conduct evaluations of educational policies, programs, and interventions at state, local, and federal levels. They conduct congressionally mandated evaluations and evaluations of national interest determined by the Department of Education. The Blueprint proposes a new evaluation authority for rigorous evaluations of ESEA programs, policies, and practices, with a biennial plan submitted to Congress. The Secretary would submit a biennial plan on ESEA evaluation and performance measurement to Congress and establish an independent panel for advice. The Administration's FY2011 budget includes $9.2 million for a \"reauthorized Title I Evaluation authority\" to evaluate Title I programs. The Blueprint discusses priorities for education reform. The Blueprint discusses priorities for education reform, including Technology, Evidence, Efficiency, Supporting English Learners and Students with Disabilities, and Supporting Rural and Other High-Need Areas. These priorities are encouraged to be incorporated across educational programs and policies, particularly in competitive grant programs like RTTT and i3. It is unclear how these priorities would be incentivized in formula grant programs. The Blueprint emphasizes the use of technology to improve schools, teaching, and learning. It prioritizes programs that leverage digital technology in grant applications, similar to the focus in RTTT and i3 grant programs. Technology is integrated into various educational programs within the Blueprint. The Blueprint proposes funding areas with evidence of effectiveness in improving student outcomes, focusing on scientifically based research for education activities and programs under the ESEA. The Blueprint proposes funding programs with evidence of effectiveness in improving student outcomes, prioritizing those with a strong evidentiary base. The i3 program uses a three-tiered framework of evidence for competitive grants, and RTTT requires specific evidence for proposed educational programs. The shift to \"evidence-based\" programs is mentioned in various areas, but the type or level of evidence required is not clearly defined by the ED. The Blueprint emphasizes funding evidence-based programs to improve student outcomes, with a focus on efficiency in resource utilization. The RTTT program evaluates applicants on their ability to implement programs effectively and efficiently. However, the specific level of evidence required for effectiveness is not clearly defined by the ED. The Blueprint emphasizes accountability for educating all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities. Priority may be given to programs that improve the performance of these groups. The primary legislation for English language learners is the ESEA, and for students with disabilities is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Blueprint provides details on ELL education programs. The Blueprint emphasizes accountability for educating all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities. While ELL education programs are detailed, there is relatively little information on programs for students with disabilities. Both groups have unique educational needs that may require different policies, programs, or practices. For example, assessments for ELLs may not be suitable for students with disabilities, and teachers trained for ELLs may not be equipped to teach students with disabilities. In the i3 program, applicants are given preference points for addressing the unique learning needs of ELLs or students with disabilities. The Blueprint aims to ensure that rural and high-need districts are not disadvantaged in applying for grants, possibly through offering more technical assistance or structuring grant programs to prioritize these districts. The i3 program awards competitive preference points to applicants proposing innovations for rural LEAs. If reauthorized as a new ESEA program, support for rural and high-need areas may continue through competitive preference points. The Administration proposes changes to priorities across ESEA programs, introducing new organizational constructs not currently used. The Administration proposes new organizational constructs for ESEA programs, but it is unclear how these priorities would be represented in new legislation."
