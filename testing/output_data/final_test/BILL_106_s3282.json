    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Energy University Nuclear Science and Engineering Act\". The Congress finds a serious decline in U.S. university nuclear science and engineering programs, with a low supply of personnel and a decrease in degree programs. Universities struggle to support research and training reactors, with a significant decline in the number of reactors since 1980. The neglect in human investment and training infrastructure is impacting national R&D investment. The decline in a competent nuclear workforce and lack of trained nuclear scientists/engineers will hinder the US in solving waste storage issues, maintaining nuclear programs, operating reactors, responding to nuclear events, preventing weapon proliferation, and designing naval reactors. Further neglect will lead to a decrease in nuclear science departments, aging faculties, and closing training reactors, diminishing the appeal of nuclear science to future students. The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Science and Technology plays a crucial role in maintaining human resources and training investments in nuclear sciences. It supports research and development in civilian nuclear research, funds basic nuclear science and engineering through the Nuclear Engineering and Education Research Program, and collaborates with universities, industry, and national laboratories in areas like proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and future fission. The Office of Nuclear Science and Technology funds universities for refueling training reactors with low enriched fuels, instrumentation upgrades, and student fellowships in nuclear science, engineering, and health physics. The Department of Energy program focuses on funding universities for refueling training reactors with low enriched fuels, instrumentation upgrades, and student fellowships in nuclear science, engineering, and health physics. The Secretary of Energy supports a program to maintain the Nation's human resource investment and infrastructure in nuclear sciences and engineering. The Office of Nuclear Science and Technology will develop fellowship programs, assist universities in recruiting faculty, and invest in fundamental nuclear sciences and engineering. The Nuclear Engineering Education Research Program supports collaborative nuclear research between industry, national laboratories, and universities. Funds are allocated for research reactor infrastructure maintenance, including refueling with low enriched fuels and upgrading instrumentation. Collaboration with the U.S. nuclear industry is emphasized. The Nuclear Engineering Education Research Program supports collaborative nuclear research between industry, national laboratories, and universities. It includes a reactor research and training award program for reactor improvements, a sabbatical fellowship program for university professors at Department of Energy laboratories, and a visiting scientist program for laboratory staff in academic nuclear science and engineering departments. The Secretary provides fellowships for students to work in Department of Energy laboratories in nuclear science. All financial assistance awards require independent merit review. SEC. 4.
