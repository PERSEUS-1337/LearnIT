    "content": "In 1991, the House of Representatives faced potential reapportionment due to the unconstitutionality of the current \"equal proportions\" formula. The court criticized Congress for not considering absolute population variances between districts for over fifty years. The court declared section 2a of Title 2, United States Code unconstitutional due to unjustified population differences between districts. The Supreme Court upheld the decision, stating that absolute and relative differences in district sizes are identical within states. In 1991, Justice Stevens noted the challenges in achieving precise population equality within states. The court faced challenges in apportionment, with Massachusetts losing a seat due to federal employees overseas being included in state populations for reapportionment. The court ruled that Massachusetts could not challenge the President's decision to include overseas federal employees in apportionment counts. In 2001, Utah argued it lost a congressional seat due to Census Bureau's inclusion of overseas federal employees in the population used for reapportionment. Utah claimed Mormon missionaries abroad should have been included in the count, similar to federal employees stationed overseas. The Supreme Court settled the issue of Congress's discretion in apportioning House seats, granting broad discretion to the President. Challenges to the apportionment formula after the 2010 Census remain uncertain. This report outlines apportionment options for Congress to consider. The Great Compromise at the constitutional convention in 1787 resolved the allocation of representation in Congress between smaller and larger states by creating a bicameral Congress. The Constitution provided for apportionment of Representatives based on population, with the number not exceeding one for every thirty thousand people. The Constitution mandated that Representatives be apportioned based on population, with each state having at least one Representative. Congress faced challenges in distributing fractional entitlements to Representatives until the Hill method was enacted in 1941. Debates centered around the size of congressional districts and how to handle fractional entitlements. The permanent House size has received little attention since 1910. The Montana legal challenge raised the issue of \"one person, one vote,\" established by Supreme Court decisions in the 1960s. This concept has only been applied within states, requiring justification for any deviations from numerical equality in congressional districts. The 1983 Supreme Court decision in Karcher v. Daggett (462 U.S. 725) highlighted the wide variation in district sizes due to population distribution among states in the 2010 Census. This interstate population disparity contrasts with the intrastate variation seen in redistricting, with most states having a small difference in population between their largest and smallest congressional districts. The goal of an apportionment method is to achieve as near perfection as possible in distributing Representatives among states according to their respective populations. Daniel Webster emphasized the need for Congress to strive for this near perfection in apportionment. While there are numerous methods for apportioning the House, the key is to aim for the closest possible approximation to perfection. Since 1941, seats in the House of Representatives have been apportioned using the method of equal proportions (Hill). Alternative methods for apportioning seats have been used or considered, including the Hamilton-Vinton method and others like Adams, Dean, Webster, and Jefferson. The controversy arises from different approaches to rounding fractional remainders for apportionment. The House of Representatives has been apportioned using the method of equal proportions since 1941. Alternative methods for apportioning seats have been considered, including the Hamilton-Vinton method. One proposal suggests dividing each state's population by the national \"ideal size\" district to determine seat allocation, but this could result in varying House sizes. To address this issue, a solution is proposed to allot each state the whole number of seats in its quota initially, with fractional remainders ranked in order. The Hamilton-Vinton method for apportioning House seats involves ranking fractional remainders of quotas from largest to smallest and assigning seats in rank order until 435 are allocated. This method was proposed by Alexander Hamilton but vetoed by President Washington. It was used by Congress from 1851 to 1901, known as the Vinton method after Representative Samuel Vinton. The Hamilton-Vinton method for apportioning House seats involves dividing the apportionment population by the House size to determine the ideal district size. Each state's population is then divided by this ideal size to obtain quotas, with seats awarded based on whole numbers first and fractional remainders ranked for additional seats. The method, proposed by Alexander Hamilton and used from 1851 to 1901, faced challenges like the \"Alabama paradox.\" The \"Alabama paradox\" arose after the 1880 census when Alabama lost its eighth seat in the House due to fractional remainders. Alabama's quota increased from 7.646 to 7.671 when the House size grew to 300, causing Illinois and Texas to receive additional seats instead. The \"Alabama paradox\" arose when Alabama lost a seat due to fractional remainders in the House apportionment. The Hamilton-Vinton method, which led to this anomaly, also faces the population paradox and new states paradox. These issues highlight the need for a formula that avoids such anomalies in apportionments. The Hamilton-Vinton method of apportionment, adopted in 1911 by Congress, aims to avoid paradoxes in seat allocation. It involves rounding fractional remainders of state quotas to determine House representation. This method ensures a total of 435 Representatives by rounding up fractional remainders below 0.5. The calculations required by this method are similar to other alternative methods, but instead of ranking remainders, they are rounded. The national \"ideal\" district size is calculated by dividing the total population by 435, the size of the House. Each state's quota of Representatives is then determined using this ideal district size. Different methods round the allotments either up or down to the nearest whole number based on certain rules, with the Hamilton-Vinton method rounding up fractional remainders below 0.5 to ensure a total of 435 Representatives. The common divisor, known as the \"ideal congressional district size,\" is adjusted to allocate the desired number of seats in the House. If too many seats are apportioned, a larger divisor is used, and if too few, a smaller divisor is used. The final divisor is the one that apportions the correct number of seats. Different rounding methods are used to adjust the allotments, with the Hamilton-Vinton method rounding up fractional remainders below 0.5 to ensure a total of 435 Representatives. The rounding methods for apportioning seats in the House include Webster, Hill, Dean, Adams, and Jefferson. These methods differ in how the rounding point is set, with Dean and Hill methods adjusting the rounding point based on the state's population size. Smaller states may have their apportionments rounded up to yield an extra seat with these methods. The Dean and Hill methods favor smaller states by rounding up their apportionments to yield an extra seat for smaller fractional remainders compared to larger states. This is illustrated in Figure 1, showing the differences in rounding points among the methods. For example, Dean awards a second seat for any fractional remainder above 1.33, while Hill gives a second seat for every remainder above one. The Dean and Hill methods allocate seats based on different rounding criteria. Dean awards a second seat for any remainder above 1.33, while Hill gives a second seat for every remainder above one. The Webster method rounds fractions to the nearest whole number at the arithmetic mean, such as 1.5 between 1 and 2. The Hill method of apportionment rounds at the geometric mean, unlike the Webster method which rounds at the arithmetic mean. This results in different rounding points, such as 1.41 instead of 1.5 between 1 and 2. The Dean Method for apportionment in a 435-seat House rounds at the harmonic mean, with different rounding points compared to the Hill method. The Adams method for apportionment in a 435-seat House rounds up to the next seat for any fractional remainder, ensuring the total number of seats sum to 435. It involves finding a number that, when divided into each state's population and rounded up, results in the desired total number of seats. The Jefferson method for apportionment in a 435-seat House involves finding a number that, when divided into each state's population and rounded down, results in the total number of seats summing to 435. The method was used from 1790 to 1830 and ensures that states receive the correct number of seats based on their population. In 2011, alternative formulas were considered, and the results of applying these formulas to the 2010 state apportionment population figures are displayed in Table 2 and Table 3. The Dean method would have resulted in Montana regaining its second seat lost in 1991, and California losing a seat in 2011. The Webster method would have cost Rhode Island a seat and given an additional seat to North Carolina. The Hamilton-Vinton method would have the same seat distribution as the current Hill method. The Adams method in 2011 would have reassigned 18 seats among 15 states, while the Jefferson method would have reassigned 16 seats among 15 states. Table 2 and Table 3 show seat allocations based on the 2010 apportionment population for different methods. Table 3 ranks states by population size, highlighting differences in allocations compared to the current method. The Adams method would shift seats from more populous states to less populous ones, while the Jefferson method would do the opposite. The apportionment methods have properties that recommend them, with each formula satisfying certain fairness measures. The Montana case questioned which formula best upheld the \"one person, one vote\" principle, while the Massachusetts case raised concerns about the Hill method favoring less populous states. It is unclear which method is the most equitable in meeting the \"one person, one vote\" standard due to the constraints of a fixed House size. The practical question is how to minimize inequality in district equalization, with no definitive answer on the best method. The National Academy of Sciences outlined criteria for evaluating apportionment formulas' fairness, predating the \"one person, one vote\" principle. Congress could use these criteria to assess the equity of the Hill method chosen in 1941. The NAS criteria evaluate apportionment formulas' fairness based on equity, aiming to approximate the \"one person, one vote\" concept. Different methods like the Dean, Webster, and Hill methods minimize inequalities in district sizes or individual shares of Representatives. The NAS criteria evaluate apportionment formulas' fairness based on equity, aiming to approximate the \"one person, one vote\" concept. The Hill method minimizes the absolute representational surplus among states, while the Adams method minimizes the absolute representational deficiency. The Jefferson method is based on a different criterion. The NAS report does not clearly endorse one method as fairest or most equitable, leaving room for other factors to be considered. The NAS report evaluates apportionment methods based on fairness criteria such as states' representational \"quotas\" and the constitutional \"great compromise\" between large and small states. Pair-wise tests were used to assess different methods, with the Dean method minimizing absolute differences in state average district populations. The federal government proposed using the variance as a means of testing apportionment formulas for fairness. Variance measures the degree of variation from the average, with lower variance indicating a more equitable apportionment method. Comparing the variances of Dean and Hill apportionments can determine the fairness of each method. In 2010, the Hill apportionment method showed smaller variance compared to Dean's method when using district size difference as the criterion. The Hill and Hamilton-Vinton methods had the smallest variances among all methods discussed. Different apportionment methods are deemed most equitable depending on the fairness criterion used for variance calculation. For instance, the Webster method was most effective in minimizing inequality when individual share of a Representative was the comparison criterion. The Webster method is effective in minimizing inequality as measured by variance. The federal government challenges the basis for the Montana and Massachusetts claims that the Hill method is unconstitutional, arguing that percent difference calculations are fairer than absolute differences. Tests other than pairwise comparisons and variance can also be applied, such as using the sum of the absolute values of differences between national averages and state figures. The Hill and Hamilton-Vinton method produce the smallest national totals for deviations from the \"ideal\" in district sizes and shares of a Representative. The Hill and Hamilton-Vinton method minimize national deviations in district sizes, while the Webster method minimizes deviations in shares of a Representative. Different methods excel in different criteria, showing no single method is universally equitable. The concept of fairness in apportionment formulas remains open for debate. According to the proposed method, fractional remainders would be treated as fractions rather than rounded, with each state assigned its exact quota of seats based on its apportionment population. Congress could adjust each Representative's vote to reflect their constituents' representation in the House. This approach aims to represent states' quotas accurately, although it may lead to unequal influence among individual Representatives. The concept of quota in apportionment methods is crucial for judging fairness. However, the constitutional requirement of each state getting at least one seat complicates this concept. The idea of \"fair share\" adjusts for this by eliminating entitlements to less than one seat. For example, in a hypothetical country with four states and a House of 10 seats, quotas are calculated based on population sizes. In apportionment methods, the concept of fair share adjusts for the constitutional requirement of each state getting at least one seat. Quotas are calculated based on population sizes, with the goal of not deviating by more than one seat from a state's fair share. No rounding method meets this test under all circumstances. The Hamilton-Vinton method consistently stays within one seat of a state's fair share, while the Adams and Jefferson methods often result in states getting more than one seat above or below their fair shares. The Dean method violates this concept about one percent of the time, while the Webster and Hill methods violate it much less. The Constitution established a bicameral Congress with equal representation for states in the Senate and apportionment by population in the House. Each state is entitled to one Representative in the House regardless of population. The various methods of apportionment are being evaluated in terms of balancing the interests of smaller and larger states. The Jefferson method is suggested for favoring large states, while the influence of small states may be overshadowed by larger ones due to factors like the electoral college dynamics. The Adams, Dean, and Hill methods vary in their favoritism towards small states. The Webster and Hamilton-Vinton methods are considered neutral in their application to states. Various mathematical tests, such as pair-wise measures and variance, have been proposed for apportionment formulas. The federal government used the variance test in a 1992 litigation. The plaintiffs in Massachusetts argued that different variance measures can be used for apportionment criteria, leading to different methods. The best mathematical test to approximate the constitutional requirement for Representatives' apportionment among states is a matter of judgment, not a definitive mathematical test. Congress would face difficult choices if they address this issue before the 2020 Census."
