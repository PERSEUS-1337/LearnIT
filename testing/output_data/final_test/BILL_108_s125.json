    "content": "The Act titled \"Emergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2003\" provides crop disaster assistance. The Emergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide emergency financial assistance to producers who have suffered qualifying crop losses due to damaging weather conditions in 2001 or 2002. Assistance will be administered in a similar manner as provided under a previous Act, with the same loss thresholds for quantity and quality losses. Payments can be received for crop losses in either the 2001 or 2002 crop year, but not both. The Secretary will use funds to provide payments for livestock losses in counties with emergency designations in 2001 or 2002. Producers can choose to receive payments for losses in either year, but not both. Ineligibility for payments is outlined in Section 4. In this section, definitions for additional coverage, insurable commodity, and noninsurable commodity are provided. Producers on a farm are ineligible for payments under section 2 for losses to insurable or noninsurable commodities, except as specified in subsection (c). Producers on a farm may be ineligible for payments for losses to insurable or noninsurable commodities if they did not obtain additional coverage or file required paperwork and pay fees by the State deadline. The Secretary can waive this requirement if producers enter into a contract. The farm enters into a contract with the Secretary for producers to obtain additional coverage for insurable commodities for the next 3 years. Producers agree to forfeit payments for violations. For noninsurable commodities, producers agree to file paperwork and pay fees. Producers agree to pay administrative fees and forfeit payments for violations under the contract with the Secretary for insurable commodities. For noninsurable commodities, producers must file paperwork and pay fees by the State filing deadline. The Secretary will utilize the resources of the Commodity Credit Corporation for implementing this title. Regulations will also be established. The Secretary may issue necessary regulations to implement the Act without following certain procedural requirements. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted under specific authority. Additionally, emergency designation is addressed in the Act. SEC. 7 of the Act addresses emergency designation, requiring the President to submit a budget request designating the entire amount as an emergency requirement under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Congress designates the amount as an emergency requirement under specific sections of the Act."
