    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal financial assistance for postsecondary education and institutions. Last reauthorized in 2008, funding has been extended through various legislation. The Education and the Workforce committee marked up the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (PROSPER Act; H.R. 4508) for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). The proposed amendments would extend HEA programs through FY2024, with specific funding amounts allocated annually. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a reduction in mandatory spending by $2.2 billion over FY2018-FY2022 and $14.6 billion over FY2018-FY2027, while discretionary spending would increase by $87.5 billion over FY2018-FY2022 and $210.1 billion over the FY2018-FY2027 period. The report focuses on changes H.R. 4508 would make to the HEA's programs, highlighting major proposed changes and features. It includes tables with information on authorization of appropriations for new and existing programs. The focus is on larger changes proposed in H.R. 4508, rather than providing a comprehensive summary of the bill. H.R. 4508, reported with amendments on February 8, 2018, aims to reauthorize the HEA by simplifying student aid, modifying aid rules, eliminating programs, revising quality and financial requirements for IHEs, enhancing public accountability, transparency, and consumer information, and establishing limitations on the Secretary of Education's authority. Title IV of the HEA contains provisions for various federal student aid programs to assist students and families in financing postsecondary education. These programs include grants, loans, work-study assistance, and service payback programs. There are five primary ways in which these programs can be characterized, such as the type of aid (grant, loan, work-study, or service payback) and whether it is broadly available or targeted. The federal student aid programs under Title IV of the HEA include grants, loans, work-study assistance, and service payback programs. Aid can be broadly available or targeted, with grants being gift aid, loans requiring repayment, work-study providing part-time employment compensation, and service payback aid contingent on completing a service obligation. Student aid can be broadly available or targeted based on specific fields of study or service. It can be need-based or non-need-based, and portable or non-portable across participating institutions. In AY 2017-2018, federal student aid is available through a subset of programs authorized under Title IV, including three grant programs and two loan programs. Pell Grant and FSEOG are need-based aid programs, while Pell Grant and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants are portable aid for undergraduate students. The Pell Grant and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants are portable aid for undergraduate students. Two loan programs available: the William D. Ford Direct Loan program for undergraduate and graduate/professional study, and the Federal Perkins Loan program for undergraduate students only. Direct Loans offer need-based and non-need-based loans, while Federal Perkins Loans are need-based. One work-study program available: the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program for undergraduate and graduate/professional students. One service payback program: the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program is non-need-based and portable aid. The TEACH Grant program is non-need-based, portable aid available to undergraduate and graduate students, making up a small share of federal student aid. H.R. 4508 aims to redesign federal student aid programs by consolidating them into a smaller number of programs. The proposal in H.R. 4508 aims to eliminate certain federal student aid programs like TEACH Grants and FSEOG, wind down the Perkins Loan program, and introduce a new Federal ONE Loan program. The new federal student aid programs would include Pell Grants, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, Federal ONE Loans, and Federal Work-Study assistance. The proposed H.R. 4508 aims to replace certain federal student aid programs with new ones like Pell Grants, Federal ONE Loans, and Federal Work-Study assistance. Changes would be made to the procedures for determining students' eligibility for aid and the amount they can receive. The proposed H.R. 4508 aims to replace federal student aid programs with new ones like Pell Grants, Federal ONE Loans, and Federal Work-Study assistance. Changes include limiting need-based aid to undergraduates, introducing a Pell Grant bonus for students taking at least 30 credit hours per year, and revising the allocation formula for Work-Study funding. In the proposed Federal ONE Loan program, loans would be made without origination fees, but interest subsidies would not be provided while borrowers are in school, during grace periods, or deferment. Borrowing limits would be increased for undergraduate students, while graduate students and parents of undergraduates would have specified loan limits. Repayment plans would be limited, and loan discharge would only be available in specific circumstances. The Higher Education Act (HEA) includes provisions for Direct Loans, requiring borrowers to sign a master promissory note (MPN) with loan terms. Borrowers can borrow multiple loans under one MPN for up to 10 years without reviewing terms again. Entrance and exit counseling are required to ensure borrowers understand loan conditions. The Higher Education Act (HEA) mandates borrowers to understand loan terms and consequences. H.R. 4508 proposes changes to aid disbursement timing to help recipients manage their aid better. Under H.R. 4508, borrowers must acknowledge loan terms before receiving new loans. Title IV loan borrowers and Pell Grant recipients need annual counseling to understand aid terms. The bill also requires more frequent and smaller disbursements of Title IV funds, slowing down the rate at which borrowers earn federal aid. These changes aim to make federal student aid more manageable for recipients. H.R. 4508 aims to eliminate various programs authorized under the Higher Education Act (HEA) and other statutes related to higher education, including the FSEOG program which provided $712 million in awards in FY2017. This bill would also eliminate programs that support institutions and their programs, such as those preparing students for teaching careers. The Strengthening Institutions program, which provided $85 million in FY2017 to support needy students, would be eliminated under H.R. 4508. Title VIII of the HEA, with 27 parts focusing on various topics, has never been funded. H.R. 4508 would wind down some currently operational programs, authorizing them to operate for a limited time before curtailing their operations. The elimination or wind-down of programs under H.R. 4508, such as the TEACH Grant program and the Direct Loan program, aims to streamline the number of programs in the HEA. This could lead to a more focused federal effort in supporting postsecondary education, potentially reducing federal expenditures. However, it may also limit available approaches for addressing targeted priorities. The HEA currently includes institutional accountability measures related to educational and fiscal accountability. H.R. 4508 aims to address educational and fiscal accountability in postsecondary institutions by adding new requirements and amending existing ones. This includes treating proprietary and public/nonprofit institutions equally. The bill focuses on ensuring quality educational programs and making adjustments to participation standards for institutions. H.R. 4508 aims to adjust standards for accrediting agencies overseeing Title IV student aid programs. The bill would eliminate some institutional evaluation standards and focus on evaluating educational outcomes in relation to expected measures. H.R. 4508 aims to adjust standards for accrediting agencies overseeing Title IV student aid programs by repealing current regulatory definitions and outcome measures. It would replace existing metrics with a new programmatic loan repayment rate metric for educational programs at various types of institutions. The new programmatic loan repayment rate metric would measure students' ability to repay Title IV loans, linking educational program quality to loan repayment success. This metric differs from cohort default rates and gainful employment metrics, focusing on program quality rather than overall institutional performance. H.R. 4508 proposes changes to educational and fiscal accountability requirements for institutions participating in Title IV programs, including adding educational performance requirements for all programs and institutions. This signals a shift towards a more comprehensive postsecondary education accountability framework. H.R. 4508 proposes changes to fiscal accountability provisions related to returning Title IV funds when a student withdraws from school. It includes amendments to the Return of Title IV provisions, specifying how and when funds should be returned to the Department of Education. The bill would reduce the rate at which unearned funds must be returned on a pro rata schedule before the 60% point of a payment or enrollment period. H.R. 4508 proposes amendments to federal student aid regulations, including reducing the rate at which aid is considered earned by students and requiring higher returns of aid by institutions when students withdraw. It aims to incentivize institutions to ensure student completion, enhance financial accountability, expand conditions for financial responsibility, and repeal the 90/10 Rule for proprietary institutions. The Higher Education Act (HEA) addresses college affordability and consumer information by requiring the Secretary to administer the College Navigator website and IHEs to provide Net Price Calculators. H.R. 4508 proposes amendments to the HEA for a more tailored approach to public accountability. H.R. 4508 proposes amendments to the Higher Education Act (HEA) to enhance public accountability and transparency. It would rename the College Navigator to the College Dashboard, requiring the collection of new student outcome data like median earnings. However, it would remove certain information currently available on the College Navigator, such as applicant numbers and admission percentages. Additionally, Title II transparency provisions for teacher preparation programs at IHEs would be eliminated. The Title II transparency provisions under the Higher Education Act require data collection and reporting for teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education. The Secretary has the authority to manage ED functions, prescribe rules, and enter into contracts for services, including for Direct Loans. H.R. 4508 would amend the Higher Education Act to limit the Secretary's authority in promulgating regulations for Title IV student aid programs. Provisions in the bill would restrict rules on topics like \"gainful employment\" and state authorization requirements. Additionally, the bill would increase oversight of the Office of Federal Student Aid, including requiring input from stakeholders and establishing an advisory board for oversight. H.R. 4508 would establish an advisory board to oversee the Federal Student Aid (FSA) and require specific actions from the Secretary regarding borrower accounts under loan-servicing contracts. The bill aims to make adjustments to various federal student aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, including loans, grants, and work-study assistance. H.R. 4508 proposes changes to student aid programs, including the Federal Pell Grant program, which provides need-based grants to undergraduate students. The bill would authorize a Pell Grant Bonus award and extend discretionary appropriations for Pell Grants. H.R. 4508 proposes a Pell Grant Bonus award of up to $300 for recipients who enroll more than full-time and complete at least 30 semester hours in an award year. The Pell Grant Bonus proposed in H.R. 4508 would award up to $300 to recipients who complete at least 30 semester hours in an award year. The bonus would be funded by indefinite permanent mandatory appropriations and go into effect in 2018-2019. The Secretary would report annually on the number of students receiving the bonus and their time to certificate or degree. The GAO would conduct a study on Pell Grant bonus recipients' student loan debt, completion rates, and course load compared to non-bonus recipients. Under current law, Pell Grant recipients are informed of their eligibility for aid, subject to a lifetime cap of 12 full-time semesters. H.R. 4508 proposes annual status reports on remaining Pell Grant eligibility and amounts. Financial aid administrators can offer additional counseling without delaying aid disbursements. Students with unusual enrollment history may lose eligibility until legitimate reasons are documented. H.R. 4508 proposes provisions to address unusual enrollment history for Pell Grant recipients, requiring documentation of legitimate reasons for lack of academic credit. Additionally, it allows ED to withhold Pell Grant disbursement until enrollment history is deemed not unusual. Under H.R. 4508, ED would compare actual Pell Grant expenditures to prior CBO estimates. The bill also addresses the expiration of loan programs like FFEL and Federal Perkins Loan, authorizing new loans only through the Direct Loan program. Under H.R. 4508, the Federal Perkins Loan program expired in 2017, and a new Federal ONE Loan program would replace the Direct Loan program. The bill discusses phasing out Direct Loans and establishing the new program, while provisions for the Perkins Loan program are addressed separately. The Direct Loan program, the largest federal program for student financial assistance, operates under Title IV of the HEA. In the Direct Loan program, permanent indefinite mandatory appropriations cover loan subsidy costs, while annual discretionary appropriations cover administrative costs. Loans are provided to students and families by ED from the U.S. Treasury. Different types of loans are available, including Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans. Loan terms are specified in statute. In FY2017, $93.0 billion in Direct Loans were disbursed. H.R. 4508 would terminate new loans through the Direct Loan program after September 30, 2024. Existing borrowers prior to July 1, 2019, can continue borrowing until September 30, 2024. Borrowing through the Federal ONE Loan program would make individuals ineligible for Direct Loans after 2024. H.R. 4508 would establish the Federal ONE Loan program as the sole option for federal student loans after September 30, 2024. Changes to borrower defense and loan discharge procedures would be made, but existing Direct Loan benefits like deferments and loan forgiveness programs would remain available. The Federal ONE Loan program would provide mandatory appropriations for loan subsidy costs and discretionary appropriations for administrative costs. It would offer different types of loans to undergraduate students, graduate and professional students, and parents of dependent undergraduate students. Borrowers could also consolidate existing federal student loans into a single new loan. The program would replace all other federal student loan options under Title IV of the HEA starting July 1, 2019. The Federal ONE Loan program would offer loans with market-indexed, fixed interest rates based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate plus a percentage, with caps for undergraduate, graduate, and parent loans. The Federal ONE Loan program offers market-indexed, fixed interest rates based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate plus a percentage, with caps for different types of loans. Interest would begin accruing once a loan is made, and no loan origination fees would be charged. Borrowers are responsible for paying the accrued interest, with limited subsidies available. Federal ONE Loans offer interest rate subsidies similar to Direct Loans, including a 0.25% rate reduction for automatic payments and no interest accrual for up to 60 months for active duty borrowers. Loan eligibility is not based on financial need, but an endorser may be required in certain cases. The Federal ONE Loan program offers borrowing limits that allow students to borrow up to the cost of attendance minus financial assistance, with annual and aggregate limits varying by borrower type. Undergraduate students may borrow up to $2,000 more per year compared to the Direct Loan program, while graduate students and parents may borrow less. Dependent students would have lower borrowing limits under the Federal ONE Loan program compared to the Direct Loan program. Undergraduate dependent students can borrow up to $39,000 in total, while independent students can borrow up to $60,250. Graduate students have a limit of $150,000, with higher limits for health professions programs. Parent borrowers are limited to $56,250 per student per year. Financial aid administrators can limit borrowing to $12,500 per year and $56,250 in total per student. They can also adjust borrowing amounts based on factors like program of study, enrollment status, credential level, or special circumstances. Repayment plans are available for borrowers. H.R. 4508 aims to reduce the number of repayment plans available to borrowers, limiting Federal ONE Loan borrowers to choose between a fixed-term standard repayment plan and an income-based repayment (IBR) plan. PLUS Loans made to parent borrowers are excluded from income-driven repayment plans. The IBR plan under H.R. 4508 would be available for loans other than Federal ONE Parent Loans and Excepted Federal ONE Consolidation Loans. Borrowers would make monthly payments based on their adjusted gross income, with a minimum monthly payment of $25. Married borrowers would consider the AGI of both spouses. Unemployed or financially distressed borrowers could have reduced payments for up to three years. The IBR plan under H.R. 4508 would consider the AGI of both spouses for married borrowers. Monthly payment amounts would be based on both borrowers' combined loan balance. Maximum cumulative payments would be limited for Federal ONE Loans repaid under the IBR plan or a 10-year standard repayment plan. Any remaining loan balance would be forgiven. Deferment is a temporary pause in loan payments for borrowers of Federal ONE Loans, based on specific criteria like being enrolled in school or facing economic hardship. Borrowers of Federal ONE Consolidation Loans may be ineligible for IBR plan benefits if they choose a repayment term over 10 years. Loan deferment allows borrowers to temporarily pause loan payments due to specific criteria such as high medical expenses or unemployment. Interest accrued during deferment is added to the loan balance. Loan forgiveness options include forgiveness for teachers and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for borrowers making 120 qualifying monthly payments. H.R. 4508 would retain loan forgiveness benefits for borrowers of Direct Loans, excluding Federal ONE Loans. Liability for federal student loans can be discharged in cases of death, disability, or inability to work due to impairment. H.R. 4508 would make changes to loan discharge provisions for Title IV student loans, including borrower defense to repayment regulations specified by the Department of Education. H.R. 4508 would establish new standards and procedures for borrower defense to repayment (BDR) that would apply to Direct Loans and Federal ONE Loans. FFEL and Perkins Loan borrowers seeking relief under the BDR procedures would first be required to consolidate their loans into a Federal ONE Consolidation Loan. H.R. 4508 introduces new borrower defense to repayment (BDR) standards for Direct Loans and Federal ONE Loans. Borrowers can qualify for BDR if they have a favorable judgment against the institution, if the institution fails to fulfill its contract obligations, or if there was a substantial misrepresentation. The bill allows ED to approve BDR applications, consolidate similar claims for faster processing, and recover funds from institutions. H.R. 4508 introduces new borrower defense to repayment (BDR) standards for Direct Loans and Federal ONE Loans, allowing borrowers to qualify for BDR in cases of institutional misconduct. The bill also includes provisions to recover funds from institutions that have successful BDR claims against them. Additionally, H.R. 4508 would repeal BDR regulations from 2016, which were delayed in implementation until July 1, 2019. H.R. 4508 codifies regulations for borrower qualifications and discharge options for various loan programs. It also addresses disbursement requirements for federal student loans and Pell Grants, allowing flexibility for institutions to meet students' needs. H.R. 4508 requires institutions to disburse Pell Grant and Federal ONE Loan payments to students in equal installments within 30 days of the payment period. Institutions with a loan repayment rate below 60% cannot disburse loans to new undergraduate students until 30 days after the start of their studies. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program provides part-time employment to postsecondary students in need of earnings to pursue their studies and promote community service. H.R. 4508 proposes changes to FWS, including amending fund allocation procedures, setting aside funds for \"improved institutions,\" and adjusting student employment requirements and compensation. The bill authorizes approximately $1.723 billion annually for the FWS program from FY2019 to FY2024. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program for FY2019 through FY2024 has indefinite discretionary appropriations authorized. In FY2017, the federal share of FWS compensation was around $984.8 million. HEA Section 442 outlines the allocation process for FWS funds to participating institutions. Funds are first allocated based on a base guarantee, with any remaining funds distributed according to an institution's \"fair share\" determined by student need. Institutions with a fair share greater than their base guarantee can receive additional funding to reduce the shortfall. H.R. 4508 aims to eliminate the base guarantee in the Federal Work-Study program and allocate all funds to institutions based on new fair share procedures. Half of the fair share allocation would be determined by undergraduate need, while the other half would be based on the proportion of Pell Grant funds awarded. An institution could receive a \"new base guarantee\" from FY2019 to FY2023, equal to a decreasing percentage of the combined base guarantee and fair share increase. H.R. 4508 aims to eliminate the base guarantee in the Federal Work-Study program and allocate all funds to institutions based on new fair share procedures. An institution could receive a \"new base guarantee\" from FY2019 to FY2023, equal to a decreasing percentage of the combined base guarantee and fair share increase. Beginning in FY2024, all available funds would be allocated using new fair share allocation procedures. The bill would also change the Secretary's authority to reserve FWS funds for allocation to \"improved institutions.\" The Secretary can reserve funds for allocation to \"improved institutions\" based on completion rates of Pell Grant recipients or improvement in graduation rates. These institutions would receive a proportional allocation based on Pell Grants awarded, ranging from $10,000 to $1,500,000. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program allocates $1,500,000 for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students with financial need. Students can work for their institution, government entities, non-profit organizations, or for-profit organizations. Institutions must allocate 7% for community service jobs and ensure one student works in a reading tutoring or family literacy project. A maximum of 25% can be used for for-profit organizations. Students are compensated with federal funding and a matching amount from the institution or employer, with a maximum federal share of 75% for most FWS jobs. Under H.R. 4508, the Federal Work-Study program would no longer be available to graduate and professional students, only undergraduates with financial need. The bill eliminates the 7% requirement for community service jobs and the 25% restriction for for-profit sector employment. It also reduces the maximum federal share of compensation to 50% over five years. H.R. 4508 would reduce the federal share of compensation for Federal Work-Study (FWS) employment to 50% over five years, with exceptions for certain cases. It also addresses various student aid programs authorized under HEA, Title IV, including the Federal Perkins Loan program. Some programs would be repealed or not extended under the bill. The Federal Perkins Loan program provided low-interest loans to students with financial need for postsecondary education. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) managed the program, including servicing and collecting loans. IHEs were required to cancel loans for borrowers who completed public service. Congress last appropriated funds for loan cancellations in FY2009. In FY2017, 356,000 Perkins Loan awards totaling $885 million were disbursed to students. H.R. 4508 would remove the current language pertaining to the Perkins Loans program from the Higher Education Act and incorporate it into the PROSPER Act. This means that the provisions of the Perkins Loan program would still be in effect, even though they would no longer appear in the HEA. The bill also includes provisions on how Institutions of Higher Education should wind down the operation of the Perkins Loan program. The bill H.R. 4508 includes provisions for winding down the Perkins Loan program at Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), allowing them to continue servicing loans or assign them to the Department of Education for collection. It also addresses the collection of interest on short-term loans made to the Perkins Loan revolving fund. Additionally, IHEs are required to complete a final program audit upon termination of participation in a Title IV HEA program, with some flexibilities provided in submitting audits. The bill does not cover institutional reimbursement for cancelled Perkins Loans. The FSEOG program provides need-based grants to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need for postsecondary education. H.R. 4508 would repeal the program, with funds available until FY2019. The TEACH Grant program offers $4,000 grants to students preparing for teaching careers. Recipients of TEACH Grants must commit to teaching in high-need subjects at high-poverty schools for four years. Failure to fulfill this requirement results in the grant converting to a loan. Approximately 74% of grants are expected to convert to loans. In FY2017, $85.3 million was disbursed for 38,200 grants. H.R. 4508 would end new TEACH Grants after June 30, 2018, but allow existing recipients to complete their studies. The Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program (LEAP), Grants for Access and Persistence Program (GAP), Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program, Academic Competitiveness Grant program, and National SMART Grant program provided federal funds for postsecondary education. H.R. 4508 aims to repeal these programs. HEA, Title IV sets student aid program provisions like eligibility criteria and need analysis formula. H.R. 4508 aims to repeal federal student aid programs like LEAP, GAP, Byrd Honors Scholarship, ACG, and SMART Grant. It would make changes to Title IV student aid eligibility criteria and the EFC calculation process based on FAFSA responses. The EFC formula considers income from the prior prior year for student aid applications. H.R. 4508 would require EFC calculation using prior prior year income information. The HEA establishes a Simplified Needs Test for certain students based on income criteria. Applicants with a gross income of less than $50,000 and meeting specific criteria must report assets on the FAFSA, including balances of bank accounts and investments. 529 accounts are considered assets of the student's parent for dependent students, which can affect the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Distributions from a 529 account used for educational expenses are not counted as income in the EFC calculation. H.R. 4508 proposes to increase the SNT AGI threshold to $100,000 and exclude certain 529 accounts from being considered as assets in calculating the EFC. This change aims to protect a family's savings for higher education from being factored into the expected contribution towards education costs. H.R. 4508 aims to make the FAFSA process easier by providing a mobile-optimized version of the form and allowing the use of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. This bill would also increase the SNT AGI threshold to $100,000 and exclude certain 529 accounts from being considered as assets in calculating the EFC. H.R. 4508 aims to simplify the FAFSA process by providing online tools for estimating aid eligibility and increasing awareness of student aid opportunities. It also directs ED to develop an online tool using basic financial information to estimate eligibility for federal grants, loans, and work-study assistance, accompanied by net price information from specified institutions. The bill would require annual reports on FAFSA simplification progress and IRS-DRT security. H.R. 4508 directs ED to develop annual tables showing Pell Grant recipients' percentages based on income levels and dependency statuses. HEA Section 484 outlines academic criteria for Title IV aid eligibility, including maintaining satisfactory academic progress. H.R. 4508 would amend eligibility requirements for Title IV aid, allowing students without a high school diploma to qualify after completing six credit hours applicable to a degree. The bill also codifies regulations on satisfactory academic progress, including maintaining a cumulative C average and completing the program within 150% of the published length. H.R. 4508 proposes changes to institutional and programmatic participation requirements for Title IV federal student aid programs. Postsecondary institutions must meet criteria including maintaining a cumulative C average and meeting the HEA Section 102 definition of an institution of higher education. The Section 102 definition of an institution of higher education includes public and private nonprofit institutions offering degree programs and those providing at least a one-year program for gainful employment. It encompasses all institutions eligible for Title IV federal student aid, including proprietary institutions, vocational institutions, and foreign institutions. These institutions must offer programs preparing students for employment in a recognized occupation, regardless of degree attainment. The Section 101 and Section 102 definitions of an institution of higher education overlap in requiring legal authorization to provide postsecondary education. H.R. 4508 proposes combining aspects of these definitions into a new Section 101 definition, encompassing public, private nonprofit, proprietary, and vocational institutions for all HEA programs. Proprietary institutions would not be considered an IHE for Title III and Title V institutional aid. Under H.R. 4508, the new Section 101 definition of an institution of higher education would encompass public, private nonprofit, proprietary, and vocational institutions for all HEA programs. Proprietary institutions would not be considered an IHE for Title III and Title V institutional aid. All references to programs preparing students for gainful employment would be removed, and regulations relating to state authorization would be repealed. The Secretary would be prohibited from enforcing any rules on state authorization. Foreign institutions would be defined under an amended Section 102, applying only to Title IV, Part D, and new Part E programs. Eligibility for Title IV federal student aid requires enrollment in an eligible program at an eligible IHE. Eligible programs at public and nonprofit institutions must lead to defined degrees or certificates, be at least two years in length for full credit towards a bachelor's degree, or less than one year in length for gainful employment preparation. Proprietary and vocational programs must meet durational requirements and prepare students for recognized occupations. Admission without an associate's degree requires at least 600 clock hours of instruction. H.R. 4508 would eliminate the requirement for nondegree programs to lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation and would establish debt-to-earnings ratios for educational programs offered by institutions of higher education. H.R. 4508 would establish new durational requirements for nondegree programs leading to a recognized educational credential and define criteria for competency-based education programs. It would also repeal gainful employment regulations and eliminate the requirement for certain postsecondary institutions to offer programs leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires institutions to offer programs leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation. H.R. 4508 would make changes to accreditation requirements for Title IV participation, allowing accreditation agencies to set their own standards as long as they meet HEA criteria. Accreditation agencies must evaluate institutions based on student achievement, faculty, curricula, facilities, and financial capacity. H.R. 4508 proposes to shift focus to student learning outcomes rather than institutional evaluation standards. H.R. 4508 proposes criteria for accreditation agencies to evaluate competency-based education and identify institutions struggling with student learning outcomes. It allows agencies to review high-performing institutions less frequently. H.R. 4508 proposes criteria for accreditation agencies to evaluate competency-based education and identify institutions struggling with student learning outcomes. It also aims to make summary information on agency actions publicly available without request and prohibits the Secretary from regulating agencies' mechanisms for identifying struggling institutions or policies related to educational changes. Credit hours are used to measure student work and achievement in Title IV eligible programs. H.R. 4508 would repeal the regulatory definition of credit hour and prohibit the Secretary from enforcing rules related to it. Institutions must meet cohort default rate requirements to maintain Title IV eligibility. Default rate is the percentage of loan recipients who default before repayment. H.R. 4508 would establish a new accountability metric called programmatic loan repayment rate (PLRR) to replace cohort default rate (CDR) provisions. The PLRR would track the number of students in positive repayment status on their federal student loans two years after entering repayment. The bill H.R. 4508 proposes a new accountability metric called programmatic loan repayment rate (PLRR) to replace cohort default rate (CDR) provisions. Educational programs with PLRRs below 45% for three consecutive fiscal years would lose Title IV eligibility. The metrics aim to ensure loan repayment quality and minimize defaults in federal student aid programs. Congress enacted provisions in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 to specify the return of Title IV funds when a student withdraws from school. HEA Section 484B outlines the process for returning unearned funds to the Department of Education based on a prescribed schedule. Funds are considered earned up to the 60% point of a payment period, after which no funds need to be returned. H.R. 4508 would change the rules for returning federal student aid when a student withdraws, requiring institutions to return a larger portion of aid. This may incentivize institutions to help students complete their enrollment. H.R. 4508 would require institutions to return Pell Grant funds first, followed by loans and other Title IV aid, based on a schedule of earned and unearned aid percentages. Institutions could also require students to repay up to 10% of unearned aid. H.R. 4508 would allow institutions to design policies for post-withdrawal aid disbursements and require them to return Pell Grants first, followed by loans and other Title IV aid. Institutions may also collect up to 10% of unearned aid from students. Financial responsibility standards for Title IV eligibility include certification by ED and meeting specific financial ratios. H.R. 4508 would retain and expand financial responsibility standards for institutions of higher education, allowing for additional oversight and cash monitoring restrictions. The bill also addresses issues of waste and abuse in Title IV aid programs and concerns about the quality of education provided by proprietary institutions. The 90/10 Rule was implemented to ensure proprietary institutions derive at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds. H.R. 4508 aims to repeal this rule and requires IHEs to provide information related to Direct Loans to borrowers. H.R. 4508 would make changes to requirements for Direct Loan borrowers, including entrance counseling for first-time borrowers and exit counseling for graduating students. Pell Grant recipients who also borrow Direct Loans must undergo entrance counseling. Loan terms, conditions, and borrower rights are covered in entrance counseling. H.R. 4508 would replace entrance counseling with annual financial aid counseling for Title IV loan borrowers and Pell Grant recipients. Exit counseling for graduating students would cover repayment plans, debt management, and borrower rights and responsibilities.
