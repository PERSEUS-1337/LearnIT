    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lead Exposure Reduction Amendments Act of 2012\" and includes definitions for key terms. Section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2681) is amended to redefine the term 'abatement' to include specific inclusions and exclusions such as renovation, remodeling, landscaping, or other activities not primarily for abatement purposes. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to redefine 'abatement' to include renovation activities that reduce lead-based paint hazards. Emergency renovation is defined as unplanned repair work due to sudden events posing a public health risk. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to include lead-based paint hazards in the definition of 'abatement'. Lead-based paint is defined as paint containing lead exceeding specified levels. Post-abatement clearance testing is defined as a test conducted after any lead-based paint activity to ensure complete reduction and absence of lead-contaminated dust hazards in the dwelling or worksite. The term 'test kit' is defined as a chemical test that can detect lead in paint at specified levels. SEC. 3. LEAD-BASED PAINT ACTIVITIES TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION. Section 402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to require a study on lead exposure during renovation and remodeling activities in buildings constructed before 1978. The Administrator must complete studies on lead exposure from renovation activities in buildings built before 1978 and publish results before proposing new regulations. The Administrator must complete studies on lead exposure from renovation activities in buildings built before 1978 and publish results before proposing new regulations. Amendments include determining the administrator, adding an exemption for emergency renovations, and prohibiting post-abatement clearance testing requirements. Target housing owners must comply with new regulations within 60 days of enactment. The Administrator may allow owners of target housing to authorize contractors to skip compliance with renovation regulations if no pregnant woman or child under 6 resides in the housing during the renovation. The owner can authorize a renovation contractor to skip compliance with regulations if no pregnant woman or child under 6 lives in the target housing during the project. Contractors can be exempt from certain work practices required by regulations if they receive written certification. They are also exempt from liability for any misrepresentation by the owner of the target housing. The Administrator allows the use of lead-based paint test kits that meet specific criteria for certification determinations. The Administrator establishes a process to approve lead-based paint test kits meeting specific criteria for certification determinations. The approved test kit must be inexpensive, commercially available, easy to use without special training, and enable users to detect lead at the job site. The Administrator can suspend regulations if unable to identify approved lead-based paint test kits for on-site use without laboratory analysis. The Administrator can suspend regulations until approved lead-based paint test kits are identified and approved, with a notice published in the Federal Register. The suspension will be lifted no earlier than 45 days after the publication of the approval notice. The clause applies to regulations allowing owners to authorize contractors to skip compliance, without affecting other regulations under this subsection. The Administrator's regulations provide an exemption from penalties for first-time submissions with minor errors and a process for resubmission. Accredited renovator recertification courses are exempt from certain requirements."
