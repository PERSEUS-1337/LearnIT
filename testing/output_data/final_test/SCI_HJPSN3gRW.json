    "content": "In this work, the focus is on training an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate to a target object in a 2D grid environment using visual information and language instructions. An attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion of visual and textual modalities is developed to improve navigation tasks and language grounding. Experimental results show that this mechanism outperforms existing fusion methods for navigation tasks. The study focuses on training an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate in a 2D grid environment using visual and language inputs. Attention weights are used to correlate object attributes with visual representations, showing semantically meaningful textual representations. The model generalizes effectively to unseen scenarios and exhibits zero-shot capabilities. The study trains an agent to understand natural language instructions and navigate in a 2D grid environment using visual and language inputs. The agent needs to extract semantically meaningful representations of language to accomplish tasks specified by instructions. This ability allows the agent to generalize to unseen combinations of words. The agent learns to navigate in a 2D grid environment by recognizing objects, remembering previous states, and grounding instructions in visual elements and actions. Our proposed end-to-end trainable architecture combines visual and textual modalities to navigate to a target object while avoiding obstacles. An attention mechanism for multimodal fusion outperforms existing methods, correlating object attributes in instructions with visual representations. Our model combines visual and textual modalities to navigate in a 2D environment, demonstrating semantic meaningfulness and zero-shot generalization capabilities. The environment is thread compatible and open-sourced for reproducibility and further research. The curr_chunk discusses various approaches in robotics domains focusing on grounding verbs in navigational instructions, mapping natural language instructions to action sequences in 2D and 3D environments, and using deep reinforcement learning agents for tasks in different environments. These approaches aim to learn optimal policies for navigation and playing first-person shooter games. Our work involves an agent receiving natural language instruction in addition to visual state of the environment. The agent learns to navigate in a 2D maze-like environment using natural language instructions, visual representations, syntax, and semantics of natural language. The task includes navigation and Visual Question Answering (VQA) where the agent receives navigation instructions or questions about the environment and provides navigation actions or answers. Another approach uses a concatenation of visual and textual representations. Anonymous2 (2018) propose a Gated-Attention architecture for task oriented language grounding in a new environment over VizDoom BID12. They use a multimodal fusion mechanism to ground natural language instructions in a 2D grid environment without prior information of visual and textual modalities. The model is end-to-end trainable and does not require external semantic parser or language models. In a new environment, a multimodal fusion mechanism is used to ground natural language instructions in a 2D grid environment. The agent learns to navigate to the target object specified in the instructions, with more complex scenarios including larger grid size, multiple objects, and thread compatibility. The agent in the 2-D grid environment must reach the correct object before the episode ends, facing obstacles and receiving negative rewards for hitting non-target objects. The environment is customizable with objects, obstacles, and the agent performing actions like up, down, left, and right. The environment in the 2-D grid is customizable with attributes like color and size. The agent perceives the environment through raw RGB pixels and receives natural language instructions at the beginning of each episode. Successful completion of the task results in a positive reward, while hitting a wall incurs a negative reward. The agent in the 2-D grid environment receives rewards for reaching the target object and penalties for hitting a wall or reaching non-target objects. The environment is reset randomly in each episode, and instructions are based on the initial configuration. In the 2-D grid environment, the agent receives rewards for reaching specific objects based on color, size, or location. Instructions test the agent's ability to distinguish between objects and navigate to the correct grid. In a 2-D grid environment, the agent receives rewards for reaching specific objects based on color, size, or location. Instructions test the agent's ability to distinguish between objects and navigate to the correct grid. The environment contains multiple instances of objects with different attributes, requiring the agent to correlate words like \"smaller\" or \"larger\" with the corresponding size of objects to navigate effectively. The agent in a 2-D grid environment receives rewards for reaching specific objects based on color, size, or location. Instructions test the agent's ability to distinguish between objects and navigate to the correct grid. The proposed model for solving the problem consists of three phases: input processing, multi-modal fusion, and policy learning. The agent receives a RGB image of the environment at each time step. The agent receives a RGB image of the environment at each time step, along with an instruction detailing the task. The image is processed through a convolutional neural network to obtain a representation. Pooling layers are not used to preserve the location details of objects. The final image representation has 64 channels and dimensions of W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D. The instruction is converted into one hot vectors and passed through a GRU. The maximum number of words in the instruction is 18 with a vocabulary size of 72 unique words. Sentences are zero padded to ensure uniform representation. The output of the GRU is passed through multiple FC layers and reshaped into vectors V1, V2, etc. An attention method is proposed for sentence representation. The attention method proposed involves generating vectors V1, V2, etc. from the instruction, which are used for multimodal fusion with feature volume RE. Each fusion results in an attention map, which are concatenated to form a tensor M attn. This mechanism draws inspiration from BID24 and aims to detect various attributes in the visual representation. The attention method involves generating vectors from the instruction for multimodal fusion with visual representations. This fusion mechanism creates an attention map (M attn) that correlates object attributes with visual features, symbolizing the consciousness of an AI agent. In a variant of the fusion mechanism, an attention map is concatenated with visual representation to create a tensor. The policy learned using this input performs poorly compared to another method. The method is compared with other fusion methods like Gated Attention unit and Concatenation unit. The architecture and hyperparameters used are replicated for comparison. The phase receives the output of the multimodal fusion phase and employs the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. In A3C, a global network and multiple local worker agents interact with their own environment copies simultaneously. Gradients from worker agents update the global network. The grid size is fixed at 10x10 with 63 objects and 8 obstacles. Each episode starts with 3 to 6 randomly selected objects and a feasible instruction. Feasible instructions consider agent reachability to objects. Episodes end when the agent reaches the target object. The evaluation metrics for the agent in the given episode include accuracy and mean reward. Accuracy is measured by the number of successful reaches to the target object, while mean reward is the average reward obtained across all episodes. Two modes of evaluation are considered: unseen scenario generalization and zero-shot generalization. In the unseen scenario generalization, the agent is tested in new environment scenarios with instructions from the training set. In zero-shot generalization, the agent is tested with unseen instructions and environment scenarios that were not encountered during training. The input to the neural network consists of a RGB image and an instruction. The image is processed with a CNN with multiple convolution layers. The instruction is encoded through a GRU and passed through a FC layer. The visual and textual modes are combined using various fusion mechanisms like simple concatenation, attention mechanism, and GatedAttention unit. The neural network combines visual and textual information using fusion mechanisms like concatenation, attention, and GatedAttention. Multiple attention maps are concatenated and passed through convolutional layers before reaching the LSTM layer. The LSTM layer allows the agent to remember previous states in an egocentric view. Network parameters are shared for predicting policy and value functions, with PReLU activations used in all layers. Negative gradients are not suppressed during experimentation. During experimentation, it was found that suppressing negative gradients led to poor performance in evaluation scenarios. The A3C algorithm was trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule and entropy regularization for improved exploration. Gradients were clipped to prevent large parameter updates, and the Generalized Advantage Estimator was used to reduce policy gradient update variance. The performance of the attention mechanism (A3C attn) is depicted in the results and discussions. The results and discussions show the performance of the attention mechanism (A3C attn) for various n values on unseen scenarios. The best mean reward of 0.95 was achieved with n = 5, and under zero-shot generalization settings, a mean reward of 0.8 was obtained. Zero-shot evaluation measured the agent's success rate on new instructions not seen during training. The results are updated in table 1, and the mean reward for different n values is shown in FIG4, with n = 5 converging faster to higher reward values. The A3C attn model with n = 5 converges faster to higher reward values compared to other methods. The performance gain is evident by using PReLU activations instead of ReLU activations. The attention maps for the best performing A3C attn model are visualized, showing faster convergence and significant improvement in performance. The attention maps in figures 6b, 6c, and 6d show how the agent uses different regions to navigate successfully. By subtracting maps 6b and 6c from 6d, the agent identifies the target object. This joint representation of textual and visual modalities highlights the effectiveness of the attention mechanism. The attention maps in figures 6b, 6c, and 6d demonstrate successful navigation using different regions. The visualization of attention weights indicates that instruction representations are semantically meaningful and grounded in visual elements. A two-dimensional PCA projection shows the quality of instruction embedding learned by the GRU. The model's ability to organize concepts and learn relationships between them is highlighted through vector arithmetic in instruction embeddings. This is demonstrated in figures 8b and 8c, showing parallels between instructions with color, size, and direction attributes. The model demonstrates its ability to learn relationships between concepts through vector arithmetic in instruction embeddings. By combining vectors representing different instructions, the agent successfully navigates to the target object, as shown in figures depicting the environment and the agent's trajectory. The embedding vectors allow the agent to navigate to the target object by combining different instructions. The agent can respond to new sentences formed by vector arithmetic, showing language grounding capabilities. This enables the agent to understand concepts across different languages. The agent is trained to translate instructions between English and French with 85% accuracy using a decoder branch with separate decoders for each language. This language grounding capability allows the agent to understand concepts across different languages. The agent is trained to translate instructions between English and French with 85% accuracy using separate decoders for each language. During testing, the English decoder is activated for French instructions and vice versa. The translation was done unsupervised, proving the agent can associate words with their true meaning independently. Agent's trajectory is stored as GIFs and available on GitHub. The paper presents an attention-based architecture for grounding natural language sentences via reinforcement learning. By visualizing attention maps, it is shown that discarding visual features after multimodal fusion still allows the agent to achieve its goals. The embeddings learned by the agent are meaningful, and the environment and code have been open-sourced to encourage further research. Future work aims to increase the complexity of sentences and environment dynamics. The study introduces an attention-based architecture for grounding natural language sentences in a 3D environment with moving objects. Results show significant performance improvement compared to a previous fusion mechanism, including zero-shot instructions. The approach converges faster and achieves better accuracy values, demonstrating the scalability of the attention mechanism to 3D environments. Our approach outperforms other baselines in both 2D and 3D environments, converging faster than the original fusion mechanism. Experiments were conducted on the same hardware for fair comparison. The 2D environment is customizable with objects specified in a JSON file, and different sizes available. Images of objects used in experiments are publicly available. The curr_chunk contains a list of natural language instructions for navigating in a 2D grid environment, including words like apple, sofa, car, chair, and more. Unseen instructions for zero-shot generalization evaluation are also provided. The curr_chunk provides a JSON configuration file for a 2D grid environment with instructions for zero-shot generalization settings. It includes details about objects like apples, sofas, cars, chairs, and obstacles like walls. More objects and obstacles can be added as needed."
