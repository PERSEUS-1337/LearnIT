    "content": "Congressional inaction on climate change has led to various entities pursuing climate change measures through international forums, treaty negotiations, EPA action under the Clean Air Act, state and regional efforts, and common law suits. These suits aim to establish GHG emissions and climate change impacts as a nuisance, but the prospects for such litigation are limited, especially for cases seeking injunctive relief under federal common law. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 gave EPA authority to regulate GHG emissions, impacting the outlook for common law suits. The Supreme Court's decision in American Electric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut in 2011 dealt a major blow to federal common law nuisance suits related to GHG emissions. It clarified that federal courts cannot develop their own emission standards through common law in the climate change area, as EPA has authority over GHG emissions. This limits the potential for common-law climate change lawsuits seeking to establish emission standards through court rulings. Nuisance law presents challenges for individual climate change lawsuits, with questions of causation, remedy, and defendants' contribution to GHG emissions. Despite these challenges, some support the use of nuisance lawsuits to address climate change. The use of nuisance lawsuits to address climate change has defenders who argue that many harms attributed to climate change are traditionally covered by nuisance doctrine. Nuisance law adapts to changing circumstances, recognizing private and public nuisances. Public nuisance cases are typically brought by the government for activities that significantly interfere with public health and safety. Common-law nuisance actions related to climate change often involve public nuisance. The American Electric Power decision upheld the displacement barrier to suit, reducing the importance of standing and political question doctrine in climate change litigation. The text discusses the impact of climate change litigation, focusing on common law nuisance cases and public trust doctrine suits. It highlights the challenges faced by plaintiffs in addressing greenhouse gas emissions through nuisance actions, with the displacement of federal common law being a key issue. The federal common law of nuisance in relation to GHG emissions and interstate pollution may be displaced by acts of Congress, according to the Supreme Court. New federal laws and regulations could eventually preempt federal common law in this area. Regulations may preempt federal common law of nuisance in the climate change area, as confirmed by Supreme Court decisions. The 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling established EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA, further solidified by the 2011 American Electric Power decision. The CAA now supersedes federal common law in setting GHG emission limits for sources under EPA regulatory authority. The act directly addresses the defendants' GHG emissions in light of Massachusetts and CAA coverage of stationary emission sources. The importance of standing and political question doctrine in federal-common-law climate change litigation has been reduced by the American Electric Power decision. The standing issue determines if a party has the right to bring suit in federal courts under Article III of the Constitution. Standing in federal courts has constitutional and prudential components, requiring a plaintiff to show actual or imminent injury caused by the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision. Climate change lawsuits may face challenges meeting these requirements due to the difficulty in proving causation of specific injuries. Defendants may argue that the plaintiff's injury was not caused by climate change or that their greenhouse gas emissions were minimal contributors. State plaintiffs can sue as owners of natural resources or in their parens patriae capacity, where they must show a quasi-sovereign interest separate from private parties. A state's interest in the health and well-being of its residents can establish parens patriae standing. The Court's decision in Massachusetts in 2007 established that states have a lower standing threshold due to their quasi-sovereign interests. In American Electric Power in 2011, the Court's split on standing was evident, with a 4-4 vote due to a recusal. Prudential standing rules are self-imposed limits on federal jurisdiction, not dictated by Article III. The political question doctrine imposes limits on federal jurisdiction, aiming to prevent the judiciary from interfering in the business of other branches of government. This doctrine is applied on a case-by-case basis, with factors outlined in Baker v. Carr in 1962. The Supreme Court established the political question doctrine in Baker v. Carr in 1962, setting high thresholds for nonjusticiability. This doctrine has been prevalent in nuisance/climate change litigation, although its application in such cases remains unclear. The Supreme Court established the political question doctrine in Baker v. Carr in 1962, setting high thresholds for nonjusticiability. In climate change litigation, American Electric Power involved plaintiffs seeking to require electric utilities to reduce CO2 emissions. In American Electric Power, plaintiffs sought to reduce CO2 emissions to address climate change. The federal district court dismissed the case in 2005 on political question grounds, citing the need for guidance from the political branches due to the balancing of various interests involved. The Second Circuit later held in 2009 that the district court erred in dismissing the case on political question grounds. The Second Circuit in 2009 ruled that the district court erred in dismissing the case on political question grounds. The Supreme Court focused on the displacement issue, stating that when Congress addresses a question, federal common law is no longer needed. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act directly addresses CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants, making federal common law unnecessary. The Act qualifies carbon dioxide as air pollution and instructs the EPA to regulate existing sources that contribute significantly to air pollution. This includes the defendants' power plants, which are subject to state regulations based on federal guidelines. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act delegates authority to the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants, displacing federal common law. This decision was based on the Act's direct addressing of CO2 emissions as air pollution and the EPA's mandate to regulate significant sources of pollution, including the defendants' plants. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act delegates authority to the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants, displacing federal common law. The Court emphasized the complexity of climate change and the need for government action based on policy determinations. It remanded the case to the Second Circuit for further proceedings, which may involve determining the fate of state common law claims regarding GHG emissions and whether the CAA preempts them. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Clean Air Act delegates authority to the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, displacing federal common law. State common law claims regarding GHG emissions may face challenges, with courts likely to apply the nuisance law of the GHG source's state. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Clean Air Act delegates authority to the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, displacing federal common law. State common law claims regarding GHG emissions may face challenges, with courts likely to apply the nuisance law of the GHG source's state. A question arises whether American Electric Power displaces climate-change-based federal common law actions seeking relief, particularly in cases where plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to reduce GHG emissions. The Court's reasons for finding displacement seem focused on the lack of federal court expertise in setting emission standards and the potential conflict between EPA and judicial standards. These concerns may not apply in cases seeking monetary damages, where the court's task is to determine if the plaintiff's injury was caused by the defendant's emissions. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Clean Air Act delegates authority to the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, displacing federal common law. State common law claims regarding GHG emissions may face challenges, with courts likely to apply the nuisance law of the GHG source's state. The applicability of American Electric Power to cases seeking damages may be resolved soon in Village of Kivalina. The decision reaffirms EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions and highlights the complexity of climate change, emphasizing the need for administrative expertise. If Congress eliminates EPA authority over GHG emissions, a different question arises regarding common law claims. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Clean Air Act delegates authority to the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, displacing federal common law. State common law claims regarding GHG emissions may face challenges, with courts likely to apply the nuisance law of the GHG source's state. The elimination of EPA authority over GHGs could lead to judge-made emission standards if climate change is deemed a nuisance. Three climate change cases invoking the common law of nuisance are currently active, including Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp. and Comer v. Murphy Oil USA. These cases have not yet reached a decision on the merits, focusing on threshold issues. In Village of Kivalina, an Inupiat Eskimo village sued oil and energy companies for GHG emissions contributing to climate change. The Village of Kivalina sued oil and energy companies for emitting large quantities of GHGs that contribute to climate change, leading to the destruction of the village. The lawsuit invokes federal and state laws on public and private nuisance, as well as civil conspiracy claims. The village seeks monetary damages, but the federal nuisance claim was initially dismissed by the district court. The Village of Kivalina's lawsuit against oil and energy companies for climate change damage has been reactivated. The case involves arguments on the application of American Electric Power decision and claims for monetary remedies. Additionally, a liability insurer has filed a suit related to potential damages in Kivalina. Comer v. Murphy Oil USA litigation has also been reactivated, involving property damage from Hurricane Katrina and lawsuits against oil, coal, and chemical companies. The plaintiffs sued oil, coal, and chemical companies for damages caused by Hurricane Katrina, alleging that greenhouse gas emissions intensified the hurricane. They claimed negligence, nuisance, trespass, and sought compensatory and punitive damages. Additionally, they accused the companies of spreading misinformation about global warming. Claims were also made against home insurance companies for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of consumer protection laws. The plaintiffs sued oil, coal, and chemical companies for damages caused by Hurricane Katrina, alleging negligence, nuisance, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. They also accused the companies of spreading misinformation about global warming. Claims were made against home insurance companies for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of consumer protection laws. The federal district court dismissed the action for lack of plaintiff standing, but the Fifth Circuit later reversed this decision, ruling that the plaintiffs had standing for their tort claims. In 2010, the Fifth Circuit lacked a quorum, leading to the dismissal of an appeal. The court could not reinstate the vacated panel decision, effectively denying appeal of the original district court dismissal. The plaintiffs refiled the case in 2011, creating a second opportunity for a ruling on American Electric Power. Another case involved California suing auto manufacturers for climate change impacts, seeking damages under federal common law. The district court dismissed the case in 2007 on a political question rationale. In 2009, California appealed to the Ninth Circuit but later motioned for voluntary dismissal as part of an agreement with the Obama Administration and automobile manufacturers. Korsinsky v. U.S. EPA was a pro se action alleging that GHG emissions threatened the plaintiff's health. The district court dismissed for lack of standing, and the Second Circuit affirmed in 2006. Nuisance lawsuits joined by a coordinated campaign seek to address climate change through different legal avenues. The public trust doctrine asserts that the government has a responsibility to protect the atmosphere from climate change. Lawsuits and petitions, coordinated by Our Children's Trust, involve children and teenagers as plaintiffs. This doctrine holds that certain natural resources are held in special status by the sovereign, with the government having an affirmative duty to safeguard them. The public trust doctrine asserts that the government has a duty to protect natural resources for the benefit of the public. Lawsuits filed by Our Children's Trust seek to declare the atmosphere as a public trust resource, with the government having a fiduciary duty to protect it. Twelve suits have been filed against various states and the United States, with Montana's suit uniquely extending the public trust to the atmosphere. Montana's lawsuit extends public trust to the atmosphere under state law, seeking injunctive relief against the United States for allowing unsafe GHG levels. Other states have filed rulemaking petitions citing the public trust doctrine to regulate GHG emissions. No monetary damages are sought in these legal actions."
