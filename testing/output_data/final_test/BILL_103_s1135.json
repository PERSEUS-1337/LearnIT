The Food Stamp Act of 1977 is amended to modify the collection and disposition of claims and administrative and judicial review processes. The changes include removing certain language related to waivers for good cause and adding provisions for thorough review of penalties and determinations of good cause. The Food Stamp Act of 1977 is amended to modify the collection and disposition of claims and administrative and judicial review processes. The changes include provisions for thorough review of penalties and determinations of good cause, as well as clarifications on the deliberative process privilege for document withholding by the Secretary or State agency. Administrative cost sharing and quality control criteria are also updated to include uncontrollable caseload fluctuations and natural disasters as examples of good cause. The Food Stamp Act of 1977 is amended to address various factors that can disrupt food stamp program administration, including natural disasters, program changes, strikes, client errors, demographic factors, and state program improvements aimed at reducing error rates in the long term. The Food Stamp Act of 1977 is amended to address factors causing short-term increases in error rates, including circumstances beyond state agency control. The national average overpayment error rate is the ratio of incorrect allotments issued to ineligible or overissued households to total allotments issued. The national average underpayment rate is also defined. The national average underpayment rate is the ratio of underissued allotments to total allotments issued by State agencies in a fiscal year. The overpayment error rate is the percentage of incorrect allotments issued to ineligible or overissued households, reduced by the national average underpayment error rate. The underpayment error rate for the fiscal year exceeds the State agency's underpayment error rate. The reduction required for overpayment error rate can be applied in determining future fiscal years at the State agency's request. Payment error rate is the sum of overpayment and underpayment error rates. Underpayment error rate is the ratio of underissued allotments to total allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency. The program authorized under this Act aims to enhance payment accuracy by establishing fiscal incentives for State agencies. The Secretary can adjust the federally funded share of administrative costs based on the payment error rate, increasing the share for agencies with lower error rates. The Secretary can adjust administrative costs based on payment error rates, with State agencies needing to reduce errors to receive adjustments. State agencies with high overpayment error rates may face penalties. The amount determined for adjustments in administrative costs is based on the overpayment error rate of the State agency compared to the national average. Penalties may apply to State agencies with high overpayment error rates. The penalty for overpayment errors is calculated by multiplying the difference between the State agency's overpayment error rate and the national average by the overpayments recovered in the fiscal year. State agencies can pay the penalty in quarterly installments over a maximum of 30 months. Certain errors are excluded from the error rate calculation for management purposes. Errors that are excluded from the overpayment or underpayment error rate calculation include those resulting from new regulations within 120 days, use of correct information from a Federal agency, actions based on approved policy information, and cases later found not to involve payment errors after a fair hearing. When determining if a payment is erroneous, the Secretary and State agency must follow the State plan approved under section 11. If a State plan conflicts with Federal law or regulations and the Secretary notifies the State agency in writing, the Federal law or regulations will prevail. Exceptions include situations where the State needs to pass a law to resolve the inconsistency and the Secretary allows time for this, or if the payment was made in compliance with a court order. The State agency must comply with a court order when making payments. If the Secretary receives a penalty from a State agency that is later determined to be not due, the Secretary must promptly refund the amount with interest. State error rates are determined from a single statistical sample without sub-sampling or re-reviews. National average error rates are derived from State error rates. State error rates are reviewed by State agency personnel or the Secretary. No penalty is imposed if the error rate's confidence interval width exceeds 50% of the point estimate, unless agreed upon by the State. The Secretary determines error rates, incentive payments, and penalties within 9 months after the fiscal year ends. The Secretary may assert a financial claim against a State agency, which can seek review of the action within 9 months after the fiscal year ends. SEC. 3. STUDY OF QUALITY CONTROL STATISTICAL SYSTEM. The Secretary of Agriculture and State agencies will conduct a study on measurement error and uniformity in the food stamp program quality control system. Controlled experiments will be conducted to determine the consistency of error-rate measurements. A report on the study is due within 1 year. The Secretary of Agriculture and State agencies will report the results and recommendations of a study on measurement error and uniformity in the food stamp program quality control system to the Committees on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 1 year. Recommendations will focus on reducing measurement error and increasing quality control at a reasonable cost. SEC. 4. BUDGET NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENT: No provision of this Act or amendment shall take effect unless fully offset in each fiscal year through 1995. Price support programs cannot be reduced for offset. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATES: The Act is effective upon enactment, with food stamp quality control amendments effective from October 1, 1991."
