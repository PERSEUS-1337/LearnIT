Congress finds that there is no requirement for lenders to provide information on creating a durable power of attorney for financial decision-making in case of borrower or cosigner incapacitation or death. Private lenders' promissory notes lack clear descriptions of borrower and cosigner responsibilities in such events. Approximately 1.4 million people in the US suffer traumatic brain injuries annually, resulting in 50,000 deaths, 235,000 hospitalizations, and 1.1 million treated and released from emergency departments. The estimated annual incidence of spinal cord injuries is around 40 cases per 1 million people, with 12,000 new cases each year. In the 2007-2008 academic year, 13% of students at public schools and 26.2% at private schools borrowed from private educational lenders. In 2009, the number of cosigned private education loans increased from 66% to 84% of all private education loans, according to Sallie Mae. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL STUDENT LOAN PROTECTIONS. Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include additional protections for borrowers and cosigners of private education loans. This includes providing information on creating a durable power of attorney for financial decision-making during student loan counseling sessions. The amendment to the Truth in Lending Act requires private educational lenders to provide information on creating a durable power of attorney for financial decision-making to borrowers and cosigners of private education loans. Lenders must also clearly describe the cosigner's obligations with respect to the loan. The Truth in Lending Act amendment mandates private educational lenders to inform borrowers and cosigners about creating a durable power of attorney for financial decision-making. Lenders must also clearly explain the cosigner's obligations regarding the loan. The Board will provide model forms for this information. The Truth in Lending Act requires private educational lenders to define death, disability, or inability to engage in substantial gainful activity for borrowers and cosigners according to specific regulations. The Truth in Lending Act now includes definitions for \"durable power of attorney\" and \"cosigner\" to clarify financial decision-making roles in cases of incapacity. The Truth in Lending Act defines a \"cosigner\" as an individual liable for another's obligation without compensation, including those required to sign for credit or collection purposes, but excluding spouses needed to perfect a security interest in a loan. SEC. 3. FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS. Section 485(l)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include information on loan discharge due to death, disability, or inability to work. It also explains that for private education loans, the borrower, estate, and consigner may be obligated to repay the full amount regardless of the borrower's condition. The model form for durable power of attorneys published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in accordance with the Truth in Lending Act, along with information on how to access the form for borrowers residing in a different state. The durable power of attorneys model form was passed by the House of Representatives on September 28, 2010."
