    "content": "Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the AUMF, granting the President authority to use force against those involved. Many captured individuals were sent to Guantanamo Bay for detention and possible prosecution. Most detainees have been transferred to third countries, while those remaining are in preventive detention to prevent them from returning to the battlefield. Preventive detention at Guantanamo Bay is used to stop captured individuals from returning to the battlefield. Those detained may face criminal charges before a tribunal, with potential penalties including life imprisonment or death. Some detainees have been cleared for transfer or release to foreign countries but remain detained until the transfer can be arranged. The Bush Administration's decision to detain suspected belligerents at Guantanamo was based on policy and legal considerations. Guantanamo provided a secure location for interrogation and potential trial by military tribunals for war crimes. The administration aimed to prevent legal challenges by keeping detainees outside of U.S. jurisdiction, denying them the same legal protections as if they were held in the United States. The legal support for detaining Guantanamo detainees outside the U.S. jurisdiction was weakened by Supreme Court rulings allowing detainees to seek judicial review. Despite Congress's efforts to limit courts' jurisdiction through the DTA and MCA, the Supreme Court ruled in Boumediene v. Bush that Guantanamo detainees have the right to habeas corpus review. This allows detainees to challenge the legality of their detention. The Boumediene decision granted Guantanamo detainees the right to habeas corpus review, but key legal issues remain unresolved, such as the extent of habeas review available, remedies for unlawful detention, and the application of constitutional provisions to noncitizens at Guantanamo. The D.C. Circuit has issued rulings favoring the government's position, with the Supreme Court declining to review them. President Obama's Executive Order 13492 aimed to close the Guantanamo detention facility. Obama issued Executive Order 13492 to close the Guantanamo detention facility within a year. Detainees were to be transferred to a third country, another U.S. facility, or prosecuted. Reviewing authorities assessed legal, logistical, and security issues, including the feasibility of prosecuting detainees in an Article III court. President Obama issued Executive Order 13492 to close the Guantanamo detention facility within a year, halting all proceedings before military commissions. Two other Executive Orders created task forces to review U.S. detention policy, including options for detainee disposition and interrogation policies, potentially impacting Guantanamo policy. The Executive Order to close Guantanamo had limited success, with only one detainee transferred to the US for trial. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 modified rules for military commissions, impacting the forums for 10 other Guantanamo detainees. The Attorney General and Secretary of Defense decided to resume military commission proceedings for five Guantanamo detainees, while charges against five others related to the 9/11 attacks were withdrawn for trial in federal civilian court. Plans to try Khalid Sheik Mohammed in federal court were put on hold but later reversed in April 2011. The Administration reversed course in April 2011, deciding to try 9/11 conspirators before military commissions. The debate over terrorism trials was fueled by Ahmed Ghailani's 2010 conviction for charges related to the 1998 embassy bombings. The Guantanamo Task Force's final report in January 2010 concluded that some detainees should remain in preventive detention without trial. In December 2009, President Obama directed the acquisition of Thomson Correctional Facility for Guantanamo detainees. Congress later barred funds for constructing or modifying a facility in the US for detainees. The Thomson facility was purchased in 2012 but will not be used for housing Guantanamo detainees. The Administration intended to use Thomson Correctional Facility to hold high-security prison inmates, not Guantanamo detainees. Efforts to close the Guantanamo detention facility have been hindered by congressional limitations on transferring detainees into the United States. The Guantanamo detention facility remains open due to congressional limitations on transferring detainees into the United States. President Obama expressed opposition to these measures but did not claim they were unconstitutional. Military tribunals are the only viable forum for trying Guantanamo detainees for criminal offenses. President Obama opposed congressional limitations on transferring detainees to the US, but did not claim they were unconstitutional. He issued Executive Order 13567 for the periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. The order established a Periodic Review Board to assess the need for continued detention. The Executive Order 13567 established a Periodic Review Board to assess the need for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for finding suitable transfer locations for detainees not deemed to warrant continued detention. detainees have the right to challenge their detention and present evidence in a hearing before the PRB within a year of the Order's issuance. The Executive Order 13567 established a Periodic Review Board to assess the need for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The Order specifies that the process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. The White House also reaffirmed its commitment to closing the Guantanamo detention facility and announced the resumption of new charges to military commissions. The White House reaffirmed its commitment to prosecute detainees in Article III courts and repeal legislation restricting detainee transfers for trial in civilian courts. The National Defense Authorization Act of FY2012 authorizes detention of certain persons, regulates status determinations, periodic review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees, and continues funding restrictions on detainee transfers. President Obama signed the 2012 NDAA into law despite earlier threats to veto it, but issued a signing statement objecting to detainee-related restrictions. Congress maintained funding restrictions on Guantanamo detainee transfers in the 2013 NDAA. Obama criticized these provisions, stating they hindered his ability to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and could violate the Constitution. The President criticized restrictions on Guantanamo detainee transfers in the 2013 NDAA, stating they hindered closure efforts and could violate the Constitution. He reiterated his intention to work towards closing the detention facility. The closure of the Guantanamo detention facility raises legal issues regarding detainees, especially if transferred to the United States. Constitutional protections for detainees in the US may differ from those at Guantanamo. The transfer could impact detention, prosecution, and potential asylum for detainees. President Obama's Executive Order to close Guantanamo involves working with Congress on related legislation. This report discusses legal issues related to the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees, their continued detention in the United States, and constitutional issues in their criminal prosecution. It addresses detainees' rights to a speedy trial, prohibition against ex post facto laws, and limitations on hearsay and secret evidence in criminal cases. These issues are likely to be relevant in any legislation regarding the transfer of detainees to the United States. The report discusses legal issues related to the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees, their continued detention in the United States, and constitutional issues in their criminal prosecution. It addresses detainees' rights to a speedy trial, prohibition against ex post facto laws, and limitations on hearsay and secret evidence in criminal cases. Any proposal to close the Guantanamo detention facility must address the transfer of detainees, including the possibility of transferring some to the United States for continued detention or release. Decisions to transfer Guantanamo detainees to another country are based on the detainee no longer being deemed an enemy combatant or no longer posing a threat. If continued detention is no longer necessary, detainees are transferred to another government for release. The DOD also transfers detainees to other countries for continued detention, investigation, or prosecution. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 on March 7, 2011, establishing a process for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. A Periodic Review Board (PRB) composed of officials from various departments reviews the grounds for continued detention of detainees designated as enemy combatants or referred for prosecution. Additionally, a Review Committee annually assesses transfer efforts' sufficiency and efficacy. The Periodic Review Board (PRB) assesses the necessity of continued detention of Guantanamo detainees and evaluates transfer efforts every four years. If continued detention is not warranted, efforts are made to find a suitable transfer location outside the United States, in compliance with U.S. obligations against torture. The PRB assesses the need for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees every four years, with efforts to find suitable transfer locations if release is deemed appropriate. detainees have the right to a hearing where they can argue against their continued detention with the assistance of a government-appointed representative and possibly private counsel. The PRB reviews the need for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees every four years, with efforts to find transfer locations if release is deemed appropriate. Detainees have the right to challenge government information and present their own, with periodic reviews every six months and a full review every three years. If the PRB does not reach a unanimous decision on continued detention, the case goes to the Review Committee for further consideration. The Review Committee considers cases for further review, but the Order lacks clarity on their procedures and the impact on detainee cases. Transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees doesn't guarantee immediate removal due to legal constraints, such as the prohibition on transferring individuals to countries where they may face torture or persecution. The Bush and Obama Administrations have policies against repatriating Guantanamo detainees to countries where they may be tortured. Diplomatic assurances are sought before transferring detainees, and if assurances are not reliable, the transfer is delayed. The use of diplomatic assurances in Guantanamo transfer decisions is similar to practices used by U.S. authorities for extradition or removal of aliens. President Obama created a task force in 2009 to review transfer policies and ensure compliance with legal requirements, including monitoring treatment to prevent torture. The Guantanamo Task Force was created in 2009 by President Obama to review transfer policies and ensure compliance with legal requirements, including monitoring treatment to prevent torture. Measures to monitor the treatment of transferred persons might impede the transfer of some Guantanamo detainees to third countries. Despite being cleared for transfer, several dozen detainees remain at Guantanamo due to no country willing to accept them or human rights concerns preventing their transfer. The Guantanamo Task Force identified detainees cleared for transfer but unable to be repatriated due to concerns in their home countries, needing resettlement in a third country. Some detainees could be transferred for continued detention if receiving countries can manage the threat they pose. President Obama halted transfers to Yemen due to security concerns, with 30 Yemeni detainees designated for conditional detention. The Guantanamo Task Force identified detainees cleared for transfer but unable to be repatriated due to concerns in their home countries, needing resettlement in a third country. President Obama halted transfers to Yemen due to security concerns, with 30 Yemeni detainees designated for conditional detention. The U.S. refusal to resettle detainees on its territory may be contributing to the reluctance of other countries to accept more detainees for resettlement. Congress passed measures barring funds from transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign states without prior notification to Congress. The 2011 NDAA imposed stricter restrictions on transfers, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense at least 30 days before any proposed transfer. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress that a foreign government or entity meets specific criteria before transferring a detainee, including not being a state sponsor of terrorism, maintaining control over detention facilities, and preventing future threats to the US. Similar requirements are found in previous NDAA measures. The 2011 CAA, 2012 NDAA, and 2013 NDAA, along with two continuing appropriations measures, have identical certification requirements for transferring detainees. The 2011 NDAA and CAA also prohibited transfers to foreign governments if there is a confirmed case of terrorist activity post-transfer. The Secretary of Defense can waive these restrictions if certain conditions are met. The 2013 NDAA and CAA have similar restrictions to the 2011 NDAA. The 2013 NDAA and 2013 CAA have provisions similar to those in the 2011 NDAA, restricting the transfer of detainees to foreign countries unless specific conditions are met, such as not being a state sponsor of terrorism and maintaining control over detention facilities. The 2013 NDAA and 2013 CAA have provisions similar to those in the 2011 NDAA, restricting the transfer of detainees to foreign countries unless specific conditions are met, such as ensuring the individual cannot engage in terrorist activities and sharing relevant information with the United States. The prohibition on transferring detainees to any country with a history of recidivism is also continued. The certification requirements and recidivism prohibition do not apply in the case of a detainee who must be released or transferred pursuant to a court order or a plea agreement under a military commission entered prior to enactment of the CAA. The Secretary of Defense may waive certain requirements and prohibitions if alternate assurances can be arranged. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, certifies that all certification requirements are met, alternative measures are in place to avert threats, and national security interests are served by permitting the transfer. Waivers for certification requirements and recidivism prohibition may be granted if risks cannot be completely eliminated, but alternative actions will substantially mitigate them. The certification requirements for transferring detainees involve security conditions, control over detention facilities, and terrorism support. Proposals to end Guantanamo detentions may include transferring detainees to the US for preventive detention, prosecution, or possible release. Congress has passed measures preventing funds from being used to release or transfer detainees into the US. Congress has enacted measures barring funds from transferring detainees into the US or its territories since 2011. This may have implications under immigration law, as the INA prohibits entry or presence of aliens involved in terrorism-related activities. Most Guantanamo detainees would be barred from admission into the US under current law. Persons currently detained at Guantanamo would generally be barred from admission into the United States on terrorism- and other security-related grounds under normal circumstances. Even if a detainee is not inadmissible or removable on such grounds, he may still be inadmissible or removable under other INA provisions. The INA would generally preclude most detainees from being released into the country, as such aliens would be subject to removal under immigration law. The INA's restrictions do not necessarily bar executive authorities from transferring wartime detainees into the United States for continued detention or prosecution. The INA's restrictions on alien admissibility do not necessarily apply to military detainees, and the 2001 AUMF may authorize the detention of captured belligerents in the United States. The executive branch can use its \"parole\" authority to transfer military detainees into the United States, allowing them to enter for a significant public benefit without being admitted for immigration purposes. This clarifies their immigration status if they are released from U.S. custody. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-83) included a provision barring the use of funds for providing immigration benefits to detainees brought into the United States, clarifying their immigration status if released from U.S. custody. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 and the 2011 Continuing Appropriations Act restricted the use of funds to provide immigration benefits to Guantanamo Bay detainees. Congress passed continuing resolutions to extend funding for federal agencies based on FY2010 appropriations enactments. The FY2010 appropriations enactments remained in effect for FY2011, including the bar on transporting Guantanamo detainees to the US. The Department of Homeland Security Act required Guantanamo detainees on the No Fly List unless certified as non-threats. Rules for detainee treatment would apply if transferred to the US, with potential additional constitutional protections for non-citizens. Guantanamo detainees deemed enemy belligerents may be held preventively. In the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court recognized the President's authority to detain enemy belligerents captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The Court also ruled that individuals deemed \"enemy combatants\" have the right to challenge their detention before a neutral decision-maker. While preventive detention of enemy belligerents is constitutionally acceptable, the scope of who falls under this category remains uncertain. The 2001 AUMF permits the detention of individuals captured supporting hostile forces in Afghanistan. The extent of detention authority away from the combat zone and the President's independent authority remain unresolved. The Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding the detention of a resident alien as an \"enemy combatant.\" The 2001 AUMF allows for the detention of individuals captured supporting hostile forces in Afghanistan. The Supreme Court granted the government's request to transfer al-Marri from military to civilian custody for criminal trial, leading to the case being dismissed as moot. The scope of the executive's authority to militarily detain persons captured away from the battlefield, including alleged members or associates of Al Qaeda or the Taliban, remains a matter of dispute. In a 2010 case, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals recognized the President's authority to detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban who engage in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals recognized the President's authority to detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban who engage in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. The panel endorsed a standard that permits the detention of individuals who purposefully and materially support AUMF-targeted organizations, without exploring the outer bounds of what constitutes sufficient support or indicia of membership. The standard is controlling in the D.C. Circuit unless the Supreme Court takes up the issue in a future case. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals endorsed a standard for detaining individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban who engage in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. The government is not required to show a person's role in the organization's \"command structure\" to justify detention. Congress enacted a provision in the 2012 NDAA to clarify executive authority to detain \"covered persons\" under the AUMF. The 2012 NDAA provision allows for the detention of individuals who have supported or engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, without clear definitions for terms like \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces.\" This provision may lead to a broadening of the conflict scope, with certain individuals required to be militarily detained until their ultimate disposition is determined. It is unclear if these provisions apply to individuals captured within the United States, but they are intended to cover detainees at Guantanamo. The 2012 NDAA provision allows for the detention of individuals who have supported or engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This may lead to a broadening of the conflict scope, with detainees at Guantanamo potentially being transferred into the United States. If a former detainee is charged with a federal crime, they may be held in pretrial detention if no other conditions would assure their appearance for trial or the safety of the community. Detainees may be held in detention as material witnesses to criminal proceedings if it becomes impracticable to secure their presence by subpoena. If the military lacks authority to hold a detainee in the US, they may be placed in immigration removal proceedings and detained pending removal. Aliens inadmissible on criminal or terrorism-related grounds are generally required to be detained pending removal, with removal typically required within 90 days. Aliens inadmissible or deportable on terrorism-related or most crime-related grounds cannot be released. Detainees may be held in detention as material witnesses to criminal proceedings if it becomes impracticable to secure their presence by subpoena. Aliens inadmissible or deportable on terrorism-related or most crime-related grounds cannot be released from detention. Continued detention beyond six months may be prohibited, but specially dangerous aliens may be detained longer, subject to periodic review. Immigration regulations allow for continued detention of certain aliens due to special circumstances, such as serious adverse foreign policy consequences, security concerns, or being considered specially dangerous due to past violent crimes and a likelihood of future violence. Some reviewing courts have found that regulations governing detention following an order of removal may not be permissible under the immigration statute. Proposals suggest detaining alien detainees released from military custody in the US pending removal, raising potential constitutional challenges. Without new legislation, rules for Guantanamo detainees would remain largely unchanged if transferred to the US under the DTA. The DTA prohibits unauthorized interrogation techniques on detainees in DOD custody, requiring compliance with the Army Field Manual and Geneva Conventions. Common Article 3 applies to Al Qaeda conflict detainees, mandating humane treatment and prohibiting torture. The DTA prohibits unauthorized interrogation techniques on detainees in DOD custody, requiring compliance with the Army Field Manual and Geneva Conventions. Common Article 3 mandates humane treatment and prohibits torture, including protection from violence, cruel treatment, and outrages upon personal dignity for detainees transferred into the United States. Noncitizen detainees in the US may receive greater constitutional protections than those detained outside the country. In February 2009, a D.C. Circuit panel ruled that Guantanamo detainees are not protected by the Constitution's due process rights. The Supreme Court later vacated the ruling in March 2010 due to changed circumstances but ultimately denied further review. The DTA and MCA prohibit cruel treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, regardless of their location. Detainees transferred to the U.S. may have broader judicial review options. The DTA and MCA limit detainees' access to judicial review in the United States, stripping federal courts of jurisdiction over most claims by noncitizen detainees. While the Boumediene Court allowed Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detention, it did not address claims of unlawful treatment or confinement. The Boumediene Court did not address claims of unlawful treatment or confinement, leaving unresolved questions regarding detainees' ability to bring constitutional challenges. The viability of measures stripping courts of jurisdiction over detainee claims may depend on the interpretation of constitutional protections. While challenges to aspects of detention may be permissible, measures eliminating detainees' ability to bring constitutional challenges would likely face legal scrutiny. The scope of constitutional protections for Guantanamo detainees is disputed, but it is clear that due process protections apply to all persons in the United States. The Constitution's due process protections apply to all persons in the United States, regardless of citizenship. Detainees transferred to the US may have better legal options to challenge their detention and potential transfers. The US must release detainees if there are no legal grounds for their custody. CAT Article 3 prohibits transferring detainees to countries where they may face torture, with potential judicial review available for transfer decisions. The prohibition against transferring detainees to countries where they may face torture is absolute, regardless of their involvement in terrorist or criminal activities. While the Bush Administration argued that CAT Article 3 does not apply to detainees held outside the US, there is consensus on its application to transfers within the country. Detainees brought to the US may seek relief under immigration laws, including asylum and adjustment of status to legal permanent resident. Detainees brought to the US may seek relief under immigration laws, including asylum or other forms of relief from removal if found eligible. Immigration authorities may need to provide evidence for removal decisions if challenged by the detainee. Asylum only provides relief from removal under immigration laws and does not prevent transfer. The Obama Administration seeks legislation from Congress to address Guantanamo detainees' immigration status, potentially barring them from asylum eligibility. Previous acts have restricted funds from providing immigration benefits to detainees or classifying them as refugees or asylum applicants. The Obama Administration seeks legislation to address Guantanamo detainees' immigration status, potentially barring them from asylum eligibility. Congress extended restrictions on detainees' immigration benefits through FY2011 but has not renewed them since. Legal questions arise regarding detainees' constitutional protections and the choice of judicial forum for prosecuting them. The interpretation of constitutional rights for detainees at Guantanamo is a legal dispute, with the Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene that the writ of habeas applies but leaving other protections unclear. The application of constitutional principles to noncitizens outside the US depends on practical factors, and some protections may be unavailable to aliens beyond US borders. The application of constitutional principles to Guantanamo detainees is uncertain, with differences in protections depending on the forum of prosecution. Constitutional requirements may vary between military commissions, courts-martial, and civilian court proceedings. Congress has significant control over due process protections in military court proceedings. The Constitution gives Congress control over military rights and procedures, especially regarding wartime security measures. Courts have historically been more lenient towards security measures on \"enemy aliens\" than U.S. citizens. Detainees could be prosecuted in federal civilian court, military commissions, or general courts-martial proceedings. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 amended the statutory framework for military commissions, providing more procedural protections to accused alien \"unprivileged enemy belligerents\" similar to those in military courts-martial. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 amended the statutory framework for military commissions, providing more procedural protections to accused alien \"unprivileged enemy belligerents.\" Critics have raised questions about the constitutionality of the military commission system, and courts have yet to rule on the legitimacy of many procedures used by military commissions. Military commissions are not restricted from jurisdiction within the United States, and the Supreme Court has upheld their use against enemy belligerents tried in the country. In November 2009, the Department of Justice and Department of Defense announced that military commission prosecutions against Guantanamo detainees may be resumed. Several detainees could be tried before military commissions or in federal civilian court for offenses under federal criminal statutes. Provisions in the U.S. Criminal Code apply extraterritorially to some detainees, with ex post facto and statute of limitation concerns limiting their application to certain offenses. One detainee was transferred to the U.S. for trial in federal court for his alleged role in the 1998 embassy bombings. In November 2009, plans to bring charges against detainees for their alleged role in the 9/11 attacks were put on hold due to opposition. The Attorney General eventually dropped the plan in favor of military commissions. Funding bars on transferring detainees to the US seem to prevent civilian trials at Guantanamo. Military courts-martial could also be used to try detainees under the UCMJ and law of war. Military courts-martial could charge detainees with offenses under the UCMJ and the law of war. The executive has discretion to choose the prosecution forum, but obstacles like the accused's right to a speedy trial and statute of limitations may arise. The Administration aims to prosecute some detainees in Article III courts and others in military commissions. Legislative proposals may dictate the prosecution forum or modify procedural rules. The executive has the authority to modify military commission procedural rules, potentially creating a new forum for detainee prosecution. Constitutional issues, including the right to counsel, would apply to detainees brought to the US for criminal prosecution. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to assistance of counsel in any criminal prosecution. This right includes the ability to retain counsel of choice or have one appointed by the court if unable to afford it. The court must inform the defendant of this right and ensure any waiver of counsel is valid. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to counsel, whether chosen or appointed. The waiver of this right must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The right includes self-representation if chosen intelligently. There is no constitutional right to continuity of appointed counsel, but substitution must serve justice. The right to counsel ensures effective assistance, with a two-fold test for determining ineffective assistance. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel, with a two-fold test for determining ineffective assistance. In federal civilian courts, Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure implements the right to counsel, while in courts-martial, Rule 506 of the Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) applies. This rule allows for counsel to be appointed for a defendant who is unable to obtain counsel at every stage of the proceedings. Rule 506 of the Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) and Rules for Military Commissions (R.M.C.) provide the right to be represented by civilian counsel at no cost to the government, along with the option to waive counsel and defend personally. Detainees subject to military commissions have the right to be represented by detailed military defense counsel and civilian counsel meeting specific qualifications. In military commission proceedings, detainees can waive their right to counsel and defend themselves. Unlike courts-martial rules, detainees do not have the right to specific individual military counsel upon request. However, under MCA 2009 modifications, detainees can request a military defense counsel of their choice if available. Admissibility of interrogation statements obtained by U.S. or foreign agencies is a potential issue for certain detainees at Guantanamo. The interrogation techniques used on detainees at Guantanamo would be considered unconstitutionally harsh in the United States. Any evidence obtained through coercive methods may be challenged in court under the Fifth Amendment. Statements made under coercion are generally inadmissible in U.S. courts, with Miranda warnings required for admissibility. Miranda applies when police question a defendant in custody. Recent jurisprudence has weakened Miranda's effect, allowing departures from strict adherence. The \"public safety\" exception, introduced in New York v. Quarles, allows for admissibility of incriminating statements without Miranda warnings in certain cases. The \"public safety\" exception, as seen in New York v. Quarles, allows for admissibility of incriminating statements without Miranda warnings in cases where public safety is at risk. This exception has been used in questioning terrorist suspects like Faisal Shahzad and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before Miranda rights were read. An FBI memorandum advises extensive \"public safety questioning\" for terrorist operatives to gather information on potential attacks. The memorandum discusses exceptions to Miranda warnings for terrorist suspects, including the \"public safety\" exception and an exception for statements made to foreign officials. The need for unwarned intelligence interrogations in exceptional cases is also highlighted. The Yosef court identified exceptions to Miranda warnings for terrorist suspects, including the Quarles public safety exception and an exception for statements made to foreign officials. In cases involving joint ventures or situations that shock the judicial conscience, the exception does not apply. Prosecutors would only need to show that detainees' statements were made voluntarily for them to be admitted at trial. For example, in United States v. Abu Ali, statements made to Saudi interrogators were upheld as voluntary despite a lack of Miranda warnings. The court found that the statements were voluntary, following the constitutional standard of \"voluntariness\" as the ultimate safeguard against coerced confessions. The test for voluntariness examines factors such as the accused's age, education, and the use of physical punishment. Failure to provide Miranda warnings can be a factor in determining voluntariness. The failure to provide Miranda warnings can impact the evaluation of the totality of circumstances in a case. Without a Miranda warning, unwarned statements may be excluded from trial. However, evidence derived from unwarned statements may not be excluded unless it was obtained as a result of coercion. In a specific case involving Ahmed Ghailani, abusive interrogation did not lead to charges being dismissed but did result in the exclusion of a government witness. Congress has generally barred enemy belligerents in military custody outside the United States from being read Miranda warnings, absent a court order, as per the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 prohibits enemy belligerents in military custody outside the US from being read Miranda warnings, except in certain circumstances such as when the Department of Justice intends to bring criminal charges in federal civilian court. This provision does not apply to the Department of Justice, allowing them to potentially read Miranda warnings to detainees in military custody. Individuals brought before a court-martial are protected from coercion, unlawful influence, or inducement. They cannot be forced to incriminate themselves or answer irrelevant questions. They are entitled to Miranda-type warnings, known as 31 bravo rights, informing them of the accusation, their right to remain silent, and the use of their statements as evidence. These protections are broader than Miranda warnings as they apply even if the suspect is not in custody. Military personnel questioning captured insurgents suspected of unlawful hostilities may not need to provide Miranda-type warnings, as Army regulations suggest Article 31 rights may not apply to such individuals. There is a potential exception for public safety concerns, and the relationship between UCMJ Article 31 and Miranda rights limitations is unclear. The limitations on Miranda warnings in the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act may not necessarily include Article 31 warnings. Persons subject to military commissions have a statutory privilege against self-incrimination, which is less robust than in courts-martial proceedings. Statements obtained through torture are prohibited, and under the original MCA, military commissions could admit statements from harsh interrogation. However, statements obtained through cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment are not admissible under the DTA. The DTA's prohibition applies to methods considered unconstitutionally harsh in the United States. The MCA 2009 prohibits the admission of statements obtained through torture or \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\" in military commission proceedings, regardless of when they were made. Self-incriminating statements by the accused can be introduced if specific criteria are met. The MCA 2009 sets criteria for the admissibility of statements in military commission proceedings, requiring reliability, probative value, and lawful conduct during military operations. Legal challenges may arise, especially regarding the admissibility of involuntary statements or those made after harsh interrogation. In a military commission case, a detainee's statements were ruled tainted by an earlier confession made under threat of death. A federal court later deemed all statements by the detainee as products of torture, leading to his release and transfer to Afghanistan. Despite allegations of threats during interrogation, a military judge allowed the use of another detainee's statements. The Military Commission Rules of Evidence address evidence derived from statements obtained through torture or coercion. Rule 304 states that such evidence may not be used against an accused unless it can be shown that the evidence would have been obtained even without the statement or that its use is consistent with the interests of justice. The Ex Post Facto Clause in the U.S. Constitution limits the ability of U.S. authorities to pursue criminal charges against detainees, as offenses punishable under one jurisdiction may not be recognized in another. This clause also serves as a check on congressional power, preventing the enactment of retroactive laws with unjust effects. The Ex Post Facto Clause limits congressional power and may affect the prosecution of detainees, regardless of their location. Some detainees could be prosecuted in federal civilian court for offenses related to or preceding the 9/11 attacks without violating the clause. Laws criminalizing terrorism-related activity existed before 9/11, including those with extraterritorial application. In the early days of the conflict with the Taliban and Al Qaeda, many terrorism-related statutes did not apply to wholly extraterritorial acts committed by foreign nationals that did not injure U.S. persons. Prior to 2004, federal criminal law generally did not extend to non-citizens with no ties to the United States who provided material support to a terrorist organization. Some persons could also be charged with offenses under the War Crimes Act for specified offenses under the law of war. For offenses prior to September 11, 2001, establishing them in an armed conflict context may be challenging. Statute of limitations can affect prosecution, with a typical limit of five years for federal offenses, but eight years for terrorism-related crimes unless death or serious injury is involved. Ex post facto laws may limit charges in military proceedings. The UCMJ grants general courts-martial jurisdiction to try individuals subject to trial by a military tribunal and impose punishments allowed by the law of war. The common law of war defines offenses triable in general courts-martial, with no specific list provided. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court ruled that conspiracy to violate the law of war is not inherently a crime under the common law of war or the UCMJ. Congress exempted military commissions from many UCMJ requirements after the Hamdan case. Military commissions were exempted from many UCMJ requirements applicable to courts-martial proceedings. They have personal jurisdiction over a limited category of belligerents and share subject-matter jurisdiction over violations of the law of war. Congress defined specific offenses punishable by military commissions, including murder of protected persons, terrorism, and conspiracy to commit an offense punishable by military commission. These acts by an unprivileged enemy belligerent are punishable by military commissions regardless of the timing of the offense. Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act (MCA) in response to events post-9/11, codifying offenses triable by military commissions. The Court of Military Commission Review upheld convictions for terrorism-related offenses, citing historical evidence. However, the D.C. Circuit later disagreed and reversed the decision in the Hamdan II case. In the Hamdan II case, the D.C. Circuit reversed Hamdan's conviction, stating that Congress did not intend for the offenses defined in the MCA to apply retroactively. The court found that the crime of material support of terrorism was not considered a war crime under international law at the time of the relevant conduct, making the conviction invalid. The court suggested that offenses must be based on norms firmly grounded in international law to avoid being retroactive. The Al Bahlul case is seeking a rehearing en banc to challenge the decision in Hamdan. The crime of \"murder in violation of the law of war\" may also be new, depending on interpretation. The degree of deference given to Congress in defining violations of the law of war will be crucial in determining the constitutionality of punishable offenses listed by the MCA. The Supreme Court applies strict criteria to determine punishable acts under the law of war, but Congress may have more flexibility in defining war crime offenses. Ex post facto concerns may arise in changing statutes of limitations or penalties. These considerations impact decisions on prosecuting detainees and crafting new legislative proposals. The prosecution of detainees may face ex post facto issues related to evidentiary rules, including hearsay. Both civilian and military courts have rules on hearsay evidence, with the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause ensuring the right to confront witnesses. These issues are relevant in prosecuting individuals captured in the war against Al Qaeda. Hearsay issues may arise in prosecuting detainees captured in the war against Al Qaeda. Witnesses detained by foreign governments may be unavailable to testify in US courts, and procedural rules limit the use of hearsay evidence. Federal civilian courts, courts-martial, and military commissions all have rules governing hearsay evidence admission. Federal Rules of Evidence and Military Rules of Evidence impose similar restrictions on hearsay evidence usage. Both federal and military rules of evidence impose restrictions on hearsay evidence usage, allowing exceptions for statements with greater reliability. Examples include \"excited utterances,\" records of regularly-conducted activity, and self-incriminating statements. A residual exception exists for statements with equivalent trustworthiness guarantees, such as interviews of child abuse victims by trained FBI agents. The definition of hearsay includes statements made by co-conspirators in furtherance of a conspiracy, which are not considered hearsay. In cases involving material support to terrorist organizations, co-conspirators' statements can be used as evidence at trial. However, the existence of the conspiracy must be established before these statements can be admitted. Military commissions under the Military Commission Rules of Evidence have different procedural rules compared to Federal Rules of Evidence and Military Rules of Evidence. The Military Commission Rules of Evidence allow for more leniency in admitting hearsay evidence, with the MCA 2006 permitting its admission if it meets certain criteria. The MCA 2009 further modified the rules, allowing hearsay evidence not admissible in general courts-martial to be admitted in military commission proceedings under specific conditions. In general, hearsay evidence may be admitted in a military commission trial if certain conditions are met, including giving advance notice to the opposing party and the military judge determining the reliability and relevance of the statement. Hearsay evidence may be admitted in a military commission trial under certain conditions, allowing for a broader range of inculpatory evidence for prosecutors. Military commission rules also permit a broader scope of hearsay for both parties, potentially allowing defendants to introduce more exculpatory evidence compared to federal court proceedings. The Constitution imposes limitations on hearsay evidence in criminal cases, with protections under the Confrontation Clause applying to both civilian and military proceedings. While it is unclear if these protections extend to noncitizens in military commissions at Guantanamo, they likely restrict the use of hearsay evidence in cases against detainees transferred to the US. In Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court ruled that hearsay exceptions may not apply, even under forum rules. The Supreme Court ruled that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial hearsay against a criminal defendant without prior cross-examination. Testimonial statements are those where a reasonable person would expect them to be used at trial, such as statements taken during investigations or formal interrogations by police. Statements made to enable police assistance in an ongoing emergency are not considered testimonial. The Supreme Court ruled that statements made to request police assistance in an ongoing emergency are not testimonial. Concerns arise when introducing statements made by detainees without them testifying in court, as it may violate the Sixth Amendment. In the context of enemy combatants, incriminating statements obtained during formal interrogation or on the battlefield may be considered testimonial. The Sixth Amendment would require the defendant to have the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant in such cases. The Confrontation Clause would also apply to noncitizens held at Guantanamo in military commissions. The Confrontation Clause would apply to military commissions held within the United States, requiring prosecutors to adhere to rules regarding testimonial hearsay against the defendant. Non-testimonial hearsay and testimonial hearsay with prior cross-examination opportunities may still be admissible. In early 2008, the DOD announced that around 80 Guantanamo detainees were expected to face trial before military commissions. In January 2010, the Obama Administration planned to bring charges against about 35 detainees in military or civilian court. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to a speedy trial for the accused in all criminal prosecutions, which applies to civilian and military courts. Detainees transferred to the United States may argue for a constitutionally entitled speedy trial. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy trial for detainees, balancing their prejudice with the public's interest in delaying prosecution. Courts use a multi-factor test to assess violations, considering delay length, reason, defendant's assertion, and prejudice. Severe remedy of dismissal is hesitated upon, but extremely long delays can violate the Sixth Amendment right even without specific prejudice proof. Some Guantanamo detainees may have suffered prejudice from long detention periods, potentially affecting their right to a speedy trial. The balance between detainee prejudice and public interest in delaying prosecution is a key consideration. Non-citizen detainees may not have the same speedy trial rights before transfer to the US. Ahmed Ghailani, transferred for trial, claimed a violation of his Sixth Amendment right due to a five-year delay. The court denied Ghailani's motion claiming a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial due to a five-year delay. The delay was justified by the need for interrogation for intelligence purposes during his time in CIA detention. The time spent in Guantanamo and the aborted military commission prosecution did not justify further postponement of trial. The court found Ghailani's delay in prosecution did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights due to lack of prejudice. The Federal Speedy Trial Act sets time limits for indictment and trial commencement, with exceptions for speed of prosecution. The Speedy Trial Act allows for exceptions to speed of prosecution, such as \"ends of justice\" continuances and complex case factors. In United States v. al-Arian, four men were charged with providing material support to terrorists. The court granted a continuance in the case of United States v. al-Arian, despite one defendant's objection based on his right to a speedy trial. The court found that the complexity of the case and the need for extensive discovery outweighed the defendant's interest in a speedy trial. The defendant failed to prove specific prejudice from the continuance. The military commissions do not have statutory or procedural rules governing an enemy combatant's right to a speedy trial. Only rights provided by the Sixth Amendment apply in this context. In contrast, courts-martial afford significant speedy trial rights, with Article 10 of the UCMJ requiring immediate steps to inform the accused and bring them to trial within 120 days. The military commissions lack statutory rules for speedy trials, while courts-martial have strict requirements under Article 10 of the UCMJ. Rule 707 allows for exclusions from the 120-day requirement, posing challenges for prosecuting Guantanamo detainees. The speedy trial requirement may start when detainees are confined, with potential exclusions for periods in civilian custody. The government may face challenges in prosecuting Guantanamo detainees before a general court-martial due to the lack of statutory rules for speedy trials. The defense can object to the trial based on the speedy trial requirement, which may require modifications to applicable statutes and forum rules. Even if time constraints are met, there could still be concerns about violating a defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment Due Process. The government faces challenges in prosecuting Guantanamo detainees due to the lack of statutory rules for speedy trials. This can lead to violations of a defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. The dilemma of potentially disclosing classified information in public trials led to the enactment of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA). The procedures for disclosing classified information in federal courts, courts-martial, and military commissions were amended by the MCA 2009 to align with practices in civilian courts. In cases involving classified information, the defendant may seek to introduce such information, requiring sequestration to protect national security interests. In cases involving classified information, procedures are in place to prevent disclosure to the defendant and the public. Protective orders can be issued to prevent access to classified information that could prejudice the defendant's rights. The prosecution may provide an unclassified summary to ensure the defendant can still make their defense effectively. The defendant can be provided with a substitute submission of classified information that allows for a fair defense, even if certain details are redacted. Legal issues regarding withholding classified information may arise during discovery and trial phases of criminal litigation. Discovery in federal criminal litigation is governed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, allowing defendants to request information and evidence from the prosecution before trial. Prosecution must provide Brady material (exculpatory evidence) and Jencks material (witness statements) if requested. Brady material refers to evidence that proves the defendant's innocence, even if prosecutors do not intend to use it. Prosecutors possess information closely aligned with the prosecution, including Jencks material which refers to witness statements with high impeachment value. The Jencks Act codified this requirement, differing from Brady material. In the context of classified information, the operation of Jencks and Brady may vary significantly. In cases involving classified information, the prosecution may request to submit a redacted version or substitute to prevent harm to national security. The court may reject these substitutes without defense counsels' input. Classified information that is also Jencks or Brady material is subject to CIPA. In some cases, the issue may be granting the defendant pre-trial access to government witnesses, as seen in United States v. Moussaoui. In Moussaoui, the defendant requested depositions of witnesses with potentially exculpatory information, but the government cited national security concerns and refused. The Fourth Circuit considered providing substitutes for depositions to balance discovery orders and national security, noting that substitutes should not automatically be deemed inadequate if they put the defendant in a similar position. The Fourth Circuit suggested that government-produced summaries of witness statements could serve as adequate substitutes for depositions in cases involving national security concerns. Rule 505 of the Military Rules of Evidence addresses the use and disclosure of classified information in courts-martial proceedings, allowing for the deletion, substitution, or conditional provision of classified information to the accused. The document outlines conditions to protect disclosed information, including withholding if national security is at risk. Pretrial sessions can address classified information issues for a fair trial. Military commissions follow 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7949p-1\u2013949p-9 for disclosure of classified information. The military judge has authority in interpreting statutory requirements for classified information in military commission proceedings, with the ability to hold pretrial sessions to address related matters. Modifications by the MCA 2009 allow for ex parte conferences to protect classified information, following federal court practices under the Classified Information Procedures Act. The military judge in military commission proceedings has the authority to authorize discovery of classified information if it is relevant to the defense, prosecution's case, or sentencing. The judge can modify or substitute classified evidence and may dismiss charges if fairness is compromised without disclosure. Using secret evidence at trial raises constitutional concerns about national security. In cases where disclosure of classified information could harm national security, the prosecution may present evidence at trial without fully disclosing it to the defendant. One proposed scenario involves excluding the defendant from certain trial portions while allowing their counsel to be present, which may violate the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Some courts allow procedures that do not require the defendant's physical presence during witness testimony, such as using depositions instead of live testimony. In cases involving national security concerns, courts may allow the use of depositions or video conferences for witness testimony when witnesses are beyond subpoena power. The Fourth Circuit in United States v. Abu Ali permitted video conferences for a defendant to observe witnesses being deposed in Saudi Arabia, citing national security as an important public policy justifying the use of such procedures. The Criminal Justice Information Act (CIPA) allows for protective orders to prevent disclosure of classified information to the defendant by defense counsel in order to protect national security interests. Admissibility of classified information is determined at a pretrial hearing, where the government may seek to redact or substitute classified information. In the context of classified information in legal proceedings, substitutions or redacted versions may be used, with the adequacy of these determined in an adversarial proceeding. Rule 505 of the Military Rules of Evidence governs the use of classified information in courts-martial, where the convening authority may decide to dismiss charges rather than disclose classified information to protect national security interests. In legal proceedings involving classified information, the military judge may order an in camera proceeding to determine the admissibility of evidence. The judge can issue a protective order to prevent disclosure of classified evidence. If classified information is not provided and would prejudice the accused, charges may be dismissed. Military commissions allow introduction of evidence while protecting sources and methods. In legal proceedings, a detainee may be excluded from an in camera hearing to handle classified information. The detainee's defense counsel can argue for release of information on their behalf. Military commissions may be challenged for not providing sufficient opportunity to contest evidence. The use of ex parte evidence in military proceedings may be challenged if it precludes the accused from contesting its reliability. Classified intelligence evidence may be admissible if it has guarantees of trustworthiness. The policy of detaining suspected belligerents at Guantanamo has faced international and domestic criticism for treatment and limited detainee access. Criticism of Guantanamo's treatment of detainees and limited access to federal courts is debated. Defenders argue for secure detention away from the battlefield for suspected belligerents. The Obama Administration has tried to close the facility but faced obstacles from congressional enactments. The closure of the Guantanamo detention facility may raise complex legal issues if detainees are transferred to the United States, including differences in constitutional protections and potential immigration consequences. Detainees could face criminal charges in federal trial courts, courts-martial system, or military commissions, each with varying procedural protections and types of offenses. The closure of the Guantanamo detention facility may lead to legal debates over the constitutional rights of detainees and the fairness of military commissions for trying war crimes. There is discretion in choosing the trial forum, but legislative actions could restrict this. The closure has broad implications for U.S. detention policy and the rights of enemy belligerents. The closure of the Guantanamo detention facility may have long-term consequences for U.S. detention policy in conflicts with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as future armed conflicts."
