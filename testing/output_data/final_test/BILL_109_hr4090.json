    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Whatever It Takes to Rebuild Act, Part II\". It includes findings. Congress finds that major disasters, including natural disasters and those caused by terrorist acts, lead to economic decline and reduced tax collections by State and local governments in affected areas. A report by the Government Accountability Office confirmed significant tax revenue losses in New York City and the State of New York following the 2001 terrorist attack. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on State and local tax revenues is also noted. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on State and local tax revenues is believed to be extensive. The President may provide loans to local governments under the community disaster loan program if they suffer substantial revenue losses due to a major disaster. Repayment of these loans may be canceled if post-disaster revenues are insufficient to cover the operating budget. The Community Disaster Loan program provides financial assistance to local governments facing revenue losses and expenses after a major disaster. Loans may be forgiven if post-disaster revenues cannot cover the operating budget. The program has a $5,000,000 limit for loans related to major disasters, established by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The $5,000,000 loan limit under the Community Disaster Loan program is seen as unfair for heavily populated areas like New York City and areas severely affected by disasters like Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. In October 2005, New Orleans had to lay off 3,000 city employees due to reduced tax revenues post-Katrina. Congress then passed the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005 to provide assistance to local governments recovering from major disasters. The Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005 provided $1 billion for loans to communities affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita, waived the $5 million loan limit, and prohibited loan forgiveness. Repayment forgiveness has been common under the Stafford Act, but this Act prohibits it. The Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005 provided $1 billion for loans to communities affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita, waived the $5 million loan limit, and prohibited loan forgiveness for the first time. The Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005, which provided $1 billion for loans to communities affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita, is repealed. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include State or local government eligibility for assistance. The maximum amount of assistance is now based on need and shall not exceed $5,000,000. Additionally, a new section is added for Incidents of National Significance, outlining loan terms for states or local governments facing substantial revenue loss due to a major disaster deemed an incident of national significance. The amendments to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act allow for State and local government eligibility for assistance in incidents of national significance. Loans provided under this amendment are not subject to interest or principal payments, and the maximum amount of assistance is based on need, not exceeding $5,000,000. These changes apply to major disasters occurring on or after August 24, 2005. Authorization of appropriations is provided for community disaster loans to State and local governments. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act amendments allow State and local governments to receive assistance in incidents of national significance. Loans provided are interest-free and not subject to principal payments, with a maximum assistance of $5,000,000 based on need. Authorization of appropriations is provided for community disaster loans to State and local governments affected by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita, totaling $1,000,000,000 and additional necessary funds."
