    "content": "The \"Economic Growth and Debt Reduction Act\" aims to balance the Federal budget by 2002, monitor direct spending programs, and use windfall revenues for economic growth through lower taxes. It also establishes targets for direct spending and revenue. The \"Economic Growth and Debt Reduction Act\" establishes direct spending and revenue targets for fiscal years 1998 through 2002, based on total outlays and revenue amounts provided in the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998. Additionally, the President is required to conduct an annual review of direct spending and receipts. The President must provide an annual review of direct spending and receipts in each budget submission, including information on total outlays for covered programs and any excess revenues. Additionally, the \"Economic Growth Protection\" section is established. The Office of Management and Budget will include revenue changes as deficit decreases in required reports. Any excess revenues can only be offset by legislation decreasing revenues. Additionally, the President must provide a special direct spending message annually. The President must include a special direct spending message in the budget if actual outlays exceed targets or are projected to do so. The message should analyze the variance and include recommendations to eliminate overages. The President's direct spending message must include a special resolution implementing recommendations through reconciliation directives for changes in laws within House and Senate jurisdictions. SEC. 6. REQUIRED RESPONSE BY CONGRESS. In order to consider a budget resolution, the House and Senate must fully eliminate any overage in the President's report through reconciliation directives. The Senate can waive or suspend this requirement with a three-fifths majority vote. Appeals in the Senate related to this section are limited to 1 hour and require a three-fifths majority vote. In the Senate, a three-fifths majority vote is needed to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section. The Act excludes reductions in outlays or revenues from budget enforcement procedures under certain acts. For minor overages, specific procedures may not apply. The Act applies to fiscal years 1998-2002 and expires at the end of 2002."
