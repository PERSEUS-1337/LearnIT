    "content": "Proposals to limit Senate debate have been ongoing throughout the Senate's history. The most significant procedure was the adoption of the cloture rule in 1917, allowing for the end of discussion with a supermajority vote. Since then, there have been continuous proposals to repeal or amend the rule, sparking debates on the Senate's tradition of free and unlimited debate. The cloture rule in the Senate has been a subject of debate regarding its potential impact on the body's ability to make changes to its rules. Senators have used various tactics to try to change Rule XXII, including seeking opinions on its constitutionality and attempting to invoke cloture by majority vote. The cloture rule in the Senate has been a subject of debate regarding its constitutionality and amendments over the years. Changes to Rule XXII have been made through six amendments since its enactment in 1917, expanding its reach to include nominations, motions to proceed, and motions to consider changes in Senate rules. The threshold for invoking cloture was lowered in 1975 from two-thirds to three-fifths of the full Senate. In 1975, cloture threshold in the Senate was lowered from two-thirds to three-fifths of the full Senate. Amendments to Rule XXII in subsequent years included changes to reading aloud amendments after cloture, adding a \"consideration cap\" to prevent post-cloture filibusters, and reducing the consideration cap from 100 hours to 30 hours in 1986. The current form of Rule XXII requires a cloture motion to be signed by 16 Senators and presented on the Senate floor. The Senate cloture process requires a yea-and-nay vote with three-fifths of Senators needed for approval. If cloture is invoked, final action must be taken within 30 hours. Amending Senate rules requires a two-thirds majority vote. Once cloture is invoked, the matter remains pending with each Senator limited to one hour of speaking time. After cloture is invoked in the Senate, no dilatory amendments or motions are allowed, and all debate and amendments must be relevant. Senators can only propose amendments filed before the cloture vote, and a limit of two amendments per Senator is imposed until all Senators have had a chance to do the same. Printed amendments available for 24 hours are not read aloud. Time for votes, quorum calls, and other actions is counted towards the 30-hour limit on consideration, which can be extended by joint leadership motion. Supporters of extended debate in the Senate believe in safeguarding minority rights against the majority's power. They argue that obstruction is sometimes necessary to prevent the majority from restricting minority rights until a broad political consensus is reached. They emphasize that the Senate's structure was designed to protect smaller states' rights, and diminishing minority rights would go against this intent. Supporters of extended debate in the Senate argue that the tradition of debate has historically protected different political parties and allows for vital deliberation. They believe that the Senate's unique ability for any Senator to speak at length on any topic plays a crucial role in the legislative process, as intended by the framers of the Constitution. They contend that removing this deliberative function would diminish the Senate's significance compared to the House of Representatives. The Senate's role as a check on the executive branch through nominations and treaties may be compromised if debate restrictions are implemented. Supporters of limiting debate argue that it is undemocratic to allow a minority to obstruct the majority's will. They believe that extended debate wastes time and money, undermines public accountability, and gives too much power to the minority. Supporters of changing debate rules argue that extended debate wastes time and money, delays important legislation and nominations, and brings public disrepute to the Senate. They propose limiting debate to allow for discussion but not block action if a majority supports it. Proponents of additional limitations focus on the benefits of an up or down vote. The Senate has considered changes to cloture rules in the past, with renewed concern in recent Congresses over the impact of extended debate on the Senate's capacity. Senators are concerned about extended debate affecting the Senate's efficiency. Proposals to change Senate rules are grouped into categories based on procedural mechanisms or goals. One category suggests a non-rule-based method for rule changes, while another focuses on altering the vote threshold for cloture. Another group of proposals aims to reduce the time spent on the cloture process. The third group of proposals aims to reduce the time spent on the cloture process in the Senate. This includes limiting debate on specific questions and increasing procedural burdens on those opposing an end to debate. The Senate considers itself a \"continuing body\" due to overlapping terms and the majority of Senators continuing their service without interruption. The Senate is considered a \"continuing body\" due to overlapping terms and the majority of Senators continuing their service without interruption. This principle implies that Senate rules apply across Congresses without needing to be readopted. The Senate did not readopt its rules at the beginning of the 2nd Congress, and standing rules changes are made within the framework of existing rules and precedents. In 1959, the Senate explicitly incorporated this understanding into the standing rules. The Senate rules are considered \"entrenched\" and continue from one Congress to the next unless changed. Changing the rules may require a supermajority or a departure from existing procedures. There has been discussion of a \"nuclear\" option to end debate and vote in recent Congresses. Supporters of a potential \"constitutional option\" argue that the Senate could change the rules to allow cloture to be invoked by a simple majority vote, bypassing the existing provisions of Rule XXII. This approach could end debate and bring pending business to a vote if a majority vote sustains the decision. Some Senators refer to the \"constitutional option\" as a way to address filibusters on judicial nominations. The focus in past Congresses was on nominations, seen as a Senate duty. The proposals aim to allow a simple majority vote to end debate and bring pending business to a vote. Some proposals in the Senate aim to change rules to address debatable questions, potentially altering the Senate's character and comity. These actions have been labeled as \"nuclear\" due to their potential to bypass existing rules and precedents. Critics argue that such changes could make the Senate more like the House of Representatives, where a majority can end debate at any time. Some Vice Presidents have offered advisory opinions that the Senate's Rule XXII can be changed by a majority vote at the start of a Congress. In 1975, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller submitted a ruling to this effect, which was later reversed by the Senate. The reversal raised questions about the precedent for cloture by majority vote. Senator Robert C. Byrd noted that the reversal erased the precedent established two weeks prior, reaffirming the 'continuous' nature of Senate rules. The cloture rule in the Senate has been subject to changes, with the voting threshold currently set at three-fifths of the full Senate. Some have proposed lowering this threshold to three-fifths of those present and voting. Senator Walter F. Mondale highlighted the significance of a Vice President and a clear majority of the Senate establishing the Senate's right to adopt its own rules at the start of a new Congress by majority vote. The proposal aims to lower the number of votes needed to invoke cloture in the Senate by changing the voting threshold to three-fifths of those present and voting. Another suggestion is to allow multiple cloture votes with a decreasing threshold in each successive vote, giving a determined simple majority the opportunity to eventually pass their desired legislation. The proposal aims to change the cloture process in the Senate by lowering the voting threshold to three-fifths of those present and voting. This change would apply to all matters, including legislation, and could lead to multiple cloture votes with decreasing thresholds, allowing a simple majority to eventually pass their desired legislation. The proposal seeks to change Rule XXII in the Senate to allow a simple majority to invoke cloture on the first attempt, arguing that the existing process provides ample time for deliberation and debate. Opponents argue that the complexity of legislation often requires more time for careful deliberation and negotiation. Some proposals aim to lower the voting threshold for cloture in specific circumstances, such as confirming nominees. Advocates argue for deference to the President's nominations, suggesting a lower threshold for executive branch nominees only. Other proposals aim to reduce strict party polarization in filibusters by requiring a vote threshold of less than three-fifths for cloture in certain situations. Some proposals suggest lowering the cloture voting threshold to less than three-fifths in specific circumstances, such as confirming nominees, to reduce party polarization in filibusters. This could shorten the time-consuming cloture process and allow for more efficient Senate floor consideration of matters. Some proposals aim to streamline the cloture process in the Senate by reducing the two-day layover period or allowing the majority leader to move for an immediate vote on cloture. Other suggestions include creating a non-debatable motion after a cloture motion or reducing floor time after cloture has been invoked. Some recent proposals seek to streamline the cloture process in the Senate by limiting post-cloture consideration of nominations and motions to proceed. This includes implementing a two-hour post-cloture debate limit or allowing the majority leader to move for an immediate vote if no one speaks during the 30-hour post-cloture debate. Other suggestions involve altering the existing non-debatable motion in Rule XXII to reduce the 30-hour post-cloture period. Some proposals aim to streamline the cloture process in the Senate by limiting post-cloture debate on nominations and motions to proceed. This includes suggestions like a two-hour post-cloture debate limit or allowing the majority leader to call for an immediate vote if there is no speech during the 30-hour post-cloture debate. Other ideas involve changing the non-debatable motion in Rule XXII to shorten the 30-hour post-cloture period. One way to expedite Senate action is by reducing the time spent on the motion to proceed, which could help avoid lengthy cloture processes. This change would not eliminate opponents' ability to block measures through extended debate and cloture requirements. Reducing the time spent on the motion to proceed in the Senate could expedite action and avoid lengthy cloture processes. Changing Senate rules to make some motions to proceed non-debatable could significantly impact the time spent on each matter considered. Other proposals include limiting debate on motions to proceed without eliminating it entirely. The Senate could expedite action by reducing time spent on motions to proceed through non-debatable motions or limiting debate to a certain number of hours. Supporters argue that establishing a new non-debatable motion or setting a majority threshold for debate could help make decisions on a case-by-case basis. This could provide a faster way of bringing measures to the floor. The Senate could expedite action by reducing time spent on motions to proceed through non-debatable motions or limiting debate to a certain number of hours. This could provide a faster way of bringing measures to the floor and arranging to send a measure to conference with the House. The Senate may seek to expedite action by allowing motions to proceed through non-debatable motions or limiting debate time. Some Senators propose amending rules to combine motions for arranging a conference committee, potentially reducing the need for multiple cloture processes. The Senate may expedite action by using amendment exchange to resolve differences with the House, potentially limiting opposition to a conference. Another proposal aims to reduce the need for multiple cloture processes on the same policy proposal. The Senate often invokes cloture twice on bills due to the application of certain amending principles, particularly when considering a substitute amendment that may contain non-germane provisions. This process is necessary to prevent the substitute amendment from falling as non-germane once cloture is invoked on the bill. Some propose avoiding the double cloture process by limiting debate on an underlying bill once an amendment in the nature of a substitute is agreed to. This would save time as the pending text does not differ from the substitute. Another suggestion is to broaden the scope of Senate Rule XIX to restrict debate in certain circumstances. The proposal is to broaden Senate Rule XIX to limit debate on \"executive business\" like treaties and nominations. Currently, Senators can speak twice on each question, allowing for potential obstruction. The Senate may not amend nominations and cannot attach conditions to their confirmation. Senate precedents would need reinterpretation to apply the two-speech rule to executive business, specifically nominations. Time in the Senate is measured in legislative days, triggered by adjournment. The Senate measures time in legislative days triggered by adjournment, which can span multiple calendar days. This can impact the application of rules like the two-speech rule for Senators. The Senate measures time in legislative days triggered by adjournment, which can span multiple calendar days. The two-speech limitation for Senators applies differently to executive business, only restricting speeches on a calendar day. Changing this rule for executive business may require a Senate rule change or a ruling from the chair endorsed by a Senate vote. The Senate is considering a rule change known as the two-speech rule for executive business, which may require a Senate rule change or a ruling endorsed by a Senate vote. This rule could potentially allow a majority of the Senate to eventually reach a final vote on a nomination, but there are concerns about the mechanics and costs associated with implementing it. The Senate is discussing changes to cloture rules to address the costs of filibustering. Proposals aim to speed up cloture motions and require Senators to hold the floor to prevent final action on a question. Proposals to change cloture rules aim to speed up the process by requiring Senators to stay close to the floor to prevent the majority leader from shortening the layover period. The proposals also suggest limiting post-cloture debate time on nominations and motions to proceed, and allowing the presiding officer to rule out dilatory motions and quorum calls after a cloture motion is filed. Proposals aim to make it harder for opponents to use routine quorum calls to delay proceedings by linking them to a \"snap\" vote. If a quorum call is not lifted in time, a majority of Senators must be present to keep the Senate in session. Some proposals suggest linking routine quorum calls to a \"snap\" vote to prevent opponents from easily delaying proceedings in the Senate. This would trigger an automatic vote on invoking cloture if a quorum call were to \"go live,\" potentially shortening the time spent on cloture motions. Additionally, the proposals aim to address rules that allow opponents to delay or prevent a vote with relative ease. Some proposals aim to address rules that allow opponents to delay or prevent a vote with ease by creating an \"extended debate\" session after a majority vote to invoke cloture. This session would require opponents to speak to prevent a vote, limit quorum calls, and allow the majority leader to postpone votes during the extended debate session. Some proposals seek to increase the procedural burden on opponents of cloture by changing the voting threshold, making it dependent on the number of Senators voting against it. One proposal suggests cloture be invoked by a simple majority if less than 41% of the Senate votes against it, while another proposes cloture be invoked by a simple majority unless two-fifths of the Senate votes against it. This contrasts with the current rule requiring three-fifths of Senators to invoke cloture, allowing 41 Senators to prevent it by not voting. Some proposals aim to change the operation of cloture by altering the voting threshold, while others focus on enforcing existing rules more vigorously. Additionally, the use of \"holds\" and proposals to delay or sunset rules changes have been discussed. Various Senate rules and precedents could also be used to limit debate in certain situations. Some proposals aim to change cloture rules by adjusting voting thresholds or enforcing existing rules more strictly. Other ideas include using \"holds\" to delay rule changes and utilizing Senate rules to limit debate in specific cases. One suggestion involves limiting Senators to two speeches on pending business each night, with potential challenges in record-keeping and defining a \"speech.\" Another tool allows the presiding officer to move the pending question without further discussion if no Senator seeks recognition. The presiding officer can move the pending question without further discussion in the Senate to expedite proceedings, potentially leading to extended sessions and increased enforcement of rules to limit debate. Currently, there is no general germaneness requirement for amendments in the Senate, except in the post-cloture period. Debate must be relevant to the measure or matter before the Senate for the first three hours of debate each calendar day. The ability of a Senator to speak freely on any topic for as long as they want is a key feature of the Senate, making changes to this practice unlikely. Holds in the Senate are notifications by Senators to their floor leaders of an intent to object to the consideration of a business item, with their effectiveness depending on Senate rules that allow unlimited debate on most questions. The Senate's effectiveness in limiting holds is challenging due to rules allowing unlimited debate, making it difficult to regulate holds without amending Rule XXII. Holds often signal a filibuster threat, prompting proposals to expedite consideration and address extended debate effects. Recent efforts to establish procedures for holds have been made in the Senate. In the 110th and 111th Congress, efforts were made to establish procedures for regulating holds, with proposals to address limitations and enhance transparency, but no agreements were reached. Efforts to establish procedures for regulating holds in the Senate have been ongoing, with proposals introduced in multiple Congresses. One such proposal, S.Res. 28, was adopted in January 2011, setting a new process triggered by an objection to proceeding to a measure. The impact of holds on cloture processes should be considered in the context of proposals to change cloture operations in the Senate. Some Senators are concerned about limited amending opportunities in the Senate, particularly when the majority leader \"fills the amendment tree\" to restrict additional amendments. This can impact cloture operations and lead to objections to unanimous consent requests for more amendments. These concerns are linked to the ability of bill managers to negotiate packages of cleared amendments. Some Senators are concerned about limited amending opportunities in the Senate, especially when the majority leader restricts additional amendments. This can impact cloture operations and lead to objections to unanimous consent requests for more amendments. Proposals to change the operation of cloture aim to address the challenges Senators face in the floor amending process. Proposals to change cloture operations aim to address concerns about limited amending opportunities in the Senate. Some suggest guaranteeing each party a set number of amendments to alleviate uncertainty and potential delays in considering matters. Another proposal allows Senators to offer germane amendments with majority agreement, even when not in order. Concerns arise about potential advantages to one party with changes to cloture procedures. Many supporters propose changes to cloture procedures to address concerns about limited amending opportunities in the Senate. Suggestions include making changes effective in the future or for a short period to assess any unintended consequences. However, opponents view these proposals as potentially benefiting the present majority party. Some changes may not require altering Senate standing rules, relying instead on changes in Senate practices. Some proposals to change Senate practices do not require altering standing rules but may involve a series of steps on the Senate floor. Changes to standing rules can be made through a simple resolution or a statutory measure. Once a resolution is on the Calendar of Business, it can be brought before the Senate by unanimous consent or a debatable motion. Rules changes may require a cloture process to end debate and allow for a final vote on adoption. The Senate's Rule XXII requires a two-thirds threshold for cloture on a proposal to change standing rules, making it challenging to amend Senate rules. Senate procedures are also governed by the Constitution, standing orders, statutes like the Congressional Budget Act, and practice, allowing for changes through mechanisms other than Rule XXII. The Senate's Rule XXII requires a two-thirds threshold for cloture on a proposal to change standing rules. Options to amend Senate rules could still be subject to a three-fifths threshold to end debate, or require House and potentially presidential approval for enactment."
