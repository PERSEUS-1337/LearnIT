    "content": "Nigeria is a key power in Africa due to its size, political and economic role. It has surpassed South Africa as Africa's largest economy and is a major source of high-quality crude oil. Lagos, its commercial center, is one of the world's largest cities. With the fastest-growing population globally, Nigeria is projected to reach 410 million by 2050, becoming the world's third-most populous country. Despite having one of Africa's largest militaries and contributing to peace operations, poor governance and corruption have hindered infrastructure development and economic growth, leaving much of the country in poverty. Nigeria faces challenges in service delivery, economic growth, and poverty. It has a high HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis burden. The country is ethnically diverse, with the Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo being politically active. Religious tensions exist between Muslims in the north and Christians in the south. Ethnic and religious conflicts, fueled by politicians, have led to thousands of deaths. Boko Haram, a violent Islamist group, is a significant threat. The violent Islamist group Boko Haram has significantly worsened security conditions in Nigeria's northeast since 2009. It aims to establish an Islamic state in the region, leading to thousands of deaths and a humanitarian crisis with 2 million displaced people. Boko Haram was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2013, and its pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015 raised concerns about their operational ties. In 2016, a Boko Haram leadership dispute led to the emergence of a splinter group, Islamic State-West Africa (IS-WA), designated as an FTO in 2018. In the Niger Delta region, local grievances related to oil production have fueled conflict and criminality for decades. Government negotiations and an amnesty program have calmed the region, but attacks on oil installations surged in 2016. Some militants are involved in criminal activities like maritime piracy and drug trafficking, overlapping with oil theft networks. These activities contribute to instability in the Gulf of Guinea. The Gulf of Guinea has seen a rise in piracy and attacks on ships. Nigeria faces sociopolitical tensions ahead of elections, with protests in the Igbo-dominated southeast. Separatist sentiment exists among some Igbo, stemming from a historical civil war. Economic frustration is widespread, but most Igbo do not support insurrection. Cameroon faces a conflict in border regions, leading to displacement of over 30,000 people. In neighboring Cameroon, over 30,000 Cameroonians have sought refuge in Nigeria due to an emerging conflict in border regions. In Nigeria's Middle Belt, violent competition for resources between nomadic herders and settled farming communities, exacerbated by ethnic and religious divisions, is spreading into southern states. Nigeria, a federal republic with 36 states, gained independence from the UK in 1960 and has a political structure similar to the US. Herder-farmer tensions in Nigeria are fueled by desertification, access to weapons, land-grabbing, and banditry. Nigeria gained independence from the UK in 1960 and has a federal republic with 36 states. The country transitioned from military to civilian rule in 1999, with subsequent elections marred by flaws. The power struggle between the north and south stems from colonial administrative divisions. Since 1999, there has been a de facto power-sharing arrangement in Nigeria. Since 1999, Nigeria has had a power-sharing arrangement known as \"zoning\" between its geopolitical zones for the presidency. The death of President Obasanjo's successor, Yar'Adua, and the ascension of Jonathan, a southerner, raised questions about the zoning system. Jonathan's decision to run in the 2011 elections led to violence as many northerners saw it as a violation of the arrangement. The 2015 elections were highly competitive, resulting in Jonathan and the ruling party losing to a new opposition coalition led by Buhari. In 2015, Nigeria's incumbent president, Jonathan, lost to a new opposition coalition led by Buhari. The All Progressives Congress (APC) capitalized on popular frustration with insecurity, economic pressures, and state corruption to win. Decreased turnout for the PDP was linked to discontent with the government's response to the Boko Haram threat. The U.S. government viewed the elections positively, citing Nigeria's commitment to democratic principles. There were concerns about potential political violence around the polls. President Buhari's popularity in the 2015 elections was notable, given his history. A Muslim from Katsina state in northern Nigeria, Buhari had struggled to gain votes in the south but joined with other opposition parties to form the APC coalition. His vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, is an ethnic Yoruba Pentecostal pastor and former state attorney general. Osinbajo is widely respected and served as Acting President during Buhari's medical treatment in London in 2017. President Buhari's silence on his undisclosed medical condition raised concerns about his fitness for office ahead of the 2019 elections. The ruling APC's prospects are uncertain, with Buhari facing criticism from prominent figures like former President Obasanjo. Buhari will run against Atiku Abubakar, a former ally who defected to the PDP and promises to revive Nigeria's economy. This will be Abubakar's fourth attempt at the presidency. Atiku Abubakar, a former ally of President Buhari, has defected to the PDP and pledged to revive Nigeria's struggling economy. Analysts expect the 2019 election to be closely fought, with Abubakar potentially splitting the northern vote. Several high-profile defections have occurred, causing rifts between political parties and hindering the government's ability to address pressing challenges. In July 2018, a joint preelection assessment by NDI and IRI praised INEC's efforts to reinforce electoral integrity but noted public concerns about vote buying and illegal voting in Nigeria. INEC has taken steps to enable marginalized voters to cast their ballots, including those displaced by conflicts. In December 2018, concerns were raised about the credibility of the 2019 polls in Nigeria due to potential threats such as attacks on the legitimacy of INEC, intimidation by security forces, electoral violence, and exclusion of certain groups from voting. President Buhari's suspension of the chief justice just before the election also drew criticism for its impact on the judiciary's role in resolving election disputes. Observers are concerned about potential election-related violence in Nigeria, particularly in subnational contests for gubernatorial and state legislative seats. The International Crisis Group has identified six states as vulnerable to violence due to political importance and social conflicts. Nigeria's security forces are stretched thin, with allegations of politicians stoking divisions and concerns about partisanship among security officials. The International Crisis Group has raised concerns about potential election-related violence in Nigeria, particularly in subnational contests. Nigeria's diverse population, with a large Muslim community, faces issues of sharia law enforcement and ethnic, regional, and religious divisions fueled by politicians. In some areas, hisbah groups enforce sharia-based rulings with state support, contributing to social tensions. In Nigeria's Middle Belt, violence between nomadic Fulani herdsmen and settled farming communities, mostly Christian, has escalated in recent years. The International Crisis Group estimates that herder-farmer clashes claimed around 2,000 lives annually from 2011-2016, increasing to 2,500 deaths in 2016. Amnesty International reports over 2,000 deaths from herder-farmer violence in the first ten months of 2018, blaming the Nigerian government for failing to address the issue and allowing a cycle of violence to persist. The use of sophisticated weapons and the emergence of ethnic militias have contributed to the recent surge in violence. The recent surge in violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt involves ethnic militias and community vigilante groups backed by local leaders. The violence is described as a competition for resources on ethno-religious lines in a country characterized by impunity and corruption. Farming expansion has decreased land for grazing, leading to religious undertones in the conflict. Attackers have targeted villages, churches, and mosques, spreading the conflict beyond the Middle Belt into southern states. The violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt has spread to southern states, affecting northern states like Zamfara as well. Clashes often occur between settled Hausa communities and pastoralist Fulani, both Muslim. President Buhari, an ethnic Fulani, has been accused of complicity in herder attacks. Anti-Shia Muslim sentiment has also increased, with reports of the Nigerian army killing hundreds of members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria in 2015. In Zaria, Kaduna State, the army was found responsible for a mass killing, leading to the arrest of 177 IMN members. Zakzaky, a key figure, is among those facing murder charges. His supporters demand his release, resulting in clashes with security forces. In October 2018, soldiers used live fire to disperse IMN gatherings in Abuja, killing dozens. Nigeria's Shia population is estimated between 4 to 10 million. Separately, protests in the Igbo-dominated southeast have raised concerns about resurgent separatism. The Biafra War from 1967 to 1970 resulted in up to 2 million deaths. Igbo political grievances have increased under Buhari, leading to clashes and deaths of pro-Biafra demonstrators. Economic frustration and government's forceful response to separatist sentiments may escalate violence. Boko Haram, a deadly terrorist group since 2009, exploits grievances like intercommunal tensions, disparities in development, and corruption to recruit members. Boko Haram's rise in northeast Nigeria and northern Cameroon is fueled by popular frustration with elite corruption, erosion of traditional leaders' legitimacy, resource struggles over Lake Chad, and the group's narrative against Western education. Their ideology rejects Western influence, democracy, and pluralism. Boko Haram, a militant group in Nigeria, rejects Western influence, democracy, and pluralism. They have killed thousands of people since 2011, displaced millions, and abducted civilians, including schoolgirls. The group uses women and children as suicide bombers and launched a territorial offensive in 2014. Nigerian forces struggled to reverse their advances until regional forces intervened in 2015. Regional forces, led by Chad, launched a successful counteroffensive against Boko Haram in early 2015. The African Union-authorized Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF), supported by the U.S. and other donors, continues to reclaim territory from the militants. However, insecurity persists in northeastern Nigeria, Cameroon, and Niger due to corruption and mismanagement in the Nigerian security sector. The State Department has identified challenges in combating Boko Haram, including lack of coordination among Nigerian security agencies and slow judicial processes. The International Crisis Group calls for defense sector reform. Boko Haram poses a threat primarily in northern Nigeria and neighboring areas, as well as to international targets. Abubakar Shekau, the group's leader, has threatened the United States. Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, has threatened the United States, but no U.S. citizens have been harmed by the group. The group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, potentially increasing recruitment and funding. A breakaway faction led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi has been recognized by the Islamic State as the new leader of IS-WA, focusing attacks on security forces and government targets in Nigeria and Niger. The name \"Boko Haram\" is still commonly used to refer to both factions. The Barnawi-led faction, IS-WA, has approximately 3,500 fighters and was responsible for the 2018 kidnapping of schoolgirls in Dapchi. They have also carried out devastating attacks on Nigerian military bases, resulting in a high death toll and damaging morale. Both Boko Haram and IS-WA have been designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The State Department designated Boko Haram and Ansaru as terrorist groups in 2013, with Boko Haram also added to the U.N. Al Qaeda sanctions list in 2014. Several individuals linked to Boko Haram were designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), including Shekau, with a reward offered for information on his location. The British government also designated both groups as terrorist organizations. In December 2015, two senior Boko Haram leaders were designated as SDGTs by the State Department, followed by the addition of IS-WA leader Barnawi in February 2018. Nigeria's oil wealth has led to political tension, protests, and criminal activities in the Niger Delta region, where most of the country's oil is produced. The region faces low social indicators and high unemployment rates, with millions of barrels of oil spilled causing damage to the ecosystem and livelihoods of the Delta's inhabitants. The United Nations Environment Program estimated it could take 25 to 30 years to clean up Ogoniland, prompting a $1 billion restoration program in 2017. Local grievances related to oil production have fueled conflict and criminality in the region for years. The resurgence of militant activity in Nigeria's oil-producing region in 2016 led to a 30-year low in production and an economic recession. President Buhari's decision to end the amnesty program for former militants sparked renewed violence, but after extending the program and increasing its budget, peace returned in mid-2017. However, ex-militants still threaten to resume attacks, and long-term solutions to the violence remain undeveloped. Some former Delta militants have utilized the amnesty program to enter politics, while others are involved in criminal activities like piracy and arms trafficking. These activities contribute to piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Nigerian military and police face accusations of human rights abuses, with little accountability from the government. The Nigerian military and police are accused of human rights abuses in detention facilities, including sexual exploitation and abuse, looting, and destruction of property. Few perpetrators are prosecuted, leading to little accountability. Major incidents include a massacre of over 640 people in 2014 and a bombing raid on an IDP camp in 2017. These abuses have complicated U.S. efforts for counterterrorism cooperation. The Nigerian military has been accused of human rights violations, including a deadly air raid in Adamawa state and crackdowns on civil society. In December 2018, the military suspended UNICEF activities citing national security concerns, but later revoked the ban. They also threatened to prohibit Amnesty International operations. In January 2019, military personnel raided the Daily Trust offices for reporting on a military operation in the northeast. Rights monitors have documented serious abuses by the paramilitary Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in Nigeria, which emerged to combat the Boko Haram insurgency. The government may struggle to demobilize the CJTF, with some members possibly being integrated into the military or police. Corruption in Nigeria is widespread and hampers development, with estimates of billions lost to corruption in various sectors and levels of government. Nigerian officials took $4.6 billion in bribes in 2016. International firms implicated in bribery scandals. Nigeria known for cybercrimes, including \"419 scams.\" Analysts highlight \"security votes\" as vulnerable to embezzlement, totaling over $670 million annually. Buhari Administration expanded discretionary accounts before 2019 polls. Nigeria ranked 148th on Corruption Perception Index in 2017. Oil and gas industries major sources of corruption. The oil and gas industries are at the core of corruption in Nigeria, with billions of dollars expropriated by political and military leaders. Former dictator Sani Abacha stole over $3.5 billion, much of it from the oil sector. Some funds have been repatriated, but others remain frozen abroad. Abacha assets totaling $1.2 billion have been returned to Nigeria, with $480 million forfeited by the U.S. DOJ in 2014 and $321 million restituted by Switzerland in 2017. Efforts are ongoing to secure the return of an additional $500 million in looted funds. Efforts to repatriate over $500 million of looted funds from Nigeria are underway with assistance from other governments. Central bank governor Lamido Sanusi raised concerns about $20 billion in unaccounted NNPC revenue due to corrupt practices. Former Minister of Petroleum Resources Diezani Alison-Madueke is under investigation for corruption, with an arrest warrant issued by the EFCC in December 2018. The U.S. DOJ also filed a civil complaint related to global corruption inquiries in 2017. The UK global corruption inquiry involves the forfeiture of $144 million in assets linked to corrupt oil dealings by Alison-Madueke. Nigeria's petroleum industry faces structural challenges, including corruption risks in DSDP contracts and lack of oversight in NNPC operations. Investigations into bribery in the oil industry continue. Investigations are ongoing into bribes related to the 2011 purchase of a license for OPL 245 by Eni and Royal Dutch Shell. The scandal has led to lawsuits and an Italian court sentencing two intermediaries to prison. Global Witness estimates that the sale of OPL 245 may have cost the Nigerian government $6 billion in revenue. The Buhari Administration is working to increase transparency in the oil industry, while the EFCC is investigating alleged corruption during the Jonathan government, targeting individuals like Alison-Madueke and Colonel Sambo Dasuki for embezzlement. Former National Security Advisor Colonel Sambo Dasuki is accused of embezzling over $2 billion through fraudulent security sector procurements. Acting EFCC Chairman Ibrahim Magu has probed allegations against ruling party members, including former APC governors. Despite Nigeria being a major crude oil exporter, it imported up to 90% of gasoline for domestic use in 2017. The government aims to increase refining capacity to stop oil imports by 2020. The government has granted permits for new refineries, but Nigeria's domestic gasoline subsidy has deterred foreign investors. President Jonathan cut the subsidy in 2011, leading to protests and a partial reinstatement. Public scrutiny has revealed possible misappropriation of subsidy funds. Calls for elimination persist despite the subsidy remaining in place. President Buhari has pledged to reform the oil and gas industry by reintroducing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to increase transparency, attract investors, and create jobs. The subsidy on domestic gasoline in Nigeria is costing over $2 million per day, leading to calls for its elimination from international financial institutions. The subsidy hampers growth as gains in revenue from global oil price increases are offset by rising subsidy costs. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding the PIB has deterred investment in the industry. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) has faced regulatory uncertainty, leading lawmakers to split it into four bills for faster passage. The first bill, the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB), aims to restructure the NNPC for better transparency. Efforts to reform the NNPC have been welcomed, but significant pushback from elites benefiting from the current system is expected. Previous administrations in Nigeria have made commitments to economic reform, with some success in lessening the impact of global economic crises through conservative policies. The 2008-2009 global economic crisis impacted Nigeria's economy, leading to the government using funds from the Excess Crude Account to stimulate recovery. President Jonathan later replaced the ECA with a sovereign wealth fund. Due to oil price slumps, Nigeria resorted to borrowing from international sources, including a $2.38 billion loan in 2015 for salaries and the budget. Under Buhari, engagement with international financial institutions increased, with the World Bank approving $2.1 billion in loans for electricity access, nutrition, and development. The Buhari Administration in Nigeria has made significant strides in strengthening the business environment and improving governance. Reforms have focused on shifting spending towards capital investment, expanding the social safety net, and stimulating the economy through increased public expenditure. The IMF has praised Buhari's Economic Growth and Recovery Plan for driving diversification, job creation, and macroeconomic stability. Despite a decline in Nigeria's external debt to GDP ratio, public debt remains sensitive to fluctuations. Nigeria's external debt to GDP ratio is sensitive to oil sales and currency exchange rates. Despite its oil wealth, the country has high poverty levels, with over 87 million people living in extreme poverty. Access to water and sanitation is limited, and Nigeria ranks low on the Human Development Index. Economic mismanagement and corruption have hindered investment in education and social services. Nigeria has faced challenges like instability and corruption, hindering investment in education and social services. Despite this, the country has made progress in public health, containing Ebola in 2014 and working towards eradicating polio. Successes include reducing malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV prevalence among pregnant women. Nigeria has a relatively low HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate but has the largest HIV-positive population after South Africa. Malaria remains the leading cause of death in the country. In 2014, Nigeria announced the rebasing of its economy, now the largest in Africa, with a GDP ranking 30th in the world. The economy is diversified, with contributions from mining, services, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors. Despite challenges like poor infrastructure and electricity shortages, the economy rebounded in 2018 with a 1.9% growth. The IMF forecasts a 2.0% growth in 2019, with oil production being a significant factor. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries estimated Nigeria's crude oil production at 1.72 million barrels per day in 2018, up from 1.66 million in 2017 but below levels seen in 2010-2015. Insecurity, such as vandalism by oil thieves, poses a threat to output. China has significantly invested in Nigeria's economy, with projects like the 700MW Zungeru hydropower plant. Chinese investments and contracts in Nigeria totaled $8 billion in 2018, making Nigeria the largest recipient of Chinese investment in sub-Saharan Africa. Consortium developing $1.3 billion project in Nigeria with Chinese funding. China involved in Mambilla hydropower project, aiming for 3,000MW energy output. Nigeria is a significant trading partner with the U.S., with $9 billion two-way trade in 2017. Opportunities for U.S. exports to Nigeria and West Africa are promising. Nigeria's exports, particularly petroleum products, are significant in the West Africa region. The country benefits from trade advantages under AGOA, with over 90% of exports to the U.S. being petroleum products. Nigeria's Gulf of Guinea crude is valued for its low sulphur content, making it attractive to U.S. interests. While the U.S. was once a major importer of Nigerian oil, purchases have decreased since 2012. India is now the largest importer of Nigerian crude. China offers favorable loans for oil exploration rights in Nigeria, posing competition for U.S. energy companies. The U.S. Export-Import Bank supports power generation reforms in Nigeria. U.S.-Nigeria relations have improved since the 1990s, with diplomatic engagement focused on human rights and governance issues. Nigeria is a partner country in USAID's Power Africa initiative to increase electricity connections and power generation in Africa by 2030. Bilateral relations between the U.S. and Nigeria have been influenced by concerns over human rights, governance, and corruption issues. The establishment of the U.S.-Nigeria Binational Commission in 2010 aimed to address mutual concerns. President Buhari's election in 2015 improved relations strained by U.S. criticisms of the previous administration. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship, with President Trump's call to President Buhari in 2017 highlighting continued engagement. President Buhari was the first sub-Saharan leader to visit the Trump White House in April 2018, where President Trump praised Nigeria's security efforts and called for improved commercial ties. The U.S.-Nigeria Commercial and Investment Dialogue was launched by the Commerce Department in November 2017, focusing on infrastructure, agriculture, digital economy, investment, and regulatory reform. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan outlined security cooperation, economic growth, and democracy as key goals of U.S.-Nigerian relations during the 2017 meeting of the BNC.

The U.S. is focused on increasing trade and investment in Nigeria, highlighting the importance of free and fair elections. Concerns were raised about intimidation and vote-buying during the 2018 gubernatorial elections. The U.S. maintains diplomatic presence in Nigeria and promotes American culture through \"American Corners\" in libraries across the country. Travel advisory for U.S. citizens notes risks of armed attacks in certain regions of Nigeria. Nigeria faces risks of armed attacks in the Niger Delta and northeast, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, and travel warnings for Borno, Yobe, and northern Adamawa states. The U.S. has provided security assistance to enhance Nigeria's peacekeeping capabilities and coordinates on maritime security due to Nigeria's strategic position. Nigeria is a hub for maritime piracy, narcotics trafficking, and criminal organizations. The U.S. Navy has increased operations in the Gulf of Guinea and launched the African Partnership Station in 2007. The U.S. Navy increased operations in the Gulf of Guinea and launched the African Partnership Station in 2007. Bilateral counterterrorism cooperation with Nigeria has increased, and Nigeria has coordinated with various U.S. agencies to strengthen its security systems. Nigeria is also a participant in the State Department's Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership. The U.S. has increased counterterrorism efforts in the region, primarily through engagement with Nigeria's neighbors and support for the Multinational Joint Task Force. Concerns have been raised about human rights abuses by security services in Nigeria, leading to the blocking of a helicopter sale in 2014. In 2014, the U.S. blocked the sale of Cobra helicopters from Israel to Nigeria due to human rights concerns. The Obama Administration later approved the sale of Super Tucano A-29 aircraft, but it was suspended after a Nigerian jet struck an IDP camp in 2017. The Trump Administration revisited and approved the $345 million sale in December 2017. President Trump downplayed previous concerns during Buhari's 2018 visit to the White House. Buhari faced domestic pressure over the purchase, including withdrawing $900 million from Nigeria's Excess Crude Account without parliamentary approval. The Super Tucanos are expected to be completed by May 2024. According to the contract award, work on the Super Tucanos is expected to be completed in May 2024. Nigerian officials are sensitive to perceived U.S. interference in internal affairs and have sometimes rejected military training offers. President Buhari pledged to uphold the rule of law and address human rights abuses. Observers question the government's commitment to holding senior commanders accountable for abuses. Nigeria is a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance in Africa, with an average of over $450 million annually provided by the United States. The State Department's FY2019 Congressional Budget Justification outlines assistance to Nigeria focusing on strengthening democratic governance, increasing agricultural productivity, expanding basic services, and promoting economic growth through private sector partnerships. U.S. initiatives in Nigeria include programs for AIDS relief, malaria prevention, agriculture, trade, and energy.
