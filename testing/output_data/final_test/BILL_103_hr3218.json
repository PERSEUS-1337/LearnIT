Definitions for the terms \"agency\" and \"employee\" are provided in this section, with specific exclusions mentioned for certain entities. In order to assist in restructuring the Federal workforce and minimize involuntary separations, the head of an agency may pay a voluntary separation incentive to eligible employees under specific retirement systems or with disabilities. The agency head can designate a 90-day period for employees to separate from service through retirement or resignation, with the separation date no later than September 30, 1994. Employees may continue in service beyond the 90-day period if necessary for the agency's mission, up to 2 years. A voluntary separation incentive is provided to eligible employees to assist in restructuring the Federal workforce and minimize involuntary separations. The voluntary separation incentive payment is a lump sum given to eligible employees after separation, capped at $25,000 or the amount under section 5595(c) of title 5, United States Code. It does not affect other government benefits or severance pay calculations and is funded from available appropriations. An employee who receives a voluntary separation incentive and then accepts a job with the US government within 2 years must repay the full amount of the incentive. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management can waive this repayment requirement for positions in Executive agencies. The repayment for employment in difficult-to-recruit positions may be waived by the head of the entity or appointing official in the legislative branch, and by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in the judicial branch. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management can create necessary regulations for this Act. Employees of the judicial branch can participate in a program established by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Congress suggests reducing one full-time equivalent position in the executive branch for every two employees who receive voluntary separation incentives under this Act. Agencies should adjust their employment levels accordingly. SEC. 4. COORDINATION WITH OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW. Defense Agencies: Employees who receive separation pay under this section and accept employment with the Government of the United States within 2 years must repay the entire amount to the defense agency. Repayment may be waived for positions with exceptional difficulty in recruitment. Employees in the legislative branch may have their repayment waived if their position is hard to fill. The same applies to employees in the judicial branch. For the Central Intelligence Agency, employees who receive separation pay and join the government within 2 years must repay the amount, unless their position is difficult to fill. Employees in the legislative and judicial branches may have their repayment of separation pay waived if their position is hard to fill. For the Central Intelligence Agency, employees who rejoin the government within 2 years must repay the separation pay unless their position is difficult to fill. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts may waive repayment if the position is hard to fill. SEC. 5. Additional agency contributions to the retirement fund require agencies to remit 9 percent of the final rate of basic pay for employees retiring under section 8336(d). This amendment applies to retirements occurring after the enactment of this Act."
