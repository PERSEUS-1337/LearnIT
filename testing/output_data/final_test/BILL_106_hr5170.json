    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Common Sense Marriage Tax Relief Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that in 1999, 48% of joint tax returns incurred a marriage tax penalty, 41% received a marriage tax bonus, and 11% were unaffected. The average marriage tax penalty was $1,141 per couple. There are 66 provisions in the tax code that treat married couples differently from single filers. Married working women earn 60% of their husband's salary on average, with a 73% wage gap between women and men. The wage gap between women and men is significant, with Caucasian women at 73%, African-American women at 63%, and Hispanic women at 53%. Around 40% of married mothers in the US stay at home to raise children full-time. The tax code is biased against secondary earners, mostly women, due to progressive marginal rates. Once income exceeds the earned income tax credit threshold, individuals lose the benefit, impacting newly married couples disproportionately. Marriage penalty relief is addressed in Section 3. The standard deduction under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the deduction amount. Additionally, the amendment addresses the deduction in determining minimum tax. The standard deduction is amended to increase the deduction amount under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Technical amendments are made to certain sections of the Code, including adjustments to the earned income credit. The earned income credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to reduce the marriage penalty by increasing the phaseout amount for joint returns by $2,500 ($2,000 for taxable years starting in 2001). This amount is subject to inflation adjustments for taxable years after 2002. The text chunk discusses adjustments to the earned income credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, including the cost-of-living adjustment for the taxable year and the rounding of any increase to the next lowest multiple of $50. Additionally, it mentions the repeal of the reduction of refundable tax credits in subsections of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000. SEC. 4. Tax reductions tied to Social Security and Medicare solvency certifications. The Act specifies that no provision shall take effect until there is a social security certification, a medicare certification, and a public debt elimination certification. The social security solvency certification ensures actuarial balance until 2050 for the Social Security Trust Funds, while the medicare solvency certification ensures the same for the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be in actuarial balance until 2030. A public debt elimination certification is required for the national debt to be eliminated by 2013, taking into account tax reductions."
