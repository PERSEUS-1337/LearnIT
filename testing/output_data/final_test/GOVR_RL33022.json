This is based on the federal government's trust responsibility for Indian tribes, derived from various legal sources. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health services to about 1.8 million eligible Indians from federally recognized tribes, regardless of their ability to pay. Congress has a moral obligation, not a legal one, to provide Indian health care. The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that IHS is under an obligation to provide any specific health program to Indians. The report discusses IHS appropriations, statutory authorities, and legislative issues, including the reauthorization of appropriations in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). The federal government's delivery of health services to Indians has evolved over more than a century. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is a rural health care delivery system with regional area offices and local service units. It serves federal reservations, Indian communities in Oklahoma and California, and communities in Alaska. Service units cover all counties in the national IHS service area. The distribution of IHS service areas aligns with federal Indian reservations and communities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides a variety of medical services in five states, serving every county in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. They offer inpatient, ambulatory, emergency, dental, public health nursing, and preventive health care without a defined medical benefit package. Special focus is given to Indian health problems like maternal and child health, fetal alcohol syndrome, diabetes, hepatitis B, alcoholism, and mental health. Services are provided directly by IHS, tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, and private providers through contracts. Currently, many service units and health facilities are managed by Indian tribes and tribal organizations through self-determination contracts and compacts with the Indian Health Service. 81% of IHS-funded health facilities are operated by tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Additionally, health services are purchased through contracts with over 2,000 private providers. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds health facilities operated by tribes and tribal organizations through self-determination contracts. Health services are also purchased through contracts with private providers in areas known as \"contract health service delivery areas\" (CHSDAs). IHS also funds urban Indian health projects (UIHPs) serving urban Indians living in IHS's urban service areas. The IHS funds construction, equipping, and maintenance of health facilities for tribes and urban Indian health projects. Tribes may operate these facilities under self-determination contracts. Since 1960, the IHS has funded water supply, sewage, and waste disposal systems. About 12% of AI/AN homes lack safe drinking water compared to 1% of all U.S. homes. Improved access to sanitation facilities has led to an 80% reduction in gastrointestinal disease among AI/AN since 1973, according to the IHS. However, the IHS faces challenges in providing all needed care due to funding limitations, resulting in some services being \"rationed\" based on medical need. Services vary depending on financial resources, personnel, and facilities available in each area served by the IHS. The Indian Health Service (IHS) faces challenges in providing all needed care due to funding limitations and shortages in medical personnel. Job vacancy rates in January 2008 were high for dentists, nurses, physicians, optometrists, and pharmacists. Eligible individuals for IHS services are members of federally recognized tribes living on or near federal Indian reservations or in traditional Indian communities. Eligible Indians for Indian Health Service (IHS) services include those of Indian descent living in IHS health service delivery areas, on tax-exempt land, actively participating in tribal affairs, or meeting other relevant criteria. Urban Indian health programs funded by IHS may serve a wider range of eligible persons, including members of terminated or state-recognized tribes. Non-Indian women pregnant with an eligible Indian's child are also eligible for care during pregnancy and postpartum period. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides care during pregnancy and postpartum for eligible Indians and non-Indian women pregnant with an eligible Indian's child. IHS services are mainly for federally recognized tribes, but some states recognize Indian groups not acknowledged by the federal government. Tribal membership is determined by descent from a tribal roll, following paternal or maternal bloodlines, with some tribes requiring specific genealogical percentages for membership. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides care for eligible Indians and non-Indian women during pregnancy and postpartum. Tribal membership is determined by descent, with some tribes requiring specific genealogical percentages for membership. Congress has set membership criteria for a few tribes, while IHS estimates its service population based on census data and adjusts for birth and death rates. The Indian Health Service (IHS) estimates its service population based on self-identification as AI/AN by race, not tribal membership. Not all AI/AN counted by the census are eligible for IHS services. The IHS also estimates its \"user population\" based on registered AI/AN patients who used IHS-funded services in the past three years. The BIA publishes biennial estimates of its service population, covering only persons on or near reservations. The BIA lists tribes' enrollment totals but does not confirm figures with a census. Urban Indian population eligibility for UIHP services is uncertain. UIHPs serve a wider range of eligible persons, including terminated or state-recognized tribes. BIA figures do not help determine the urban UIHP population due to data limitations. The Census Bureau data on Indians does not provide information on tribal membership, but it does offer useful approximations of the population that IHS serves. Most AI/AN live outside reservations, with a majority residing in urban areas identified by the census. Urban areas within CHSDAs are included in these figures. The IHS service population in urban areas has historically had higher mortality rates compared to the general U.S. population. Disparities in mortality rates have decreased in recent years for certain conditions, but Indians still have significantly higher death rates from alcoholism, tuberculosis, diabetes, and accidents. American Indians and Alaska Natives have a lower likelihood of dying from heart disease and cancer. Their life expectancy is 2.4 years less than the general U.S. population. They have higher mortality rates for leading causes of death related to alcohol abuse, including accidents, suicide, and homicide. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is increasing among this population, particularly among young adults. Diabetes mortality is significantly higher in American Indians and Alaska Natives compared to the general U.S. population. Diabetes mortality is 3.1 times higher in American Indians and Alaska Natives than in the general U.S. population. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) was established in 1997 to address this issue, providing funding for diabetes programs in 318 AI/AN communities. This funding has improved patient care, education, and prevention programs to delay the onset of diabetes. The SDPI program has successfully increased the percentage of Indian diabetics maintaining blood sugar control. Other health incidents related to diabetes have also decreased, such as kidney disease and retinopathy. Additionally, there are programs promoting the message that AI/AN individuals can reduce the risk of heart attacks or strokes by controlling their blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. IHS funding is divided into health services, facilities, collections (reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance), and SDPI. Budget authority for health services and facilities, along with collections and SDPI, make up IHS's program-level funding. Funding details for FY2000-FY2008 are shown in Table 4, with the administration's request for FY2009. Trends in budget authority and program-level funding for FY1994-FY2008 are depicted in Figure 2. Indians are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and IHS can collect reimbursements from these sources. Collections funding for the Indian Health Service has increased from 9% in FY1995 to 18% in FY2007, with most reimbursements coming from Medicaid and Medicare. Medicaid payments accounted for 71% of collections in FY2003, falling slightly to 69% in FY2007. Overall, Medicaid and Medicare collections make up to 50% of hospital and clinic operating budgets. States receive 100% federal reimbursement for Medicaid services provided to eligible Indians through IHS or tribal facilities. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act created the IHS's Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) by transferring $30 million annually from SCHIP to fund SDPI. In 2000, the funding was increased to $100 million annually, with $30 million from SCHIP and $70 million from the general Treasury for FY2001-FY2002. The funding was extended to $150 million annually for FY2004-FY2008. The annual funding for SDPI was increased to $150 million and extended to FY2004-FY2008. Legislation in the 110th Congress would raise the annual SDPI appropriation to $200 million and extend it to FY2013. Groups supporting Indian health care argue that IHS per capita expenditures are lower than other federal health-related programs. For example, in FY1997, IHS's per capita expenditures were $1,430 compared to $3,489 for the Bureau of Prisons and $5,458 for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In FY2006, IHS per capita expenditures rose to $1,664, while VA's rose to $5,799. A study showed disparities in personal medical services between IHS and mainstream health care systems, comparing different federal health programs. The study was produced by a tribal-IHS workgroup and compared to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The latest FDI study compared IHS health services to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP), finding that $3,753 per AI/AN would be needed for comparable coverage. IHS appropriations in FY2004 would need to be $3.97 billion for FEHBP-level coverage, with an additional $1.7 billion needed to bridge the gap. IHS funding for health services is mainly based on historical patterns of recurring base funding with annual adjustments to maintain current service levels. Increases above the base funding are allocated using formulas developed in consultation with tribes. Some programs are allocated solely by formulas, such as facility maintenance and certain grants. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funding is primarily based on historical base funding, leading to disparities in funding levels among different service units and areas. In FY2004, 61% of operating units were funded at or below 60% of need, while 18% were funded at over 80% of need. These internal funding disparities have been a long-standing issue within the IHS. The Indian Health Service (IHS) has long struggled with inequitable funding allocations, leading to disparities among different service areas. Various attempts have been made by the IHS and Congress to address the issue, including the establishment of equity funds. However, these funds were insufficient to significantly impact allocation disparities, with major methodology problems also hindering progress. Congress established a permanent equity fund in 1988 to address these challenges. The Indian Health Service (IHS) established the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF) in 1988 to address funding disparities among service areas. The Fund uses the Facility Determination Index (FDI) methodology to allocate additional funding to units in need. Congress also implemented a \"hold harmless\" provision in 1988 to prevent funding reductions of 5% or more from the previous year without proper reporting. Urban Indian health programs are included in the FDI calculations to address funding disparities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) uses the Facility Determination Index (FDI) methodology to allocate funding for urban Indian health programs. Funding shortfalls have been identified in various service areas such as facilities maintenance, replacement of biomedical equipment, sanitation facilities, and health professions scholarships. Congress has enacted statutes to provide health services to American Indians/Alaska Natives, with the IHS administering funds and policies. The Indian Health Service (IHS) administers funds and policies under various statutes, including the annual Indian appropriations acts. The act provides authorization for federal Indian programs, including health conservation. Congress passed this act in 1921 to address the lack of specific statutory authorizations for Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) activities developed after the Civil War. Indian appropriations authority was moved to the Appropriations Committee in 1920, making it vulnerable to procedural objections due to the absence of authorizing acts. The Snyder Act was passed to authorize various Indian programs, including health care, by transferring responsibility from the BIA to the PHS. This act also allows tribes to manage their health care services through negotiations. Tribes can manage their health care services through self-determination contracts with IHS, transferring funds and control for specific programs. Congress amended ISDEAA to allow tribes to consolidate contracts into self-governance compacts, giving them authority to redesign programs and reallocate funds. The Tribal Self-Governance Amendments in 2000 made the IHS self-governance program permanent, authorizing direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurers. It also grants funding to urban Indian organizations for health care services and various programs. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) was last fully reauthorized in 1992, extending authorizations through FY2000 and later through FY2001. The act made permanent a demonstration program for direct billing of Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors by Indian tribes and health organizations. This program resulted in increased collections, reduced billing time, improved tracking, and lowered administrative costs. Multiple committees have jurisdiction over legislation affecting the Indian Health Service. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) was last fully reauthorized in 1992, extending authorizations through FY2000 and later through FY2001. Legislation amending an existing statute is likely to be referred to committees with jurisdiction over the original legislation. The Natural Resources Committee holds major jurisdiction over Native American issues, Indian health care legislation, and self-governance. The Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over public health care, health facilities legislation, and programs like Medicaid, Medicare Part B, and SCHIP. The Ways and Means Committee has exclusive jurisdiction over Medicare Part A. Bills to reauthorize IHCIA have been referred to multiple committees for consideration of relevant provisions. Recent IHCIA reauthorization bills include a provision to elevate the IHS director to the level of an assistant secretary within HHS. The Committee on Indian Affairs holds jurisdiction over Senate legislation relating to Indians, while the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee oversees public health matters. The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP. Senate IHCIA reauthorization bills have been referred to the Indian Affairs Committee in recent congresses. In the 109th and 110th Congresses, bills related to provisions in the Social Security Act added by IHCIA were referred to the Finance Committee. IHS, part of HHS, receives annual appropriations from the Interior and Environment subcommittees. The 110th Congress will debate the reauthorization of IHCIA and related amendments to the SSA. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) reauthorization has been under consideration since 1999. Negotiations among Indian health proponents, HHS agencies, other departments, the Administration, and congressional committees have led to changes in bills from one Congress to the next. In the 110th Congress, the Senate's IHCIA reauthorization bill, S. 1200, was introduced on April 24, 2007, and reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on October 16, 2007. The House IHCIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 1328, was introduced on March 6, 2007. The House bill H.R. 1328, introduced on March 6, 2007, was referred to multiple committees for review and amendments. The bill was reported with amendments by the Natural Resources Committee on April 25, 2007. The Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings and marked up the bill on November 7, 2007. A Senate bill, S. 2532, addressing IHCIA-related amendments to the SSA, was also reported in September 2007. The House bill H.R. 1328 and Senate bill S. 1200 were introduced in the 110th Congress but did not come to a vote. No IHCIA reauthorization bill has been introduced in the 111th Congress. The House bill H.R. 1328 and Senate bill S. 1200 in the 110th Congress contained health-related titles. Title I of each bill reauthorized IHCIA's eight titles and made technical amendments. Title II included amendments to the SSA, with additional sections added by the Senate. The Senate also added a Title III apologizing for U.S. Indian policy. The Senate bill S. 1200 and House bill H.R. 1328 propose significant changes to Indian policy, expanding the roles of tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations in decision-making. They aim to improve behavioral health services, create a construction priority system for health facilities, authorize long-term and hospice care, exempt Indians from Medicaid and SCHIP premiums, allow urban Indian health programs to receive reimbursements, and establish a commission to enhance Indian health care delivery. The bills S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 propose changes to Indian policy, consolidating provisions and appropriations authorizations. The bills aim to improve Indian health care delivery and address various issues such as mental health and third-party reimbursements. The House Health Subcommittee made changes to H.R. 1328, and the Administration issued a statement on S. 1200 during the Senate's consideration. The Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on S. 1200 objected to several items and threatened a veto over a provision related to the Davis-Bacon Act Application. The bills proposed changes to Indian health care delivery, including expanding definitions of health promotion and disease prevention services. The bills propose expanding Indian health care delivery by including general activities like improving various environments and specific programs such as abuse prevention and community health. There are concerns about funding and capacity to provide all expanded services. New terms like \"Tribal Health Program\" and \"Indian Health Program\" are introduced for Indian health services managed by different entities. The Indian Health Program (IHP) includes programs administered by IHS, THPs, or tribes with HHS funding. The bills expand funding eligibility and authorize traditional Indian health care practices. No specific definition of traditional health care practices is provided in the current bills. The current bills do not define traditional health care practices, leading to objections from the SAP regarding liability issues. Title I of the bills focuses on personnel recruitment and scholarships to increase the number and skills of health professionals in the IHS. The bills also expand eligibility for training programs and retention bonuses for health professionals in IHP or UIO programs. Nursing school clinics are eliminated, and community college health training programs are restricted to accredited colleges nearby. Title I of the bills reauthorizes the Community Health Representative Program and the Community Health Aide/Practitioner (CHAP) program in Alaska, allowing them to provide health care services to Indian communities, especially in rural areas. The bills also introduce a national CHAP program and mention the Alaska Dental Health Aide Therapist Program, aiming to provide dental care to remote Alaskan villages. The bill reauthorizes the CHAP program in Alaska to train dental health aide therapists to provide dental care in remote Alaskan villages. The American Dental Association opposes this expansion, citing concerns about the quality of care and potential extension of the program to other states. Skilled dental therapists are needed to address dental challenges in remote villages. Supporters of the dental health aide therapist program argue that specially trained therapists could help solve many dental problems. Currently, Alaska CHAP dental health aide therapists receive training abroad due to the lack of U.S. programs. The bills would allow the program to continue in Alaska but restrict therapists outside the state. They would also limit the procedures therapists can perform without dentist certification. A study of the program would be conducted by a neutral panel. The health aide therapist program, conducted by a panel of clinicians, economists, community practitioners, oral epidemiologists, and Alaska Natives, would assess the quality of dental services and report to Congress and the HHS Secretary. The bills reorganize health programs, moving mental health provisions to a new \"behavioral health\" title and shifting third-party reimbursements to Title IV. The provisions in Title IV of the health services title of the IHCIA broaden the range of health care services authorized for IHS to provide, address funding inequities, establish a Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund, enhance diabetes prevention and treatment, create an Office of Indian Men's Health, include oral health and youth programs in Indian school health education, combine CHSDAs in North and South Dakota, and require the establishment of an epidemiological center in every IHS service area. The IHS is establishing an epidemiological center in every service area. The IHCIA authorizes a feasibility study for hospice care and home- and community-based care for Indians. Concerns have been raised about the standards and eligibility for these services. H.R. 1328 requires conformance with accepted standards for care. The IHS is establishing an epidemiological center in every service area and authorizing a feasibility study for hospice care and home- and community-based care for Indians. H.R. 1328 requires conformance with accepted standards for care, while S. 1200 specifies that assisted living and home- and community-based services must meet applicable standards. Both bills define services through definitions and eligibility criteria for long-term care. The Administration's SAP objects to currently ineligible persons becoming eligible for IHS-funded services and opposes the expansion to new services. S. 1200 authorizes funding for \"convenient care services\" programs, providing primary health care services outside regular hours. Both S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 aim to screen eligible Indians for diabetes and reduce its incidence. The bills aim to reduce the incidence of diabetes among eligible Indians by authorizing funding for diabetes prevention programs, establishing dialysis programs, and requiring the Secretary to consult with Tribal Health Programs to track diabetes cases. Additionally, the bills authorize the establishment of a diabetes control officer in each IHS area office. The bills authorize funding for diabetes prevention programs, establish dialysis programs, and require consultation with Tribal Health Programs to track diabetes cases. They also propose establishing a diabetes control officer in each IHS area office and extending licensing exemptions to THP-employed health professionals. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 limits the exemption to licensed health professionals and services provided in THP facilities. New provisions include financial and technical assistance for tribes to establish utility organizations for sanitation facilities, emergency IHS assistance, and a feasibility study for a new health-facility construction loan fund. The current bills propose new provisions such as authority for THPs to set rents on staff quarters, IHS accepting funding for health care facility construction from various sources, and a requirement for a feasibility study for a new health-facility construction loan fund for tribes and TOs. Additionally, there is a provision to prevent facility closures based on outdated reports by requiring impact reports to be submitted no more than two years in advance. Another new requirement is for the Secretary to develop a priority system for health-care facility construction. The bills propose retaining current priority levels for top projects in various facility categories to avoid penalizing slow-rising projects. They require consultation with tribes, TOs, and UIOs for innovative approaches to meeting facility needs, including an \"area distribution fund\" in S. 1200. Section 305 of S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 propose amendments to grants for tribes and TOs to construct or modernize small ambulatory care facilities. The changes include reducing minimum service-population size, changing minimum user-population size to a minimum number of visits, and expanding exemptions for facilities on islands or road systems without direct access to inpatient hospitals. The bills also allow grants to be used for reducing tribal or TO debt incurred for facility construction or modernization. The House Health Subcommittee's version of H.R. 1328 includes a set-aside for grants to Indian communities below a minimum size. S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 propose amendments for grants to Indian communities for constructing or modernizing small ambulatory care facilities. S. 1200 defines convenient care services and authorizes demonstration grants for these services. H.R. 1328 adds new authority for using appropriations for sanitation facility construction. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 removes authorization for tribal loans from sanitation-facilities appropriations. Both bills prohibit using IHS funds for sanitation facilities in new homes funded by HUD. The goal is for HUD to fund sanitation facilities for new homes, allowing IHS funds to upgrade existing Indian homes. The Davis-Bacon Act requires prevailing wages in construction contracts funded by federal government. IHCIA applies Davis-Bacon to facility construction with Title III funds. ISDEAA exempts tribes from Davis-Bacon if they use own employees. Critics argue it increases costs, while proponents say it prevents unfair competition. Both bills retain Davis-Bacon application. The Senate-reported version of S. 1200 added exemptions from Davis-Bacon for tribes or TO carrying out projects with their own employees or contracting with ISDEAA funds. The January 2008 Statement of Administration Policy objected to this provision, and it was replaced with current law. Earlier versions of IHCIA reauthorization expanded negotiated rulemaking for IHS facilities. The Administration objected to the requirements for negotiated rulemaking in IHS-tribal joint ventures and facility construction priorities. S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 have dropped most of these requirements, except for determining the renovation cost threshold through negotiated rulemaking. The current bills consolidate provisions covering reimbursements from third parties, including SSA's Medicare and Medicaid programs, into Title II and Title IV of the IHCIA. Several programs are moved from other titles of current law, with new provisions added. Jurisdiction over Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP in the Senate is assigned to the Finance Committee. In the reauthorization bills, provisions amending the SSA were separated from the IHCIA and placed in a distinct part of the bills. This separation aimed to reduce confusion and clarify the amendments made to the Social Security Act. The revised IHCIA provisions would change the status of tribes and Tribal Organizations. Several revised IHCIA provisions would alter the status of tribes and Tribal Organizations in relation to federal health care programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP. Changes include adding UIOs and SCHIP to exclude Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements from annual Indian health appropriations. Additionally, a special fund administered by the HHS Secretary would now include payments from any SSA program, not just Medicaid reimbursements. The special fund administered by the HHS Secretary now includes payments from any SSA program, not just Medicaid reimbursements. Section 401(c) of the bills increases the proportion of reimbursement going to the service unit providing health services to 100%. Allowable uses of the reimbursement funds are broadened to address health resource deficiencies in tribes served. The House Health Subcommittee version limits SSA programs contributing to the fund to Medicare and Medicaid, with allowable uses focused on improving facility services. The Act of 2000 amended the IHCIA to allow THPs to directly bill Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors for services. Reimbursements go to the THP, not a special fund. THPs must be approved by HHS and report annually. IHCIA Section 401(d) gives THPs direct billing authority without HHS approval, monitoring, or reports. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 expands the programs covered to include SCHIP and limits the allowable uses to compliance expenditures and increasing the capacity, quality, and accessibility of services. HHS objects to expanding the allowable uses beyond meeting CMS program requirements. IHCIA Section 402 of the bills expands grants to TOs for outreach to include SCHIP enrollment and grants to UIOs. H.R. 1328 requires HHS to facilitate agreements between states, IHS, tribes, TOs, and UIOs. S. 1200 and the House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 change this requirement to developing best practices for agreements. The current IHCIA law allows the United States, tribes, and Tribal Organizations (TOs) to recover \"reasonable expenses incurred\" for providing health services through civil actions. The proposed bills expand this right to Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) and change it to \"reasonable charges billed.\" Concerns have been raised that this change may allow responsible third parties to argue they are not liable if no charges have been billed by Indian Health Programs (IHPs) for services to IHS-eligible persons. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 allows recovery of the highest amount the third party would pay for care by nongovernmental providers. A new provision in the bills, IHCIA Section 405, allows tribes, TOs, and UIOs to use federal health services funds and reimbursements to purchase health benefits coverage based on beneficiaries' financial need. S. 1200 allows purchase of coverage through high deductible or health savings account plans, while the House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 excludes purchase of coverage through high-deductible health plans. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 includes new provisions related to qualifying coverage as \"creditable coverage\" and authorizing agreements for sharing medical facilities with the VA and Defense Department. It also addresses reimbursement for services provided to beneficiaries eligible for VA or Defense services. The Administration's SAP objected to the reimbursement provision. S. 1200 adds a new section reaffirming goals from a 2003 memorandum. S. 1200 adds a new Section 407 reaffirming goals of a 2003 memorandum between IHS and VA regarding VA treatment of eligible Indian veterans at IHS facilities. It requires the HHS Secretary to provide payment for such treatment, establish guidelines, and prohibits use of funds for payments. It also authorizes local memoranda of understanding and defines \"eligible Indian veteran.\" H.R. 1328 does not have a similar provision. If an Indian is eligible for health care services under other programs, IHS may assist in enrollment and collect for services provided. The IHS serves as the payor of last resort for services not covered by other payment sources, including Medicaid, Medicare, SCHIP, and private insurance. New legislation broadens this designation to cover all services for eligible individuals, extending it to THPs and UIO health care programs. IHS-operated entities are exempt from state licensure requirements due to their federal status. The new legislation exempts IHS-operated entities from state licensure requirements, allowing them to be eligible for reimbursement from federal health care programs without needing to be licensed or recognized under state or local laws. Staff members without a required state or local license may still be eligible if they hold a valid license from another state. Payments are prohibited to entities or individuals excluded from federal health care programs or with suspended licenses. The bills exempt IHS-operated entities from state licensure requirements for federal health care program reimbursement. HHS opposes exempting tribal entities, arguing it may impact quality of care. The bills do not specify who determines compliance with standards or limit unlicensed staff. H.R. 1328 deletes sections related to this issue. The bills also require a study on treating the Navajo Nation as a state for Medicaid services. The study would assess the establishment of an entity for Medicaid and administrative expenditures for Indians within Navajo boundaries. New programs for urban Indians and a Division of Urban Indian Health are proposed. Funding for urban Indian health programs and residential treatment centers for urban Indian youth are also authorized. The bills propose grants for urban Indian health programs, including diabetes prevention, treatment, and control. They also provide access to the Community Health Representatives program and study the feasibility of federal loans for facility construction. The changes are effective immediately upon enactment. The bills propose grants for urban Indian health programs, including diabetes prevention, treatment, and control, with changes effective immediately upon enactment. The IHCIA extends eligibility for its urban Indian health program to various groups, including members of state recognized tribes, non-member descendants of tribes, and individuals who are Alaska Native or considered Indian by the Secretary of the Interior or HHS Secretary. None of the previous proposals such as extending FTCA protections to UIOs are included in S. 1200 or H.R. 1328. The urban Indian health program extends eligibility to various groups, including state-recognized tribes and Alaska Natives. The program's constitutionality has not been challenged, and proponents argue that it meets legal standards. The Department of Justice has raised concerns about the program's eligibility standards. The bills propose changes to the Indian Health Service (IHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services, including establishing a new position of Assistant Secretary of Indian Health. They also authorize contracts for enhancing information technology and require the automated management system to include a training component. Section 601 of the bills elevates the Director of IHS to the new Assistant Secretary of Indian Health, responsible for policy and budget matters related to Indian health. The bills propose changes to the Indian Health Service, including creating a new Assistant Secretary of Indian Health to oversee mental and behavioral health programs. This expansion aims to establish a comprehensive behavioral health prevention and treatment program, consolidating various programs and consulting with tribes on policy decisions. The bills propose a comprehensive continuum of behavioral health care, including outpatient and residential treatment, acute hospitalization, detoxification, emergency shelter, transitional living, and community-based services. It also mandates specific behavioral health services for Indian children, adults, families, and elders, expanding the current alcohol and substance abuse program to include behavioral health services. Tribes and Tribal Organizations are added to the authorization for treatment services under the Indian Health Service. The bills authorize HHS to provide inpatient mental health care facilities in each IHS service area, create a youth telemental health project for Indian youth suicide, expand alcohol and substance abuse programs to cover all behavioral health issues, and add diagnostic clinics and early intervention projects for fetal alcohol disorder. Tribes and Tribal Organizations can implement community education programs for behavioral health issues. The bills propose changes to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), including the establishment of treatment programs for child sexual abuse victims and perpetrators in every IHS service area. Additionally, tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations would become contractors for behavioral health research programs instead of the IHS. The bills also retain a \"Miscellaneous\" title with new programs and reporting requirements. The bills S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 propose changes to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, including expanding required reports on national health-care programs and adding SCHIP to accounting on reimbursements. They drop a provision for comparing Indian health appropriations with general population health status. H.R. 1328 also adds a report on compliance with credentialing and licensure requirements. The bills S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 propose changes to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, including expanding required reports on national health-care programs and adding SCHIP to accounting on reimbursements. They also increase instances where IHS must conduct negotiated rulemaking for regulations relating to health services, behavioral health, and health facilities. The Statement of Administration Policy objects to new report requirements, arguing they restrict HHS flexibility in delivering health care services. Section 313(c) and Section 807 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act allow discretionary rulemaking for various aspects such as human resources, facilities, reimbursements, and urban Indian health. Earlier versions of the reauthorization required negotiated rulemaking in more programs and set deadlines for publication of proposed and final regulations. The current IHCIA law includes restrictions on federal funding for abortion, known as \"Hyde Amendments,\" which apply to IHS funds expended by IHPs and UIHPs. The Administration opposed negotiated rulemaking requirements, arguing it was resource-intensive and unnecessary. The deadline for HHS authority to make IHCIA regulations is not included in H.R. 1328 or S. 1200. S. 1200 was amended on the Senate floor to add a provision that replaces the current law with language similar to the Hyde Amendment, with exceptions for rape, incest against a minor, and endangerment of the mother's life. This provision aims to make the Hyde Amendment permanent in its application to the Indian Health Service. The National Indian Health Board argues that the Indian Health Service already complies with the Hyde Amendment and should not be subject to different standards. H.R. 1328 retains the abortion provision in current law, while S. 1200 adds a provision postponing the application of a 1987 IHS regulation on health services eligibility. Section 811 of S. 1200 extends exemptions from the National Labor Relations Act to tribes and TOs with self-determination contracts or self-governance compacts. This exemption may apply to contracts with all federal agencies. Section 813 of S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 establish a national bipartisan commission on Indian health care delivery. A commission has been created to focus on Indian health care entitlement, to determine if health services can be provided to Indians under an entitlement program. Unlike entitlement programs like Medicaid and Medicare, the IHS health care delivery program is not guaranteed funding each year and depends on annual appropriations. One of the key issues in the IHCIA reauthorization bills is the challenge of making choices within the constraints of a finite annual appropriation. The debate revolves around the choices to be made within the constraints of annual appropriations for Indian health care services. Proponents argue for an entitlement program, citing the loss of land and resources as justification, which would not limit federal spending on eligible Indians' health care. Controls on entitlement programs could include reducing benefits, changing eligibility requirements, or generating new revenues. Some advocates are concerned about how a \"beneficiary\" would be defined and whether Congress would require \"means testing\" as part of the eligibility criteria for an entitlement program for Indian health care. Opponents argue that federal Indian treaties did not promise unlimited health care services to all Indians and question if the benefit package would cover non-clinical services currently provided by IHS. The commission authorized under S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 would make recommendations on Indian health care delivery and related issues. The Administration objected to the commission authorized under S. 1200 and H.R. 1328, arguing it was unnecessary as HHS and IHS continually strive to improve health care services for Indians. IHS is currently prohibited from charging eligible Indians for services, with Congress making this prohibition permanent in 1996. Additionally, IHS is forbidden from billing under ISDEAA and requiring tribes or TOs to do so. In 2008, a federal court ruled that IHS cannot deny a tribe's compact for charging Indians for services. The Senate amended S. 1200 to allow THPs operating under ISDEAA compacts to charge for services provided. The Senate amended S. 1200 to allow THPs operating under ISDEAA compacts to charge for services provided, including decisions on amounts, criteria, and programs. A membership dispute within the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma may restrict access to IHS funding and services based on revised membership criteria. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma faces a membership dispute regarding the exclusion of descendants from the Freedmen roll. The dispute centers on a 2007 amendment that limits tribal membership to those with Cherokee ancestry, leading to legal battles in both CNO and federal courts. An injunction temporarily reinstated Cherokee Freedmen's tribal membership, with ongoing legislative efforts to address the issue. Legislation (H.R. 2824, 110th Cong.) aims to sever the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's government-to-government relationship with the federal government and suspend their gaming rights until compliance with the 1866 treaty and restoration of Cherokee Freedmen's tribal membership. Amendments to House bills (H.R. 2786 and H.R. 3002) would also make the CNO ineligible for Indian housing and economic development programs pending compliance with the treaty. Cherokee Freedmen provision could restrict federal health funding for the CNO. The bill would place restrictions on federal health funding for the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma (CNO) similar to other bills. It includes amendments to various sections of the Social Security Act, distinguishing between Title II and IHCIA's Title IV. Section 1911 of the SSA, added by the 1976 IHCIA, pertains to IHS health facilities. Title II, Section 201(a) of the bill extends Medicaid eligibility to Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) and expands eligible entities to include IHS, tribes, Tribal Organizations (TOs), and UIOs, regardless of whether they are Indian Health Programs (IHPs). This change broadens the scope of eligible health services, facilities, and entities, despite objections from HHS regarding UIOs already being able to receive Medicaid reimbursements through states. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 limits Medicaid reimbursement eligibility to Indian Health Programs (IHPs) and removes Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) from eligibility. Amendments to SSA Section 1911 require reimbursements for benefits covered under state Medicaid waivers and plans. The new service delivery language is considered confusing and has been deleted. The provision in Section 1911 has been updated to include tribes, Tribal Organizations (TOs), and UIOs, extending the deadline for facilities to meet Medicaid requirements. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 removes Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) from Medicaid reimbursement eligibility and updates Section 1911 to include tribes, Tribal Organizations (TOs), and UIOs. HHS opposes the renewal of the requirement for facilities to make improvements in accordance with a plan to meet Medicaid conditions, arguing that current IHS and tribal facilities are already in compliance. The 1976 IHCIA amendment allows IHS health facilities, operated by IHS, tribes, or TOs, to be reimbursed by Medicare for coverable services, aligning with Medicaid amendments. HHS opposes including UIOs under Medicare law, arguing they are already eligible, and questions the need for specific language for IHS, tribes, and TOs. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 drops the addition of UIOs and limits eligibility for Medicare reimbursement to IHPs, renewing a provision for facilities to meet Medicare requirements within 18 months. HHS objects to this renewal and the House Health Subcommittee version removes the provision. Title II of the bills adds definitions for IHPs, aligning with Medicaid, and exempts IHS-operated or IHS-funded insurance programs from the SCHIP prohibition. Section 203(c) of Title II of the bills expands SSA Section 2105 to include tribes, TOs, and UIOs, allowing federal reimbursements for health care services. Section 201(c) amends SSA Section 2107 to align SCHIP with Medicaid provisions, extending eligibility to tribes, TOs, and UIOs for reimbursement and direct billing. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 includes amendments to SSA Section 1911, removing UIOs from SSA Section 2107. Title II of the bill aims to improve outreach and enrollment of Indians in Medicaid and SCHIP, encouraging states to provide enrollment services near Indian reservations. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 aims to improve outreach and enrollment of Indians in Medicaid and SCHIP by requiring HHS to facilitate cooperation with states, IHS, tribes, TOs, and UIOs. HHS objects to the mandate, preferring consultation over cooperation. HHS consults with states, IHS, tribes, TOs, and UIOs to develop best practices for agreements. The SSA sets a cap on outreach expenditures at 10% of federal payments for SCHIP benefits. Expenditures for outreach to Indian families are excluded from the cap, but HHS opposes this, fearing unlimited spending could expand federal reimbursements for Medicaid. States must meet requirements for federal reimbursement for Medicaid services. To receive federal reimbursement for Medicaid services, satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship and identity is required for all Medicaid applicants who claim to be U.S. citizens or nationals. Certain documents like U.S. passports, DHS certificates, state driver's licenses, or other HHS-approved documentation can be used to demonstrate citizenship and identity. Many Indian citizens, especially older ones, may lack standard documents like birth certificates or passports due to remote locations and poverty. Some Indian groups may have members who are not U.S. citizens due to being divided by international borders. Section 203(d) of Title II of the bills addresses these issues. Section 203(d) of Title II of the bills amends SSA's list of satisfactory documentation to include tribal membership documents as equivalent to U.S. passports for Medicaid citizenship and identity purposes. HHS is required to issue regulations for tribes with members who are not U.S. citizens, allowing the use of tribal documents until then. HHS opposes Section 203(d) as unworkable, arguing that existing regulations already address tribal members' citizenship. Some question the reliability of tribal membership documents for proving citizenship and identity. HHS accepts tribal documents for identity purposes if they include personal information, while DHS accepts them for citizenship and identity if they meet security standards. DHS plans to collaborate with tribes on developing secure tribal documents. S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 aim to improve tribal documentation compliance with security standards. S. 1200 includes requirements for border tribes with non-citizen members and exempts Indians from certain Medicaid charges. S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 aim to improve tribal documentation compliance with security standards. S. 1200 exempts Indians from certain Medicaid charges and excludes specific groups from eligibility for certain health programs and services. Section 204(a) prohibits Medicaid reimbursements to certain providers from being reduced by cost-sharing amounts. Definitions of Indian entities and contract health services are included in S. 1200, but not in the House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328. The draft provision in the House Energy and Commerce Committee's economic stimulus bill is similar to Section 204(a) of H.R. 1328, exempting Indians from Medicaid cost-sharing. However, it does not include definitions of Indian entities and contract health services like S. 1200 and H.R. 1328. Under current Medicaid law, cost-sharing is nominal or prohibited for many beneficiaries. The cost-sharing exemption in Section 204(a) of S. 1200 would increase federal Medicaid spending by $5 million in FY2008 and $74 million over FY2008-FY2017. Section 204(b) excludes certain Indian property from being considered in determining Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility. This includes real property and improvements within Indian reservations and former reservations in Oklahoma. Excluded from Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility determination are certain Indian properties within reservations, former reservations in Oklahoma, Alaska Native regions, and BIA-approved Indian allotments. This includes property of unique cultural significance or used for traditional lifestyles. The House Health Subcommittee version of Sec. 204(b) excludes Indian property from Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility determinations, with a provision similar to an economic stimulus bill in the 111th Congress. The Energy and Commerce Committee began marking up the draft stimulus bill with this provision on January 22, 2009. The House Health Subcommittee version of Sec. 204(b) excludes Indian property from Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility determinations, expanding the types of property excluded and requiring all states to exclude such property. CBO's cost estimates have not addressed any costs connected to the exclusions. Section 205 of Title II of the bills exempts IHS, tribal, TO, and UIO entities from state or local licensing for reimbursement eligibility. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 deletes Section 408 and Section 206 requires the Secretary to maintain a national Tribal Technical Advisory Group within CMS. It also authorizes states receiving Medicaid or SCHIP payments to establish a consultation process with IHPs and UIOs for healthcare services. Medicaid assistance is available within the state and consultation with federal and Indian entities is required before submitting any Medicaid plan amendments. Section 206 takes effect on October 1, 2009. An economic stimulus bill in the 111th Congress contains a provision similar to Sec. 205 of H.R. 1328. The Energy and Commerce Committee started marking up the draft stimulus bill on January 22, 2009. Current SSA, Title XI, includes an anti-kickback provision for criminal penalties related to referrals for services or purchases. The provision in Section 207(b) of Title II of S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 adds safe harbors from criminal prosecution for certain transactions involving Indian Health Programs, tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations. These transactions include transfers of inventory or supplies, staff, waiver of premiums or cost sharing, and the collection, transport, analysis, or interpretation of diagnostic specimens or test data. The safe harbor provision in Section 207(b) of S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 provides protection from criminal prosecution for certain transactions involving Indian Health Programs, tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations. This includes transfers of resources, staff, waivers of premiums or cost sharing, and other value transfers deemed appropriate by the HHS Secretary. The provision aims to ensure continuity of care and cost-effective operations within the Indian health system. HHS opposes the safe harbor provision in Section 207(b) of S. 1200 and H.R. 1328, questioning its purpose and effectiveness. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 replaces this provision with a requirement for the HHS Secretary to solicit proposals for safe harbors related to Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations. Medicaid services can be provided through managed care organizations or entities, allowing beneficiaries to enroll for care. Section 208 of the bills introduces changes for Indian health entities and Medicaid managed care, requiring non-Indian Medicaid managed care entities to allow IHS-eligible Indian enrollees to choose an \"Indian health care provider\" as their primary care provider. Additional requirements are placed on managed care entities with a significant percentage of Indian enrollees. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 introduces changes for Indian health entities and Medicaid managed care, including requirements for non-Indian Medicaid managed care entities to allow IHS-eligible Indian enrollees to choose an \"Indian health care provider\" as their primary care provider. It also adds rules regarding Indian Medicaid MCEs, such as offering agreements for Indian Medicaid MCEs to serve as the Medicaid or SCHIP MCE for eligible Indians. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 introduces special rules for Indian Medicaid MCEs, including enrollment restrictions, default enrollment of Indians, application of Medicaid solvency standards by HHS, exemption from certain state solvency standards, waiver of requirements for patients' advance directives, and modification of MCE marketing rules for culturally appropriate materials. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 removes the requirement for states to make agreements with Indian Medicaid MCEs and eliminates special rules for Indian Medicaid MCEs, except for enrollment restrictions. S. 1200 specifies that Section 208 becomes effective on October 1, 2009. HHS collaborated with Indian health care advocates on Section 208 but opposes mandating states to comply with it. Section 209 of Title II of S. 1200 and H.R. 1328 require the HHS Secretary to report annually to Congress on the enrollment and health status of Indians receiving SSA health benefits. The House Health Subcommittee version of H.R. 1328 removes the requirement for states to make agreements with Indian Medicaid MCEs and eliminates special rules for Indian Medicaid MCEs, except for enrollment restrictions. HHS opposes the provision for collecting data on benefits under each SSA health program, the health status of Indians, and compliance with CMS requirements, stating it would be burdensome. Congress has also considered other legislative initiatives impacting Indian health. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), the Indian Health Service (IHS) pays tribes contract support costs for administering IHS programs. These costs cover various expenses such as planning, start-up costs, direct costs like training, and indirect costs like overhead expenses. The funding for contract support costs is negotiated between tribes and IHS but is dependent on the availability of appropriations, which has been insufficient. Funding for tribal contract support costs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is insufficient, leading to tribes having to use program funds to cover the difference or forego administrative support. This results in less health treatment being offered at IHS-funded facilities, as argued by contracting and compacting tribes. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and the Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Nevada sued the United States over insufficient funding for tribal contract support costs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Despite winning their case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the issue of underfunding persists due to limitations set by Congress in appropriation acts. Indian communities face mental health and substance abuse issues at higher rates than the general population. Proposals to fully fund contract support costs for tribes include making them an entitlement, but critics argue it would be costly and could jeopardize funding for other programs. Bills introduced in Congress aimed to make these costs an entitlement for IHS and BIA contracts, but were not enacted. Alcohol is a significant risk factor for AI/AN youth, leading to accidents, suicide, and homicide. In 2002, alcohol was the primary substance abused among AI/AN. AI/AN are 6.5 times more likely to die from alcohol-related issues compared to the average American. Mental health and social problems account for a third of demands on Indian health facilities. AI/AN suffer a disproportionate burden of mental health issues compared to other ethnic groups in the US. The federal government offers mental health and substance abuse prevention programs for Indian tribes, but funding is limited and fragmented. Operating programs with multiple funding sources is not cost-effective due to small amounts and burdensome requirements. Legislation has been introduced in various Congresses to allow Indian tribes to consolidate federal substance abuse and mental health programs for administrative purposes. New legislation may be proposed to authorize tribal consolidation of funding for these programs. From 1789 to 1849, the Department of War handled Indian affairs, likely providing early federal health services through military doctors. The earliest federal Indian health care services were likely provided by military doctors to prevent infectious diseases. The first explicit authorization and appropriation for Indian health care was in 1832 for smallpox vaccinations, with additional funding allocated annually from 1860 to 1915. The earliest Indian treaty providing for health services was signed in 1832 with the Winnebago tribe. The 1832 treaty with the Winnebago tribe included funding for two physicians for 27 years as part of compensation for a land cession. About 44 treaties made with Indian tribes until 1871 committed the federal government to provide medical care, transitioning to civilian authority after 1849. The federal government recognized the need for medical care on reservations as tribes were placed there in the 19th century. The government gradually realized the need for medical care on reservations, with Congress providing funding for Indian vaccination against smallpox from 1860 to 1915. By the 1860s, appropriations were made for doctors and medicine at some agencies, and the BIA appointed physicians at certain locations. The number of medical employees in BIA agencies and schools increased over the years, with the establishment of BIA hospitals by 1888. Despite the lack of an organized medical division until 1908, the severity of health issues, particularly tuberculosis, in Indian schools and reservations was highlighted by critics and studies. The number of BIA hospitals and sanatoria increased from five to an unspecified number between 1900 and 1911. Between 1900 and 1911, the number of BIA hospitals and sanatoria increased from five to 50. In 1910, Congress enacted its first appropriation for general Indian medical needs for $40,000. By 1920, the overall Indian health appropriation was increased to $375,000, with additional funds for hospital construction and medical treatment. In 1921, Congress passed the Snyder Act, authorizing appropriations for Indian health services without limitations. Despite these efforts, criticism of BIA health services persisted, leading to suggestions of transferring medical services to the Public Health Service. In 1926, a PHS surgeon supervised BIA medical services. Congress authorized inspections of AI/AN health and education in 1929. The Johnson-O'Malley Act in 1934 allowed BIA to contract for medical services. Indian health programs were transferred to PHS in 1955. Appropriations for Indian Health Service increased, improving health status over the next 20 years. In 1976, Congress enacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (P.L. 94-437) to improve healthcare for Native Americans, granting IHS access to Medicaid and Medicare funds. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638) allowed for self-governance compacts, leading to tribal operation of most IHS facilities.
