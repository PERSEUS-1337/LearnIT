    "title": "AB 1669",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 4.6 of the Labor Code is amended to address public transit service contracts and contracts for solid waste collection and transportation. The Legislature recognizes the economic challenges faced by qualified employees when contracts are awarded to new contractors. The amended Labor Code addresses economic challenges for qualified employees when contracts change hands. It aims to reduce reliance on government programs by retaining prior contractor employees for similar work. The definitions in this chapter pertain to public transit services and solid waste contracts in California. \"Awarding authority\" refers to local government agencies, \"bidder\" is someone submitting a bid, and \"contractor\" is the party entering into a contract with the awarding authority. In California, \"Employee\" refers to individuals working for contractors or subcontractors under a contract, excluding certain exempt employees. \"Person\" includes various entities that may employ individuals or enter into contracts. \"Public transit services\" involve providing passenger transportation services to the general public. A \"Service contract\" is defined as a contract primarily for public transit services or the exclusive right to provide solid waste collection and transportation using employees. In California, a \"subcontractor\" is defined as a person who enters into a contract with a contractor to perform part of the contractor's obligations. The Labor Code requires bidders for service contracts to declare if they will retain prior contractor or subcontractor employees for at least 90 days. Bidders who agree to retain employees receive a 10 percent preference from the awarding authority. If the awarding authority plans to bid out a service contract, the current contractor must provide employee details and job information to the authority and potential bidders. This information must be shared at least 30 days before bids are due. If a new contractor is awarded the contract, the current contractor must provide employee details to the successor contractor. The current contractor must provide employee details and job information to the successor contractor as required by service contracts. A successor contractor or subcontractor must retain employees from the prior contractor, with exceptions for performance issues or failure to meet hiring qualifications. The successor contractor or subcontractor must offer written employment to retained employees within a specified time frame, not less than 10 days. They are not required to match the wages or benefits of the previous contractor. The successor contractor or subcontractor must retain qualified employees by seniority within the job classification if fewer employees are required than under the prior contract. Employees may be required to possess any necessary license. This applies to service contracts for solid waste collection and transportation. The successor contractor or subcontractor must retain qualified employees by seniority within the job classification if fewer employees are required than under the prior contract. Employees may be required to possess any necessary license. A successor contractor or subcontractor shall retain employees of a prior service contract unless certain conditions are met. If the number of employees meeting requirements exceeds those communicated to bidders, written notice must be given to successor contractors or subcontractors of any violation or breach, allowing 30 days to cure before termination of the service contract. Section 1076 is added to the Labor Code, stating that this chapter applies only to service contracts for solid waste collection and transportation when put out to bid by an awarding agency. It does not affect any existing franchises, contracts, licenses, or permits granted before January 1, 2017. Section 1076 of the Labor Code, added by this act, does not apply to contracts awarded before January 1, 2017, or contracts with completed bid processes before that date. Reimbursement for mandated costs in this act will be made to local agencies and school districts as per the Government Code."
