    "content": "Congress has the authority to review and approve the District of Columbia's budget, granted by the Constitution and the Home Rule Act of 1973. This act gave the city limited self-government powers but retained Congress's power to review and approve all District laws, including the annual budget. The mayor must submit budgets to the city council for review and adoption, ensuring expenditures do not exceed resources. The mayor's budget submission must ensure expenditures do not exceed resources and include a four-year financial management plan. A supplemental budget may be prepared for additional expenditures, with identified revenue sources. The council must act on the budget within 56 days, and the approved budget is forwarded to Congress for review and approval. The President and Congress may propose financial assistance to the District through special federal payments for specific activities or priorities. Congress must approve the District's budget as part of appropriations bills, which typically consist of three titles. Title I includes additional sums for specific congressional priorities, such as funding for court operations, emergency planning, security, and education initiatives. Title II of District appropriations acts includes the operating and capital budgets funded by local taxes, fees, charges, and federal assistance. The capital budget is supported by bond sales and annual appropriations. Title III covers general provisions related to fiscal matters, administrative controls, congressional oversight, and limitations on appropriated funds. The District's appropriations act includes controls for congressional oversight, limits on funds for advocacy of statehood or voting representation, and restrictions on social policies like abortion services and medical marijuana. Congress can authorize specific initiatives like school vouchers and charter schools. The District's budget moves through the congressional appropriations process, including subcommittee hearings and markups. City leaders have expressed concern over Congress delaying approval of the District's budget, impacting financial management and public services. Delays have been caused by complications in the congressional appropriations process. The District of Columbia appropriations act is often included in omnibus or consolidated appropriations acts and continuing resolutions due to delays in the congressional appropriations process. In FY1997, it was only enacted before the fiscal year once in the past 12 years. The District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2007, introduced by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, aims to provide budget autonomy for the District of Columbia. The Self-Government Improvement Act (Home Rule Act) of 1973 granted limited self-governing authority to the city while retaining congressional oversight of the District's budget. H.R. 733 proposes to allow the District to bypass congressional review of its budgets funded by local revenues, remove certain budget submission requirements, and ease restrictions on borrowing authority. This move towards increased budget autonomy is supported by the Bush Administration's FY2004 budget. H.R. 733 would eliminate elements of the District's home rule charter related to the budget submission process, including changing fiscal year starting points and removing provisions on the content and timing of the mayor's proposed budget submission. H.R. 733 would establish a multi-year budget plan for agencies, restrict the mayor's and council's ability to alter budget submissions, and require a congressional review period for District budget acts. It eliminates elements of the home rule charter related to the budget submission process. If Congress approves H.R. 733, the District of Columbia could change its fiscal year and budget processes independently. This could lead to a more efficient budget cycle with accurate revenue and expenditure estimates. The current budget approval process involves multiple entities, including the mayor, council, Chief Financial Officer, President, and Appropriation Committees. Enactment of H.R. 733 would allow the District of Columbia to have more autonomy in its budget processes, potentially leading to a more efficient cycle. However, Congress would still need to appropriate federal funds for certain functions carried out by the District but financed by the federal government. This includes corrections, courts, security, education initiatives, and other services. Enactment of H.R. 733 would grant the District of Columbia more budget autonomy, but Congress could still restrict the use of District funds through separate legislation. Including social policy provisions in District appropriations bills may go against the principles of home rule and could be challenged. The House approved a rule allowing consideration of an amendment authorizing a school choice program in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2004. The bill would remove certain provisions and financial management reporting requirements included in the home rule charter, such as limiting the city's ability to increase spending based on revenue increases and requiring the mayor to submit a financial report to the council annually. The curr_chunk proposes establishing a contingency reserve fund and the position of the District of Columbia Auditor, requiring the mayor to develop and submit performance accountability plans and reports for all government departments and agencies annually. The curr_chunk focuses on financial reporting requirements for the government of the District of Columbia, including the submission of a five-year financial plan and a financial compliance report to oversight committees and the Government Accountability Office. The bill proposes to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements for the government of the District of Columbia, which may impact congressional oversight and appropriations responsibilities. This could potentially hinder Congress's ability to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, and ensure the financial stability of the nation's capital. The bill proposes to allow the District of Columbia to establish its own rules for borrowing funds, reducing congressional oversight on financial matters. Currently, the city's home rule charter limits borrowing to 17% of District revenues. Additionally, revenue anticipation bonds are capped at 20% of total anticipated revenue. The D.C. Code sets rules for issuing bonds, limiting the total amount to 20% of anticipated revenue. Bonds must include specific provisions, have a payment schedule, and be backed by the District's credit. H.R. 733 would change borrowing rules, reducing congressional oversight. H.R. 733 would make most current District borrowing language non-binding, except for key provisions like the full faith and credit of the District and tax exemptions for bonds. The bill would allow the District to establish its own laws for issuing bonds, potentially changing current protocols set by Congress. The District would maintain protocols set by Congress in the Home Rule Act, including the budget reserve fund. Despite the repeal of the congressional mandate, the District continues to maintain a $50 million budget reserve fund. The proposed changes would allow the District to establish its own laws governing the borrowing process, potentially enabling quick responses to specific circumstances by raising the borrowing cap. The District government's borrowing autonomy allows for quick responses to specific circumstances by raising the borrowing cap. This autonomy also holds the government accountable for its borrowing decisions. Congress should inquire about the District's intended laws and procedures to ensure good borrowing practices in the future. In the interim, Congress may require the District to establish temporary institutions or propose a timeline for creating relevant laws, granting the District the power to make future alterations. Arguments for and against budget autonomy for the District can be categorized into constitutional and philosophical, accountability and governance, and best practices and economic impact. The citizens of the District have the right to elect representatives with the authority to decide on tax expenditures without federal approval, but without budget autonomy, the government lacks singular accountability. The District of Columbia cannot be solely accountable for budget decisions as responsibility is shared with the federal government. Involving the District in the appropriations process prolongs budgeting by six months or more, leading to unreliable estimates and economic costs. It is more efficient to have a single body in charge of budget matters rather than splitting decision-making between two bodies with different objectives. Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee the District's affairs, as it is the seat of the federal government. The District's policies should reflect the interests of its citizens and the federal government. The District of Columbia should have congressional oversight to ensure representation of both local and national interests. Line-item approval of the budget is crucial to prevent financial troubles. Without oversight, the District could face another takeover by a financial control board. H.R. 733 may lead to changes in how District officials manage their budget autonomy. If H.R. 733 becomes law, District officials may make changes to the budget process, fiscal year, revenue estimation, financial management safeguards, contingency funds, borrowing limits, and protocol for issuing bonds. Without full budget autonomy, officials seek to remove burdensome provisions like changing fiscal year dates or relaxing reserve fund requirements. Delays in congressional approval harm District operations, prompting the need for improvements in the legislative structure to pass necessary changes. Delays in congressional approval of the District's budget have hindered the operation of the District government. The proposed District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2007 aims to provide budget autonomy for the District, building on previous efforts dating back to 1981. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 granted local self-government powers to the District but did not include budget autonomy initially. The District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2007, H.R. 733, is part of a series of bills dating back to 1981 that have aimed to grant budget autonomy for the District of Columbia. Previous bills have sought to provide the District with autonomy over its own-source revenues, but none have become law. The bills from the 101st to 105th Congresses aimed to grant the District of Columbia autonomy over its own-source revenues and the authority to hire employees. The Fiscal Protection Act from the 104th Congress would have allowed the District to spend own-source revenue for operations with notification to interested parties. The bills from the 101st to 105th Congresses aimed to grant the District of Columbia autonomy over its own-source revenues and the authority to hire employees. The Fiscal Protection Act from the 104th Congress would have allowed the District to spend own-source revenue for operations with notification to interested parties. The Fiscal Integrity Act, 107th Congress, and the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Acts, 108th-109th Congresses, sought to allow enactment of the District's budget without congressional approval and alter the role of the CFO. The Senate passed the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2003 in the 108th Congress, but the legislation was not considered by the House. District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Acts (House versions) were introduced in the 105th, 106th, and 108th-110th Congresses, aiming to amend legislation related to the CFO and the Chief Financial Officer Establishment Act. The Home Rule Act and Early Budget Autonomy Bills aimed to eliminate congressional review of the District budget, allowing it to take effect upon approval by the city council and mayor. Discussions on budget autonomy for the District began with the passage of the Home Rule Act in 1973, but the prospect was ultimately rejected, leading to provisions requiring the District to transmit its budget to Congress. The Home Rule Act of 1973 required the District of Columbia to submit its budget to Congress for approval before taking effect. Efforts for budget autonomy began with the introduction of the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act in 1981, seeking to grant the District control over its own-source revenues. Efforts for budget autonomy in the District of Columbia began with the introduction of the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act in 1981. Subsequent bills introduced by Delegate Fauntroy and Representative Dellums aimed to grant budgetary autonomy and eliminate congressional review periods, but none successfully passed. In 1992, Congress passed the District of Columbia Legislative and Budget Autonomy Act, waiving the period of congressional review for certain legislation enacted by D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton urged colleagues to pass the bill, but it never made it to the floor. Financial distress in 1994 contributed to Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's defeat in the Democratic primary. In 1994, financial distress contributed to Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's defeat in the Democratic primary. Former Mayor Marion Barry was then re-elected. In April 1995, Congress passed the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act, establishing the Control Board during periods of financial instability. Discussions on budget autonomy have since been influenced by the Control Board's establishment in 1995. Since 1995, the Control Board has been a point of contention regarding District autonomy. In November 1995, a government shutdown occurred due to a lack of approval for an appropriations bill. Congresswoman Norton introduced H.R. 2661, advocating for the District to use its own-source revenues during shutdowns. Representative Tom Davis supported H.R. 2661 in December 1995. In December 1995, a continuing resolution was passed to allow the District to operate until January 3, 1996. Another resolution passed on January 3, 1996, providing appropriations until January 25, 1996. Budget autonomy bill H.R. 2661 was introduced but never voted on. In the following years, similar budget autonomy bills were introduced but did not progress. In the 107th Congress, bills were introduced for budget autonomy in the District of Columbia, with more ambitious goals than previous bills. The House and Senate versions of the D.C. Fiscal Integrity Act did not pass. In the 108th Congress, new bills titled the \"District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2003\" were introduced by Representative Davis and Senator Susan Collins. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 733 was introduced to amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act by making certain provisions inapplicable unless the District is in a \"control period\" as defined by financial criteria. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-91) aims to eliminate federally imposed mandates on the local budget process and financial management of the District of Columbia. References to CRS reports on appropriations for FY1998 to FY2003 are provided. The CRS reports on appropriations for the District of Columbia from FY2003 to 2007 were authored by various individuals."
