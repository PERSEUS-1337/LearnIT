    "content": "The Act titled \"Reducing Global Warming Pollution from Vehicles Act of 2008\" aims to address global warming pollution from vehicles. Congress finds that the State of California has regulated motor vehicle air emissions more stringently than the Federal Government for over 40 years. In recognition of the State's role in protecting public health, Congress enacted section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act allowing the Administrator of the EPA to waive Federal preemption of State motor vehicle standards. California requested a waiver in 2005 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The regulation of the State requires a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. Once California is granted a waiver for this regulation, other states may adopt the same vehicle emission standards. Currently, 14 states have adopted or are adopting California standards, with 4 more states moving towards adoption. The State of California requested a waiver for vehicle emission standards, which was supported by comments overwhelmingly. Despite this support, Administrator Stephen Johnson denied the request, which was unprecedented. The State of California requested a waiver for vehicle emission standards, which was denied by Administrator Stephen Johnson. The denial was based on the argument that it would create a confusing patchwork of State regulations, despite overwhelming evidence supporting the waiver. The State of California's request for a waiver for more stringent vehicle emission standards was denied by Administrator Stephen Johnson. However, granting the waiver would not create a patchwork of regulations as claimed, as there have been two standards for vehicles for 30 years - a weaker Federal standard and a more stringent California standard adopted by many States. The benefits of allowing California to set stricter standards, which are then adopted by other States, are well-documented. The National Academy of Sciences recognized California as a leader in emissions-control innovations, with valid reasons for maintaining separate standards. California should continue its pioneering role in setting mobile-source emissions standards to achieve air quality goals and be a proving ground for new emissions-control technologies. The Administrator argued that national fuel economy standards would be more effective, but California's standards show they would result in significantly larger emission reductions by 2020. The Administrator's argument that national fuel economy standards would be more effective is countered by California's pioneering role in setting mobile-source emissions standards. California's standards would result in approximately twice as large a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 compared to the Federal program. This contradicts the Administrator's claim that national fuel economy standards eliminate the need for vehicle greenhouse gas emission controls. The Administrator's authority to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles was discussed, emphasizing that the EPA must fulfill its environmental responsibilities independently of the Department of Transportation's energy efficiency mandate. Congress expressed support for California's request for vehicle emission controls. The State of California's request for a waiver to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles is not supported by science, precedent, or applicable law. The purposes of the Act are to allow immediate state regulation of emissions, provide certainty to automakers and the public, and address the threat of climate change to public health and the environment. The State of California's request for a waiver to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles has been approved under Section 209 of the Clean Air Act."
