    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 52060 of the Education Code requires school districts in California to adopt a local control and accountability plan using a state board template by July 1, 2014. The plan must be updated annually and cover both the district and individual schools within it. The annual goals for all pupils and subgroups must align with state priorities and any additional local priorities set by the school district's governing board. Subgroups are defined as numerically significant pupil groups. The school district must outline specific actions in the local control and accountability plan to achieve goals aligned with state priorities, including addressing deficiencies. These actions must not conflict with existing collective bargaining agreements. State priorities for school districts include ensuring teachers are appropriately assigned and fully credentialed, providing access to standards-aligned instructional materials, maintaining school facilities, implementing academic standards for English learners, and promoting academic content knowledge and English language proficiency. The school district's priorities include offering professional development opportunities for instructional personnel, promoting parental involvement, and measuring pupil achievement. Pupil achievement is measured by statewide assessments, the Academic Performance Index, and completion of courses for entrance to UC/CSU or career technical education programs aligned with state standards. The condensed text chunk focuses on measuring pupil achievement through various indicators such as English proficiency progress, reclassification rate, AP exam passing rate, college preparedness, pupil engagement including attendance rates, chronic absenteeism, middle and high school dropout rates, and high school graduation rates. The condensed text chunk focuses on measuring pupil achievement through various indicators such as dropout rates, graduation rates, school climate, access to a broad course of study, and pupil outcomes in different subject areas. The governing board of a school district may consider qualitative information for school quality reviews, consult with various stakeholders in developing a local control and accountability plan, and identify local priorities and goals for measuring progress. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
