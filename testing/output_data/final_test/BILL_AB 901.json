    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Exporters, brokers, and transporters of recyclables or compost in California must provide periodic reports to the department on the types, quantities, and destinations of materials. The reports may exclude financial data and information on the origin of materials, but aggregated facility-wide data may be shared with jurisdictions upon request. Non-company specific aggregated information is public. The department will adopt regulations to implement practices for handling solid wastes and recyclable materials, ensuring compliance before enforcement and determining penalty amounts. These regulations should not overly burden waste and recycling operations or compromise safety. Any person who refuses or fails to submit required information is subject to a civil penalty ranging from $500 to $5,000 per violation or for each day of a continuing violation. (e) Filing a false report, refusing inspection, failing to keep records, or falsifying records can result in a civil penalty of $500 to $10,000 per violation. Liability can be imposed through civil action or administratively. All records required for verifying reports must be available for inspection by the department, but will remain confidential and not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. An employee of a government entity can inspect and copy records related to tonnage received at a disposal facility after July 1, 2015, within the entity's jurisdiction. The records include weight tags with hauler, vehicle, quantity, date, type, and origin of waste, for purposes of enforcing local fees, but they are confidential and not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Names of haulers using specific landfills shall not be disclosed by a government entity unless necessary for enforcement purposes or to fund local programs. A government entity can seek court intervention to enforce its authority under specific regulations. The definition of a government entity is outlined, and the terms \"disposal\" and \"disposal facility\" are clarified. The subdivision does not alter the authority granted to government entities as of December 31, 2015. The operator can redact confidential pricing information from records before inspection. Reports required by this section must be submitted electronically. All records provided are subject to Section 40062."
