    "content": "The last new refinery in the United States opened in 1976, but a small refinery is set to open in North Dakota this year. Despite over 150 refinery closures since the 1980s, remaining refineries have expanded to meet demand. Current U.S. refining capacity appears to exceed demand, with increasing exports of refined petroleum products. The industry is looking to expand further to take advantage of cheaper U.S. crude oil. However, economic and regulatory barriers hinder the construction of new refineries. The industry has negotiated regulatory hurdles to expand refinery capacity, favored over new construction due to economy of scale. New entrants may face steep competition, but \"teapot\" refineries processing light-sweet crude oil have low entry costs. Small refineries face similar economic and environmental factors as large ones but may benefit from exemptions in federal regulations. Some federal policies have displaced petroleum products in the market, posing direct challenges to refineries. The report discusses the state of refining in the United States, focusing on regulatory criteria, small vs. large refineries, and economic challenges such as competition from ethanol and biodiesel producers. The industry faces potential displacement of petroleum products by alternative fuels mandated by the Renewable Fuel Standard and a decline in demand for refined products. The discussion focuses on environmental requirements for refinery construction and operations, particularly air emissions control. There are 115 refineries in the US processing 18 million barrels of crude oil daily, all sharing atmospheric distillation. The United States has 115 refineries processing 18 million barrels of crude oil daily, all utilizing atmospheric distillation. Refineries vary in complexity, with many now capable of converting heavy crude oils into refined products through cracking and coking processes. This shift began in the late 1970s due to a dwindling supply of light-sweet crude oils, leading to the adoption of heavy-sour crude oils and advanced refining techniques. In the late 1970s, U.S. refineries started using cracking and coking processes to convert petroleum resid into high value motor fuels, increasing production without expanding capacity. This upgrade required significant investment costs and became prominent in the 1980s and 1990s. Midwest refineries have recently added coking/conversion capacity to utilize heavier crude oils from Canada's oil sands projects. The availability of light sweet crude oils from unconventional shale resources like the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations has revitalized U.S. refining operations. There are concerns about the role of condensates in the market, which are volatile light hydrocarbons associated with crude oil. Condensates can vaporize when transferred to stock tanks due to pressure changes. The crude oil stream is directed through a separator or \"splitter\" to prevent flashing. A splitter separates condensates into various product streams based on temperature and pressure. Small refineries are defined by the number of employees and daily production. Small refineries with less than 125,000 barrels per day capacity may qualify for federal small business contracts. Around 50% of U.S. refining capacity is made up of 27 refineries. Regulations define a small refinery as having less than 75,000 b/d in average daily crude oil throughput. Small refineries with capacity below 155,000 b/d are temporarily exempt from complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard. The Clean Air Act sets 65,000 b/d as the threshold for small refineries to comply with vapor recovery provisions. The North American Industry Classification Codes (NAICC) identifies construction costs for small oil and gas structures below $33.5 million. The smallest refinery under construction, a 20,000 b/d refinery in North Dakota, is estimated to cost $350 million. Smaller oilfield equipment like oil and gas separators may align with NAICC costs due to their mobile and temporary nature. For example, a 2,500 b/d crude oil condensate stabilizer in Texas cost around $400,000 in 2012. Small business opportunities in refining depend on factors like regional demand for refined products and available crude oil. Some key factors affecting small business opportunities in refining include regional demand for refined products, available crude oil supplies, regional price differences, and unique state environmental regulations. Refinery-ownership changes suggest that buying an existing refinery is the quickest way to expand capacity. The availability of light sweet crude oil in the mid-continent region presents opportunities for constructing small topping units. The region (North Dakota, Colorado) offers opportunities for small topping or hydroskimming refineries. Hess Corp. has applied a \"heater treater\" to handle excess condensate production in North Dakota. Around 20 refining projects are proposed or in development, ranging from condensate splitter plants to mini-refineries. Oil companies can adjust refinery capacity to meet changing demand for petroleum products. The refining industry can adjust capacity and utilization rates of existing refineries, export or import products, and buy or sell refineries to meet demand. No new complex refineries have been built in the US since 1977, with over 150 refineries closing since 1982. Capacity expansion in existing refineries has offset some lost capacity. Since 1982, over 150 refineries have closed in the US, with no new complex refineries built since 1977. Despite a loss of 1.6 Mb/d in refining capacity, existing refineries have expanded to increase overall capacity by 23% to over 18 Mb/d. The United States transitioned from a net importer to a net exporter of petroleum products, indicating no shortage of refining capacity. This shift allowed for meeting domestic demand while supplying foreign markets, showcasing the industry's focus on optimizing capacity utilization rates. Refiners' profits fluctuated over the years due to various factors such as high oil prices, weak demand during the recession, and recovering demand with discounted crude oil supplies. Profit volatility is common in the refining industry, leading to uncertainty in building new refineries in the United States. The refining industry in the United States faces profit volatility due to factors like high oil prices and weak demand. Desirable investment projects should offer predictable profits in the long run. Capital investment is done for various reasons such as expanding facilities, implementing new technology, and regulatory compliance. U.S. refining capital investment peaked in 2008. The U.S. refining industry saw a peak in capital investment in 2008 due to increasing global demand for petroleum products. Subsequent declines in investment were followed by a resurgence driven by exports and investments in new light, sweet crude oil supplies. The construction of a new refinery in North Dakota in 2014 highlights the importance of these new oil sources. Permitting new sites remains a key factor in capital investment decisions. The Arizona Clean Fuels Refinery faced permitting delays and financing difficulties, costing millions of dollars and taking seven years without completion. Market conditions, such as growth in demand for transportation fuels and stable crude oil supplies, are necessary for new refinery investments to be desirable. The availability of stable, affordable crude oil supplies and regulatory certainty are important for refining profitability. Despite a decline in U.S. gasoline demand from 2007 to 2013, factors like rising CAFE Standards could further reduce demand. Full implementation of these standards could decrease U.S. motor fuel demand by 12 Mb/d by 2025, impacting the need for new refining capacity. Additionally, the use of bio-based ethanol in gasoline is increasing. The growth in bio-based ethanol use in gasoline has reduced demand for crude oil per gallon. Potential growth in alternative fuel vehicles could further increase demand. Despite U.S. crude oil and natural gas production growth, refineries face challenges with the quality of feedstock. Light sweet crude offers a competitive advantage for larger refineries. The refining industry faces challenges with feedstock quality and shifting to light crude from heavy feedstock. Environmental regulations, such as CAFE/GHG standards and RFS, impact refiners' operations and costs. Compliance with regulations may reduce petroleum fuel consumption. The federal government regulates vehicle fuel economy and GHG emissions to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. This includes setting CAFE standards for passenger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle GHG standards administered by the EPA. Compliance with these regulations may increase costs for refiners and present challenges. The Obama Administration has issued joint rules on vehicle fuel economy and GHG emissions to reduce emissions from motor vehicles. EPA and NHTSA are drafting a second phase of fuel economy/GHG standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. New passenger car and light truck CAFE standards are expected to rise to 41.0 mpg in MY2021 and 49.7 mpg in MY2025. EPA and NHTSA expect significant improvements in fuel efficiency by MY2025. The Obama Administration has issued joint rules on vehicle fuel economy and GHG emissions to reduce emissions from motor vehicles. New passenger car and light truck CAFE standards are expected to rise to 41.0 mpg in MY2021 and 49.7 mpg in MY2025. Critics challenge the assumptions, stating costs may be higher and could impact new vehicle sales. The standards aim to reduce U.S. oil use by more than 2 Mb/d in 2025, indirectly affecting refineries by improving overall vehicle fleet efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. Short-term effects on fuel consumption and the refining industry are uncertain. The CAFE and GHG vehicle emission standards have led to a decline in petroleum fuel consumption, impacting refinery operations. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the use of biofuels in transportation fuel, established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Renewable Fuel Standard, established in 2005 and expanded in 2007, mandates the use of biofuels in transportation fuel. In 2013, 16.55 billion gallons of biofuels were mandated, with 13.3 billion gallons from corn ethanol. The goal is to reach 36 billion gallons of renewables by 2022, reducing the demand for petroleum-based fuel. Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) are used as a compliance mechanism for the RFS. Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) are used as a compliance mechanism for the Renewable Fuel Standard. RINs are generated by biofuel producers and are sold with the fuel. Biofuel purchasers separate the RINs from the physical fuel when blending ethanol into gasoline. RINs can be sold to other parties, including obligated entities or third-party traders. Non-integrated refiners may need to buy RINs from the secondary market if supplies are tight, potentially facing higher compliance costs than competitors. Non-integrated refiners could face higher compliance costs due to the need to secure RINs, presenting an economic hurdle for new, independent refineries. Small volume refineries were temporarily exempted from RFS requirements through 2010, with some small refiners later found to face disproportionate economic hardship and exempted for 2011 and 2012. EPA exempted 13 small refineries during this period. The EPA exempted 13 small refineries from Renewable Fuel Standard requirements. California implemented a Low-Carbon Fuel Standard to reduce GHG emissions by 2020, requiring refiners to decrease carbon intensity of fuels. Most of the reduction is expected to come from lower-carbon biofuels, although some biofuels may have higher emissions than gasoline or diesel. The California program interacts with the federal Renewable Fuel Standard. The California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) may impact refiners' costs as it becomes more stringent. EPA finalized new gasoline sulfur standards in 2014, reducing sulfur content in gasoline from 30 ppm to 10 ppm by 2017 to reduce emissions from vehicles. This aligns with new \"Tier 3\" emissions standards for new vehicles, aiming to limit pollutant formation in existing vehicles and enable advanced emissions systems in new vehicles. The cost of refining gasoline is expected to increase due to new sulfur standards for gasoline set by the EPA in 2014. Refiners may need to invest in desulfurization technology, with compliance costs estimated to be below one cent per gallon on average. Small refiners are given more flexibility in meeting fuel standards compared to larger refiners. Small refiners have more flexibility in complying with fuel standards compared to larger refiners. Small refiners are defined as those with 1,500 or fewer employees and an annual crude oil capacity of 155,000 b/d or less. They will be granted an additional three years to comply with Tier 3 standards, until 2020, and can generate tradable credits for early compliance. Environmental permitting and regulatory requirements apply to refineries, with the specific requirements varying in difficulty. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions for \"Refinery Revitalization\" to improve permitting coordination between EPA and state agencies. State and local agencies handle environmental permitting and regulatory operations, implementing inspections, monitoring, enforcement, and setting standards. States have their own statutes and requirements independent of EPA. Air pollution permitting is a significant regulatory challenge for new projects. The report focuses on air pollution permitting and standards for new and modified refineries under the Clean Air Act. EPA is authorized to regulate emissions from stationary sources like refineries, including requirements such as air permitting, NSPS, and NESHAPS. Regulatory challenges may also arise from specific location and situations of proposed refineries, such as limited cooling water supply in arid areas. The Clean Air Act requires major industrial sources to obtain construction and operating permits, including Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permits for new or modified facilities with significant air pollution. States are delegated responsibility for permitting under the CAA. EPA or state authorities can issue permits. The Clean Air Act mandates permits for major industrial sources to control air pollution, with PSD requirements for new or modified facilities. Refineries are subject to PSD regulations, requiring Best Available Control Technology, air quality analysis, impacts analysis, and public participation. Title V permits streamline permitting for refinery emissions sources like cracker towers, coker units, and boilers, which emit pollutants such as VOCs, NOx, and SOx. Title V permits address major sources of air pollution, including VOCs, NOx, SOx, CO, PM, and HAPs. They cover sources in nonattainment areas, those subject to NSPS, regulated sources of HAP emissions, and sources requiring new source or modification permits under Title I of the Clean Air Act. A federal Title V permit may be required for a new oil refinery, depending on the State Implementation Plan. Permit requirements vary based on the location of the refinery, with more stringent regulations in nonattainment areas. Refineries in nonattainment areas may need to meet the \"Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate\" and offset expected emissions with Emission Reduction Credits. The permitting requirements for a small refinery depend on technical specifications and potential emissions. Operations may not need a Title V permit if they fall under other state regulations based on size and emissions potential. The permitting requirements for a small refinery depend on technical specifications and potential emissions, such as the need for a synthetic minor permit. These air permitting issues, including industry-specific standards, can be a limitation for new refinery construction or modifications. Offsets and complex calculations may also pose constraints, requiring technical expertise from both the facility operator and permitting agency. Industry-specific NSPS requirements have been established by the EPA to regulate air pollution from sources that may endanger public health. The existing NSPS for petroleum refineries address PM, CO, and SO2 emissions, setting limits and standards for various units and equipment, as well as monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. The EPA has established industry-specific NSPS requirements for petroleum refineries to regulate air pollution. These requirements include National Emission Standards for Petroleum Refineries, such as Refinery MACT 1 and Refinery MACT 2, which set emission limits for HAPs and work practice standards. Additionally, a proposed rule in 2014 aims to further control HAPs from petroleum refineries. The EPA proposed a rule in 2014 to control emissions from petroleum refineries, including storage tanks, flares, and coking units. Refineries must meet emission control requirements and monitor air concentrations at the fence-line to protect neighboring communities. Refineries, regardless of size, must comply with the rule as either a major or area source of HAPs. New construction or modifications must use the best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA is considering implementing control standards for greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum refineries, with a focus on energy efficiency improvements. These improvements, such as heat recovery units, can reduce emissions, pollutants, fuel consumption, and costs. Currently, there are no federal standards for GHG emissions from refineries, but proposed settlement agreements aim to address this issue by requiring new and modified refineries to comply with NSPS for GHG emissions by November 10, 2012. The EPA is considering implementing control standards for greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum refineries, focusing on energy efficiency improvements. California's requirements under A.B.32 are expected to affect refineries, and other states may follow suit. The United States is experiencing an energy renaissance in producing light crude oil and natural gas, presenting challenges and opportunities for U.S. refiners. Refineries are choosing to reduce the number of facilities, increase existing capacity, and utilize new resources. Refineries are increasing capacity by adapting to run new light crudes, potentially impacting smaller refineries that depend on light crudes for profitability. There is little evidence that refinery growth has been significantly hindered by environmental permitting requirements. Some refineries are considering bypassing conventional refining altogether and exporting light crude. The possibility of bypassing conventional refining and exporting light crude directly is a new development that may offer opportunities for small businesses in the petroleum supply sector. Congress may need to consider redefining a refinery to include similar processes producing product streams based on physical properties. Additionally, they may need to assess unique challenges or opportunities for small businesses entering the refining industry now that the US is a net exporter of refined petroleum products. For more information on refining, refer to CRS reports such as The U.S. Oil Refining Industry: Background in Changing Markets and Fuel Policies and Petroleum Coke: Industry and Environmental Issues. The CRS reports mentioned include topics on Petroleum Coke industry, U.S. Rail Transportation of Crude Oil, Automobile and Truck Fuel Economy, Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards, and Renewable Fuel Standard."
