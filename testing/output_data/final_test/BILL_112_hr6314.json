    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Energy Independence and Domestic Refining Capacity Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of promoting domestic energy independence through various federal incentives and partnerships to support growth in energy industries. The increasing demand for petroleum products, coupled with refinery closures, poses challenges such as supply shortages, higher prices, and increased production costs. Reduced refining capacity will increase pressure on the industry to manage supply and meet demand as domestic refining capacity shifts and contracts. The location of refining facilities and distribution networks is significant. The \"Commission on Energy Independence and Domestic Refining Capacity\" is established to conduct studies on refinery consolidation or closure's impact on domestic refining capacity as requested by the President. The Commission will conduct a study on the state of the domestic refining industry, potential public-private partnerships for increased capacity, consequences of Federal partnerships, reinvestment of partnership revenues into energy education and research, and types of Federal incentives. The Commission will conduct a study on the state of the domestic refining industry and potential public-private partnerships for increased capacity. Federal incentives such as tax incentives, loan guarantees, direct loans, grants, land grants, credits, cooperative agreements, preferences, and other competitions will be considered. A report will be submitted to the President and Congress within 3 months of the study request. The Secretary of Energy may offer Federal incentives to prevent the diminishment of refining capacity if the Commission's study finds adverse effects. Incentives include forming public-private partnerships and increasing domestic refining capacity. Staff of the Commission and experts/consultants are also mentioned.
