    "content": "The biotechnology industry was developing biologics for human therapeutic use around the time of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These biologics, such as insulin and growth hormone, require special handling and are often administered via injection or infusion. Biotechnology products are expected to increase in the pharmaceutical market, but their high cost can be a barrier for patients. The costs of commonly used biologic drugs in 2009 ranged from $26,000 for Enbrel to $200,000 for Cerezyme. Medicare spending on biologics was about $13 billion in 2007, representing 11% of healthcare spending in the US. Insurers are adopting strategies like tiered formularies and prior authorization to manage expensive biologics. The use of innovative payment models for expensive drugs that do not improve overall survival is being considered by insurers. Generic medications can significantly reduce prices of branded drugs by 60% to 90%. The generic drug industry saves costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. Generic drugs must demonstrate sameness to the original product before being marketed. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) advocated for the FDA to establish a regulatory system for the approval of follow-on biologics under its existing statutory authority. However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) filed a citizen petition with the FDA to inhibit the approval of follow-on biologics. On April 12, 2006, the European Commission approved the first follow-on biologic. On April 12, 2006, the European Commission approved the first biosimilar product Omnitrope, a human growth hormone, in Europe. Sales of Omnitrope in the United States followed a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor of Omnitrope. The court ruled that the FDA must consider the application for Omnitrope, which was submitted in 2003. The FTC report in June 2009 examined the impact of follow-on biologics on drug prices, concluding that the 12- to 14-year market exclusivity period is too long to promote innovation. The report also stated that special procedures to resolve patent issues are unnecessary. The report concluded that special procedures to resolve patent issues are unnecessary and could harm consumers. The Obama Administration proposed a seven-year market exclusivity period as a compromise. The biotechnology industry believed 12 to 14 years of exclusivity was necessary for innovation. Various experts provided recommendations on the length of data exclusivity, ranging from seven to 16.2 years. Economic studies on potential savings from follow-on biologics have varied, with estimates ranging from nothing to $14 billion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office found that a bill could save the federal government $5.9 billion over 10 years and reduce total biologics expenditures by about $25 billion. The Obama Administration estimated significant savings following the approval of a pathway for follow-on biologics. The implementation of a pathway for the approval of follow-on biologics is estimated to result in savings of $9.2 billion over a 10-year period. Concerns have been raised about the expedited FDA approval process compromising patient safety, with a study finding that 41 out of 174 biologics approved since 1995 were subject to safety-related regulatory actions. These actions included letters to healthcare professionals and \"black box\" warnings on product labels, but no product withdrawals. The study found that the probability of a first safety-related regulatory action for biologics was 14% after 3 years and 29% after 10 years of approval. Safety problems often arise post-approval due to rare adverse effects. The first biologics in a subgroup were more likely to face regulatory actions compared to later products. The regulation of biological products and chemical drugs is done under different Acts by the FDA. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for pharmaceutical products, setting new precedents for pre-market government review. The Biologics Act of 1902 focused on the manufacturing process of biologic products, requiring inspection before federal licensing. It predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which lacked premarket control over new drugs. The Biologics Act was replaced by the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required new drug applications to demonstrate safety before marketing. The Biologics Act of 1902 focused on manufacturing processes for biologic products, requiring inspection before federal licensing. The 1944 Public Health Service Act revised the Biologics Act, specifying that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FDA. This includes viruses, vaccines, blood products, and other products for disease prevention or treatment. The FDA approval is not required for products with a license under the PHS Act. The Public Health Service (PHS) Act regulates biological products, which are defined as articles intended for disease diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention in humans or animals. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 amended the PHS Act to require a single Biological License Application (BLA) for biological products. The PHS Act allows for immediate license suspension in cases of public health danger. Biological products are generally licensed under the PHS Act, while chemical drugs are approved. The FDA has regulatory authority over certain natural source biological products, such as insulin, which is regulated as a drug under the FDC Act rather than as a biologic under the PHS Act. This distinction also applies to other products like glucagon and human growth hormone. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides a pathway for generic drugs under the FDC Act but not the PHS Act. It added abbreviated pathways for subsequent versions of approved products. The 505(j) pathway is used for the approval of most generic chemical drugs, where the generic company establishes that its drug product is chemically the same as the innovator drug. The 505(b)(2) pathway is used for drugs with significant differences from the innovator drug but still sufficiently similar, requiring additional non-clinical and clinical data for approval. This pathway has been used for drugs like Omnitrope, a follow-on human growth hormone. The regulatory responsibility for biologics was first delegated to the Hygienic Laboratory in 1902, and in 1972, it was transferred to the FDA Bureau of Biologics, which later became the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). Determining the jurisdictional status of biotechnology products has been challenging due to their characteristics overlapping multiple definitions. In 1991, an Intercenter Agreement was published between CBER and the Center for Drug. In 2002, the FDA announced a reorganization of review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. This allowed CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. Biological products transferred to CDER will continue to be regulated as licensed biologics under section 351 of the PHS Act. Products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, proteins for therapeutic use, immunomodulators, and growth factors. Traditional biologics like vaccines, allergenic products, and blood products remain at CBER. The Hatch-Waxman Act added abbreviated pathways for product approval under the FDC Act, not the PHS Act. Biological products are complex and not identical due to their manufacturing methods. The 505(b)(2) pathway may be used for the approval of biologics that are sufficiently similar to the innovator product. However, additional legislation is needed to provide this pathway under the PHS Act for traditional biologics. The FDA's longstanding policy for biologics regulated under the PHS Act is to require a full BLA for approval. The FDA's policy for biologics regulated under the PHS Act requires a full BLA, including clinical testing, for licensing each product. All biological products must undergo clinical testing to demonstrate safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness before approval, even if similar products are already on the market. Each biologic is unique and must be separately proven safe and effective. There is no \"me-too\" biologic. The FDA stated in 1992 that the ANDA procedure outlined in Hatch-Waxman does not apply to biological drug products licensed under 42 USC 262. Janet Woodcock of the FDA mentioned in 2007 that there is no pathway for approval of follow-on biologics under the PHS Act similar to the 505(b)(2) pathway under the FDC Act. Comparing follow-on proteins with brand-name products is more challenging than comparing generic and brand-name chemical drugs. Therapeutic proteins, unlike chemically synthesized drugs, are much larger in size and have a complex three-dimensional structure composed of amino acids. Even slight changes in the amino acid chain or shape can impact the protein's biological activity. Manufactured biologics can vary slightly from lot to lot, and proteins can be altered by the addition of chemicals like sugar groups. Therapeutic proteins have a complex structure with amino acids and can be altered by the addition of chemicals like sugar groups. Current technology faces challenges in fully characterizing biological products, such as follow-on biologics, due to the complexity of protein structures. Sophisticated technologies are needed for conclusive analysis beyond determining the amino acid sequence. The complexity of protein structures, including folding, post-translational modifications, and protein aggregation, determines their unique functional characteristics. Predicting clinical comparability between products relies on understanding the relationship between protein structure and function, as well as demonstrating structural similarity between follow-on and reference products. Advanced technology is needed for accurate comparison, especially for more complex protein products. The FDA faces challenges in determining interchangeability between follow-on biologics and brand-name biologics. Therapeutic equivalents are drug products with the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration. Bioequivalence ensures similar absorption rates. Interchangeability between follow-on biologics and brand-name biologics is not clearly defined by the FDA. It could refer to therapeutic equivalents that can be substituted at the pharmacy level without a physician's intervention. Dr. Woodcock explains the importance of determining therapeutic equivalence for generic drugs, but this may not be possible for follow-on protein products currently. Therapeutically equivalent drugs approved under section 505(j) can be substituted at the pharmacy level in many jurisdictions. The FDA does not clearly define interchangeability between follow-on biologics and brand-name biologics. Therapeutically equivalent drugs may be substituted at the pharmacy level in many jurisdictions without a physician's intervention. However, it is unlikely that manufacturers of follow-on protein products can demonstrate identical products due to the complexity of protein molecules and limitations of analytical methods. Immunogenicity, or the ability to elicit an immune response, is crucial in the discussion of follow-on proteins. Immunogenicity is a critical factor in the discussion of follow-on protein products. An immune response to administered protein products can lead to serious adverse events, including hypersensitivity reactions and cross-reactions with endogenous proteins. Predicting immunogenicity, especially for complex proteins, is challenging and requires significant attention. The immunogenic potential of a new protein product must be clinically assessed due to limited data on complex proteins. FDA approval does not guarantee interchangeability with the original brand-name product, requiring additional clinical data for substitution. The need for additional clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in repeated switches between follow-on and brand-name protein products is highlighted. Efforts by Congress to establish a pathway for the licensure of follow-on biologics have been initiated but faced challenges. In the 110th Congress, competing legislative approaches were introduced for FDA approval of follow-on biologic products. H.R. 1038 and S. 623 favored the generic drug industry, while H.R. 1956 and S. 1505 favored brand-name companies. A third approach was introduced with S. 1695, aiming to negotiate a compromise between the two sides. The sponsors intended to add S. 1695's language to FDA user fee program legislation, but it did not happen. In the 110th Congress, various bills were introduced for FDA approval of follow-on biologic products. H.R. 3580 became law in 2007 without including S. 1695. H.R. 5629 was introduced in 2008, similar to S. 1695 but with differences favored by the brand-name industry. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 1427 and H.R. 1548 made changes to previous bills. Health care reform legislation also included provisions for follow-on biologics in the PPACA. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes provisions for follow-on biologics, specifically in \"Subtitle A\u2014Biologics Price Competition and Innovation.\" The act requires a determination on interchangeability if the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product and can produce the same clinical result without risk to the patient. PPACA mandates information in FDA applications demonstrating similarity to the reference product based on clinical studies for safety, purity, and potency. Data exclusivity is a period during which a manufacturer of a follow-on product is blocked from using data submitted in the original application for FDA approval of the brand-name product. This results in exclusive marketing rights separate from patent protection. FDA may issue guidance for public comment before finalizing, but the absence of guidance does not affect application review or action. The PPACA provides a 12-year exclusivity period for brand-name products, with additional exclusivity for orphan drugs. It also allows for exclusive marketing for the first interchangeable follow-on biologic product. The legislation includes provisions for patent infringement claims and new processes for resolving disputes between brand-name and biosimilar companies. The PPACA establishes a multistep patent resolution process for disputes between brand-name and biosimilar companies. It requires biological product applications to be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act. Recommendations for the review of follow-on biologic product applications must be developed by the Secretary of HHS and presented to Congress. Congress should act based on these recommendations. The Senate recommends Congress authorize a user fee program for follow-on biologic applications starting October 1, 2012. The Secretary must collect cost data and conduct audits every two years. PPACA grants six months of market exclusivity for new biologic drugs with pediatric studies before FDA approval. PPACA mandates an IOM study to review pediatric testing of biological products and recommends ensuring testing for children. It also requires the HHS and Treasury Secretaries to determine annual savings from biosimilar approval pathway for deficit reduction."
