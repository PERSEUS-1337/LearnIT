    "content": "The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section for a credit related to intelligent vehicle technology systems. A credit of $500 per qualified intelligent vehicle system placed in service during the taxable year is allowed against the tax imposed. The credit is limited to $1,000 per vehicle, reduced by any prior credits received for the same vehicle. A qualified intelligent vehicle system refers to a system of devices installed in a motor vehicle. The paragraph describes electronic lane departure warning systems, collision avoidance systems, and navigation systems installed in vehicles. Lane departure systems alert the driver if they veer out of their lane, collision avoidance systems warn of potential collisions at speeds over 45 mph, and navigation systems provide nationwide route guidance with audio directions. Active automatic crash notification systems use wireless technology to alert emergency services when a passenger activates the car's emergency button or the airbag deploys. Electronic stability control systems optimize vehicle control, side obstacle detection systems increase awareness of blind spots, and automatic back-up warning devices provide alerts when reversing. Automatic back-up warning device systems alert drivers to people and objects behind their vehicle when backing up. Adaptive cruise control systems warn drivers of slower-moving traffic ahead and automatically adjust speed to maintain a driver-set gap from the vehicle ahead. These systems monitor the area ahead of the vehicle to adjust speed through braking and throttle control. The curr_chunk discusses advanced features in vehicle technology, including Adaptive Front Lighting Systems (AFS), LED brake lights, and seat-mounted head protection airbag systems. These features enhance visibility, safety, and response time in various driving conditions. The curr_chunk introduces seat-mounted head protection airbag systems that deploy from the driver or passenger side seat to protect the head in a side-impact crash scenario. Additionally, it mentions head-curtain airbag systems that deploy from the roof lining of the vehicle to cover the front two rows in a crash. The curr_chunk introduces requirements for head airbag and rollover protection curtain systems in vehicles, including deployment for 5 seconds in rollover crashes and meeting occupant ejection mitigation standards. It also mentions direct tire pressure monitoring systems for heavy trucks. The curr_chunk discusses pressure monitoring systems for heavy truck applications that provide real-time determination of tire pressure and temperature. It also mentions systems identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for enhancing safety or security. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a motor vehicle and special rules related to tax credits for certain properties. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for claiming a tax credit for a qualified intelligent vehicle system, including the need for supporting documentation as specified by the Secretary. Additionally, it mentions that no credit will be allowed if the taxpayer elects not to have the section apply to the vehicle. The curr_chunk discusses the process for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to identify systems for inclusion or removal from the list of qualified intelligent vehicle systems for tax credits. An advisory committee will be established for this purpose. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will establish an advisory committee with industry and consumer representatives to evaluate qualified intelligent vehicle systems for tax credits. The committee will meet regularly, provide quarterly reports, and make them available to the public. Conforming amendments will be made to the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2005."
