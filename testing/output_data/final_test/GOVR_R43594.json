    "content": "Several western states are facing severe to exceptional drought conditions, with California experiencing its third consecutive dry year. This has led to low reservoir, surface, and groundwater levels. The drought has sparked congressional interest in its impact on water supplies, agriculture, and wildlife. Regulations on water deliveries to the Central Valley Project and State Water Project are sometimes limited due to endangered species and water quality regulations. Endangered species and water quality regulations restrict water releases from reservoirs and pumping from the Bay-Delta, reducing water deliveries to users. During droughts, water allocation is based on senior water rights, leading to potential zero supply for junior rights holders. These reductions in water deliveries spark disputes among water contractors, environmental groups, and fisheries. The Senate-passed version of S. 2198, the \"Emergency Drought Relief Act,\" addresses water delivery curtailments resulting from the drought in California and other regions. Introduced in the 113th Congress, the bill focuses on Sections 4 through 8 and aims to provide operational flexibility and limits on environmental restrictions. The Senate-passed version of S. 2198, the \"Emergency Drought Relief Act,\" dropped many provisions and included direct spending measures to address emergency drought impacts in California and other states. It directs multiple government agencies to increase water supplies, prioritize funding for drought mitigation activities, provide emergency environmental reviews, and address water issues in the Klamath River Basin. The Senate-passed version of S. 2198 focuses on maximizing California water supplies, streamlining environmental reviews, and addressing specific water infrastructure issues. It includes provisions for emergency drought relief, project development directives, and a study on increasing water supplies through controlling an invasive plant species. The bill aims to maximize water supplies and streamline environmental reviews for the federal Central Valley Project and State Water Project. Key issues for Congress include ensuring adequate water supplies for irrigation and public health, as well as protecting endangered fish species. The bill directs federal agencies to operate within existing laws and regulations. The Senate-passed S. 2198 mandates certain operational activities for CVP and SWP, with unknown long-term consequences on listed species habitat and water supply. The bill includes sections on emergency drought relief and focuses on selected provisions that have received attention in congressional debates and media. The report focuses on S. 2198, discussing specific emergency actions related to California water supply management. It also addresses studying water supply effects and funding pilot water projects in the Colorado River Basin. Many provisions of the bill would expire upon suspension of the state emergency drought declaration. The Senate-passed version of S. 2198 would modify implementation of financial assistance for water resource and water quality programs. The EPA, under federal laws, would fund pilot projects to increase water supplies in the Colorado River Basin. Provisions focus on maximizing water availability for agricultural and municipal demand during an emergency drought declaration. Other sections would modify existing program authorizations. The Secretaries have broad authority to approve projects and operations to provide maximum water supplies to various contractors in California, including emergency projects and those following required procedures. The Secretaries have broad authority under Section 4(b) to approve projects that increase water supplies in California, including small conservation projects, large projects expanding storage facilities, and adjustments to reservoir operations. This authority also allows federal participation in state-driven drought projects, such as California's recent $687.4 million initiative. The goal is to provide flexibility and increase water supplies. The bill aims to increase water supplies in California by providing flexibility to federal agencies during periods of increased precipitation. Section 4(a) raises questions about how agencies would determine the \"maximum quantity of water supplies possible\" for contractors, which could be difficult and contentious to implement. Monitoring the effects on species survival, viability, and water quality may be challenging and not immediately quantifiable. Some stakeholders believe agencies are prioritizing water supplies over species, while others argue for relaxing laws. Balancing new directives with existing regulations makes it hard to predict the impact on projects and operations. The provision in S. 2198 aims to authorize projects and operations to provide additional water supplies quickly, but lacks specificity on what this means. Projects must be consistent with applicable law and could be conducted statewide, not just in specific service areas. The impact on projects and operations is uncertain due to the broad range of potential projects that could be authorized. The provision in S. 2198 authorizes projects and operations to provide additional water supplies quickly, with a requirement to be consistent with state and federal laws. The interpretation of \"consistent with the law\" versus other phrases like \"pursuant to\" or \"in compliance with\" is questioned, and it may be up to the courts to determine compliance with laws and regulations. The authority in Section 8 of the bill allows for projects to be implemented quickly during a drought emergency, with a requirement to comply with laws and regulations. The authority expires when the governor lifts the drought emergency declaration, raising questions about permanent authorization and funding for ongoing projects. This provision could streamline permit processes and feasibility studies, but the specifics are unclear. Section 4(c) of S. 2198 directs specific project-related and operational actions in California, aiming to increase water supplies and provide flexibility during periods of increased precipitation. The intent is to streamline processes, but the long-term impact on species decline is uncertain. Several provisions in Section 4(c) of S. 2198 address operational issues related to managing the CVP and SWP, including limitations on water deliveries due to endangered species and water quality regulations. These restrictions lead to disputes among water users, environmental groups, and fisheries interests. The subsections of Section 4(c) focus on projects impacting water deliveries, species viability, and water quality. Section 4(c) of S. 2198 addresses operational issues related to managing the CVP and SWP, including restrictions on water deliveries due to endangered species and water quality regulations. The provision in Section 4(c)(1) directs the Secretaries to keep the Delta Gates open to maximize peak tide flood periods for water supply benefits during the state's emergency drought declaration. Questions and potential issues may arise from changes in the operations of the Delta Gates. The provision in Section 4(c)(1) of S. 2198 directs the Secretaries to keep the Delta Gates open to maximize peak tide flood periods for water supply benefits during the state's emergency drought declaration. This would provide definitive authority for the Secretary of the Interior to maximize flows, as long as it is consistent with laws and regulations. The practical effect of the provision would depend on how state and federal agencies or courts determine the consistency with laws and regulations. Section 4(c)(1) of S. 2198 directs the Secretaries to operate Delta Gates in accordance with SWRCB orders and permits under the ESA. Data collection and assessment on the impact of gate operations on species, water quality, and supply is also required. The provision in S. 2198 directs the NMFS to make recommendations for changing the operations of the CVP and SWP, including potential changes to BiOps issued in 2009. It requires recommendations to address salmon populations in the Delta, but it is uncertain how these recommendations will impact the BiOps. There may be unintended consequences for stakeholders if NMFS implements modified recommendations. The provision in S. 2198 would result in changes to NMFS's implementation of its 2009 BiOp, directing strategies for turbidity control and managing reverse flow to minimize water supply reductions for the CVP and SWP. Uncertainty exists regarding the vetting and rapid implementation of existing strategies to address turbidity during drought conditions while complying with laws and regulations. Section 4(c)(3) would provide direct authority to manage flows with the goal of minimizing water supply reductions. Section 4(c)(3) in S. 2198 would give direct authority to manage flows to minimize water supply reductions for SWP and CVP users. It raises concerns about balancing this directive with other legal requirements like water quality and ESA regulations. The outcome depends on how Reclamation and DWR implement this provision and if it would result in different management compared to temporary operations or previous BiOps. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation challenges agencies face in balancing water supply maximization with species and habitat protection. It mentions the directive for a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for increased San Joaquin River flows during drought conditions. The ratio varies based on water year type, with a 2:1 ratio in dry years and a 3:1 ratio in below-normal years. The 2009 NMFS BiOp changes the water year type ratio to 2:1 in \"dry\" years, 3:1 in \"below normal\" years, and 4:1 in \"above normal\" and \"wet\" years. The goal is to allow 100% of transferred water to move through the Delta, but Reclamation assumes a 10% conveyance loss. Reclamation plans for a 1:1 ratio in 2014, which may not affect operations unless the hydrologic situation improves. The language in the provision could impact operations if hydrologic conditions improve or other opportunities arise. The net effect on water supply for export and fish and wildlife habitat is not addressed in the report. The Westlands Water District suggests that the provision, along with managing reverse flow in the OMR as directed in the 2008 FWS Delta Smelt BiOp, could potentially yield over 500,000 acre-feet of water for CVP and SWP exports. However, some environmental groups argue that this could harm salmon species if hydrologic conditions improve before a drought declaration is lifted. The 1:1 ratio in S. 2198 would be limited. The provision in S. 2198 would direct the Secretaries to issue permit decisions for barriers or gates in Delta channels within 30 days to improve water quantity and quality for water contractors. The barriers or gates should provide species benefits and protection without the need for formal ESA consultation. This directive may be controversial if relevant studies are not completed and considered in the decision-making process. The proposed barriers in the Delta have faced objections from boaters, with concerns raised about the 30-day time limit for decision-making. Temporary barriers and gates have been under study for years, with potential language changes affecting their purpose, particularly in the South Delta. The priority of the barriers project is to improve water quantity and quality for water contractors, while also aiming to reduce fisheries impacts and enhance circulation patterns in the area. The bill proposes temporary barriers and gates in the Delta to improve water quantity and quality for water users, while potentially impacting listed fish species and their habitat. Section 4(c)(6)(A) directs completion of necessary NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days of a request. Reclamation must complete NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days of a permit request for water transfers related to voluntary fallowing of nonpermanent crops in California. The process involves environmental analysis of water generated by the transfer proposal to determine its impact on water availability for the grower. Upon completion of the environmental analysis, Reclamation issues a biological assessment (BA) if the proposed action may affect a listed species, initiating consultation with FWS. FWS reviews potential harm to species like the giant garter snake due to fallowing of crops north of the Delta. The consultation process with FWS may take up to 135 days to complete. The consultation process with FWS regarding wetland areas may take up to 135 days. Reclamation aims to shorten this process. FWS might deny permits involving listed species to meet deadlines. Reclamation issues environmental assessments for transfers under NEPA. Water availability from fallowing in 2014 is uncertain, with estimates up to 80,000 acre-feet. The proposed legislation aims to expedite the NEPA and ESA requirements for water transfers through the Delta, potentially impacting species habitat and survival. It directs FWS to allow water transfer requests associated with fallowing to maximize water supplies for non-habitat use. The legislation's effect on the amount of water available for export from the Delta and its impact on species habitat and survival remain unclear. 4(c)(6)(A) directs the head of FWS to allow water transfer requests associated with fallowing to maximize water supplies for non-habitat use, potentially prioritizing agricultural, municipal, and industrial uses over wildlife refuges or rice fields supporting fish and wildlife. This raises concerns about potential water reductions for habitat uses. Section 4(c)(7) directs the Secretaries to participate in pilot projects to increase water in reservoirs in drought-affected river basins, specifically targeting California and the Colorado River basin. Funding would be provided to states for grants and participation in these projects. Section 4(c)(7) aims to address water supply concerns in the Colorado River Basin, which has seen decreasing water supplies over the last 14 years. Existing authority available to the Secretary of the Interior includes grants under the Department's WaterSMART program. Section 4(c)(8) would require the Secretaries to maintain rescheduled water supplies in San Luis Reservoir and Millerton Reservoir for the following year, unless storage capacity limitations prevent it. Rescheduling is currently done under agency guidelines, not as a matter of law. The spill priority at San Luis Reservoir and Millerton Lake is included in agency guidelines, causing operational problems during extreme low water supplies. In 2014, Reclamation faced challenges meeting rescheduled water supplies due to water shortages. The uncertainty of this policy, being in guidelines and not law, concerns water users who invest in water for the following year. Rescheduled water supplies are crucial for water contractors, impacting opportunity costs and other incurred expenses. Section 4(c)(9) directs the Secretaries to meet contract water supply needs of CVP refuges through water conservation measures, conveyance facilities, and wells. Funding would come from the Water Assistance Program or WaterSMART Program. Water obtained may be redirected from refuges to CVP contractors. The Central Valley Project refuges receive water supplies from various sources, including surface water contracts and wells. These supplies are categorized into Level 2 and Level 4, with Level 4 supplies being limited. The CVPIA allows for different options to increase water supply for fish and wildlife, such as purchases and project modifications. There is a directive to diversify water sources to minimize adverse effects on CVP contractors. The proposed provisions would potentially change the priority of CVP water delivery for wildlife refuges under CVPIA by finding new water sources and transferring water to CVP contractors. It is unclear if the quality of water would remain the same, and there is no mention of additional costs for water obtained through these new activities. Reclamation may presume that contractor deliveries supplement contract water supply, but this is not clear. The provision in Section 4(c)(10) would authorize coordination between the Secretaries and the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study on the effectiveness and environmental impacts of saltcedar tree biological control by the National Academy of Sciences. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of WaterSMART grant funding in California for emergency purposes such as drinking water, crop protection, economic losses from drought, and conservation technology with immediate water supply benefits. This provision only applies to WaterSMART funding in California. The provision in the bill would prioritize California projects for WaterSMART funding, specifically for offsite upstream projects in the Delta and upstream Sacramento River and San Joaquin River basins to offset the effects on ESA listed species. The projects could include habitat restoration, water quality improvements, storage, or flow adjustments. The term \"offsite\" is unclear in terms of location and type. Section 4(c)(13) of the bill directs the Secretaries to use all available scientific tools to identify and implement changes to real-time operations of water projects for additional water supplies. It raises questions about unused scientific tools and authority under current law. The provision must be consistent with existing laws and regulations. It is unclear how this provision adds to current authorities or practices. This subsection does not explicitly apply to California, unlike other subsections in Section 4. Section 4(d) states that the provisions apply to all federal agencies approving projects. Section 4 of the bill applies to all federal agencies involved in approving projects, including the Corps of Engineers. Federal agencies must use expedited procedures for water projects in California and address emergency drought conditions. The Secretary of the Interior must convene a final project decision meeting upon request from the state. The bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to convene a final project decision meeting with relevant federal agencies to approve emergency water supplies. The meeting must be held within seven days of the request, and a final decision on the project must be made within 10 days. The Secretary can also convene a meeting at any time without a request. Federal agency approval is not mandated. The bill establishes procedures to expedite federal agency decision-making on project approvals without mandating agency approval. This provision applies broadly to projects requested by state or agency heads and could override regular approval processes under laws like NEPA and ESA. Implementation details are unclear, but actions must be consistent with current laws and regulations. The bill aims to expedite federal agency decision-making on project approvals, potentially overriding regular approval processes. However, implementation details are unclear, raising questions about how final project decisions would be made within a 10-day timeframe. The bill aims to expedite federal agency decision-making on project approvals within a 10-day timeframe. Section 5 directs agencies to consult with the Council on Environmental Quality to develop alternative arrangements for compliance with NEPA during emergencies. This could impact how emergency federal projects in California demonstrate NEPA compliance. NEPA requires agencies to consider environmental impacts before final decisions on federal actions. Section 5 of the bill allows agencies to seek alternative compliance arrangements with NEPA during emergencies, specifically in California under the governor's drought emergency declaration. It is unclear which projects would qualify for such arrangements, and there is debate on whether certain projects mandated in Section 4(c) require NEPA review. Courts have ruled that if a law gives no agency discretion, NEPA does not apply. In cases where actions are strictly mandated by Congress, NEPA may not apply if the agency lacks discretion. Specific mandates like the 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for the San Joaquin River could lead to a court deciding that NEPA review is not required. Other environmental laws may still apply, regardless of NEPA's applicability. Agencies must still assess if the project complies with state or federal environmental requirements under other laws. Even without NEPA requirements, actions funded by S. 2198 must comply with other laws like the ESA and water quality laws. Section 6 addresses California's use of funds for wastewater and drinking water projects under the CWA and SDWA. S. 2198 does not provide additional funding for California's State Revolving Fund programs but directs the EPA in their administration. S. 2198 directs the EPA Administrator to prioritize water supply projects in California for areas at risk of water shortages. It also allows for expedited review of Buy American waiver requests and authorizes 40-year loan repayments to State Revolving Funds. The bill does not provide additional funding but focuses on the administration of existing programs. The bill S. 2198 prioritizes water supply projects in California for areas at risk of water shortages. It directs the state's priorities for awarding assistance among projects already eligible under the SRF programs, including water recycling, conservation, source water, and storage projects. California agencies administering the SRF programs have established procedures for project identification and prioritization. The bill S. 2198 prioritizes water supply projects in California for areas at risk of water shortages. It directs the state's priorities for awarding assistance among projects already eligible under the SRF programs. Intended Use Plans are prepared annually and open to public participation. The bill includes provisions for the expiration of authorities when the state-declared drought declaration is suspended by the governor. It also ensures that existing California state water rights protections are not preempted by the act."
