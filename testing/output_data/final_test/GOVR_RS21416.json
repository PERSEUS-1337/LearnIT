    "content": "In August 2001, the President announced the President's Management Agenda to improve the federal government's management and performance. It included five government-wide initiatives focused on adopting business-like principles to enhance performance. One of the initiatives was the Strategic Management of Human Capital, aiming to transform how the government employs, deploys, develops, and evaluates its workforce. The FY 2007 Budget discussed agencies strengthening performance appraisal systems, nurturing future leaders, improving hiring efficiency, and implementing Competitive Sourcing for federal activities. Improved Financial Performance aimed to provide better financial information for decision-making. Expanded Electronic Government focused on enhancing IT management. Electronic Government focused on improving service delivery through activities like GovBenefits.gov and Grants.gov. Performance Improvement integrated performance reviews with budget decisions, using program performance information like the program assessment rating tool (PART). President Bush's FY2003 budget submission included five management initiatives and a Management Scorecard to measure progress. Grades for agencies were updated quarterly by OMB based on a traffic light motif. The OMB updated agency grades quarterly based on a traffic light motif. Agencies had to meet core criteria to receive a green rating, with red indicating unsatisfactory performance and yellow showing partial success. As of December 31, 2008, several agencies had achieved green ratings for all five initiatives, while others had received no green ratings. The performance improvement initiative showed the most progress, with 18 agencies at green status. Financial performance and expanded electronic government had the most red grades, followed by competitive sourcing. The initiative progress as of December 31, 2008, showed 18 agencies at green status, with none failing at red. The human capital initiative had 14 green, 11 yellow, and one red. Agencies also received progress scores, with green for on track, yellow for some delays, and red for serious issues. Overall, OMB's grading for progress was higher than current status, with only five red grades out of 130. In 2007, 11 agencies had green progress on all initiatives, but by December 2008, only three did, indicating some slippage. The Administration introduced the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in 2002 to evaluate program performance. PART included sections on program purpose, design, planning, management, and accountability. OMB translated PART scores into qualitative ratings. By FY2008, the goal was to review virtually all federal programs using PART. President Bush included a separate volume on Performance and Management Assessments in the FY2004 and FY2005 budgets. In FY2004, the budget for FY2005 included a brief discussion of the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) with detailed information provided on a CD-ROM. Access to PART data was improved in 2006 with the launch of ExpectMore.gov. By FY2007, the percentage of programs rated as \"results not demonstrated\" decreased from 50% to 19%. Programs in the effective, moderately effective, and adequate categories showed increases from FY2002 to FY2007. The percentage of programs rated ineffective declined from 5% to 3%. President Bush emphasized the importance of management reforms for federal government performance and results. A House subcommittee held an oversight hearing on \"Management and the President's Budget,\" where OMB officials noted that the Scorecard is working but many agencies still show problems. Significant improvement has been seen in implementing governmentwide PMA initiatives, although progress has been uneven. OMB Deputy Director for Management Clay Johnson III testified that agencies are better managed and achieving greater results than before, as reflected in the Scorecard. The PART process has been effective in improving program performance. Director Johnson highlighted the effectiveness of the PART process in improving program performance and building on the foundation of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Subcommittee chairman Todd Platts expressed interest in codifying the requirement for coordinated program evaluations like PART. Mr. Johnson emphasized the importance of conducting assessments of program performance to complement the GPRA framework. On February 25, 2004, Representative Platts introduced H.R. 3826, the Program Assessment and Results Act (PARA), to amend GPRA and establish a statutory requirement for program reviews. The bill aimed to have OMB review each program activity at least once every five years. H.R. 3826 was favorably reported in the House, but no further action was taken. In the 109th Congress, a PARA bill was reintroduced as H.R. 185, which also saw no further action. The Congress considered other measures related to the President's management initiatives, including the establishment of new statutory commissions. President Bush proposed the creation of \"Results Commissions\" to review and revise proposals for restructuring federal programs, with plans submitted to Congress for expedited consideration. He also called for a Sunset Commission to conduct systematic reviews of programs, terminating those not reauthorized by Congress. Executive Order 13450 required agency heads to set clear goals, prepare plans for achieving them, and measure progress and resource efficiency. Executive Order 13450, issued by President Bush in November 2007, aimed to institutionalize a results-driven culture in government spending. It required agency heads to designate a performance improvement officer and established a Performance Improvement Council chaired by OMB's Deputy Director for Management. This order was a response to the unsuccessful legislative efforts to provide a statutory basis for the Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in previous Congresses. The goal was to ensure transparency in agency and program performance to enable taxpayers to hold the government accountable for spending wisely and effectively. The Executive Order 13450 aimed to institutionalize a results-driven culture in government spending by requiring agency heads to designate a performance improvement officer. OMB Director Peter Orszag criticized the PART system for focusing too much on process and not being effective. OMB Director Peter Orszag criticized the PART system for being ineffective and focused too much on process rather than outcomes. He pledged to replace PART with a more effective evaluation system in collaboration with Congress and executive agencies."
