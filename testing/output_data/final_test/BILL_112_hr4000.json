    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Energizing America through Employment Act\". Congress finds that President George W. Bush delegated authority to the Department of State to oversee cross-border pipeline projects, including the Keystone XL pipeline. The Department of State issued a final environmental impact statement stating no significant environmental impact for the project. The Department of State failed to uphold Executive Order 13337 by not making a national interest determination for the Keystone XL pipeline project. Congress has the authority to regulate commerce and the construction of the pipeline will bring job creation and economic benefits to the United States. The project's completion serves the national interest. The approval of the Keystone XL pipeline project is in the national interest, bringing job creation and economic benefits to the United States. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. is authorized to construct and operate pipeline facilities for importing crude oil at the US-Canada border in Montana, as per the application filed in 2008. No permit is required under Executive Order 13337 for this project. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. is authorized to construct, connect, operate, and maintain facilities at the US-Canada border without needing an additional environmental impact statement. The final environmental impact statement issued by the Department of State in 2011 satisfies all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act for the Keystone XL Pipeline project in the United States. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. is authorized to construct, connect, operate, and maintain cross-border facilities and related facilities in the United States as described in the application filed with the Department of State on September 19, 2008. Any permits issued before the enactment of this Act shall remain in effect. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. must comply with specified conditions during construction and operation. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. is required to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits from Canadian and US authorities for the construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities. They must also take measures to prevent environmental impact and protect historic properties. The construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the facilities must be similar to the application filed with the Department of State and the final environmental impact statement. It should also be carried out in accordance with the construction, mitigation, and reclamation measures agreed upon in the construction mitigation and reclamation plan. The special conditions, measures, and stipulations outlined in appendices U, H, and S of the final environmental impact statement must be adhered to by the owners and operators of the project, as agreed upon with the Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Route and construction measures in Nebraska for the project must be submitted to the Secretary of State and approved before construction can begin in the state. The State of Nebraska must submit route and construction measures to the Secretary of State for approval before construction can commence. Upon receipt, the route for the project in Nebraska will replace the previously specified route. The Secretary of State or Federal official must provide assistance within 30 days of Nebraska's request, consistent with Nebraska state law. Any actions to implement this section, including route modifications, fall under administration. The construction of cross-border facilities for pipelines does not require major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. State laws regarding pipeline siting remain unchanged. Existing processes for securing access to private property for project construction are not affected. Federal judicial review applies to approved cross-border and related facilities in the United States. The construction of cross-border pipelines approved under Federal law can only be judicially reviewed on direct appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. SEC. 4. REFERRAL OF APPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE CROSS-BORDER PIPELINE FACILITIES AT THE UNITED STATES BORDERS. Referral of Application for National Interest Determination under Executive Order 13337 with respect to pipeline facilities at US borders for importing crude oil and hydrocarbons. Secretary of State to refer applications to relevant departments, agencies, and Congress committees for their views. Committees include the Committee on Foreign Relations. The Secretary of State refers applications for National Interest Determination under Executive Order 13337 to relevant departments, agencies, and Congress committees. Committees involved include the Committee on Foreign Relations, Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate, and Foreign Affairs, Transportation and Infrastructure, Energy and Commerce, and Natural Resources in the House of Representatives."
