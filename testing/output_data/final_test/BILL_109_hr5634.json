    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advanced Energy Initiative Act of 2006\". Definitions are provided in Section 2. The Act \"Advanced Energy Initiative Act of 2006\" provides definitions for key terms such as biomass, cellulosic feedstock, engineering-scale, National Laboratory, and plug-in hybrid motor vehicle. The Act \"Advanced Energy Initiative Act of 2006\" defines a plug-in hybrid motor vehicle as a vehicle that can operate on liquid fuel or electric power, uses regenerative braking technology, and can run on electric power for at least 20 miles in city driving conditions. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 3. FUTUREGEN. The Secretary will conduct a project to demonstrate advanced clean coal energy technology for electricity generation, aiming for significant reductions in emissions by 2012. The project aims to achieve a 90 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and demonstrate the feasibility of electricity generation from coal using advanced clean coal technology with carbon capture and geological sequestration at a cost not exceeding 10 percent higher than the average of all commercial integrated coal gasification and combined cycle electric generating plants in the United States. The Secretary will ensure that the project utilizes available advanced clean coal technology to reduce technical risk and focus development efforts on system integration. The project aims to achieve a 90 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by utilizing advanced clean coal technology, such as coal gasifier technology. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2007 to 2012. SEC. 4. ADVANCED FUEL CYCLE TECHNOLOGIES FOR NUCLEAR POWER. The Secretary will implement a program for advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies to generate electricity and industrial heat, including spent fuel recycling and waste reduction.

The Secretary will develop a modeling and simulation capability for advanced nuclear fuel cycle systems, including spent fuel separations, burner reactor, fuel fabrication, and thermal reactor technologies. The Secretary will develop a modeling and simulation capability for advanced nuclear fuel cycle systems, including advanced thermal reactor technologies and waste disposal technologies. The plan will consider technology choices, engineering impacts, and mass flows of nuclear fuel and spent nuclear fuel. The Secretary will conduct a thorough analysis of possible configurations of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle system, including advanced burner and thermal reactors, to reduce the toxicity of spent nuclear fuel components. Compatibility of the fuel cycle system will also be examined. The Secretary will develop a detailed plan for research on advanced nuclear fuel cycle system technologies based on compatibility analysis of system components. This plan will include proposed technology options and engineering-scale demonstrations. The Secretary will develop a detailed plan for research on advanced nuclear fuel cycle system technologies, including engineering-scale demonstrations of system component technologies. The plan will estimate design, engineering, construction, and operating costs, and consider integrating advanced thermal reactors to reduce the toxicity of spent nuclear fuel. Consultation with technical experts from US and foreign companies is required. The Secretary will collaborate with various experts and organizations, including reprocessing facilities, technical experts from US electric utilities, economists in nuclear power, the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, a review of the plan will be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2008, which includes the research plan, National Academy of Sciences review, and the Secretary's response. Construction of a demonstration facility processing 500 kilograms or more of nuclear fuel is prohibited until 90 days after the report. Authorization of Appropriations: Amounts authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 are allocated for the Secretary to carry out the section for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. SEC. 5.
