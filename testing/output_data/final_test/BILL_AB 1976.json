    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts a bill to address unique circumstances affecting members of entities authorized in the Food and Agricultural Code related to agricultural products. A new section is added to allow advisory board meetings by teleconference with specific requirements for participation. The advisory board must designate a primary physical meeting location for in-person attendance, with at least one member present. Meeting agenda must include teleconference and remote access information. The board must provide details on meeting locations and teleconference participation. Prior to holding a teleconference meeting, the advisory board must adopt guidelines addressing technical difficulties, transparency, and public participation. For meetings held by teleconference, members must be listed in the minutes and provide notice of participation at least 24 hours in advance. The commission or council must designate a primary physical meeting location for participants to attend, with at least one member present. The agenda must include teleconference and remote access information for public participation. The commission or council must provide details on meeting locations and teleconference participation, including member identities. Prior to holding a teleconference meeting, the commission or council must adopt guidelines addressing technical difficulties, transparency, and public participation. The Food and Agricultural Code is amended to define \"producer\" or \"grower\" and establish the California Avocado Commission with specified members. The California Avocado Commission is composed of producers and handlers elected from different districts, with a public member appointed by the secretary. Each district also has an alternate producer member. The California Avocado Commission includes producers and handlers elected from various districts, with an alternate member for each district. The alternate members can sit in place of absent members and have the same rights and powers when on the commission. Amendments to the Food and Agricultural Code specify the election and roles of alternate handler members. Amendments to the Food and Agricultural Code address vacancies on the California Avocado Commission, specifying the process for filling vacant member or alternate member positions. The new regulations require that the replacement member meets all qualifications set forth in the article. Section 67054 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to require producer members on the California Avocado Commission to have a financial interest in avocado production within the district they stand for election in. This ensures that elected members are actively involved in avocado production. Handler and alternate handler members must have a financial interest in avocado handling for markets, handling at least 1% of the total industry volume in the previous year to be nominated and elected. Public members on the commission cannot have a financial interest in the avocado industry, except for nominating another public member. Section 67059 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to specify that a quorum of the commission shall consist of nine or ten voting members based on the number of districts. The vote of a majority of members present at a meeting with a quorum will constitute the act of the commission. Additionally, Section 67081 requires the secretary to establish lists of producers in each district, with handlers submitting producer information within 60 days of a written request. Any avocado producer not listed by the secretary can be added by submitting a signed statement to the commission. Being absent from the list does not exempt the producer from paying assessments. The commission may recommend to the secretary to suspend its operations if a majority of voting members find that the chapter has not achieved its goals. A referendum will be conducted among producers to decide on the suspension, with a minimum of 10 days for the referendum period. The secretary can suspend the chapter if at least 40 percent of producers participate in a referendum lasting 10 to 60 days. Additional procedures may be prescribed by the secretary for the referendum. Producers can vote to suspend the chapter if certain criteria are met: either 65% or more of producers voting must market 51% or more of total avocados, or 51% or more of producers voting must market 65% or more of total avocados. The Legislature acknowledges that new sections added to the Food and Agricultural Code may limit public access rights, as per the California Constitution. This is to protect certain interests and justify the limitations imposed. The state aims to revise teleconference requirements for food and agriculture advisory boards to facilitate participation by directors in remote locations."
