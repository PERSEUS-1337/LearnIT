The Secretary will make grants to eligible partnerships under subsection (b) from appropriated funds to carry out activities described in section 373 for a five-year period. An eligible partnership includes minority-serving institutions awarding baccalaureate degrees and partner institutions. Other entities like community colleges, community-based organizations, and businesses may also be part of partnerships under this section. Under this section, definitions for 'minority-serving institution' and 'partner institution' are provided. A minority-serving institution is eligible for assistance under specific sections, while a partner institution offers degrees not awarded by minority-serving institutions. Application requirements for eligible partnerships include listing partner names and responsibilities, as well as providing a partnership agreement.

These scholarships do not affect Federal Pell Grants eligibility and cannot exceed the student's cost of attendance. The program allocates funds for scholarships for minority students at minority-serving institutions and partner institutions. Additionally, there is an authorization of $40,000,000 for Part F for fiscal year 2001 and subsequent years. The Act will be effective upon its enactment."
