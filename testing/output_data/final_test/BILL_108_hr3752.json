The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 requires the Secretary to publish proposed regulations within 12 months and issue final regulations within 18 months. Licenses and permits for launch vehicles with human beings on board may be issued before regulations are finalized. The Secretary must issue guidelines or advisory circulars to guide the implementation of the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 until final regulations are issued. No licenses for launch or reentry of vehicles with humans on board may be issued three years after the Act's enactment without final regulations in place. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on gradually eliminating the liability risk sharing regime for commercial space transportation in the US. The study will assess methods to eliminate the regime by 2008 or soon after, including incremental approaches. Additionally, a technical amendment repeals Section 102(c) of the Commercial Space Act of 1998.
