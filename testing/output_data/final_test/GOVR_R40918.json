    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee approved America's Healthy Future Act of 2009 on October 13, 2009. S. 1796, based on the approved measure, was ordered reported on October 19. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the legislation would reduce federal deficits by $81 billion over 10 years and insure 94% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The bill focuses on restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance to certain individuals. The bill includes provisions for individuals to maintain health insurance and for certain employers to provide insurance or pay a tax. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue would be implemented, linked to essential health benefits coverage. Qualifying coverage includes QHBPs, new group or individual coverage meeting minimum health benefits, grandfathered plans, and other coverage like Medicare and Medicaid. States could establish separate exchanges for individual and small group coverage. The bill allows for the establishment of separate exchanges for individual and small group coverage, with the option for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with a nongovernmental entity to operate exchanges in states that do not establish them. Exchanges would provide access to private plans for eligible individuals and small businesses, with financial assistance available for those with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. States have the flexibility to create basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid, while existing employer and individual market plans would be grandfathered. Title VI of the bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as excise taxes and annual fees on health insurers. It also limits contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and itemized deductions for health care expenses. New plans in the individual and group market must meet minimum requirements specified in the bill to satisfy individuals and employers. Existing small group plans must meet private market reforms by July 1, 2013. This report provides background information on the private health insurance market and summarizes key provisions of the America's Healthy Future Act of 2009 affecting private health insurance. The provisions aim to reform how current private health insurance markets function, with most effective from July 1, 2013. The provisions are interrelated and include changes for individuals purchasing coverage directly. The private health insurance market functions for individuals buying coverage directly from insurers or through small employers. S. 1796 would prevent insurers from excluding or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, but this could lead to adverse selection and higher premiums. AHIP has stated that if reforms limit insurers' tools to guard against adverse selection, all individuals must be required to have insurance. The private health insurance market requires all individuals to have coverage to prevent adverse selection and higher premiums. Adequate premium subsidies must be provided to make the individual mandate practical, which is necessary for market reforms. Premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies may result in individuals having insurance they cannot afford to use. Title VI of the healthcare legislation covers provisions related to private health insurance, including the individual mandate, employer requirements, private health insurance market reforms, Health Care Cooperatives, and premium subsidies. Americans can obtain health insurance through various methods, such as the private sector or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, with employers choosing to offer coverage either through insurance or self-funding. Approximately 46 million individuals (15% of the population) were uninsured. Individuals and employers purchasing health insurance fit into the large group, small group, or nongroup market segments. Large employers, who make up over 96% of the market, can obtain lower premiums compared to small employers. Larger employers can secure lower premiums for health insurance due to their larger risk pool, which makes costs more predictable. States have tried creating platforms for individuals and small employers to compare insurance plans and pool risks, learning from past failures like California's PacAdvantage. Private-sector companies also play a role in facilitating this process. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Insurers view small firms as less stable than larger ones, as one or two employees moving in or out of the pool can have a significant impact on risk. Small employers also face disadvantages compared to larger counterparts in providing health insurance. Small firms face challenges compared to larger counterparts in providing health insurance, such as being medically underwritten, having limited market power, and lacking economies of scale. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or higher premiums based on health status in the nongroup market. Reforms in premium ratings could increase or decrease premiums based on age, health, and behaviors. States regulate private health insurance. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups, and some states extend this to self-employed individuals and non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Premium rating rules are imposed by most states. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating and rate bands. Pure community rating means all enrollees pay the same premium regardless of health or age. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in nongroup markets, with New York also using it in the small group market. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for age or gender. Rate bands allow limited premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. In the small group and individual markets, states impose premium rating rules ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating and rate bands. Rate bands allow limited premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state, with federal laws requiring limits on pre-existing condition exclusions for group health plans and health insurance issuers. Many states have rules providing consumer protection above the federal standard for pre-existing condition exclusion. Some proponents advocate for a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of insurance market reform, citing potential cost savings and increased competition. Opponents raise concerns about fairness and government advantage in setting prices. Non-profit health insurance plans have been shown to outperform for-profit plans in terms of quality, as indicated by various studies. Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have also demonstrated strong performance in recent case studies. Opponents worry that these advantages could drive private plans out of the market. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations like Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners of Minnesota. Advocates argue that health insurance co-operatives invest earnings back into the plan, resulting in lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative programs. Opponents claim co-operatives have not been successful nationwide and may not make health insurance more affordable. Congressional attention has been on incentivizing new co-operatives through options like S. 1796. S. 1796 would establish new health insurance plans in the private market, including qualified health benefits plans (QHBP) that comply with federal standards and essential benefit requirements. A qualified basic health plan would be established by the state for eligible individuals, providing coverage equal to essential benefits with a medical loss ratio of at least 85%. The Senate Finance bill defines terms related to health insurance applicable to Title I. The Senate Finance bill defines terms related to health insurance applicable to Title I, including the definition of \"Health benefits plan,\" \"Offeror,\" and essential health benefits coverage under various health insurance plans. The Senate Finance bill includes a mandate for individuals age 18 and over to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The penalty amount would increase annually, reaching $750 in 2017, with a limit of no more than two times the penalty amount for the taxpayer and dependents. Members of Congress and congressional staff would also be affected by this mandate. Members of Congress and congressional staff would be eligible to enroll in a QHBP in the individual market through a state exchange, with employer contributions only allowed for the chosen QHBP. Subsidies would assist some individuals with premium and cost-sharing payments, while exemptions from the individual mandate would apply to certain groups, such as those without coverage for less than 90 days and Indians defined in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Individuals exempt from the mandate include those without coverage for less than 90 days, Indians defined in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, those with qualifying religious exemptions, individuals in a health care sharing ministry, undocumented aliens, and those with adjusted gross income below 100% of the federal poverty level. The Secretary of Labor can exempt individuals facing hardships in obtaining coverage. Those whose required contribution exceeds 8% of household income are also exempt. Employers with over 50 full-time employees may face penalties for not providing coverage. Employers with over 50 full-time employees may face penalties for not providing coverage. Those who choose to offer health insurance must follow specific rules, such as grandfathering current plans, offering coverage in a QHBP for small employers, and meeting requirements for group health plans for large employers. Employees may not be considered covered if their required contribution exceeds 10% of household income or if the plan's share of total costs is less than 65%. Employers with more than 50 employees may face penalties for not providing health insurance coverage. They must file a return with employee information and provide notice about the health insurance exchange. Penalties may apply if full-time employees enroll in a QHBP with premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies. The penalty for employers not offering health coverage is limited to $400 per employee, with a maximum penalty of $40,000 for the firm. Small businesses may be eligible for a tax credit towards their health insurance costs. Small businesses could receive a tax credit for up to 50% of their contribution towards health insurance coverage if they have 10 or fewer full-time employees with average wages of $20,000 or less. The credit phases out as wages increase to $40,000 and the number of employees increases to 25. Employees with compensation over $80,000 are not eligible for the credit. Adjustments for inflation would be made after 2010. The Senate Finance bill proposes tax credits for small businesses with up to 25 employees, including non-profit organizations, for health insurance coverage. Seasonal workers are exempt from the calculation. The bill also aims to reduce administrative costs for businesses offering cafeteria plans. S. 1796 simplifies nondiscrimination testing for small business cafeteria plans by establishing safe harbor requirements. It also sets new federal standards for private health insurance plans in the individual and small group markets. The proposed standards would impact the small employer market by imposing new requirements on states regarding insurance risk allocation and benefit coverage. States could define small employers as having 100 or fewer employees before 2015, and this definition would apply to all small employers starting in 2015. Large employers would also be affected by certain provisions, such as the prohibition of unreasonable annual or lifetime limits on health insurance plans offered in the large and small group markets after 2009. Additionally, health plans in the large group market would be required to cover preventive services without cost-sharing after June 30, 2013. Employers with more than 200 employees offering coverage must automatically enroll new employees in a plan unless they opt out. All new health benefit plans in the individual and small group market must be qualified health benefit plans (QHBPs) meeting insurance rating reforms and essential benefits package requirements. QHBPs must be certified by the state and comply with regulations set by the Secretary or state. Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) must provide coverage for essential benefits, charge the same premium regardless of purchase method, and comply with federal health insurance standards. They are prohibited from excluding coverage for pre-existing conditions and must offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis in the individual and small group markets. Require QHBPs to offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis, determine premiums using adjusted community rating rules in established rating areas. Under S. 1796, health insurance premiums would only be allowed to vary based on specified ratios for factors like family enrollment, age, and tobacco use. The bill also requires health benefit plans to provide a standardized outline of coverage. Additionally, provisions in S. 1796 address variations in insurance risk among plan enrollees and across health plans. Provisions in S. 1796 address variations in insurance risk among plan enrollees by requiring pooling of risk, merging individual and small group markets, implementing risk adjustment models, and establishing reinsurance programs by each state. The program requires all plan offerors to contribute to a temporary reinsurance program for individual policies, shifting the risk of high expenses from insurers to a reinsurer. Additionally, the Secretary is mandated to establish and administer temporary risk corridors to adjust payments to plans based on actual expenses. The Secretary is required to establish temporary high risk pools and a reinsurance program to assist plans with high expenses. Funding for the reinsurance program would not exceed $5 billion. The Secretary would reimburse the plan for 80% of the portion of a claim above $15,000 and below $90,000. Amounts paid to the plan would lower costs for participants in premiums, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket costs. The Senate Finance bill would require states to implement regulations for private markets, establish exchanges, and require QHBPs to have appeal processes. States could also establish programs for automatic enrollment in QHBPs and maintain health insurance requirements for consumer protection. The Senate Finance bill would allow QHBPs to operate in multiple states under one state's regulations. Plans could offer coverage in grandfathered plans for current enrollees, dependents, and new employees. Insurance reform requirements, such as prohibiting pre-existing condition exclusions, would apply to grandfathered plans in the small group market starting July 1, 2013. States could phase in requirements for QHBPs. The Secretary would specify the benefits included in the \"essential benefits package\" that qualified health benefits plans would be required to cover, including hospitalization, outpatient services, professional services, and medical care. Grandfathered plans in the small group market would also be subject to insurance reform requirements. The essential benefits package for qualified health plans includes a range of services such as prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive care, maternity benefits, and well baby care. Cost-sharing is limited, and annual or lifetime limits are prohibited. The Senate Finance bill requires the Secretary to specify covered treatments, items, and services within each category of the essential benefits package. States must ensure at least one plan in the exchange is equivalent to the standard Blue Cross Blue Shield plan for Federal employees. S. 1796 mandates insurers to offer QHBPs with the essential benefits package in the individual or small group market. The Senate Finance bill mandates insurers in the individual or small group market to offer QHBPs with essential benefits at bronze, silver, gold, or platinum tiers. Insurers can offer separate plans for those under 21 or dependents. Additionally, S. 1796 allows for catastrophic plans for young adults under 26. The catastrophic plan for young adults under 26 would have no cost-sharing for preventive services but a deductible equal to the largest annual out-of-pocket maximum permitted for QHBPs. S. 1796 would establish a program modeled after the Basic Health Plan program in Washington State, which provides health insurance coverage for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. The Washington State HCA contracts with private health plans to implement the BH program, with five private insurers participating. S. 1796 would establish a program for states to offer basic health plans to eligible individuals instead of through an exchange, with premiums and cost-sharing not exceeding QHBPs costs. The Senate Finance bill mandates that states establish a competitive process for contracting with coverage providers under the qualified basic health plan. This process includes negotiations on payment rates, premiums, cost-sharing, and additional benefits. Providers must adhere to specific performance measures focusing on quality of care and outcomes, with data being made available to enrollees. The bill requires states to establish a competitive process for contracting with coverage providers under the qualified basic health plan, including negotiations on payment rates, premiums, and cost-sharing. The Secretary would provide funds to states meeting program requirements to offer affordable health care coverage through private health care systems. Funding would be based on estimates of individual tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies, distributed to states to reduce premiums and cost-sharing for eligible individuals. If states do not implement reforms by July 1, 2013, the Secretary would implement them. The bill requires states to establish a competitive process for contracting with coverage providers under the qualified basic health plan. States that do not implement reforms by July 1, 2013, will have the Secretary implement and enforce those requirements. Exchanges would be established by July 1, 2013, to provide access to insurers' plans for eligible individuals and small businesses. The Senate Finance bill calls for the creation of separate exchanges in each state for individuals and small employers. States can merge them into a single exchange if separate resources are available. Plans offered by insurers in individual and small group markets must be offered through an exchange. Insurers must offer plans in silver and gold tiers, with the option to offer bronze and platinum tiers as well as catastrophic and child-only plans. Exchanges could operate in multiple states with approval. The exchange could also include dental-only plans. The Secretary would enter into an agreement with each state to specify functions done by the Secretary, the state, or the exchange: certify, recertify, and decertify QHBPs; establish outreach plan, call centers, internet portals, and a system to rate exchange plans; determine eligibility; provide enrollment in person, by mail, by telephone, or electronically; open enrollment periods from March 1 through May 31. The exchange would provide open enrollment periods from March 1 through May 31 starting in 2013, establish uniform enrollment forms and marketing requirements, offer a calculator for determining coverage costs, certify exemptions from the individual mandate excise tax, and provide advance determination of premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies. The HHS Secretary would designate an office for technical assistance to states for SHOP exchanges. The Secretary would pay states for unreimbursed start-up costs for exchanges, funded by assessments on QHBPs. States must allow insurance agents to enroll individuals in exchange plans. Only small employers can offer coverage through an exchange, with restrictions on who can enroll. Undocumented aliens are prohibited from obtaining coverage. Beginning in 2015, small employers with 100 or fewer employees can offer coverage through an exchange. States have the option to allow large employers to obtain coverage through an exchange starting in 2017. Employers can limit the choice of exchange plans available to their employees. Members of Congress and congressional staff must enroll in an exchange plan to receive their employer's contribution towards premiums. Beginning January 1, 2013, individuals could receive tax credits for purchasing health insurance through an exchange. Premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies would be available for silver plans, including both private and public options. Eligibility for these subsidies would be based on income, with those above 400% of the federal poverty level not qualifying. Individuals above 400% of the federal poverty level would not be eligible for tax credits towards purchasing an exchange plan. Those between 300% and 400% FPL would pay no more than 12% of their incomes in premiums. The percentage of income towards premiums for those between 133% and 300% FPL would increase from 2% to 12%. Premium credit amount is based on the second lowest cost silver plan in the exchange, with cost-sharing subsidies available only for credit-eligible individuals enrolled in a silver plan. S. 1796 expands Medicaid eligibility up to 133% FPL for non-elderly citizens. Legal permanent residents below 100% FPL may be ineligible for Medicaid and premium credits in 2013, but would be eligible starting in 2014. Beginning in 2014, lawfully present taxpayers below 100% FPL who are not eligible for Medicaid would be eligible for premium credits. Individuals would generally be ineligible for credits if they were eligible for employer-sponsored plans, Medicare, Medicaid, military service coverage, FEHBP, or other recognized coverage. Those enrolled in an exchange plan at the silver tier could receive assistance in paying cost-sharing for health services. Exchange plans would be required to meet certain criteria for eligibility. In 2009, out-of-pocket maximums for HSA-qualified HDHPs are $5,800 for single coverage and $11,600 for family coverage. Cost-sharing subsidies would reduce these maximums for qualifying individuals based on income levels. Additional subsidies may be provided to ensure equivalent plan cost-sharing for qualifying individuals at different income levels. S. 1796 would provide cost-sharing subsidies for qualifying individuals based on income levels, with periodic payments to insurers. Subsidy amounts could be reduced to prevent increasing the federal deficit. The bill also incentivizes the creation of health insurance co-operatives through $6 billion in funding under the CO-OP program. S. 1796 would establish health insurance co-operatives through the CO-OP program, with federal funds distributed as loans and grants. The Secretary would prioritize applicants offering statewide health benefits, using an integrated care model, and having private support. Funding would ensure at least one non-profit insurer in each state and D.C., with grants available to encourage establishment or expansion if needed. S. 1796 would establish health insurance co-operatives through the CO-OP program, with federal funds distributed as loans and grants. Grantees would enter into an agreement with the Secretary to follow the provisions of S. 1796 and any regulations promulgated by the Secretary, including prohibitions on certain uses of funds. Qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers must meet specific requirements outlined in the bill. The health insurance co-operatives established through the CO-OP program must meet specific requirements, including governance by majority vote of members, consumer focus, compliance with regulations, and coordination with state insurance reforms. The CO-OP program requires organizations to coordinate with state insurance reforms and use profits to lower premiums or improve benefits. They can enter collective purchasing arrangements for cost efficiencies and establish a purchasing council for agreements, but cannot set payment rates for healthcare facilities or providers. The Secretary of HHS is prohibited from participating in negotiations between health insurance issuers and healthcare providers. Organizations in the CO-OP program may qualify for tax exemption if they comply with program requirements. CO-OP grantees must adhere to tax law requirements for non-profits, including restrictions on earnings benefiting individuals, political involvement, and lobbying. They need to apply for exempt status with the IRS, report annually, disclose state solvency requirements, and reserves. Health plans under S. 1796 are not mandated to cover elective abortions or those funded by HHS. S. 1796 allows funds appropriated to HHS to be used for abortions in specific circumstances. The offeror of a health benefits plan decides if abortion coverage is included. The Secretary of HHS must ensure at least one plan in the exchange covers elective abortions and those permitted by HHS funds, while another plan must not cover elective abortions. The Secretary must ensure that at least one health benefits plan in the exchange covers elective abortions and those permitted by HHS funds. Plans offering abortion coverage cannot use premium assistance credits or subsidies for such services and must segregate an amount equal to the actuarial value of providing elective abortions for all enrollees. The Secretary estimates the cost of including abortion coverage on an average actuarial basis. The Secretary must estimate the costs of including abortion coverage for the entire population, with a minimum cost of $1 per enrollee per month. Qualified health benefits plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers based on their stance on abortions. State laws on abortion coverage and funding, as well as federal conscience protection and antidiscrimination laws, would not be affected by S. 1796. The Senate Finance bill includes revenue provisions in Title VI to fund expanded health insurance coverage, such as excise taxes and limitations on employer deductions impacting health insurers. There are also modifications to tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending. Table 3 outlines the revenue provisions related to private health insurance and their estimated revenues over a 10-year period. S. 1796, a bill in the Senate Finance, includes provisions to raise $304 billion in revenues over 10 years. It imposes excise taxes on health insurers and plan administrators, limits deductibility of executive compensation, affects retiree health insurance, and imposes a 40% excise tax on high-cost health insurance coverage exceeding certain thresholds in 2013. The bill in the Senate Finance aims to raise $304 billion in revenues over 10 years through various measures. This includes imposing excise taxes on health insurers and plan administrators, limiting deductibility of executive compensation, affecting retiree health insurance, and implementing a 40% excise tax on high-cost health insurance coverage exceeding specific thresholds in 2013. The thresholds for single and family coverage are $8,000 and $21,000 respectively, with adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus 1% in subsequent years. Taxpayers aged 55 and older, retired individuals, and high-risk workers face higher thresholds. Residents in high-cost states will see phased-in thresholds between 2013 and 2016. The excise tax applies to various health insurance payments, including premiums for dental and vision, as well as contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs and HSAs. The bill aims to raise revenues through excise taxes on health insurers and plan administrators, limiting deductibility of executive compensation, and implementing a 40% excise tax on high-cost health insurance coverage. Employers would be responsible for determining the aggregate amount of health insurance coverage subject to the excise tax and estimating the share of the tax allocated to the insurer. The excise tax on health insurance coverage would be reported to insurers, plan administrators, and the IRS, with penalties for under-reporting. The tax is estimated to raise $201 billion from 2010 to 2019 and would apply to one-third of health plans by 2019. Additionally, a fee based on market share would be imposed on all health insurers starting in 2010, excluding self-insured plans. The Senate Finance bill includes a fee on health insurers based on market share, expected to raise $60.4 billion over 10 years. It also limits deductible executive compensation for health insurance providers with certain income thresholds, effective after 2012. The Senate Finance bill includes a provision to limit deductible executive compensation for health insurance providers, effective after 2012. This limitation would raise $600 million over a 10-year period. Additionally, S. 1796 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage. The provision in S. 1796 would reduce the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage by the federal subsidy received, raising $5.4 billion over 10 years. This bill includes provisions affecting tax-advantaged accounts for health care expenses like FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs. These accounts allow workers to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. The bill S. 1796 includes provisions to limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per FSA starting in 2011, raising $14.6 billion over 10 years. HSAs are also tax-advantaged accounts for medical expenses, allowing individuals to fund unreimbursed costs on a pre-tax basis and accumulate funds over time. Unlike FSAs, HSAs can be rolled over. S. 1796 proposes increasing the penalty on non-qualified distributions from HSAs to 20% of the disbursed amount, aiming to raise $1.3 billion over 10 years. The bill also seeks to modify the definition of qualified medical expenses by excluding over-the-counter prescriptions, except those prescribed by a physician. The proposed bill, S. 1796, aims to increase the threshold for deducting medical expenses from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income for taxpayers under 65. This change would limit the amount of medical expenses that can be deducted, affecting taxpayers with adjusted gross income below $50,000 the most. The proposed bill, S. 1796, aims to increase the threshold for deducting medical expenses from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income for taxpayers under 65, limiting deductions for those with income below $50,000. Taxpayers over 65 would still be subject to the 7.5% limit, with the provision projected to raise $15.2 billion over 10 years."
