    "content": "The report provides information on EPA's Boiler MACT standards and three related rules for small boilers and boilers using solid waste as fuel. Changes were finalized on December 20, 2012, giving owners until 2016 to meet new emission standards. The EPA announced a stay on the effective dates of the Boiler MACT rule in May 2011 to reconsider the rules and compliance deadlines. Despite a court vacating the stay in January 2012, the EPA issued a \"No Action Assurance Letter\" to delay enforcement. The agency also proposed extending the effective date of the rules. The EPA extended the effective date of the Boiler MACT rule by about two years in December 2012. The reconsidered rule allows for extensions to compliance time on a case-by-case basis, with permitting authorities able to grant up to one year for control installation. The EPA extended the effective date of the Boiler MACT rule by about two years in December 2012, allowing for extensions to compliance time on a case-by-case basis. Permitting authorities can grant up to a one-year extension for control installation under the NESHAP regulations. If sources demonstrate the need for extra time, a four-year compliance deadline may be considered. Congress has shown a strong interest in the potential impacts of the Boiler MACT rule, which is estimated to affect around 14,000 boilers and process heaters. The EPA extended the effective date of the Boiler MACT rule by about two years in December 2012, allowing for extensions to compliance time on a case-by-case basis. Permitting authorities can grant up to a one-year extension for control installation under the NESHAP regulations. If sources demonstrate the need for extra time, a four-year compliance deadline may be considered. Congress has shown a strong interest in the potential impacts of the Boiler MACT rule, which is estimated to affect around 14,000 boilers and process heaters. In order to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants, 12% of affected units, including coal-fired, biomass-fired, and liquid-fired boilers, would need to install pollution control equipment. The estimated capital costs for existing boilers to meet the compliance deadline in 2016 are $4.6 billion, with annualized costs estimated at $1.2 billion per year. Most boilers affected by the rule are fueled by natural gas or similar gases, with gas-powered boilers incurring capital costs averaging a little less than $6,500 per unit. The EPA has developed regulations addressing boiler emissions as they are major sources of hazardous air pollutants. Boilers emit at least 20 listed HAPs, including mercury, arsenic, chromium, and lead. Gas-powered boilers incur capital costs averaging less than $6,500 per unit, but fuel savings are expected to offset these costs. EPA regulations require controls on major sources of HAPs emitting 10 tons or more of a single listed HAP annually. The EPA has developed regulations to control boiler emissions, which emit hazardous air pollutants including antimony, beryllium, polycyclic organic matter, benzene, formaldehyde, and more. These pollutants can cause various health effects such as cancer, lung issues, and heart attacks. The new Boiler MACT rule aims to reduce premature deaths and other health effects by controlling emissions from industrial boilers. EPA was required to finalize replacement rules by February 21, 2011, after a previous rule was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The EPA was under a court order to finalize replacement rules by February 21, 2011 for controlling boiler emissions. The agency petitioned for additional time to re-propose the rules due to extensive comments received. The court had previously issued a summary judgment against the agency in 2006 for not promulgating emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. The court imposed a schedule for the EPA to fulfill statutory duties by June 15, 2009, which was extended. The court denied further extension, citing discretionary delay by the EPA. The agency issued a statement indicating changes in standards and planned to solicit further public comment through a reconsideration of the rules. The agency issued a Notice of Reconsideration alongside the final rule in March 2011, listing 14 provisions for public review. Questions arose about compliance schedules due to the reconsideration of key aspects. The EPA extended the effective date of standards to May 16, 2011, giving more time for deliberation before finalizing rules in December 2012. The agency's June 4, 2010 proposal divided boilers into subcategories with separate emission limits for different types, including coal-fired and biomass-fired boilers. The proposed limits covered mercury, dioxins/furans, and particulate emissions. The EPA replaced emission standards for dioxins/furans with a work practice standard, addressing four groups of pollutants. Emission limits were based on monitoring data from facilities in each subcategory of existing boilers. Standards for new sources are based on the best controlled similar source, as required by the Clean Air Act. The MACT floor sets minimum emission standards for existing sources based on the best 12% performance in each subcategory, without considering costs or economic impacts. The Administrator can only consider costs, health, energy, and environmental factors if setting standards beyond the MACT floor. The number of subcategories identified by the agency influences the stringency of the standards. The EPA's subcategorization of the boiler universe influences the flexibility in setting emission standards. The Administrator can set \"beyond the floor\" standards if necessary, considering factors like cost. Commenters questioned if the subcategories appropriately considered differences in size, fuels, and design. EPA addressed these concerns in the reconsidered rule. In response to comments, the EPA modified its subcategories for boilers, identifying 19 types including coal-fired units, biomass, and liquid-fueled boilers. Emission standards for each subcategory were adjusted based on new industry data, resulting in a significant easing of the originally proposed standards' stringency. Existing coal-fired boilers will be allowed to emit higher levels of particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, mercury, and carbon monoxide compared to the original proposal. The increase in allowable emissions is even greater for most pollutants emitted by existing biomass units. The EPA modified emission standards for various boiler subcategories, allowing higher levels of pollutants like HCl, mercury, and PM for existing biomass units. The dioxin/furan standards were significantly changed to require annual boiler tune-ups instead of numeric limits for dioxin emissions. Critics raised concerns about how the EPA identified the best performers within subcategories, arguing that the agency's method of averaging emissions performance for each pollutant separately could lead to overly stringent standards. This issue was previously addressed in the Hospital/Medical/Infectious Waste Incinerator rule. The EPA promulgated a rule in October 2009 regarding emissions data and controls at sources using MACT controls for some pollutants but not all. There was ambiguity in the statutory language about whether the MACT floor should be based on the performance of an entire source or on controlling specific hazardous air pollutants. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has reviewed MACT floor determinations in the past. The EPA believes that pollutant-by-pollutant basis is the best approach for setting standards, as reviewed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The agency's standards, although modified, still follow this approach. Three subcategories are exempt from emission limits in the final rules. In the final rules, three subcategories, including natural gas/refinery gas/clean gas units, are not subject to emission limits. The agency established work practice standards for these units, requiring periodic tune-ups and submission of reports to the EPA. Additionally, limited use boilers with an annual capacity factor of no more than 10% are also subject to work practice standards instead of emission standards. The EPA has set enforceable average annual capacity factor limits for boilers, with more stringent standards for new major source boilers. The agency predicts very few new coal-fired boilers will be built in the next three years, with most new units expected to be powered by natural gas. Compliance costs for natural gas boilers are estimated at $2,900 each, while biomass-fueled boilers are projected to cost $1.2 million each. The Boiler MACT rule applies to 2,078 liquid, coal, and biomass units, accounting for 97% of compliance costs for existing units. Emission limits apply to boilers with a heat input capacity of 10 million Btu per hour or greater. Coal-fired boilers can burn 1,000 pounds of coal per hour, while biomass-fired boilers may require 1,500 pounds of wood per hour. Fuel oil boilers would need to burn about 70 gallons per hour. The Boiler MACT rule applies to large boilers burning fuel oil, with some needing to burn up to 1,750 gallons per hour to comply with emission limits. Facilities may need to install various technologies like fabric filters, wet scrubbers, and carbon injection for maximum control of emissions. Some believe that due to EPA's weakened standards, most facilities may not have to make significant changes. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) found that EPA's 2011 final mercury emission standard for coal-fired boilers was 16 times higher than the best performing 12%. The carbon monoxide standard was 213 times higher than the MACT floor recommended by NACAA. NACAA criticized EPA for not using compliance test results from state and local officials in setting the MACT standards. EPA stated that some data provided by NACAA was incomplete and couldn't be used. The EPA's process for setting emission standards involves a \"variability analysis\" to account for changing operating conditions and emissions. They rank units based on test results, combine all available data, and use statistical tests to calculate standards that units must meet. The EPA estimates the capital costs of the reconsidered rule for existing boilers to be $4.6 billion, with annualized costs of nearly $1.2 billion. These costs mainly affect units burning solids (coal or biomass) and liquids, while natural gas-fueled boilers will see reduced operating costs. EPA used a multi-market partial equilibrium model to project the economic impact of the rule on 100 U.S. industries, finding no significant negative effects. The EPA estimated the capital costs of the rule for existing boilers to be $4.6 billion, with annualized costs of nearly $1.2 billion. The rule would benefit natural gas-fired boilers, but fuel-switching was not considered as a compliance strategy due to concerns about emissions and fuel availability. The EPA estimated that implementing the Boiler MACT rule would reduce emissions from major source boilers and process heaters by 3,100 to 5,300 pounds per year. Natural gas availability concerns could be eased by recent increases in gas reserves from shale gas resources. The Boiler MACT rule is expected to reduce emissions from major source boilers and process heaters by 3,100 to 5,300 pounds per year of mercury, 2,500 tons per year of non-mercury metals, 39,000 tons per year of hydrogen chloride, 16,593 tons per year of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), 180,000 tons per year of carbon monoxide, and 571,727 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. The reduction in mercury emissions is lower than originally proposed, with boilers being the fourth-largest stationary source of mercury. EPA attributes the remaining mercury emissions to smaller sources. The EPA's Boiler MACT rule aims to reduce emissions from small oil-fired boilers, which are a significant source of mercury emissions. Despite the rule resulting in important health benefits such as avoiding premature deaths and respiratory illnesses, the reduction in mercury emissions is lower than originally proposed. EPA estimates the annual value of these benefits to range from $25 billion to $67 billion in 2015, outweighing the costs by at least $23 billion. The EPA's Boiler MACT rule aims to reduce emissions from small oil-fired boilers, resulting in health benefits such as avoiding premature deaths and respiratory illnesses. The agency estimates the annual benefits to range from $25 billion to $67 billion in 2015, outweighing costs by at least $23 billion. Monetized benefits only reflect improvements in ambient PM 2.5 and ozone concentrations, underestimating the total benefits due to the complexity of monetizing HAP benefits. Industry-funded studies, including one from the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), found costs of the EPA's Boiler MACT rule to be higher than EPA's estimates. The American Forest and Paper Association highlighted high costs and potential job losses in the forest products industries. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies disputed CIBO's study, stating that Clean Air Act rules have historically been less expensive than industry estimates. Affected industries have not provided detailed views on the rule's effects, with CIBO still believing it will be more costly than EPA's estimate. CIBO reduced its estimate of the EPA's Boiler MACT rule cost from $20.7 billion to $11.7 billion for the reconsidered version, but still believes the rule will put 187,000 jobs at risk. EPA cannot consider cost in identifying the MACT floor, and most standards are based on this determination. The only exceptions are PM emission limits for biomass-fueled units, which would impose no additional cost. EPA established 19 subcategories of sources but cannot base MACT floors on cost considerations. According to EPA, hydrogen chloride (HCl) emissions are the predominant hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted by industrial boilers, accounting for 61% of total HAP emissions. The key issue was whether EPA should set standards for HCl and other acid gases under Section 112(d)(4), which allows flexibility for less stringent standards for HAPs with a health threshold. EPA established that HCl has a health threshold and is not a human carcinogen. The EPA established that HCl has a health threshold and is not a human carcinogen. In the June 2010 proposal, the Administrator decided not to set less stringent standards for HCl emissions due to lack of information on peak short-term emissions from boilers and concerns about adverse environmental effects. The EPA lacked facility-specific emissions data to set a health-based standard for HCl emissions. The agency considered setting individual standards for each acid gas emitted by boilers or a single standard as a surrogate. The MACT standard proposed significant reductions in emissions of various pollutants, providing substantial public health benefits. The decision on setting standards for HCl under Section 112(d)(4) was a key point raised in comments. Section 112(d)(4) was a key point raised in comments by Senators and House Members, urging the Administrator to consider the record supporting health-based emissions limitations for hydrogen chloride and manganese. The agency maintained its use of Section 112(d)(4) but made significant changes to hydrogen chloride standards based on new data. The Clean Air Act allows for increased HCl emissions from various sources, particularly biomass- and gas-fired units. Smaller boilers at facilities emitting less than 10 tons of an individual HAP and 25 tons of all HAPS combined are also regulated under the Generally Available Control Technology (GACT) standard. EPA implemented separate rules for area sources in 2011, with final changes signed in 2012 and a compliance deadline of March 21, 2014. Unlike major sources, area sources were not stayed by EPA. The reconsidered version of the area source rule has a compliance deadline of March 21, 2014. Smaller boilers under this rule would be subject to GACT, requiring a boiler tune-up every two to five years to improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions. Some units would also be subject to MACT for certain pollutants. The area source rule affects larger boiler units at facilities emitting less than 10 tons of any individual HAP and less than 25 tons of any combination of them. Standards are based on MACT for mercury and CO, and on GACT for PM. Approximately 183,000 existing boilers at 92,000 facilities would be impacted, with annualized costs of $490. The EPA's area source rule would impact 183,000 existing boilers at 92,000 facilities, with annualized costs of $490 million. The rule also estimates that about 6,800 new boilers will be constructed at area sources in the next three years, with net costs estimated at $48 million annually. Compliance costs for new sources are offset by fuel savings, resulting in cost savings of $3.6 million annually. EPA's cost estimates for area source boilers are detailed in Table 4 of the rule. The 2012 reconsidered rule states that the final rule will not significantly change capital and annual costs due to emission limit increases and reduced burden on small facilities. Gas-fired boilers, estimated at 1.3 million, are not affected by the area source rule. Compliance costs for the area source rule are lower than the MACT rule, making it less controversial. EPA also promulgated rules for boilers using solid waste as fuel, addressing issues from a previous court decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned and remanded the boiler rules in 2007, finding that EPA had wrongly excluded many industrial boilers from the definition of solid waste incinerators. In addition to the Boiler MACT and Area Source rules, EPA also promulgated rules on the Identification of Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials that Are Solid Waste and emission standards for Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators. EPA finalized amendments to these rules in December 2012 to clarify which materials are considered solid waste when burned in combustion units. The EPA finalized amendments in December 2012 to clarify which materials are considered solid waste when burned in combustion units. Discarded materials are generally considered solid waste, while non-hazardous secondary materials can avoid classification as waste if they meet legitimacy criteria. Non-hazardous secondary materials meeting legitimacy criteria, such as fuel under generator control, scrap tires from established programs, resinated wood residuals used as fuel, manufacturing ingredients, processed fuel products, and materials deemed indistinguishable from fuel, are not considered solid waste under the EPA's 2011 rule. Controversy arose over EPA's interpretation of these criteria. The EPA's 2011 rule excludes certain non-hazardous secondary materials, like fuel under generator control, from being considered solid waste. However, controversy arose over the interpretation of criteria for materials like off-spec used oil and whole scrap tires used as fuel. EPA considers off-spec used oil as waste due to higher contaminant levels compared to traditional fuels. Off-spec used oil could be burned in used-oil-fired space heaters under previous regulations, but it is now considered a solid waste when burned as a fuel. The EPA's 2011 rule excludes certain non-hazardous secondary materials from being considered solid waste, but off-spec used oil is classified as waste due to higher contaminant levels compared to traditional fuels. Off-spec used oil is now considered a solid waste when burned as a fuel, as it does not qualify for the generator controlled exclusion. Combusting off-spec used oil in a unit controlled by the generator would require meeting incinerator standards, which most space heaters do not meet. Testing the oil before burning it in a space heater would be costly. The proposed regulations would have effectively banned the use of waste oil in space heaters, causing confusion with existing RCRA regulations. The final rule clarified that used oil combusted in oil-fired space heaters meeting specific provisions did not need testing to determine if it is on-spec. The final rule clarified that used oil combusted in oil-fired space heaters meeting specific provisions did not need testing to determine if it is on-spec. Additionally, the rule addressed concerns about combustion units used by auto repair shops and homeowners who change their own oil, stating that emissions limits are not established for such units under the CISWI regulations. The rule also imposed restrictions on the use of whole used tires as fuel. The EPA reversed its policy on whole used tires as fuel, stating that unless processed into a non-waste fuel product, they would be considered solid waste subject to CAA section 129 requirements. This change would have impacted the use of scrap tires as fuel. EPA agreed that scrap tires collected under established tire programs are not considered discarded in the first instance. The EPA has clarified that tires collected under established programs are not considered discarded initially and can be used as non-waste fuel in combustion units. The agency has broadened definitions to allow more materials like scrap tires to be used in boilers without being classified as incinerators. The reconsidered Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerator (CISWI) rule, finalized on December 20, 2012, sets emission standards for facilities burning materials considered solid waste. The rule includes emission limits for lead, cadmium, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, with more stringent requirements under Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. EPA has identified seven subcategories for compliance. The EPA has set emission standards for Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (CISWI) with more stringent requirements under Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. There are seven subcategories of CISWI facilities, with estimated compliance costs of $271 million and benefits of $380 million-$1 billion, including the avoidance of 47-120 premature deaths annually. Controversy arose over the inclusion of \"burn-off ovens\" in the originally proposed rule, with operators disputing the number of units identified by the EPA. The EPA's emission standards for Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (CISWI) have been a topic of controversy. Stakeholders argue that burn-off ovens should be classified as boilers, not incinerators, and subject to different regulations. The EPA's Boiler MACT rule has faced criticism for being less stringent than originally proposed. Some stakeholders are concerned about the impact of proposed rules on emission standards for Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (CISWI). Members of Congress have been active in the EPA's public comment process and introduced bills to change Clean Air Act requirements for the rules. Bills would have provided more time for implementation and changed key aspects of the requirements for boilers and CISWI units. The bills introduced by Congress aimed to extend the compliance date for Boiler MACT and related rules by 15 months after enactment, giving affected units three additional years to comply. They also proposed changes to Section 112 requirements for boilers and CISWI units, including removing the \"MACT hammers\" and defining certain sources as \"existing\" rather than \"new\" with less stringent standards. The House passed H.R. 2250, which aimed to set less stringent requirements for EPA standards, giving affected units more time to comply and making emission limits less strict. EPA made changes in response to critics, finalizing rules on December 20, 2012. The House passed H.R. 2250 to set less stringent EPA standards, giving affected units more time to comply and making emission limits less strict. Changes made by EPA in response to critics were finalized on December 20, 2012. Whether these changes will satisfy affected industries and critics remains uncertain."
