    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. The Congress finds that billions of dollars in social security taxes have not been credited to American workers' earnings records due to errors in matching policies and employer reports. Approximately 200 million individual earnings reports totaling $200 billion are in a suspense file. The Congress finds that uncredited earnings totaling approximately $200 billion have affected social security benefit payments, denying millions of Americans their full entitlement. This issue continues to impact current and future retirees, leading to significant losses in monthly benefits. The Act aims to ensure that beneficiaries receive proper compensation for uncredited earnings, by reconciling wage reports and preventing future mismatches. SEC. 2. STUDY. The Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on the Social Security Administration's inability to provide full benefits to American workers due to insufficient information for identifying earnings accounts. The study will focus on the accuracy and maintenance of workers' earnings records for determining eligibility and benefit amounts. The study will focus on determining eligibility and benefit amounts for monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, proposing effective procedures for resolving discrepancies in uncredited earnings and addressing the backlog in the suspense file. Additional resources needed for implementing these procedures will also be considered. SEC. 3. REMEDIAL MEASURES.\n\nThe Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury will devise procedures to eliminate the backlog of uncredited earnings in the suspense file and prevent future discrepancies. The Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury will submit a report to the relevant congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The report will detail the study findings, progress in meeting the requirements, and any recommendations for further legislative action."
