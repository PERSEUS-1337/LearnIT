CLARIFICATION OF RULE ALLOWING DISCHARGE TO GOVERNMENTAL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE DISPOSITION OF FARM ASSETS UNDER CHAPTER 12 BANKRUPTCIES. Sec. 1232 of title 11, United States Code, addresses unsecured claims of a governmental unit related to the disposition of property used in a farming operation in bankruptcy cases. These claims are treated as pre-petition claims, do not receive priority status, must be included in a repayment plan, and are discharged upon completion of the plan. The text discusses the treatment of claims in bankruptcy cases, specifically regarding the amount to be paid on a claim if the debtor's estate were liquidated in a chapter 7 case. It also addresses the filing of a proof of claim by a governmental unit for a claim that arises after the petition is filed. In bankruptcy cases, if a debtor files a tax return after the petition is filed and the claim relates to the tax return, they must notify the governmental unit responsible for tax collection. The notice should include details of the bankruptcy petition, court location, claim amount, and supporting documentation. The governmental unit must file a proof of claim within 180 days of receiving notice. If they fail to do so, the debtor or trustee can file a claim consistent with the notice. Any claim filed will be determined and allowed or disallowed as per bankruptcy code. Technical and conforming amendments are made to chapter 12 of title 11.

Amendments are made to section 1229(a) to provide for the payment of a claim described in section 1232(a) that arose after the date of the filed petition. The amendments made by this section apply to pending bankruptcy cases and those commencing after the date of enactment of the Act. Passed by the Senate on September 5, 2017.
