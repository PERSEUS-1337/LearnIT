Congress finds that the critical electric infrastructure of the United States and Canada has over $1 trillion in asset value, with extensive transmission lines and generating capability serving millions of people. The reliance on computer-based control systems, increasingly connected to open networks, poses cybersecurity risks according to the Department of Homeland Security. Connectivity exposes control systems to cyber risks, including malicious actors targeting the electric infrastructure. The FBI has identified threats from foreign nation states, domestic criminals, hackers, and disgruntled employees. Foreign electric infrastructure has been repeatedly attacked, and an electromagnetic pulse attack could cause significant damage to critical infrastructure. The Control Systems Security Program of the Department of Homeland Security aims to enhance the reliability, security, and resilience of control systems by developing cyber risk reduction products, supporting vulnerability mitigation recommendations, and improving critical infrastructure security posture in the United States. A statutory mechanism is deemed necessary to safeguard critical infrastructure for national and homeland security. A statutory mechanism is necessary to protect the critical electric infrastructure against cyber security threats, as highlighted by Joseph Kelliher, the former Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. SEC. 3. INVESTIGATION OF CYBER COMPROMISE OF CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with other security agencies, must investigate potential compromises to programmable electronic devices and communication networks essential to critical electric infrastructure. Focus areas include extent of compromise, identification of attackers, method of penetration, ramifications on future operations, and impact on other critical infrastructure sectors and civil society. The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit a report to Congress on the investigation findings of potential compromises to programmable electronic devices and communication networks essential to critical electric infrastructure. The report will include details on the extent of compromise, identification of attackers, method of penetration, impact on national security and war fighting capability, recommended mitigation activities, and may include a classified annex. SEC. 4. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. Part II of the Federal Power Act is amended by adding a new section, SEC. 224, focusing on critical infrastructure. In this section, critical electric infrastructure is defined as systems and assets vital to the US for generating, transmitting, and distributing electric energy. Critical electric infrastructure information refers to related critical infrastructure information. Critical infrastructure information related to critical electric infrastructure includes definitions for terms such as 'cyber threat' and 'cyber vulnerability', which are crucial for understanding and protecting programmable electronic devices and communication networks essential to the reliable operation of critical electric infrastructure. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to assess cyber vulnerabilities and threats to critical electric infrastructure regularly and produce reports with recommendations. The Secretary of Homeland Security must regularly assess cyber vulnerabilities and threats to critical electric infrastructure. Reports must include findings on cyber vulnerabilities and threats, along with recommendations for enhancing domestic preparedness and response. Reports are submitted to the Commission and relevant congressional committees. The Secretary of Homeland Security must assess cyber vulnerabilities and threats to critical electric infrastructure and communicate significant findings to the Commission in a timely manner. Intelligence from national security sources may be incorporated into the assessment. The Commission has the authority to issue rules or orders to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber vulnerabilities or threats. Emergency procedures allow for immediate action without prior notice in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Commission can issue emergency rules or orders without prior notice for up to 90 days. Interested parties can submit input, and the Commission can affirm, amend, or repeal the rule. This applies to entities owning critical electric infrastructure under the Commission's jurisdiction. Protection of Critical Electric Infrastructure Information under this section is subject to the same rules as information submitted to the Department of Homeland Security. The Commission shall establish mandatory interim measures to protect against known cyber vulnerabilities or threats to critical electric infrastructure within 120 days of enactment of this Act, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. These measures will supplement, replace, or modify cybersecurity reliability standards. The Commission may replace existing cybersecurity reliability standards with new ones if they are deemed inadequate to address known cyber vulnerabilities or threats. Plans issued under this subsection may require critical infrastructure owners to comply with mandatory interim measures within 120 days of enactment. The Commission may require critical electric infrastructure owners to develop and submit plans addressing cyber vulnerabilities or threats for approval."
