    "content": "In this paper, the authors demonstrate a method to enhance visual imagination using modified variational auto-encoders. Their approach includes a unique training objective and an inference network to handle abstract concepts efficiently. They introduce evaluation metrics for visual imagination quality and compare their method with existing techniques on two datasets. The authors introduce a method to enhance visual imagination using modified variational auto-encoders, evaluating it on two datasets: MNIST-with-attributes and CelebA. They propose a two-party communication game where a speaker generates a description of a visual concept, which the listener interprets and creates mental images to match the concept. This process is called visually grounded imagination, represented by fixed-length vectors of discrete attributes. The authors propose a method for enhancing visual imagination using modified variational auto-encoders, focusing on fixed-length vectors of discrete attributes to represent concepts. They create a compositional abstraction hierarchy using a directed acyclic graph, where nodes represent concepts and edges show attribute removal. The attribute vector y O describes a concept by specifying different subsets of attributes. The authors propose a method for enhancing visual imagination using modified variational auto-encoders, focusing on fixed-length vectors of discrete attributes to represent concepts. They create a compositional abstraction hierarchy using a directed acyclic graph, where nodes represent concepts and edges show attribute removal. The attribute vector y O describes a concept by specifying different subsets of attributes for generating images at various levels of abstraction. The authors extend the variational autoencoder framework to create models for generating images based on attributes like hair color, smiling, and gender. They introduce a novel objective function called TELBO for training the model from paired data. The authors introduce a method for generating images based on attributes using a novel objective function called TELBO. They fit three inference networks to embed images or descriptions into a shared latent space, allowing for translation between the two modalities. Additionally, they use a method based on the product of experts to handle abstract concepts by conditioning on attributes to generate a diverse set of images. The authors propose a method for generating diverse images based on attributes, evaluating correctness and coverage by checking consistency and diversity in the generated image set. They aim for high correctness and coverage even for unseen attribute combinations. The authors introduce a method for generating diverse images based on attribute values, emphasizing the importance of compositionality in creating truly novel visual outputs. Experimental results on MNIST-with-attributes and CelebA BID16 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach compared to previous methods. The paper introduces a method for generating diverse images based on attribute values, showing superior performance on datasets annotated with 40 binary attributes. Key contributions include a novel extension to VAEs in the multimodal setting, a new training objective (TELBO), handling missing data in inference networks, and criteria for evaluating conditional generative models of images. The curr_chunk discusses a latent variable model with a prior and likelihood, using an inference network to maximize the evidence lower bound. The \u03b2-VAE trick can encourage disentangled latent factors, and \u03bb > 1 is useful for multiple modalities. The curr_chunk introduces the Joint VAE model, extending VAE to model images and attributes with a joint distribution. The training objective is to maximize the empirical distribution derived from paired data. The JVAE model sets \u03b2 = 1 and scales up the likelihood from the attribute vector to match the likelihood from the image. Unpaired inference networks are then trained to embed images and attributes into the same latent space. The curr_chunk discusses the product of experts inference network in the Joint VAE model, where experts vote for different parts of the latent space based on observed attributes. The inclusion of a \"universal expert\" ensures a well-conditioned posterior, even with missing attributes. The curr_chunk discusses handling missing attributes in the Joint VAE model by using a product of experts model. The objective is to optimize all terms in the ELBO jointly, and different training methods are compared in Section 4. To handle missing attributes in the Joint VAE model, a product of experts model is used where each attribute represents an expert. The approximate posterior of the inference network is a product of Gaussians, with a prior of N(z|\u00b5=0, C=I). This model differs from others by multiplying Gaussians instead of Bernoullis, resulting in a closed form solution for q(z|y) = N(z|\u00b5, C). In the Joint VAE model, missing attributes are handled using a product of experts approach. The posterior becomes narrower as more attributes are observed, reflecting increased specificity. A multi-label classifier is used to evaluate generated images by converting them to predicted attribute vectors. The attribute classifier, acting as a human observer, ensures generated images have desired attributes. Correctness is measured by matching specified attributes, while diversity is assessed by comparing values for unspecified attributes. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used to compare the distribution of attribute values in the generated set with the true distribution in the training set. Coverage is defined based on this comparison. The metric differs from the inception score and can be used to pick hyperparameters. The inception score evaluates generative models by measuring the diversity and class matching of generated images. It does not consider if the images align with specific concepts or vary in response to different levels of abstraction. To assess compositionality, a compositional split of the data can be used to test how well the model understands different attributes. In the context of evaluating generative models, a compositional split of the data can be used to test the model's understanding of different attributes. This involves predicting the effects of dropping certain attributes rather than predicting novel combinations of attributes. Various conditional generative image models have been proposed, focusing on learning a shared latent space from descriptions or images using joint, symmetric models. Several papers use a joint VAE model for learning a shared latent space from descriptions or images. The BiVCCA objective generates mean images for each concept, while the JMVAE objective aims to ensure a broad distribution of concepts. The aggregated posterior over z induced by all images associated with a description ensures coverage of embeddings for all images. This may slightly reduce sample diversity for novel concepts compared to TELBO, but sharper images can be expected when sampling z from the aggregated posterior during joint training. Regularizing with respect to the prior in VAE-type models can lead to generating samples in unexplored parts of space, impacting sample correctness. The SCAN method fits a \u03b2-VAE model on unlabeled images, similar to JMVAE but treating attribute vectors as atomic symbols. The attribute vectors y are treated as atomic symbols in the SCAN method, eliminating the need to handle missing inputs. However, this approach may struggle to infer the meaning of unseen attribute combinations at test time without paired images. The method relies on \u03b2 x > 1 for compositionality, but unsupervised learning of the latent space from images alone can lead to poor results when non-visual attributes are present. In contrast, our approach considers labels when learning the latent space, resulting in well-organized latent spaces even with non-visual concepts. Generative models like BID10 use MCMC to fit a latent Gaussian model that can handle missing data. One approach is to estimate missing values by modeling dependencies between attributes and sampling images using the estimated values. Conditioning on imputed values will give different results from not conditioning on missing inputs, which increases posterior uncertainty to represent less precise concepts accurately. Our method aims to map images and text to regions of latent space using Gaussian embeddings, different from prior works. We maximize the likelihood of (x, y) pairs and ensure adaptive covariance of the posterior q(z|y O) based on observed attributes. This property is not shared by other embedding methods, emphasizing abstraction and compositionality. The BID36 model extends concepts using images and captions, while BID29 uses order embeddings to learn relationships. Unlike previous work, our method focuses on generality through latent representations and generative models. This approach tests if a model truly understands composed components. We apply the JVAE model to MNIST-A and CelebA datasets using the TELBO objective. In this section, the JVAE model is applied to the MNIST-A dataset, which consists of 240 unique concepts created by modifying the original MNIST dataset. The model is trained using TELBO, BiVCCA, and JMVAE objectives with specific optimization parameters. For optimization, models are trained with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a minibatch size of 64 for 250,000 steps. DCGAN architecture is used for image models, generating images of size 64\u00d764. MLPs are used for attribute models, and a CNN combined with an MLP is used for the joint inference network. Evaluation includes training the observation classifier on the full dataset to achieve 91.18% accuracy. The observation classifier achieved high accuracy on the full iid dataset for various class labels, scales, orientations, and locations. The quality of samples from generative models was assessed, and correctness and coverage were computed on both iid and comp datasets. TELBO and JMVAE showed higher correctness scores compared to BiVCCA in assessing model quality in a simple setting with fully specified test concepts. The evaluation of different generative model approaches on the test set showed that JMVAE and TELBO outperformed BiVCCA, with JMVAE producing good samples and TELBO showing mostly good results with one error. The attribute classifier correctly detected the blurry images generated by BiVCCA. TELBO and JMVAE produce different orientations of digits when attributes are unspecified. TELBO generates a more diverse set of digits compared to JMVAE. The value of \u00b5 = 0.7 was chosen to maximize correctness score. When test concepts are abstract, JMVAE's correctness score drops slightly while TELBO remains steady. The coverage of TELBO is higher due to the KL regularizer. TELBO shows more diverse samples compared to other methods. When test concepts are fully specified, correctness drops for TELBO and JMVAE but they still outperform BiVCCA. Results are reported on the CelebA dataset. In this section, results are reported on the CelebA dataset BID16, using 18 visually distinctive attributes to generate images of size 64\u00d764. TELBO and JMVAE produce realistic and diverse images, while BiVCCA only generates the mean image. Dropping certain attributes results in a mixture of male and female images for TELBO and JMVAE. When dropping the \"smiling\" attribute, TELBO and JMVAE generate images with a mix of smiling and non-smiling individuals of various genders. Despite increased diversity, there is a slight drop in image quality. Visual imagination examples include generating images of \"bald female\" not in the training set, showing reasonable results. BiVCCA's results are poor. An interesting dataset bias is highlighted when models generate images. The dataset exhibits a bias where images generated by the model often lack glasses due to the rarity of the attribute. The study demonstrates the use of imagination models for concept naming in images, building on previous work in set naming with integers and extending it to images with perceptual uncertainty. The study explores using generative models for concept naming in images, specifically focusing on perceptual uncertainty. Results show that TELBO and JMVAE generate better samples than BiVCCA, which collapses to the mean. Both approaches also demonstrate meaningful generalization across unspecified attributes. The problem setup in concept naming involves assigning labels to a set of images based on a compositional abstraction hierarchy. The challenge is to generalize effectively in the concept hierarchy with limited positive examples. Two heuristic solutions are considered: Concept-NB computes arg max y p(y|X), while the goal is to find the least common ancestor in the concept hierarchy that corresponds to all images in the set. In concept naming studies, two approaches are explored: Concept-NB computes arg max y p(y|X) using the naive bayes assumption, while Concept-Latent works in the latent space by minimizing KL divergence. The MNIST-A dataset is used with fully specified attribute labels, considering different patterns of missingness. For concept naming studies, two approaches are explored: Concept-NB computes arg max y p(y|X) using the naive bayes assumption, while Concept-Latent works in the latent space by minimizing KL divergence. The MNIST-A dataset is used with fully specified attribute labels, considering different patterns of missingness. A uniform distribution is considered for missingness patterns, forming a bank of 960 candidate names. Three subsets of 100 candidate names are randomly selected for concept naming queries. The accuracy metric is reported across three different splits of 100 datapoints. The mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution for g(x) are given by i \u03c0i\u00b5i. Concept-NB model struggles with simple concepts like digits, while Concept-Latent model performs better by reasoning in a low dimensional latent space. The model incorrectly classifies digits as large in a failure case. The Concept-NB model struggles with classifying digits correctly, while the Concept-Latent model performs better by reasoning in a low-dimensional latent space. Evaluation of different models on MNIST-A dataset shows Concept-Latent approaches outperform Concept-NB approaches significantly. The Concept-Latent models outperform Concept-NB in classifying concepts based on few positive examples. Future work aims to explore richer forms of description beyond attribute vectors, such as natural language text. The JMVAE objective involves dealing with a variable number of objects in scenes. The JMVAE objective involves rewriting equations to treat indices as random variables and encourage the inference network for descriptions to be close to the average of posteriors induced by images associated with the label. We created the MNIST-A dataset by sampling discrete attributes into continuous transformation parameters for images in the original MNIST dataset. Scale values were sampled from Gaussian distributions centered at 0.9 for big and 0.6 for small, with standard deviations of 0.1. Values outside the range [0.4, 1.0] were rejected. For image generation in the MNIST-A dataset, rotation angles are sampled from Gaussian distributions for clockwise and anti-clockwise labels. Location is determined by placing Gaussians at quadrant centers with offsets, ensuring digits remain within the canvas boundaries. Rejected samples are redrawn to maintain image quality. To generate images for the MNIST-A dataset, an empty black canvas of size 64x64 is used. The original 28x28 MNIST image is rotated, scaled, and translated before being pasted onto the canvas using bicubic interpolation. The images are then binarized using the BID23 method. This process is repeated 10 times for each image in the original MNIST dataset, resulting in a new dataset with 700,000 images. The dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets for the IID split. The dataset for the MNIST-A dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets for the IID split. The compositional split divides the dataset into non-overlapping label combinations. \u03b2-VAE and Joint-VAE are compared for learning a good latent space through semantic annotations. The ELBO objective is modified to create disentangled latent spaces by scaling the KL term. Labeled data is needed to learn latent spaces corresponding to high-level concepts. An experiment is set up with a 2d latent space for MNIST-2bit dataset, showing results of fitting a 2d \u03b2-VAE model to images. A hyperparameter sweep is performed to find the best looking latent space. The latent space in the 2d \u03b2-VAE model is used to generate images, but it does not capture semantic properties like parity and magnitude. The model cannot be forced to learn these high-level concepts from images alone. A joint VAE model is fitted to the MNIST-2bit dataset to optimize images and attributes. The latent space in the 2d \u03b2-VAE model captures relevant concepts and facilitates learning of imagination functions, interpolation, and retrieval tasks. The color codes are derived from p(y|z) instead of nearest neighbor retrieval, showing the model's ability to encode and distinguish different types of concepts effectively. The agent's internal representation should capture magnitude and parity concepts rather than visual similarity. Language helps agents share information about their environments. The model includes three encoders and two decoders using ELU non-linearity. The image decoder architecture is explained in detail. The architecture for the image and label encoder in the model involves separate processing of images and labels, followed by concatenation and passing through a multi-layered perceptron with convolutional layers. Regularization is applied to the weight matrices in the label decoder. The image encoder and label encoder in the model use batch normalization in convolutional layers before applying the ELU non-linearity. Attribute labels are encoded into continuous vectors and passed through a 2-layered MLP. The label feature is concatenated with the image feature after convolutional layers and passed through a 2-layer MLP to predict mean and standard deviation for the latent space gaussian. Log \u03c3 is predicted for the standard deviation. The image encoder and label encoder in the model use batch normalization in convolutional layers before applying the ELU non-linearity.

Log \u03c3 is predicted for the standard deviation. The architecture of the observation classifier for evaluating the 3C's on the MNIST-A dataset is described as a convolutional neural network with specific filter sizes and channels. The network architecture includes convolutional layers with filters of size 5\u00d75 and 32 channels, followed by pooling layers. Four heads correspond to different attributes, each with an MLP layer. The model is trained on the MNIST-A dataset using stochastic gradient descent. For CelebA, a latent dimensionality of 18 is used, matching the number of attributes. In CelebA experiments, a latent dimensionality of 18 is used, matching the number of attributes modeled. The image encoder and decoder architectures are similar to MNIST-A, with encoders taking 3-channel RGB images and decoders producing 3-channel output. The Bernoulli likelihood is replaced with Quantized Normal likelihood. The label encoder processes 18 categorical class labels through hidden layers. The joint encoder processes 18 labels through a single layer MLP before concatenation. The text discusses the process of processing features through MLPs and image feature heads to produce \u00b5, \u03c3 values. It also mentions the observation classifier's outputs on generated images from the TELBO model trained on MNIST-A, showing reasonable results. Additionally, hyperparameter choices for TELBO, JMVAE, and BIVCCA on MNIST-A are discussed, with \u03bb x =1 set across all objectives and varying \u03bb y. The text discusses the impact of hyperparameter choices on performance in the MNIST-A dataset for TELBO, JMVAE, and BiVCCA models. It includes the use of the JS-overall metric for selecting hyperparameters and showcases compositional generalization on MNIST-A. The text discusses the impact of hyperparameter choices on performance in the MNIST-A dataset for TELBO, JMVAE, and BiVCCA models. It includes compositional generalization results, highlighting the importance of \u03bb y values in the elbo terms for good performance. The TELBO and JMVAE models perform well, while BiVCCA shows poorer performance. The \u03bb y values significantly impact the disentanglement of the latent space in TELBO, JMVAE, and BiVCCA models. The \u03b3 scaling factor in TELBO also affects performance, but to a lesser extent than \u03bb y. The parameter values of \u03b3, \u03b1, and \u00b5 have significant effects on the performance of different models. For example, changing \u03b3 from 50 to 1 decreases correctness values for fully specified queries. A value of \u03b1=1.0 works best for JMVAE, while \u00b5=0.7 was found to be the optimal choice for BiVCCA. Higher values of \u00b5 generally lead to improved performance. Lower values of \u00b5 result in sharper samples due to more weight on the elbo term with q(z|x) inference network. Compositional generalization experiments on MNIST-A showed diverse image generation with TELBO compared to JMVAE. An example in CelebA dataset revealed inaccurate labels, possibly due to annotator error. The CelebA dataset consists of 202,599 face images with 18 visually distinctive attributes. Images are aligned, cropped, and scaled down to 64 x 64. TELBO and JMVAE were compared in image generation, with TELBO showing better mixing of male and female images. The CelebA dataset contains 202,599 face images with 18 attributes, scaled down to 64 x 64. The dataset includes 96486 unique visual concepts, while the subset with 18 attributes spans 3690 concepts. The generated \"Bald\" and \"Female\" images are compositionally novel. The model's images are qualitatively different from the training examples, indicating no memorization. On the CelebA dataset, further qualitative examples of performance are shown for the TELBO and JMVAE objectives. Both produce correct images with full attribute queries, but TELBO provides more diverse samples when attributes are not specified. JMVAE optimizes for the aggregate posterior, leading to less diverse samples compared to TELBO. TELBO tends to generate less diverse samples when shown unseen concepts compared to JMVAE, which optimizes for the aggregate posterior."
