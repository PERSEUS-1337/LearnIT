    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2011\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Congress finds that denying employment opportunities to individuals based on their unemployment status is discriminatory and harms commerce by reducing personal consumption, squandering human capital, increasing demands for unemployment benefits, burdening health and welfare programs, and decreasing tax revenues essential for government operations. The purpose of this Act is to prohibit discrimination based on unemployment status in hiring, except where necessary for job performance, to support commerce. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"employer\" and \"employment agency\" in relation to their roles in commerce and industry affecting commerce. The Act defines terms such as \"affected individual\" as someone not hired due to current employment status, \"status as unemployed\" as past or present unemployment, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Labor. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Employers are prohibited from discriminating against unemployed individuals in the hiring process, including refusing to consider them for employment, publishing job ads that disqualify the unemployed, or instructing employment agencies to take unemployment status into account. It is unlawful for employment agencies to discriminate against unemployed individuals by refusing to consider or refer them for jobs, limiting their access to job information, or publishing job ads that disqualify the unemployed. It is unlawful for employers to discriminate against individuals based on their unemployed status. Employers or employment agencies cannot interfere with the rights provided under this Act, including opposing unlawful practices, filing charges, or providing information in connection with inquiries or proceedings related to the Act. Employers cannot discriminate against individuals based on their unemployed status. Consideration of an individual's recent employment history as a qualification for a job is allowed if it is necessary for successful job performance. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Employers and employment agencies that violate section 4(a) and (b) are liable to affected individuals for actual damages equal to any wages, benefits, or compensation denied or lost due to the violation. The violation of section 4 may result in monetary losses for the individual, including a civil penalty of $1,000 per violation per day, interest on the penalty amount, and liquidated damages. If proven in court, the employer or employment agency may be exempt from paying the additional damages. If a court finds that a violation of section 4 was done in good faith with reasonable grounds, the liability amount may be reduced. Equitable relief, including employment, compensatory, and punitive damages, can be sought against employers or employment agencies in federal or state courts. In federal or state courts, individuals can bring actions on behalf of affected individuals, with the court awarding attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other costs to be paid by the defendant. The right to bring such actions terminates if the Secretary files a complaint seeking restraint of a violation of section 4. The Secretary can take administrative action to investigate complaints of violations of section 4, similar to how complaints of violations of other sections are handled under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The Secretary can take legal action to enforce U.S.C. 206 and 207, including seeking injunctions, damages, civil penalties, and other equitable relief for violations. Sums recovered will be held in a special deposit account. Any recovered sums not paid to affected individuals within 3 years will be deposited into the Treasury of the United States. An action under subsection (a) must be brought within 2 years of the last event constituting the violation, with tolling of limitations during the Secretary's consideration of a complaint. The Secretary may bring an action for a willful violation of section 4 within 3 years of the last event constituting the violation. The action is considered commenced when the Secretary files a complaint in court. The district courts have jurisdiction for an action for injunction by the Secretary. The United States has jurisdiction to restrain violations of section 4 and provide equitable relief, including employment and monetary damages. The Solicitor of Labor can represent the Secretary in litigation under this section."
