    "content": "The Energy Policy Act of 1992 removed regulatory barriers in the electric utilities sector to increase supply and introduce competition. Legislation has been introduced to address remaining issues affecting transmission and reliability. Both the House and Senate passed comprehensive energy legislation, with the Senate passing H.R. 6 after suspending debate on S. 14. The Senate-passed energy bill, H.R. 6, includes provisions for incentive-based transmission rates, eminent domain rights for transmission owners, creation of an electric reliability organization, limited authority for FERC over municipal and cooperative transmission systems. Senator Domenici proposed an amendment to replace the electricity title of S.14, which was withdrawn but may be considered in conference. The House version of H.R. 6 would give FERC more authority over transmission systems, repeal PUHCA, require utilities to provide real-time rates, and establish market transparency rules. It would also prohibit round-trip trading and increase penalties under the Federal Power Act. S.Amdt. 1412 proposes creating an electric reliability organization, repealing PUHCA, clarifying transmission owner rights, prohibiting round-trip trading, establishing market transparency rules, and increasing penalties under the Federal Power Act. It differs from the House-passed H.R. 6 by not allowing transmission owners to use eminent domain for new lines and includes provisions prohibiting FERC from mandating operational control transfer to RTOs. The Valley Authority will join RTOs, challenge FERC's SMD notice, and enhance FERC's merger review authority. Refer to CRS Report RL32728 for more details on Electric Utility Regulatory Reform."
