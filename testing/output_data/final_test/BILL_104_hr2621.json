    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. APPLICABILITY OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT TO FEDERAL TRUST FUNDS AND OTHER FEDERAL ACCOUNTS.\" is about the application of the public debt limit to federal trust funds and other federal accounts. Protection of Federal Funds: No officer or employee of the United States may delay deposits or credits to Federal funds, or refrain from investing in public debt obligations, if the purpose is to avoid increasing outstanding public debt obligations. Additionally, disinvesting from Federal funds invested in public debt obligations to reduce the amount of outstanding public debt obligations is prohibited. During a period when cash benefits or administrative expenses cannot be paid due to the public debt limit, public debt obligations in a covered benefits fund can only be sold or redeemed to cover these expenses. This can only be done if cash assets are not available for payment. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue public debt obligations to obtain cash for payment of benefits or administrative expenses from a covered benefits fund, despite the public debt limit. Advance notice of sale or redemption must be given to Congress and the Comptroller General at least 3 days prior. The Comptroller General reviews compliance with the issuance of public debt obligations and issues findings to Congress. The term \"public debt obligation\" refers to obligations subject to the public debt limit. The term \"Federal fund\" refers to trust funds or Government accounts where the Secretary of the Treasury can issue obligations. The Comptroller General reviews compliance with the issuance of public debt obligations, which are subject to the public debt limit.
