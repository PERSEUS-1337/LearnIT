    "content": "The \"Abraham Lincoln Commemorative Coin Act\" recognizes Abraham Lincoln as a great leader who rose to the Presidency through honesty, integrity, and commitment to the United States. He led the effort to free all slaves and had a generous heart, ultimately sacrificing his life for his country. The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission is planning the celebration of Lincoln's bicentennial with the help of proceeds from a commemorative coin. The coin specifications include minting not more than 500,000 $1 silver coins weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, containing 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper, and being legal tender. The coins minted under the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Act are considered numismatic items and are required to have designs emblematic of President Abraham Lincoln's life and legacy. The design must include the coin's value, the year \"2009\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. The coins minted under the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a designated US Mint facility. The coins can only be issued during a one-year period starting on January 1, 2009. They will be sold by the Secretary at a price including the face value, a surcharge, and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. The Secretary will make bulk sales of coins at a discount and accept prepaid orders before issuance. All sales will include a $10 surcharge per coin, with surcharges going to the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission will receive surcharges from coin sales. The Commission is subject to audit requirements and there is a limitation on the number of commemorative coin programs that can be issued in a calendar year. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
