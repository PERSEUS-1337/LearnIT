    "content": "The Unrestricted Recursive Network (URN) mimics the flexibility of biological neural networks, showing that various neural network structures can emerge dynamically during training. This is achieved through gradient descent on a general loss function, where data structure and regulator terms determine the network's architecture. The loss function and regulators naturally arise from network symmetries and input data properties. The Unrestricted Recursive Network (URN) mimics the flexibility of biological neural networks by adapting their connectivity structure during training. This approach allows for the emergence of specialized networks that excel at specific tasks, unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) which require specific designs for each task. The question arises whether there exist flexible ANNs that can dynamically adjust their connectivity structure to the task they are trained on, leading to a new machine learning paradigm. The Unrestricted Recursive Network (URN) is a new machine learning paradigm that competes with specialized networks. When trained, URN dynamically adjusts its structure based on data geometry and hyperparameters. It can transform into recursive or feedforward networks, with various connectivity options. The network architecture is determined by symmetry arguments, different from previous approaches like growing one neural at a time. The Unrestricted Recursive Network (URN) is a new machine learning paradigm that dynamically adjusts its structure based on data geometry and hyperparameters. It can transform into recursive or feedforward networks with various connectivity options. Any network architecture can be embedded in a recursive network, as demonstrated with a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers. This embedding involves concatenating neurons and weights inside a larger structure, showing equivalence to the original MLP network. The Unrestricted Recursive Network (URN) can transform into recursive or feedforward networks with various connectivity options. It is possible to start from a general recursive structure and arrive at a feedforward multi-layered perceptron network. The network is defined with minimal structure, embedding input data in the neurons of the system. The Unstructured Recursive Network (URN) is defined with minimal structure, using a discreet iterative update rule for processing data. It consists of S neurons and I iterations, with W as an S \u00d7 S matrix, b as the bias, and \u03d5 as the non-linear activation function. The network is trained using standard loss functions and gradient descent methods. The Unstructured Recursive Network (URN) is trained using standard loss functions and gradient descent methods. The methodology includes using a multi-class cross-entropy loss function with L1 regulators on network weights and neuron activations to promote sparsity. High regulation values result in a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron structure in the emergent network. An example includes training a URN with 5000 neurons and 4 iterations on a binary classification task. The task involves distinguishing inputs from two uniform concentric 10-d spherical shell distributions. A network trained with specific hyperparameters achieves 100% test accuracy. Only 123\u00b115 neurons remain active out of 5000 initial neurons at the end of training, forming an MLP with 3 hidden layers. The neurons have organized into an MLP with 3 hidden layers. To confirm the network's structure, all other weights were set to zero with no change in output. The number of layers in the MLP equals the number of iterations in the recursive network. To allow for flexibility, pathways in the computation graph can have varying numbers of update rules, enabling dynamic layer utilization. The network can dynamically choose the number of layers to use by utilizing residual connections on input or output nodes. An update rule allows the output to accumulate gradually, cutting off further changes after a certain iteration. The emergent network may have fewer layers based on the dataset's simplicity, becoming linearly separable after one layer. In a more challenging problem like classification on CIFAR-10, the emergent network uses the maximum number of layers allowed. Residual connections on input nodes continuously feed input at each iteration, forming skip connections in the network. However, this mixing of layers leads to complex neural activity patterns that are harder to interpret. Future work will explore more complicated networks with skip connections and feedback loops. In image recognition tasks, locally connected networks (LCN) can arise from a URN when there is proximity or distance information defined on the neurons. Datasets that are invariant under permutation of input components combined with update rules preserving this symmetry do not exhibit local connectivity structure. This symmetry is naturally broken in tasks like image recognition. In image recognition tasks, symmetry is naturally broken, leading to emergent networks with local connectivity structure. The input network is a two-dimensional matrix with a Euclidean metric, embedded in a larger structure with an induced metric. The simplest metric is a product metric with a hyperparameter \u03b2 determining the perpendicular length scale. The induced geometric structure on the neurons of the network allows for the addition of extra regulator terms to the loss function, penalizing the synaptic length connecting different neurons. This term is invariant under certain parts of the permutation symmetry and involves parameters such as distance power hyperparameter and strength of the regulator term. An experiment was conducted using monochromatic CIFAR-10 images with a URN having an uplift geometry equivalent to a x \u00d7 y \u00d7 z cube of 21,600 total neurons. The URN has an uplift geometry equivalent to a x \u00d7 y \u00d7 z cube of 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 6 = 21,600 total neurons. The input embedding rule is modified to expand 32 \u00d7 32 inputs to 60 \u00d7 60 using interpolation. The network structure shows a clear feedforward and locally connected structure with forward, backward, and equal z weights. Without hyperparameter fine-tuning, the network achieves a test accuracy of 52%, a 10% improvement over the same structure with only weight and activity regulators. The neural network structures can dynamically emerge from the general framework of the URN, showing easily interpretable feed-forward MLPs. The URN loss function can be extended with proximity information to improve generalization performance. Further research is needed to understand how network topology varies with task difficulty and other related questions. The paper discusses the emergence of neural networks from a URN framework and proposes an alternative learning scheme for continual and never-ending learning. It suggests training a network with dynamically chosen architecture on a series of related tasks of increasing difficulty. The goal is to understand why feed-forward networks are generically arrived at and to incorporate weight sharing for convolutional networks. The paper proposes a new learning paradigm called Never-Ending Structure Accumulation (NESA), where a network's architecture evolves from simple to complex tasks, minimizing performance loss on prior tasks. Initial results show promise when training a URN with a lifelong learning algorithm on image tasks of varying difficulty. This approach challenges the current trend of specialized networks for each task. The NESA learning paradigm involves designing a series of tasks for ML practitioners, leading to the final ML problem. This approach mimics how BNNs learn new tasks over their lifetime."
