The National Rape Kit Database Act mandates the Attorney General to create a public database within a year of the Act's enactment. Participating entities, including Federal law enforcement agencies, must provide information on rape kits collected or tested. The National Rape Kit Database Act requires Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to provide information on rape kits collected, including the date of collection. The National Rape Kit Database Act mandates the collection of key details for each rape kit, including the location and date of the incident, date of entry into the database, entity in possession of the kit, processing status, and statute of limitations status for backlogged cases. The National Rape Kit Database Act requires database-participating entities, like laboratories, to provide updates on the processing status of rape kits. Personally identifiable information is not included in the database, and each kit is assigned a unique ID number within 72 hours of processing.

The National Rape Kit Database Act mandates assigning a unique ID to each processed rape kit for inclusion in the database. For kits collected before the database's establishment, entities can delay inclusion until 1 year after the Act's enactment. If a rape kit is deemed unfounded or the victim withdraws their report before the 72-hour deadline, it will not be included in the database. The National Rape Kit Database Act requires unique IDs for processed rape kits in the database. Kits collected before the database's creation can be delayed for inclusion.

The National Rape Kit Database Act mandates that law enforcement agencies cannot include information on a rape kit in the database until the victim reports it or an investigation begins. Information is added to the database through a secure website. States or local governments must comply with the Act to be eligible for federal funding under DNA analysis programs. The National Rape Kit Database Act requires compliance for federal funding under DNA analysis programs. States must provide certification to the Attorney General for each fiscal year to be considered in compliance. States receiving federal funding for DNA analysis programs must ensure that a high percentage of law enforcement agencies and laboratories within the state submit information on rape kits to the national database. Compliance is required for each fiscal year to be eligible for funding. The database established for DNA analysis programs must include information on rape kits collected or tested by law enforcement agencies and laboratories. It should be accessible to the public for trend analysis. The Attorney General will provide technical assistance. The Attorney General will provide technical assistance to database-participating entities without internet access and a helpdesk for participation. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2011-2016. Definitions include \"rape kit\" as a sexual assault evidence collection kit and \"State\" as various U.S. territories. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 is amended to condition receipt of Debbie Smith DNA backlog grant program funds on participation in the National Rape Kit Database. Grants for fiscal years after the establishment of the database must specify compliance with the National Rape Kit Database Act. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to condition receipt of Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds on participation in the National Rape Kit Database. Grants for fiscal years after the establishment of the database must specify compliance with the National Rape Kit Database Act."
