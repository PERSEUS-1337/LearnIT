    "content": "On June 22, 2010, the USDA published a proposed rule on livestock marketing practices as mandated by the 2008 farm bill. The rule aimed to amend regulations under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. After receiving over 61,000 public comments, the final rule was sent for review by the Office of Management and Budget in November 2011. The USDA proposed a rule on livestock marketing practices in response to the 2008 farm bill, which included provisions on bird delivery suspension, capital investment, breach of contract, and arbitration. The final rule also addressed swine and poultry contracts but omitted controversial provisions on packer-to-packer sales and pricing differentials justification. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act limited USDA's ability to finalize parts of the rule. The USDA issued a final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices on December 9, 2011, with specific conditions and prohibitions outlined in Section 721 of the act. The rule went into effect on February 7, 2012, and included four provisions from the proposed rule. The USDA's final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices, issued on December 9, 2011, addressed various aspects such as suspension of bird delivery, capital investment, breach of contract remedies, and arbitration. However, it did not include some contentious provisions due to congressional restrictions or USDA's decision not to pursue them at that time. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) oversees livestock and poultry markets under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 to ensure fair competition and payment protection. The USDA and DOJ held workshops in 2010 to address concerns about competition in livestock and poultry industries, focusing on fair competition and protecting producers from unfair trade practices of large meat companies. The USDA and DOJ held workshops in 2010 to address concerns about competition in livestock and poultry industries. Stakeholders from various sectors aired their concerns, with a proposed GIPSA rule aiming to bring fairness to marketing transactions by requiring transparency in pricing and contracts. Proponents and opponents had differing interpretations of the rule. The proposed GIPSA rule aims to bring fairness to marketing transactions in the livestock and poultry industries. Opponents argue that it could lead to inefficiencies and increased litigation. The comment period for the rule was extended, generating over 61,000 public comments. Members of Congress have shown interest in overseeing USDA's implementation of the final rule. The report provides background on the genesis of the proposed and final rules for overseeing USDA's implementation. It discusses concerns about market consolidation in the livestock industry and differing views on its impact. Some argue for stronger anticompetitive measures, while others believe consolidation has brought efficiencies benefiting producers and consumers. Market concentration in the meat and poultry industries has increased over the last two decades, with a few firms dominating each sector. The \"four-firm concentration ratio\" measures the four largest firms' market share, showing a significant increase from 1986 to 2008. The concentration ratios have stabilized in the mid-1990s for the cattle sector, around 2003 for hogs, and since about 2006 for poultry. The poultry sector relies heavily on production contracts for transactions, with cash sales of broilers being almost non-existent. In contrast, the hog sector's cash market share has been declining over the years but still plays a significant role in pricing mechanisms. The cattle sector still sees a relatively large share of cash transactions, which are crucial for determining cash prices used in contracts and marketing arrangements. Producers have pursued legal action under the P&S Act against meat and poultry companies for unfair contracting and marketing practices. In the case of Pickett v. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., cattle feeders sued for violations of the Act, leading to a landmark class action lawsuit. The jury agreed that the packer had manipulated cattle supply through \"captive supplies.\" In the Pickett v. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. case, the packer was accused of using \"captive supplies\" to control cattle prices. The jury awarded damages of over $1.2 billion, but the verdict was set aside by a federal judge due to lack of evidence. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision, stating that if a packer's practices promote efficiency and competition, it does not violate the P&S Act. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case in 2006 and again in 2011. In January 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review Terry v. Tyson Farms, Inc., a case brought by a Tennessee poultry grower against Tyson Farms. Terry claimed unfair practices under the P&S Act because Tyson would not allow him to view the weighing of his birds. Tyson canceled its contract with Terry, and the courts found Tyson's actions did not harm competition. Farmer-rancher coalitions have proposed legislation to address anticompetitive market behavior by meat and poultry companies. A coalition of farm groups proposed changes to antitrust laws and the P&S Act to address consolidation in the meat industry. Amendments were made to the 2002 farm bill to give producers more rights and protections. In 2007, Senator Harkin introduced the Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2007 to strengthen agricultural market regulations. S. 622 and H.R. 2135 were bills introduced in 2007 to address competition issues in the agricultural industry. S. 622 aimed to establish an Office of Special Counsel for Competition within USDA and set up production contract and enforcement provisions. Parts of S. 622 were included in the Senate-passed version of the farm bill, but the final 2008 farm bill did not include a competition title or the ban on packer ownership of cattle. The 2008 farm bill included competition provisions for producers, such as contract and arbitration rights. The livestock title (Title XI) covered issues like mandatory price reporting and country-of-origin labeling. Sections 11005 and 11006 addressed the P&S Act, with the USDA issuing a proposed rule to fulfill the bill's requirements. The 2008 farm bill amended the P&S Act to give poultry growers and swine producers the right to cancel contracts within three days of execution. Contracts must clearly disclose cancellation rights and any required additional investments. The bill also added provisions about choice of law and venue in contracts. The 2008 farm bill amended the P&S Act to allow poultry growers and swine producers to cancel contracts within three days. It also added provisions regarding choice of law and venue in contract disputes, including the option to specify state law and arbitration clauses with the right to decline. The 2008 farm bill amended the P&S Act to allow poultry growers and swine producers to cancel contracts within three days. It also added provisions regarding choice of law and venue in contract disputes, including the option to specify state law and arbitration clauses with the right to decline. Additionally, the bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations ensuring producers and growers have a meaningful chance to participate in the arbitration process and establish criteria for violations of the P&S Act, including determining undue preference, notice requirements for poultry dealers, and additional capital criteria. Regulations were to be issued within two years of the bill's enactment. On June 22, 2010, GIPSA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register regarding criteria for capital investments in poultry or swine contracts and time given to remedy breaches before termination. The comment period was extended to November 22, 2010, due to industry feedback and concerns from Congress. Over 61,000 public comments were received, with approximately 30,000 unique comments. The USDA proposed a rule to address the use of contracting in livestock and poultry production, aiming to level the playing field between packers, dealers, contractors, and growers. The rule covered competitive injury, unfair practices, preferences, and arbitration. It included new requirements for contracts and market practices to prevent unfair practices. The proposed rule aims to create a fair, transparent market for livestock and poultry producers by introducing new requirements for contracts and market practices. GIPSA defined competitive injury and outlined unlawful actions under the P&S Act to prevent unfair, discriminatory, or deceptive practices, undue preferences, and actions that restrain commerce. The proposed rule addresses unlawful acts under the P&S Act, focusing on proving harm to competition by meat packers or poultry processors. GIPSA defines competitive injury as any action distorting competition and likelihood of competitive injury as conduct raising costs or misusing market power. The rule extends this definition to include actions by packers, contractors, and poultry dealers. The proposed rule by GIPSA addresses competitive injury to livestock producers and poultry growers caused by unfair practices by meat packers and poultry dealers. These actions can depress prices or prevent competition without requiring proof of harm to competition. The USDA provided eight examples of unfair practices by meat packers and poultry dealers, including deceitful actions, coercion, refusal to provide data, limiting legal rights, undocumented premiums or discounts, terminating contracts based on allegations, fraudulent practices, and acts causing competitive injury. Additionally, USDA proposed a 90-day notice requirement for live poultry dealers before suspending bird deliveries to growers. The proposed rule addresses capital investment requirements for poultry and swine producers, including criteria for violations of the P&S Act. Contractors may need to make additional investments, but waivers are possible for emergencies. The proposed rule sets criteria for violations of the P&S Act, including giving growers sufficient opportunity to remedy breaches. Written notice must be provided, allowing growers to rebut claims. Contractors must consider animal welfare when addressing breaches. USDA also proposed banning packer-to-packer sales of livestock. The proposed rule addresses violations of the P&S Act, including prohibiting packer-to-packer sales of livestock. It also aims to prevent packers from manipulation and ensure fair treatment for producers of poultry or livestock products. The Secretary of Agriculture would use three criteria to determine if producers were treated with undue preference. The proposed rule under the P&S Act addresses violations such as differential pricing justification and prohibiting discounting by live poultry dealers. It also aims to ensure fair treatment for producers in poultry and livestock markets. GIPSA proposed rules to address violations in livestock and poultry markets, including prohibiting discounting by live poultry dealers and restricting livestock dealers from buying for more than one packer. Additionally, contractors would be required to provide sample copies of unique contracts to GIPSA for transparency. GIPSA proposed rules for livestock and poultry markets, including transparency requirements for contractors to provide sample contracts. Section 201.219 sets criteria for arbitration, ensuring disclosure of costs, process, and limits to legal rights. Contracts must comply with the Federal Arbitration Act and give growers the right to decline arbitration. The curr_chunk discusses the right of a poultry grower, livestock producer, or swine production contract grower to decline arbitration in an agreement. They can indicate their choice by signing a statement provided. Failure to choose voids the contract. The Appendix includes a summary of pro and con positions for each provision. On November 3, 2011, USDA submitted final and interim rules on livestock and poultry marketing practices to OMB for review. The final rule included provisions on bird delivery suspension, capital investment, breach of contract, and arbitration, as well as sample contracts. A separate interim rule on poultry tournament pricing was planned. However, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 limited USDA's ability to finalize the rule. The FY2012 appropriations provision restricted USDA from using funds to publish a final or interim rule with an economic impact over $100 million, affecting the GIPSA rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices. Critics believed the rule could have billion-dollar economic impacts and criticized USDA for lack of comprehensive analysis. Secretary Vilsack assured Congress that public comments were being analyzed for additional economic analysis. The FY2012 appropriations provision restricted USDA from implementing certain sections of the proposed rule, regardless of economic impact. It prohibited funding for finalizing definitions and criteria related to competitive practices and preferences, as well as collecting sample contracts and finalizing regulations. The USDA was restricted from implementing certain sections of the proposed rule by the FY2012 appropriations provision. This included finalizing definitions and criteria related to competitive practices and preferences, as well as collecting sample contracts and finalizing regulations. The final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices was published on December 9, 2011, and went into effect on February 7, 2012, including provisions such as suspension of bird delivery, additional capital investment, remedy of breach of contract, and arbitration. The final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices, published on December 9, 2011, included provisions on suspension of bird delivery, additional capital investment, remedy of breach of contract, and arbitration. The final rule also addressed criteria for determining violations of the P&S Act, making adjustments based on public comments and focusing on criteria rather than prescriptive measures. Section 11006(1) on \"undue or unreasonable preference or advantage\" was not included in the final rule. The final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices, published on December 9, 2011, included provisions on suspension of bird delivery and arbitration. The rule addresses criteria for determining violations of the P&S Act, focusing on criteria rather than prescriptive measures. The rule examines whether poultry companies give growers a 90-day notice of bird delivery suspension. The final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices, published on December 9, 2011, included provisions on suspension of bird delivery and arbitration. USDA may consider natural disasters or emergencies when determining violations of the P&S Act. The annual cost to the industry for providing written notices to poultry growers was estimated at $75,480. The rule established criteria for contracts requiring additional capital investment, with small changes made based on public comments. The final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices, published on December 9, 2011, included provisions on suspension of bird delivery and arbitration. It moved the equipment part of the proposed rule on capital investments requirements and prohibitions into Section 201.216. Compensation incentives for new equipment investments are now criteria for determining a violation of the P&S Act. The provision on remedy of a breach of contract addressed Section 11006(4) of the 2008 farm bill, providing criteria for determining a reasonable time for remedy before contract termination. The final rule provision on remedy of a breach of contract, similar to the proposed provision, includes criteria for growers or producers to address breaches, with a description, date, means of remedy, and deadline. The 14-day rebuttal period was removed as it was seen as a requirement. The final rule also includes a provision for contracts to allow poultry growers and livestock producers to decline arbitration. The final rule provision allows growers and producers to decline arbitration in contracts, with criteria for addressing breaches and ensuring a meaningful opportunity to participate in arbitration. Opponents criticized the lack of a rigorous economic impact analysis in USDA's proposed rule. In the final rule, USDA estimated the economic impact of the provisions to range from $21.3 million to $72.1 million, with costs falling mainly on the poultry sector. High cost estimates were attributed to potential litigation or administrative actions, but since contentious provisions were excluded, costs were lower than industry estimates. Reaction to the final rule was mixed, with some proponents seeing it as a modest start. The final rule, seen as a \"start\" by some, disappointed proponents for not addressing key anticompetitive issues in livestock and poultry industries. The National Farmers Union praised it as a first step towards market transparency and fairness but urged USDA to implement competitive injury provisions. While opponents were generally satisfied, concerns lingered about unfinalized provisions and their future impact. Provisions defining competitive injury, unfair practices, and preferences in the proposed rule were contentious. Opponents feared increased litigation between packers, poultry dealers, and producers. Concerns remained about USDA potentially re-evaluating and re-proposing these provisions. The GIPSA rule debate lasted from 2010 to 2011, with potential implications for the upcoming farm bill debate. Major concerns and arguments for and against the rule are detailed in the report's appendix. Proponents of the proposed rule argued that the P&S Act had not lived up to its potential due to lack of proper rules and incorrect court interpretations. The proposed rule aimed to bring fairness to contracts and reshape interactions between producers and meat packers, especially for poultry growers. The Organization for Competitive Markets (OCM) supported the rule, emphasizing the need to address court rulings on competition requirements. The proposed rule aims to reinvigorate the P&S Act for poultry growers who heavily rely on contracts. Opponents are concerned about the potential impacts and the establishment of criteria for violating the Act. They fear the rule will disrupt current business practices and lead to increased litigation. Opponents of the proposed rule on the P&S Act raised concerns about imposing a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach on different livestock sectors due to their varied market structures. They questioned if GIPSA had exceeded Congress's intent in the 2008 farm bill and if they had the authority to revise existing regulations. Opponents of the proposed rule on the P&S Act raised concerns about GIPSA's authority to revise regulations, arguing that the rule went beyond the 2008 farm bill. GIPSA justified its authority under Section 407 of the P&S Act, supported by 21 Senators who emphasized GIPSA's responsibility to address the rule's subject matter. The proposed rule on the P&S Act faced opposition from industry groups and some Members of Congress, who argued it exceeded the requirements of the farm bill and contradicted congressional votes and federal court decisions. One contentious issue was GIPSA's stance that harm to competition is not necessary to establish a violation of the P&S Act, citing unfair or deceptive practices as sufficient grounds according to USDA interpretation. GIPSA argued that harm to competition is not required to establish a violation of the P&S Act, contrary to USDA's interpretation. They highlighted that Congress did not include conditions of \"harm to competition\" in certain sections of the Act, and courts have disagreed with USDA's view on this matter. This argument was supported by a letter from 21 Senators to Secretary Vilsack. The principle is that courts should defer to federal agencies' interpretation of laws. GIPSA's proposed rule states that the P&S Act protects individual producers from unfair practices without needing to prove harm to the market. GIPSA aims to establish criteria for violations of the Act, focusing on actions that harm producers financially. Proponents of the rule argue that it is challenging to prove harm to competition under the P&S Act. GIPSA provided examples of individual producers being harmed by packer or poultry processor behavior without necessarily affecting competition. Opponents claim that federal courts require proof of harm to win a case, with the American Meat Institute accusing USDA of trying to bypass the courts through rulemaking. AMI argued that changing the law through bureaucratic fiat rather than Congress could weaken the standard of proof in P&S Act cases, potentially leading to a decrease in the use of alternative marketing arrangements and hindering market innovations in the meat industry. In the long run, the meat industry could become more concentrated if AMAs are undermined, as packers and poultry processors would seek more control over their slaughter supplies. Provisions in various appropriations acts have prevented USDA from finalizing rules on competition harm and unfair practices. Opponents argue that proposed rules could disrupt livestock and poultry markets, while proponents believe they are necessary to prevent price manipulation by packers and processors. The proposed rule aims to limit livestock dealers to working with a single packer to prevent collusion and price manipulation. This would open up livestock markets to more buyers and benefit the cow/bull slaughter market. Opponents argue that this restriction could impose a burden on livestock dealers. Opponents argue that restricting livestock dealers to a single packer could burden small packers who lack resources to send multiple dealers to different market zones. This could reduce competition in small markets and increase transaction costs for packers. USDA decided not to finalize this rule in November 2011. The proposed rule aimed to ban packer-to-packer sales in Section 201.212(c) to prevent price manipulation. Proponents argued that without public reporting of these sales, producers would miss crucial market signals. Opponents believed such a ban could harm the market and accelerate industry consolidation. Critics stated that packer-to-packer sales are essential for balancing supply and demand at the plant level. The USDA proposed banning packer-to-packer sales to prevent price manipulation, but opponents argued it could harm the market. Without these sales, packers may integrate further into livestock production or sell feeding facilities, raising animal welfare concerns. The final rule was not finalized, and the tournament system is used by poultry processors to pay growers based on flock quality rankings. The proposed rule aimed to regulate the tournament system used by poultry processors to pay growers based on flock quality rankings. Growers would be required to receive the same base pay for raising the same type of poultry and be ranked in settlement groups with similar facilities. Critics argued that the system allowed poultry companies to shift risks to growers and was anticompetitive. Proponents argued that the proposed tournament provisions in the poultry industry would limit the control contract growers have over their flocks, while opponents, primarily processors, believed it would penalize the best growers. They also raised concerns that the rule could lead to reduced base pay levels and increased litigation, ultimately discouraging premium pricing for top performers. The USDA intended to publish an interim final rule on poultry tournament pricing, requiring equal base pay for growers raising the same breed of poultry. The rule clarified definitions and estimated a $22.6 million industry cost. The final rule issued in December 2011 did not include provisions on tournament systems. The USDA's final rule issued in December 2011 did not include provisions on tournament systems. The proposed rule in Section 201.94 required packers, swine contractors, or live poultry dealers to maintain written records justifying differential pricing or deviations from standard terms for poultry growers, swine production contract growers, or livestock producers. The USDA argued that better documentation would help enforce the P&S Act against unfair pricing practices. Opponents disagreed with this approach. Opponents criticized the USDA's proposed rule on recordkeeping for differential pricing, arguing it was too vague and could lead to more litigation. They believed that buyers may avoid alternative marketing arrangements that pay premiums for specific livestock traits, affecting supply and efficiency in high-capacity plants. Producers would also be negatively impacted as many rely on contracts for marketing agreements. Opponents of the USDA's proposed rule on recordkeeping for differential pricing raised concerns about potential impacts on producers who rely on contracts with packers to limit price volatility and obtain capital. They argued that the rule could lead to a loss of economic incentives for producing higher quality meat and could hinder value-based marketing. Critics also questioned the acceptability of specific documents as proof for price differentials and called for clarity on industry-wide criteria, such as feed/pasture information, genetics, and medical history. Livestock with market price premiums typically have identifiable physical attributes, and top producers may already have suitable records for enforcement. Critics of the USDA's proposed rule on recordkeeping for differential pricing raised concerns about market situations where price differentials might emerge due to factors like timing or geographic conditions. They provided an example of a packer needing additional cattle and making higher-priced offers to meet demand, questioning if this would violate the law. USDA decided not to finalize the provision on recordkeeping in response to public comments. The USDA's proposed recordkeeping provision was not finalized due to concerns about unintended consequences and the need to create new records. The regulations aimed to shift production risk from producers to poultry processors to rebalance power dynamics in contract negotiations. USDA sought authority to limit capital investment upgrades in the poultry industry to prevent potential harm. The USDA proposed regulations to limit capital investment upgrades in the poultry industry to prevent harm to producers' financial positions. Critics questioned the government guaranteeing a rate of return and argued that underperforming producers would have an unfair advantage. Provisions included a requirement for poultry growers to receive a 90-day notice before bird deliveries were suspended, which opponents deemed excessive. The USDA proposed regulations to limit capital investment upgrades in the poultry industry to protect producers' financial positions. Provisions included requirements for public disclosure of contracts and criteria for determining violations of the P&S Act. Critics raised concerns about transparency and the potential disclosure of proprietary information in contracts. The USDA proposed regulations to limit capital investment upgrades in the poultry industry to protect producers' financial positions. Critics argued that every adjustment to a standard contract would reveal proprietary marketing strategy. Provisions in appropriations acts prohibited USDA from finalizing its provision on livestock and poultry contracts. Opponents of the rule were concerned about the lack of a rigorous economic impact analysis. The rule was deemed \"significant\" by the Office of Management and Budget, requiring an explanation of the regulation's need, assessment of costs and benefits, and OMB review. The proposed rule faced criticism for its incomplete cost-benefit analysis and potential market consequences. 115 Members of Congress expressed concerns that the rule exceeded the 2008 farm bill mandate and would lead to significant changes in livestock and poultry marketing. They questioned the need for the rule, its impact on the marketplace, and how it would address the demonstrated need. Secretary Vilsack promised a more thorough economic analysis in response to concerns raised by Members of Congress regarding the proposed rule's impact on livestock and poultry marketing. R-CALF USA supported this move for a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. The proposed rule by USDA was deemed significant and required a cost-benefit analysis. GIPSA identified three categories of costs in the rule, but most estimates were qualitative. Opponents hoped for a more limited scope after Secretary Vilsack mentioned redrafting the rule based on public comments. The cost of record retention for supporting differential pricing would depend on current recordkeeping levels. The benefits include price determination based on supply and demand, increased transparency in pricing decisions, prevention of monopolistic practices, and a fairer, more competitive market. GIPSA quantified costs for specific sections of the proposed rule as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. GIPSA estimated the cost of recordkeeping and analysis for differential pricing at $372,300 per year for the industry. Additional costs included $24,083 per year for submitting sample contracts, $12,500 per year for changing notifications for bird deliveries, and $6,000 for administering breach of contract provisions. Three studies by meat and poultry industries analyzed the proposed rule's impact on the U.S. economy and livestock sectors. Three studies by the meat and poultry industries analyzed the impact of GIPSA's proposed rule on the U.S. economy and livestock sectors. The first study, conducted for the American Meat Institute, projected increased litigation leading to inefficiencies, higher meat prices, and a $14 billion decline in GDP with a loss of over 104,000 jobs. Another study by Informa Economics, Inc. estimated the economic impact of the proposed rules. The study by Informa Economics, Inc. estimated the economic impact of GIPSA's proposed rules on the beef, pork, and poultry industries. One-time direct costs were projected at $136 million, with ongoing annual costs estimated at $169 million. Indirect costs were also considered, including losses in product quality and efficiencies. The estimated indirect costs for the beef, pork, and poultry industries were over $1.3 billion annually, with a significant impact on GDP and jobs. A study by Informa Economics projected ongoing costs for the chicken industry to exceed $1 billion over five years. The FarmEcon study projected that costs for the chicken industry would increase over a five-year period, with feed and housing costs rising by $794 million and additional costs related to bird death loss and administrative expenses. The study also highlighted potential higher costs from increased litigation, impacting industry innovation. Representative Frank Lucas of the House Committee on Agriculture expressed interest in overseeing the implementation of the proposed GIPSA rule during the 112th Congress. During the 112th Congress, the Agriculture Committee oversaw the GIPSA rule, which faced concerns from Congress and led to appropriations riders restricting USDA's implementation. The rule was debated in farm bill discussions, with restrictions continuing through FY2015 before being omitted in the FY2016 appropriations bill. The GIPSA rule was debated in farm bill discussions during the 112th Congress, with restrictions continuing through FY2015. The FY2016 appropriations bill did not contain a GIPSA rider. The Agriculture Act of 2014 did not include a GIPSA repeal provision. Secretary Vilsack was asked about the proposed rule during oversight hearings in 2011. Secretary Vilsack indicated that USDA was working on the economic analysis for the proposed rule without providing a specific time frame. The Secretary was also asked about peer-reviewing the analysis and allowing for a public comment period, but no commitment was given. Members of the House of Representatives requested public comment on any revisions to the proposed rule and the new economic analysis in a letter to Secretary Vilsack. The proposed rule was discussed in several hearings, including ones on the state of the beef, pork, and poultry sectors. The House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry and the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry expressed concerns about the proposed rule impacting the livestock industry. Industry representatives and Senators raised economic worries, while the National Farmers Union supported the rule for marketplace fairness. The GIPSA proposed rule was also discussed in oversight hearings by the House Committee on Small Business and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with industry witnesses voicing concerns about potential economic damage. In the Small Business hearing, a witness from a Pennsylvania farm organization testified that the proposed rule would protect poultry growers and hog producers from competition loss due to industry consolidation. Representative Marcy Kaptur opposed Section 721 in the FY2012 appropriations bill, arguing that the rule benefitted farmers and ranchers. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about GIPSA's proposed rule on livestock marketing practices, questioning compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act and limiting public input by closing the comment period early. The Senate version of H.R. 2112 passed without addressing these issues. The FY2012 conference report for H.R. 2112 included Section 721 with conditions and prohibitions on USDA's authority to finalize certain parts of the proposed rule. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) was enacted on November 18, 2011, imposing significant restrictions on the proposed rule. Proponents saw this as a setback, while opponents believed their concerns were addressed through Section 721. The American Meat Institute commended lawmakers for preventing GIPSA from implementing disruptive provisions in its 2010 proposed rule. The FY2013 appropriations act continued to block USDA from finalizing the majority of the GIPSA rule, including rescinding three provisions finalized in December 2011. In 2011, the USDA finalized three provisions related to the GIPSA rule, including the definition of \"suspension of delivery of birds,\" applicability to live poultry, and a 90-day notification period. Section 742 required USDA to rescind these provisions within 60 days. The House FY2013 appropriations bill aimed to rescind these provisions, while the Senate bill did not. The provisions were not included in the FY2013 continuing resolution. In FY2013, the GIPSA rule provisions finalized in 2011 were not included in the continuing resolution. The House and Senate bills differed on rescinding these provisions, with the Senate bill including language to continue the prohibitions on finalizing and implementing parts of the GIPSA rule. In FY2013, the GIPSA rule provisions finalized in 2011 were not included in the continuing resolution. Section 742 was included in the House and Senate negotiations over Agriculture appropriations in December 2012, sparking debate and opposition from proponents of the GIPSA rule. Senators proposed an amendment to remove the GIPSA provisions from the appropriations bill, but it did not receive a floor vote. The FY2014 Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 2410) continued the prohibition on USDA using funds for certain GIPSA rule provisions. The Senate bill (S. 1244) did not have a similar provision. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) also prohibited USDA from finalizing certain GIPSA rule parts for FY2014. For FY2015, the continuing resolution extended GIPSA funding prohibitions and prohibited finalizing GIPSA rule provisions. USDA issued a final rule removing three provisions from regulations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 does not include a GIPSA rider prohibiting USDA from finalizing rules on livestock and poultry marketing. Efforts to prohibit the GIPSA rule through appropriations bills expire at the end of the fiscal year. Critics sought a permanent solution through farm bill legislation, with provisions in the 2013 House farm bills aiming to prevent USDA from implementing the GIPSA rule. The 2013 farm bill did not include GIPSA repeal provisions, and the 2014 Agriculture Act also omitted the provision. An amendment in the House Agriculture Committee aimed to permanently stop USDA from implementing certain sections of the GIPSA rule. The FY2013 appropriations bill (P.L. 113-6) included amendments related to the suspension of delivery of birds and notification requirements. The Conaway-Costa amendment was adopted by the House Agriculture Committee and became part of H.R. 1947. After H.R. 1947 failed, the GIPSA provision was included in H.R. 2642, which passed the House. The GIPSA provision became Section 12102 of the amended House farm bill. The House farm bill (H.R. 2642) includes a GIPSA provision in Section 12102. Proponents of the GIPSA rule oppose this provision, stating it would undermine farmer protections. Stakeholders supporting the GIPSA rule are concerned that prohibiting USDA from issuing similar policies could limit future rulemaking. The Livestock Marketing Association has expressed these concerns. The Livestock Marketing Association (LMA) notes concerns about the House farm bill's GIPSA provision, which could limit future USDA rulemaking if deemed similar to the 2010 GIPSA rule. LMA recommends dropping the \"similar to\" language to avoid hindering future updates widely supported by industry."
