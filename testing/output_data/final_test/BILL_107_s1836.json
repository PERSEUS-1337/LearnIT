    "content": "The \"Veterinary Health Enhancement Act\" establishes scholarship and loan repayment programs for veterinary medicine under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish a scholarship program for students attending veterinary schools in exchange for providing veterinary services in shortage areas. Additionally, a loan repayment program will be implemented for veterinarians who agree to work in these areas in exchange for up to $35,000 repayment per year of service. The loan repayment program offers veterinarians up to $35,000 per year to repay educational loans in shortage areas, defined by the Secretary as urban or rural areas, population groups, or medical facilities lacking veterinarians. The loan repayment program offers veterinarians up to $35,000 per year to repay educational loans in shortage areas designated by the Secretary in consultation with state veterinary officials and other relevant entities. Eligibility for the program requires approval from the chief veterinary-medicine official of the state. The State veterinary-medicine official approves eligibility for the loan repayment program, consulting with relevant entities in the State. The State involved is determined based on the individual's attendance at a veterinary school or the location of the veterinarian shortage area where services will be provided. The program established in subsection (a) will have provisions similar to the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. The program established in subsection (b) will have provisions similar to the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program. The program established in subsection (b) will apply in the same manner as the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program. The term 'school of veterinary medicine' is defined in section 799B. Up to $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2002 through 2006 for the scholarship and loan repayment programs under subsections (a) and (b) respectively."
