    "content": "The \"Claremont Commission Act\" establishes a nonpartisan commission called the \"Claremont Commission\" to implement an agreement for Federal election campaign reform made in Claremont, New Hampshire in 1995. The Claremont Commission Act establishes the Claremont Commission to implement Federal election campaign reform goals, including limiting money influence, increasing public confidence, voter participation, encouraging qualified candidates, creating an equitable electoral system, removing negative financing aspects, and safeguarding political parties' role. The Commission established by the Claremont Commission Act will study and make recommendations for changes to the law governing Federal election campaigns. This includes examining the amount of money spent on campaigns, the impact of campaign laws on qualified candidates, and whether the current campaign financing system promotes trust in the political process among voters. The Commission will study the current campaign financing system to determine if it ensures the electorate is well-informed of candidates' positions. It will also consider amending laws to restrict contributions from certain entities and examine how unions, corporations, and political action committees raise money for political campaigns. The Federal Election Commission will consider amending laws to restrict contributions and spending on political campaigns, including limiting \"soft money\" donations to political parties and independent expenditures by corporations. Additionally, there will be a discussion on defining \"express advocacy\" and \"independent expenditure\" to include certain forms of issue advertising under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The Federal Election Commission will discuss various amendments to campaign finance laws, including the availability of discounted broadcast time for candidates, potential changes to contribution limits, and the need for more accurate disclosures in campaign financing. There will also be a consideration of the Commission's oversight powers and whether additional enforcement powers are necessary. The Federal Election Commission will discuss amendments to campaign finance laws, including oversight and enforcement powers, and other relevant matters as deemed appropriate. SEC. 6. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 9 private sector members appointed by the President, Senate majority leader, House Speaker, Senate minority leader, and House minority leader. The chairperson will be appointed jointly by the Senate majority and minority leaders and the House Speaker and minority leader. Appointments must be expedited by the specified officials. The House of Representatives will appoint members of the Commission within 10 days of the Act's enactment. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Each member will receive compensation based on the Executive Schedule. A quorum of six members is required for decisions, and meetings will be called by the chairperson or at the request of six members. SEC. 7. The chairperson of the Commission has the authority to appoint necessary staff without following standard appointment procedures. SEC. 8. Procedures for recommendations and fast-tracking decisions will be implemented. The Commission must submit a report to Congress within 270 days of enacting the Act, detailing the study conducted. The report may include recommendations for changes in federal campaign laws, and if 6 or more members agree on a plan, they will prepare a bill for implementation. The implementing bill will be expedited for consideration by Congress. The implementing bill prepared based on the report must be expedited for consideration by Congress, similar to a trade agreement bill under the Trade Act of 1974. The Commission will dissolve 30 days after submitting the report. $750,000 is authorized for implementing this Act."
