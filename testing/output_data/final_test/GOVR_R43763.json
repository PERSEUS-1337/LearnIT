    "content": "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low-wage workers, providing financial assistance, especially for those with children. Childless recipients can receive up to $500. Proposed legislative changes in the 113th Congress aim to modify how the credit is calculated or eligibility requirements. The report discusses legislative proposals to modify the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for workers with and without qualifying children, as well as other modifications to the credit. Eligibility for the EITC is based on various factors such as residence, presence of qualifying children, age requirements, investment income, and earned income. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) eligibility criteria include residence and ID requirements, such as providing valid Social Security numbers for work purposes. To qualify for the credit, the tax filer must have a qualifying child with a specific relationship to them. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) eligibility criteria require the tax filer to have a qualifying child who meets age requirements and shares a residence with them for more than half the year in the United States. Tax filers with no qualifying children must be between 25 and 64 years old to qualify for the EITC. Additionally, tax filers with investment income greater than $3,350 in 2014 are ineligible for the EITC. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is calculated based on a recipient's earnings, with specific parameters such as credit rate, earned income amount, and phase-out amount. The credit gradually decreases as earnings exceed the phase-out amount. Various factors, including the number of qualifying children and marital status, determine the EITC amount. Figure 1 illustrates the EITC amount for an unmarried recipient with one child. The EITC for unmarried recipients with one child in 2014 phases in at 34% of earnings under $9,720, reaching a maximum of $3,305 at $9,720 and remaining until earnings exceed $17,830. Above this threshold, the credit decreases by 15.98 cents for every dollar over $17,830, with ineligibility at earnings of $38,511. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to expand the EITC for childless workers by modifying the calculation to increase the credit amount. The EITC for childless workers is being modified to increase the credit amount, with legislative changes aimed at expanding eligibility and increasing the credit rate. These changes would raise the maximum value of the credit from $496 to approximately $1,000 to $1,500, depending on the specific bill. Under proposed legislation, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for childless workers would see an increase in the credit rate, with potential maximum values ranging from $1,000 to $1,500. The earned income amount, which determines the maximum credit value, would also be adjusted to benefit most EITC claimants. Under H.R. 2116, the childless EITC would see an increase in the maximum credit value to $765, with the earnings level for maximum value rising to $8,820. Increasing the phase-out amount would also benefit tax filers in the phase-out range. H.R. 4117 proposes to increase the phase-out amount for unmarried tax filers to $16,630 and permanently raise marriage penalty relief to $3,000 for childless workers. The bill H.R. 2116 aims to increase marriage penalty relief permanently to $8,000 for childless workers and raise the phase-out amount for unmarried recipients to $10,425. Additionally, it would make the temporary increase in marriage penalty relief of $5,000 permanent. Legislative changes proposed by H.R. 4117 and S. 836 would expand eligibility for the EITC for childless workers by lowering the minimum age requirement. The childless EITC eligibility age requirement may be lowered from 25 to 21 by bills H.R. 4117 and S. 836, as well as H.R. 2116 and S. 2162. The Obama Administration's budget proposal suggests expanding eligibility for workers aged 21 to 67. Full-time students aged 21 to 24 would still be ineligible for the EITC. H.R. 2116 proposes allowing tax filers to receive the childless EITC even if they do not provide all SSNs of their qualifying children. Current EITC requirements include children being relatives, living with the filer for over half the year in the U.S., and being under 19 years old (or 24 if a full-time student). This definition allows a child to qualify for multiple tax filers in the household. A child can be the qualifying child of multiple tax filers in a household, but only one can claim the EITC. If a qualifying child is not claimed for the EITC, childless workers cannot claim it. This rule applies even if the child's parent lives with them and is also their qualifying child. H.R. 2116 proposes allowing tax filers who did not claim their qualifying child for the EITC to claim the EITC for childless workers if the child was claimed by another filer. This rule would not apply if the child lived with both parents. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget also aims to simplify rules regarding qualifying child presence. The proposal aims to simplify rules for claiming the EITC for workers with qualifying children. Several bills in Congress seek to expand the EITC for families with three or more children, making temporary credits permanent. Additionally, there are provisions to enable separated spouses with children to claim the credit and expand the EITC for tax filers with four or more qualifying children. S. 2162 proposes allowing dual-earner couples with at least one child to reduce their earned income for a larger EITC credit. The EITC value depends on the credit rate, which increases with the number of qualifying children, up to three. The current credit rates are 34%, 40%, and 45% for recipients with one, two, and three or more qualifying children, respectively. The ARRA of 2009 introduced a 45% credit rate for families with three or more children, which has been extended multiple times on a temporary basis. The EITC modification was extended multiple times on a temporary basis, most recently through the end of 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Increasing the credit rate results in a larger credit. Proposed bills aim to make the 45% credit rate for families with three or more children permanent. H.R. 2320 would expand the EITC for tax filers with four or more qualifying children by increasing the credit rate. Married tax filers generally have two options when filing their tax returns. Currently, only married tax filers who file jointly can claim the EITC, but separated spouses with qualifying children can claim it as unmarried tax filers if they meet specific criteria. They must have lived apart for the last six months of the year, lived with the child for more than six months, and pass the \"household maintenance test.\" This test requires them to pay more than half of household expenses from their own income. H.R. 2116 aims to allow married tax filers living separately with qualifying children to claim the EITC without meeting the \"household maintenance test\" requirements. If certain conditions are met, they can claim the EITC as unmarried individuals with qualifying children, even if the other spouse does not live with a qualifying child. S. 2162 proposes a \"dual earner deduction\" for married couples with at least one child to reduce their earned income for calculating the EITC. This deduction allows the tax filer to reduce earnings by 20% of the spouse with the lesser earnings, up to a maximum deduction of $12,000. For example, a couple with one child earning $25,000 and $10,000 could benefit from this provision. The dual-earner deduction proposed in S. 2162 allows married couples with at least one child to reduce their earned income for calculating the EITC. For example, a couple with one child earning $25,000 and $10,000 could benefit from this provision by increasing their EITC from $1,429 to $1,749 in 2014. Additionally, bills like H.R. 4117 aim to expand EITC eligibility to individuals in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico and American Samoa. The legislation, H.R. 2116, proposes to allow Puerto Rico and American Samoa to distribute EITC benefits to their residents without the current investment income limitation. This provision would not apply to other U.S. territories. The Camp proposal would make significant changes to the EITC, reducing the credit amount, rates, and eligibility criteria. It would also modify the age limit for qualifying children. These changes are part of broader tax code revisions affecting family- and child-related provisions. The Camp proposal includes changes to the EITC, such as reducing the credit amount and eligibility criteria. Other tax code revisions expand the child tax credit, standard deduction, and 10% tax bracket, potentially offsetting EITC reductions for some low-income workers. Tax filers with income under $20,000 may see a tax reduction, but the actual impact depends on individual circumstances. The impact of the proposal on individual taxpayers would vary based on factors such as income, number and age of qualifying children, and filing status. The EITC parameters are adjusted annually for inflation using the CPI. Different parameters may have different base years for inflation adjustment. The inflation adjustment for the EITC is based on the average CPI from September to August of the previous year. Various bills in Congress propose changes to the EITC amounts for childless workers, with different base years for inflation adjustments. The Obama Administration's FY2015 proposal does not specify the base year for inflation adjustments."
