    "content": "The FDA assesses the novelty of active ingredients in new drugs to determine eligibility for new chemical entity exclusivity, which grants a competitive advantage in the market for five years. This exclusivity prevents the FDA from accepting applications that rely on the clinical data of the drug with exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were passed to address the costs of bringing new drugs to market. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984 created NCE exclusivity to reward innovators of new pharmaceutical products with a chance to recoup their investment. FDA evaluates the active ingredients of drugs to determine if certain provisions of the FD&C Act apply, which can be complex due to chemical reactions in the body. The active ingredient in drugs can be complex to determine due to chemical reactions in the body. Different drug molecules with the same core compound may have different compounds attached to them, raising questions about which derivative should be considered the same active ingredient. The FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety\" has led to disputes with pharmaceutical companies over NCE exclusivity. This interpretation expands the drugs eligible for generic versions by considering more derivatives as the same active ingredient. In 2015, a federal court rejected FDA's interpretation of the FD&C Act regarding NCE exclusivity. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to codify FDA's current approach to evaluating NCE exclusivity and extend it to other provisions under the FD&C Act. Multiple provisions of the FD&C Act use the phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient).\" The FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" in the context of NCE exclusivity has been a subject of debate for decades. The agency defines \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety\" to encourage innovation in new drug development. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to codify FDA's approach and extend it to other provisions of the FD&C Act. The NCE exclusivity provision in the FD&C Act focuses on the approval of drugs with new active ingredients, specifically concerning the interpretation of \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety\" by the FDA. This interpretation has been a topic of debate, with ongoing discussions on how the provision should be applied. The FDA defines NCE exclusivity as a drug containing no active moiety approved in any other application. An active moiety is the molecule responsible for the drug's physiological or pharmacological action, excluding certain appended portions. This definition is crucial in determining exclusivity for drugs with new active ingredients. Derivative versions of the same molecule with different appendages share the same active moiety. If FDA approves a drug with one derivative as the active ingredient, later approved drugs with other derivatives or the core molecule would not get NCE exclusivity. For example, if Drug A contains a derivative previously approved in Drug B, it would not be entitled to NCE exclusivity. If Drug A contains a non-ester covalent derivative of a molecule previously approved in Drug B, it may be eligible for NCE exclusivity. The final drug product before ingestion determines the active moiety. FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety\" in NCE exclusivity has been disputed. The FDA's interpretation of \"active moiety\" in NCE exclusivity has been debated, particularly regarding noncovalent derivatives of drug molecules. The agency distinguishes between NCEs and previously approved active ingredients based on active moieties to determine exclusivity periods. The FDA's interpretation of \"active moiety\" for NCE exclusivity is based on a compound containing a new active moiety. FDA reasoned that Congress did not intend to grant exclusivity for minor variations of previously approved chemical compounds. The FDA's interpretation of \"active moiety\" for NCE exclusivity was challenged in court in cases like Abbott Laboratories v. Young, where the court found ambiguity in the FD&C Act's use of the phrase \"active ingredient.\" The court considered FDA's denial of exclusivity for Depakote, which used divalproex sodium as its active ingredient. The D.C. Circuit rejected FDA's interpretation of \"active moiety\" for NCE exclusivity, finding the term \"including\" linguistically infeasible. The court concluded that Congress used \"including\" to extend coverage to specific derivatives like esters and salts, not as examples of undeserving molecules. The case was remanded to FDA for further action, while the Federal Circuit also considered related issues. The Federal Circuit reviewed the USPTO's denial of Glaxo's patent-term extension for cefuroxime axetil, the active ingredient in Ceftin tablets. The USPTO determined that cefuroxime, not cefuroxime axetil, was the active moiety, leading to the denial. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment that the USPTO's denial of Glaxo's patent-term extension for cefuroxime axetil in Ceftin was contrary to law. The court found that the USPTO's interpretation of the relevant statutory language was inconsistent with the plain meaning of the terms. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment that the USPTO's denial of Glaxo's patent-term extension for cefuroxime axetil in Ceftin was contrary to law. The court found no clear legislative intent for the phrase to refer to variations beyond the approved active ingredients' ester or salt, warranting an extension for the patent. The appellate court did not elaborate on its interpretation, but the district court concluded that cefuroxime, from which cefuroxime axetil is derived, could not be considered an \"active ingredient\" of Ceftin. In response to rulings on NCE exclusivity, FDA finalized regulations in 1994 defining \"active moiety\" as the term used in the relevant provision, meaning active ingredient. The agency modified its justification from including all active ingredients with the same active moiety to focusing on active moiety itself. The FDA finalized regulations in 1994 defining \"active moiety\" as the term used in the relevant provision, meaning active ingredient. The agency disagreed with comments objecting to the inclusion of noncovalent derivatives in the definition of \"active moiety,\" stating that such derivatives would not receive NCE exclusivity. The D.C. Circuit upheld FDA's use of pre-ingestion to interpret active ingredient in the Actavis Elizabeth LLC v. FDA case. The FDA finalized regulations in 1994 defining \"active moiety\" as the term used in the relevant provision, meaning active ingredient. A generic manufacturer challenged FDA's award of NCE exclusivity for Vyvanse, a drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Vyvanse's active ingredient is lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a salt of lisdexamfetamine, meaning that lisdexamfetamine is the active moiety under FDA regulations. The FDA regulations define \"active moiety\" as the active ingredient. A generic manufacturer challenged FDA's NCE exclusivity for Vyvanse, arguing that dextroamphetamine is responsible for the therapeutic effect, not lisdexamfetamine. The court rejected this argument, stating that the FD&C Act does not define \"active ingredient.\" The court found that the FD&C Act does not define \"active ingredient\" and that the statute's legislative history is unclear on what determines novelty for NCE exclusivity. The court upheld FDA's interpretation that \"active ingredient\" refers to the pre-ingestion molecule and approved the distinction between noncovalent and non-ester covalent derivatives for NCE exclusivity. The court rejected FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety\" in the case of Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd. v. FDA. FDA denied NCE exclusivity for Vascepa, despite its approval, due to the disagreement over the definition of the active ingredient. FDA denied Amarin's request for NCE exclusivity for Vascepa because it had previously approved Lovaza, a drug containing a mixture of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters. FDA considered the mixture as a whole the \"active ingredient\" for Lovaza, but later found that EPA was an active moiety of Lovaza. This led to the denial of NCE exclusivity for Vascepa. FDA provided a new interpretation framework for certain mixtures like Vascepa, treating them as having one active ingredient but multiple active moieties. The distinction between active ingredient and active moiety is crucial for naturally derived mixtures with multiple molecules, unlike drugs composed of a single molecule. The FDA provided a new framework for identifying active moieties in well-characterized mixtures, distinguishing between poorly characterized and well-characterized mixtures. For poorly characterized mixtures, the whole mixture is treated as the active ingredient and active moiety, while for well-characterized mixtures, a three-part framework is used to identify the active moiety or moieties. The FDA's new framework distinguishes between poorly characterized and well-characterized mixtures in identifying active moieties. For well-characterized mixtures, a one-to-many approach is applied, with one active ingredient having multiple active moieties. The district court set aside FDA's decision denying NCE exclusivity for Vascepa based on its interpretation of \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety\". The court found FDA's definition of active moiety made certain provisions redundant or incomprehensible, as it replaced \"active ingredient\" with \"active moiety.\" This interpretation was deemed to violate the canon against surplusage in statutory language. FDA's view was rejected, as it only applied to the FD&C Act's exclusivity provisions. The FDA adopted different interpretations of \"active ingredient\" in various parts of the statute, arguing that the provisions serve different statutory purposes. For abbreviated NDAs, a narrower range of molecules is considered identical to ensure safety and efficacy reviews. In contrast, exclusivity provisions require a wider range of molecules to encourage innovation in new drugs. The court rejected FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" in the context of new drug approvals, emphasizing that the agency's use of \"active moiety\" was inconsistent with statutory requirements. Congress intended for the abbreviated NDA and exclusivity provisions to balance competition and innovation, distinguishing between the two by including specific language in the exclusivity provision. The court rejected FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" in new drug approvals, emphasizing that the agency's use of \"active moiety\" was inconsistent with statutory requirements. FDA regulations remain in place, but questions linger about their validity and defensibility. Legal challenges have also arisen regarding how FDA defines \"active moiety.\" The FDA's definition of active moiety has been the subject of legal challenges, with brand name manufacturers disputing the inclusion of noncovalent derivatives and generic manufacturers challenging the exclusion of non-ester covalent derivatives for NCE exclusivity. The FDA's definition of active moiety has been challenged in legal disputes regarding NCE exclusivity for derivatives with noncovalent bonds. Abbott Laboratories v. Young addressed the inclusion of noncovalent derivative forms beyond salts and esters, with the court finding FDA's interpretation of \"including\" as overly broad. The court challenged FDA's interpretation of the 'including' clause for NCE exclusivity, leading to FDA modifying its stance in 1994. FDA defined \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety,\" excluding noncovalent derivatives. In 2015, Amarin Pharmaceuticals v. FDA rejected this interpretation. The court upheld FDA's decision to exclude derivatives with non-ester covalent bonds from the definition of active moiety, based on the uniqueness of these derivatives deserving 'new chemical entity' status and five-year exclusivity. The FDA's exclusion of non-ester covalent derivatives from the definition of active moiety was upheld by the court, citing the potential for significant changes in drug activity with minor covalent structure changes. This decision has been the subject of complex litigation, with three bills introduced in Congress to address the issue. The proposed legislation aims to codify FDA's interpretation of NCE exclusivity based on the drug's active moiety and incorporate FDA's definition of active moiety by reference. This change would impact several provisions in the FD&C Act, including NCE exclusivity, three-year exclusivity for other changes, and priority review vouchers for specific treatments. Adopting this interpretation would resolve legal uncertainties under current case law. The proposed legislation aims to adopt FDA's interpretation of NCE exclusivity and resolve legal uncertainties under current case law. It would address questions regarding FDA's ability to defend its interpretation and the inclusion of noncovalent derivative forms of the molecule in its definition of active moiety. The legislation would incorporate FDA's current approach and allow for modifications as needed in the future. The proposed legislation would entrust the decision on molecules deserving NCE exclusivity to the FDA's judgment, including successor regulations."
