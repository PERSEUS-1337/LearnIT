Bajakajian led to the enactment of the bulk cash smuggling provisions of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332, which prohibits carrying or transporting over $10,000 in unreported cash across a U.S. border to evade reporting requirements. This law has been used to prosecute individuals smuggling cash in or out of the country, regardless of whether the money is derived from criminal activity.
