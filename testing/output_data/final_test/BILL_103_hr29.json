    "content": "The Congress finds that ensuring ample opportunity for American youth to develop their intellectual capacities is crucial for the security and welfare of the United States. It is the policy of the United States to provide loans for young people who need financial assistance for post high school education or training. TITLE I--LOANS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS: agreements with institutions Sec. 101 authorizes the Secretary of Education to make agreements with higher education institutions for a student loan program. The agreements specify that funds must be used solely for student loans, limited to two academic years per recipient, and ending by September 30, 2000. The student loan program authorized by Sec. 101 limits recipients to $6,000 for undergraduate enrollment and $8,500 for graduate enrollment per academic year. The average loan per recipient is capped at $4,500 for undergraduates and $6,000 for graduates, with reductions for part-time students. Loan payments are contingent on the recipient's good standing at the institution. The student loan program authorizes loans for undergraduate and graduate students, with limits on the amount per academic year. Recipients must meet academic, financial, and character criteria. Good standing is required for loan payments. The student loan program allows institutions to award additional loans for the third and fourth academic years if needed. The institution must ensure no reduction in financial aid offered from its own resources. The Secretary may include other provisions to protect the financial interest of the United States. The institution must ensure proper execution of loan documents for repayment, with cancellation upon borrower's death or permanent disability. Loans should be disbursed in installments to protect against expenses if the borrower fails to maintain satisfactory standing. \"payments to institutions\" Sec. 102 of the Act outlines the availability of sums appropriated for each fiscal year to establish and maintain a Federal student loan fund at institutions of higher education. The Federal contribution to an institution must be used as agreed upon and not accumulated unnecessarily. Payments for loans for graduate students cannot be used for undergraduate students, and vice versa. If the appropriated amount for a fiscal year is less than the authorized amounts for each institution of higher education, the payments to each institution will be reduced proportionally based on student enrollments to ensure the total does not exceed the appropriation. Repayments of loans are made to institutions of higher education based on student enrollments to ensure the total amount does not exceed the appropriation. Sec. 103 of the Act requires scholars who received a loan to pay 5% of their net taxable income each year until the total sum received is repaid. Alternatively, they can choose to repay 10% of the total sum annually. Regulations will be issued to ensure proper documentation and payment. The student must pay 10% of sums received after no longer being a student for six months. Unpaid sums accrue interest at 2% above the US average rate. Sec. 104 authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the Act for fiscal years 1994-1999. Appropriated sums remain available for financial assistance loans until the end of the succeeding fiscal year. Sec. 201 defines an \"institution of higher education\" as a nonprofit educational institution in any State that admits students with a high school diploma, is authorized to provide post-secondary education, offers a degree program or a two-year program acceptable for degree credit, and is accredited by a recognized agency. The term \"high school\" excludes grades beyond grade 12. A \"nonprofit educational institution\" is owned and operated by corporations or associations where earnings do not benefit private shareholders. The Secretary will publish a list of nationally accrediting agencies deemed reliable for education quality assessment. The term \"public educational institution\" excludes schools or institutions of any US agency. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the US Secretary of Education. The curr_chunk is about the federal administration. The Secretary can delegate functions under the Act, utilize services of government agencies, and appoint advisory committees for advice. Members of advisory committees appointed by the Secretary may receive compensation up to $150 per diem and travel expenses as authorized by law. The General Education Provisions Act applies to committee members. Payments under this Act can be made in installments, in advance, or by reimbursement to individuals, State or Federal agencies, institutions of higher education, or other organizations, with necessary adjustments for overpayments or underpayments. Administrative appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Administrative appropriations are authorized for the cost of administering the provisions of this Act. Nothing in this Act allows the US government to control or impose requirements on educational institutions. The Secretary will conduct a study to assess if this Act can replace other Federal grants. A report with recommendations will be submitted to the President and Congress within two years. This Act will be known as the \"Federal Student Loan Act.\""
