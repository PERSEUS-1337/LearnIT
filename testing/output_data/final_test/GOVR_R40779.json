    "content": "The Federal Election Commission (FEC) was established by Congress in 1974 under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) amendments. It is a six-member independent regulatory agency responsible for enforcing campaign finance laws, administering public financing for presidential campaigns, and conducting outreach and educational activities. The Commission is divided equally among Democrats and Republicans, with at least four commissioners needed for key decisions such as making rules and approving enforcement actions. Enforcement actions by the Federal Election Commission can be triggered by a \"reason to believe\" violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Deadlocked votes on key policy and enforcement issues have been a recurring issue, with criticism directed at the Commission for failing to reach a consensus. This issue gained renewed attention in 2008 when most current Commissioners took office, leading to controversial and publicly disputed decisions. In 2008, the Federal Election Commission faced deadlocked votes on enforcement cases, leading to public disagreement and criticism. Examples include cases involving the November Fund and Arjinderpal Sekhon, where sharp statements of reasons were exchanged. Deadlocks resulted in rejected conciliation agreements and refunded civil-penalty checks. This public and acrimonious nature of deadlocked votes drew comments from Members of Congress, media, and interest groups. Senators Feingold and McCain introduced reforms in response to these issues. In August 2009, Senators Feingold and McCain introduced legislation (S. 1648) to restructure the Federal Election Commission due to deadlocks and other issues. Deadlocked votes are a regular topic of interest, but empirical analyses are rare. This report explores deadlocks in rulemakings, enforcement matters, and advisory opinions during the Commission's first year in office from July 2008 through June 2009. The report analyzes deadlocked votes on rulemakings, enforcement actions, and advisory opinions by the Federal Election Commission from July 2008 to June 2009. It focuses on the number and types of issues that resulted in deadlocks, based on the Commission's consideration of rulemakings, enforcement actions, and AOs during that period. The analysis does not cover detailed discussions of Commissioners' deliberations or the broader context in which deadlocks arise. The analysis is based on FEC data and publicly available documentation, focusing on deadlocks in Commission matters. Deadlocks occurred in a minority of cases, showing strong disagreement on policy issues like political committee status and enforcement matters. The report discusses substantive deadlocks at the FEC, which are votes that prevent the Commission from reaching a consensus on rulemaking or enforcement actions. These deadlocks often occur along partisan lines and can halt Commission action on certain matters. During the first year of the current Commission, no substantive deadlocks occurred on rulemaking issues. The FEC held votes on four rulemakings, reaching agreement on issues like reporting bundled campaign contributions and adjusting penalties for inflation. However, conflicts may still exist on other rulemaking matters, as consensus has not been reached on all issues. The lack of deadlocks does not necessarily indicate the absence of conflicts, with only one of the four rulemakings approved during the period being controversial. The data shows that no deadlocks occurred on rulemakings in the first year of the current Commission. Evaluating the frequency of substantive deadlocks depends on the data segment analyzed, with no deadlocks in cases handled through the Administrative Fine Program and alternative dispute resolution. These programs typically involve simple cases that can be resolved quickly. MURs are complex and may involve lengthy investigations, negotiations, civil penalties, or litigation, leading to deadlocks in about 13% of cases. Unlike ADR and AFP matters, MURs often involve disputed facts or legal issues. Substantive deadlocks occurred in about 6% of cases when data from MURs, AFP, and ADR cases are combined. Advisory opinions are also part of the process. Advisory opinions (AOs) allow requesters to seek guidance from the Commission on campaign finance law applications. Substantive deadlocks affected 17.2% of AOs considered, with party-line votes leading to deadlocks during the review period. The Federal Election Commission data shows that Democratic and Republican Commissioners often voted along party lines, leading to deadlocks on enforcement actions. Democratic votes typically supported additional enforcement actions, while Republican votes did not. This partisan voting pattern was evident in both MURs and AOs considered by the Commission. The Federal Election Commission often faces deadlocks on enforcement actions due to partisan voting patterns. Commissioners vote along party lines, with Democrats supporting more enforcement actions and Republicans opposing them. Deadlocks can occur on various issues, such as proceeding with investigations or accepting conciliation agreements. In some cases, deadlocks result from disagreements over competing drafts or amendments. The intricacies of individual motions and votes are complex and not fully explored in this report. The Federal Election Commission often faces deadlocks on enforcement actions due to partisan voting patterns. Deadlocks are not limited to a single policy issue and occur throughout the year on various campaign spending and political committee status issues. Multiple MURs and AOs show deadlocks involving different respondents and issues, including questions on campaign fund raising and spending. The Federal Election Commission faces deadlocks on enforcement actions due to partisan voting patterns, not limited to a single policy issue. Deadlocks occur on various campaign spending and political committee status issues, involving different respondents and questions on campaign fundraising and spending. The complexity of federal campaign finance law and regulation may contribute to occasional deadlocks, prompting Congress to consider whether deadlocks represent a public policy concern. The Federal Election Commission faces deadlocks on enforcement actions due to partisan voting patterns, not limited to a single policy issue. Congress anticipated deadlocks and created provisions to ensure formal action requires an affirmative vote from a mixed majority of Commission members. Deadlocks may be viewed positively if enforcement actions are perceived as unwarranted. Substantive deadlocks at the Federal Election Commission indicate disagreement on how campaign finance laws apply to specific situations, hindering enforcement and clarity on legal compliance. Major issues like political committee status and civil penalties remain unresolved, potentially increasing in frequency. Deadlocks at the Federal Election Commission have been increasing, with a recent study showing a rise in deadlocks on MURs. Congress may need to assess the Commission's ability to reach consensus and its impact on campaign finance regulation. In the Commission's first year, substantive deadlocks occurred in about 13% of MUR votes and less than 6% of all enforcement actions. This indicates that the Commission did not deadlock in the majority of cases. The Federal Election Commission has seen an increase in deadlocks, especially on MURs. Despite some deadlocks, the Commission has reached consensus on many cases. Congress may consider oversight on FEC deadlocks and potential reforms. The Federal Election Commission has seen an increase in deadlocks, especially on MURs. Congress may consider oversight on FEC deadlocks and potential reforms. Changes in Commission enforcement procedures or practices, including a pilot program for AO requesters, could help address deadlocks without inviting stalemates. Congress could restructure the Federal Election Commission to avoid deadlocks, such as replacing the six-member FEC with a three-member Federal Election Administration. This restructuring could reduce or eliminate deadlocks but would require broader reforms beyond addressing just deadlocked votes. Efforts to revamp the FEC may face challenges due to the controversial nature of campaign finance reform. However, past cycles of support for reform suggest that change could be possible with sufficient demand. Congress could pass legislation to clarify issues where deadlocks have occurred, such as the political committee issue. Legislation to clarify when 527s and 501(c) organizations must register as political committees could reduce deadlocked enforcement at the FEC. However, controversial issues like the political committee matter have hindered legislative progress in recent Congresses. Structural reform may be a more efficient way to address deadlocked votes, as data shows substantive deadlocks persist despite some consensus among Commissioners. Between July 2008 and June 2009, deadlocks occurred in about 13% of MURs and 17% of AOs at the FEC, always in partisan blocs. The tone of debate surrounding deadlocks received attention in Congress and the media. Various options are available to address the issue, from maintaining the status quo to restructuring the agency."
