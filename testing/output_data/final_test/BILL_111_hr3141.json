The Act \"Strengthening the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2009\" establishes a DSH redistribution pool from unexpended Medicaid DSH allotments to increase allotments for low DSH states and health network access grants. The Act \"Strengthening the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2009\" establishes a DSH redistribution pool from unexpended Medicaid DSH allotments to increase allotments for low DSH states and health network access grants. The pool allows for obligation and expenditure without fiscal year limitation, with additional unexpended DSH allotments added at the beginning of each fiscal year. In fiscal year 2011, the DSH redistribution pool will deduct the increase in federal financial participation and grants obligated under subsection (k) from the previous fiscal year. In fiscal year 2011, the DSH redistribution pool will deduct the increase in federal financial participation and grants obligated under subsection (k) from the previous fiscal year. Subsection (f)(5) of the section is amended to increase DSH allotments for low DSH states based on fiscal year 2005 data. Each succeeding fiscal year before fiscal year 2015 shall be subject to the amendment. In fiscal year 2015, the DSH allotment for the State will increase by 16 percent from the previous fiscal year. Additional states not covered in subparagraph (B) will be included if their total expenditures for disproportionate share hospital adjustments are between 0 and 3 percent of the State's total. In fiscal year 2015, the DSH allotment for the State will increase by 16 percent from the previous fiscal year. For subsequent fiscal years, the DSH allotment will be subject to an increase for inflation as provided in paragraph (3)(A). States with expenditures for disproportionate share hospital adjustments between 0 and 3 percent of the State's total will be included. The Secretary will limit increases to the amount available from the DSH redistribution pool if the additional expenditures resulting from a 16 percent increase in DSH allotments exceed the amount available for obligation from the pool. The Secretary will reduce the increase in DSH allotments for the fiscal year in a pro-rata manner to match the specified amount, without affecting future DSH allotments for the State. Additionally, a new subsection is added for Demonstration Grants to Health Access Networks. Demonstration Grants to Health Access Networks are awarded by the Secretary to improve access, quality, and continuity of care for uninsured individuals through better coordination of care by the network. A health access network is defined as an entity representing a collection of safety net providers. Health access networks are entities representing safety net providers that aim to restructure and improve care for the uninsured and underinsured by offering access to all levels of care within a community or across a service region. This includes primary, outpatient, specialty, ancillary services, and acute inpatient care. The term also includes networks and plans that meet certain criteria. The term \"health access networks\" includes networks and plans that meet specific requirements for funding under the Public Health Service Act. It also encompasses integrated health care systems, including pediatric systems, which are organized to provide coordinated care and ensure access to a full range of services. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, a health access network must submit an application and plan with measurable performance targets for specific goals. A health access network applying for a grant must submit a plan with measurable performance targets for specific goals, including managing costs for uninsured and underinsured individuals. Payment of grant funds for patient care services may be contingent on achieving these targets. The health access network aims to improve access, availability, quality, coordination of healthcare services, health status, and reduce health disparities for uninsured and underinsured individuals served by the network. The health access network aims to improve access, availability, quality, coordination of healthcare services, and reduce health disparities for uninsured and underinsured individuals served by the network. Grants awarded under this subsection may be limited to ensure each grantee can provide patient care services to the specified number of uninsured individuals in their grant application. The health access network must spend at least 90 percent of funds on direct patient care services, including specialty medical care and diagnostic services not readily available through network providers. Preference is given to safety net providers when purchasing services for uninsured and underinsured individuals. To receive a grant, health access networks must prioritize purchasing services from safety net providers. The funds should supplement, not replace, other federal or state payments supporting healthcare for low-income or uninsured patients. Funding for this subsection is available annually from the DSH redistribution pool. Payments to health access networks under a grant shall not be considered as disproportionate share hospital payment adjustments. The text chunk discusses hospital payment adjustments under a grant, stating that no state matching funds are required to receive funds. The grant amount remains available for expenditure for up to three fiscal years. Additionally, the date of application of DSH hospital requirement to funding for low DSH states is amended. The text chunk amends reporting requirements for disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allocations under the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop a unified reporting document for DSH allocations and expenditures, with states required to report all expenditures using this document starting in fiscal year 2010. The amendments made by this section have an effective date specified. The amendments made by this section will be effective starting from fiscal year 2010."
