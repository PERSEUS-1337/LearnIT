    "content": "The \"Elder Abuse Prevention Act\" is the short title of this legislation. The findings section highlights the reasons for the Act. The Elder Abuse Prevention Act acknowledges the increasing number of older individuals in the US facing abuse, neglect, and exploitation. As the population aged 65 and older grows, there is a heightened risk of abuse and exploitation, necessitating comprehensive measures for prevention and reporting. The Elder Abuse Prevention Act emphasizes the need to prevent, report, and prosecute abuse against older individuals, especially violent and sexual assaults. It calls for vigorous prosecution by Federal and State authorities, with appropriate penalties including enhanced penalties and the elimination of parole for offenders of violent sexual offenses against the elderly. The Elder Abuse Prevention Act calls for vigorous prosecution of violent sexual offenses against older individuals, with penalties including the elimination of parole for offenders. The Elder Abuse Prevention Act mandates that states must have laws prohibiting parole for individuals convicted of sexual offenses against older individuals and deemed sexually violent predators within three years of the Act's enactment. The Elder Abuse Prevention Act requires states to enact laws within a certain timeframe to comply with specific provisions. Failure to comply may result in the loss of funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. The Justice Assistance Grant Program reallocates funds to states that comply with the Elder Abuse Prevention Act. Definitions for \"older individual\" and \"sexually violent predator\" are provided in the program. A sexually violent predator is someone with a personality disorder that predisposes them to commit predatory sexual offenses, as determined by a court. AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission is required to promptly review sentencing guidelines for sexual offenses against the elderly, consider new guidelines or amendments for enhancement, and submit policy recommendations to Congress. In this process, the Commission must consider various factors. The Sentencing Commission must review sentencing guidelines for sexual offenses against the elderly, ensuring seriousness, consistency, accounting for circumstances, making necessary changes, and meeting sentencing purposes. The United States Sentencing Commission must promptly establish sentencing guidelines or amendments within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, following specified procedures."
