Phishing and pharming are internet-based practices that may contribute to identity theft. This report provides an overview of internet privacy issues and related laws, as well as legislative activity in the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress addressed Internet privacy issues, with a focus on industry self-regulation versus legislation for consumer protection. Concerns included the collection and sharing of personally identifiable information by website operators. Legislation like COPPA was passed to protect children's privacy online. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was enacted to protect the privacy of children under 13 on commercial websites. Legislation has focused on federal government websites, with concerns about information disclosure by children and their parents. The FTC's final rule implementing COPPA became effective in April 2000. Commercial websites and online services targeting children under 13 must inform parents and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information. A \"sliding scale\" was adopted by the Commission for obtaining consent, with different standards based on how the data would be used. The sliding scale was initially set to expire in 2002 but was extended due to the unavailability of better verification technologies. The COPPA rule requires websites targeting children under 13 to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information. The sliding scale for consent was extended multiple times due to technology limitations. The FTC approved self-regulatory guidelines for compliance, and civil penalties were imposed for violations. Public comments were sought on the rule's costs and benefits in 2005. The FTC conducted surveys between 1997 and 2000 to assess website operators' compliance with fair information practices. These practices include providing notice, allowing choice in data usage, access to collected data, and data security. Enforcement is also considered a fair practice. The term \"opt-in\" refers to requiring consumer consent. The FTC conducted surveys from 1997 to 2000 to assess website operators' compliance with fair information practices, including notice, choice in data usage, access to data, and data security. \"Opt-in\" requires consumer consent, while \"opt-out\" assumes permission unless indicated otherwise. The FTC's reports are available on their website, and in 1999, they found that more legislation was not needed due to industry progress in self-regulation. The FTC conducted surveys from 1997 to 2000 to assess website operators' compliance with fair information practices. In 1999, they found industry progress in self-regulation, but in May 2000, the FTC recommended legislation due to low implementation rates. The Online Privacy Alliance was formed in 1998 to promote industry self-regulation. The Better Business Bureau, TRUSTe, and WebTrust have established \"seals\" for websites to display if they agree to abide by certain privacy principles, a complaint resolution process, and monitoring for compliance. P3P technology creates machine-readable privacy policies for users to match their preferences with websites. Concerns exist about the legality of shortened privacy policies required by P3P. Consumer and privacy groups argue that self-regulation through seal programs like those offered by the Better Business Bureau, TRUSTe, and WebTrust may not be legally binding or effective in protecting privacy. Reports from the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Privacy Information Center highlight concerns that government regulation, such as the National Do Not Call list, may be more successful in safeguarding privacy than industry self-regulation. The report concludes that government regulation may be more effective than industry self-regulation in addressing Internet privacy issues. Privacy advocates are concerned about online profiling and argue that current solutions like P3P are insufficient. EPIC's report further explains these findings. The FTC issued a report in 2000 on online profiling and the self-regulatory principles of the Network Advertising Initiative. Congress was urged to enact legislation for consumer privacy due to concerns about non-compliance. Various Internet privacy bills were considered by Congress, but only one extending a prohibition on federal websites passed. Federal agencies must adhere to the Privacy Act, but concerns about online profiling persist. In June 2000, contractors for the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) were found using \"cookies\" to collect information from users during an anti-drug campaign. OMB directed ONDCP to stop using cookies and reminded agencies to comply with privacy policies. OMB specified conditions under which agencies can collect personal information using cookies. Persistent cookies are not allowed unless specific conditions are met, while session cookies are permitted. In FY2001, Congress prohibited federal websites from collecting personal information using cookies. Despite this, in December 2005, it was reported that the NSA was using permanent cookies on its website. The NSA and other government agencies were found to be using permanent cookies on their websites, unaware of the practice. Some agencies changed their practices after being contacted, while others had no idea their software was setting cookies. This violated the FY2001 Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act, which required Inspectors General to report on activities related to the collection of personal information. The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) sets requirements for government agencies to ensure privacy of personal information on websites. Reports in 2001 found unauthorized cookies and privacy violations on agency websites. Federal websites must include a privacy notice detailing information collection, intended use, consent options, security measures, and individual rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The E-Government Act mandates government agencies to protect personal information on websites, including translating privacy policies into a machine-readable format. Concerns arise regarding monitoring of email and website visits by law enforcement post-9/11 attacks, particularly with tools like Carnivore (later DCS 1000) used by the FBI. Privacy advocates raised concerns about the ability of systems like Carnivore to differentiate between the email and internet usage of a subject under investigation and others. The Justice Department no longer uses Carnivore/DCS 1000, opting for commercially available software instead. Reports obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed this change in approach. The Justice Department used commercial software for court-ordered electronic surveillance in FY2002 and FY2003 under the USA PATRIOT Act, which expanded law enforcement's monitoring abilities post-9/11. The Act modified definitions to include Internet monitoring devices like Carnivore. Privacy provisions in Title II included expanding subpoenas for electronic communication records. Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows ISPs to disclose subscriber records in cases of immediate danger, while Section 216 expands the information government agencies can capture using pen registers. Section 216 of the USA PATRIOT Act expands the information government agencies can capture using pen registers and trap and trace devices authorized by a court order, excluding the content of wire or electronic communications. It also increases judicial oversight of systems like Carnivore. Section 217 allows interception of communications from a protected computer by a person acting under color of law. Section 224 sets a four-year sunset period for many Title II provisions. Section 224 of the USA PATRIOT Act sets a four-year sunset period for many Title II provisions, with sections 212 and 217 expiring on December 31, 2005. The Cyber Security Enhancement Act amends section 212, allowing ISPs to disclose communications with a lower threshold for emergencies. Privacy advocates are concerned about the Act's language. EPIC expresses concerns about the language added by the Cyber Security Enhancement Act, noting increased risks to personal privacy and lack of judicial oversight. Congressional hearings have been held on various provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, with debates on extending the sunset date for certain sections. The sunset clause of certain provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act became a contentious issue as the deadline approached in December 2005. The House passed a permanent extension in H.R. 3199, while the Senate only approved a six-month extension in S. 2167. There were debates on the need for more civil liberties protections. Ultimately, the House amended the extension to only last for five weeks to ensure prompt resolution in Congress. The debate over warrantless searches was influenced by revelations in December 2005 that President George W. Bush directed the NSA to monitor phone calls and emails in the US without warrants. The 9/11 Commission Report recommended a full and informed debate on the Patriot Act due to concerns about the shifting balance of power to the government. The Commission recommended that governmental powers should enhance security while ensuring civil liberties are protected. They called for oversight and guidelines to restrict the use of these powers. A board within the executive branch was proposed to oversee adherence to guidelines and defend civil liberties. The Commission emphasized the need to balance security and liberty, stating that the success of one helps protect the other. They argued that curtailing liberties in the name of security would undermine American values. The 108th Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which includes the creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure that privacy and civil liberties are considered in anti-terrorism efforts. The Board will report annually to Congress and consist of five members, two of whom must be confirmed by the Senate and all must come from outside the government for independence. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board was created by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to ensure privacy and civil liberties are considered in anti-terrorism efforts. The Board consists of five members, with two confirmed by the Senate, and must come from outside the government for independence. However, the Board has faced criticism for being underfunded and lacking support from the President. Legislation was introduced to make the Board an independent agency in the executive branch and require Senate confirmation for all members. In January 2006, Google resisted a Justice Department subpoena for search data to uphold the Child Online Protection Act. Other search engines complied with the request, raising concerns about user privacy. Some observers believe Google's response to privacy concerns may be driven more by business interests than by actual privacy issues. Public concern is growing over government tracking of online activities and employer monitoring of emails and computer usage. A survey found that a majority of companies monitor web usage and review email messages, raising questions about whether employees should be notified of such monitoring. A survey revealed that a majority of companies monitor web usage and review email messages, with some firing employees for misuse. Companies inform workers about monitoring content, keystrokes, and time spent at the keyboard, as well as storing and reviewing computer files, monitoring email, and tracking web usage. A landmark ruling in Massachusetts upheld the legality of an email service provider intercepting and reading subscribers' emails for a competitive advantage. The ruling upheld the decision of a lower court to dismiss the case involving Interloc, Inc., an e-mail service provider that intercepted and copied e-mail messages from competitor Amazon.com to gain a competitive advantage. Interloc's Vice President was charged with violating the Wiretap Act. The court's majority opinion stated that the intercepted e-mails existed in Interloc's computer system's memory or hard drives during operations. The case involving Interloc, Inc. focused on whether intercepted e-mails were in transit or in storage in their computer system. Judges concluded that the e-mails were in temporary storage and not subject to the Wiretap Act. They noted that electronic communications have lesser protection than wire and oral communication according to Congress. Privacy advocates expressed deep concern about the ruling, with EFF attorney Kevin Bankston stating that the court's interpretation could render the Wiretap Act irrelevant. Judge Lipez's dissent argued that Congress did not intend for temporarily stored e-mails to have less privacy than messages in transit, and that the ruling could undo decades of practice and precedent. The court ruling allowed Internet communication providers to invade user privacy freely. The U.S. Department of Justice appealed the decision, which was later overturned by the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Two bills in Congress aimed to amend the Wiretap Act or Stored Communications Act but saw no action. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the Wiretap Act regarding electronic communication. Spyware, which is not well defined, collects information about computer use and may include personally identifiable information. The debate surrounding spyware includes whether adware should be considered spyware, as it tracks user's web activity and displays pop-up ads. There is a lack of consensus on whether new laws are necessary or if industry self-regulation is enough, with concerns about the definition of spyware hindering legislative efforts. The debate over spyware includes concerns about legislative action, with some arguing that existing laws are sufficient while others believe new laws are needed. Utah and California have passed spyware laws, but there is no specific federal law. In the 108th and 109th Congress, multiple bills were introduced regarding spyware, but no further action was taken. The Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on S. 687 (Burns-Wyden) and S. 1004 (Allen) in 2005. S. 687 was ordered reported on November 17, 2005, while S. 1004 was defeated. The FTC endorsed S. 1608 at a hearing dealing with spyware and Internet-related fraud. The focus of S. 1608 is to enhance the FTC's ability to investigate and prosecute perpetrators located abroad or using foreign intermediaries. Identity theft, although not directly related to Internet privacy, is often discussed in that context due to the perception that the Internet facilitates identity theft. The widespread use of computers for storing and transmitting information has contributed to the rising rate of identity theft. This involves one individual assuming the identity of another using personal information like credit card and Social Security numbers. The Internet is often debated as a factor in the increase of identity theft cases, with some attributing it to carelessness by businesses and credit issuers. Traditional methods like lost or stolen wallets are also used by identity thieves. Three high-profile incidents in early 2005 compromised consumer PII security. In early 2005, high-profile incidents involving ChoicePoint, Bank of America, and LexisNexis compromised consumer PII security, reinforcing fears about identity theft. Surveys found that personal information was obtained through various means, including lost or stolen wallets, transactions, stolen mail, and misuse by someone with access to the information. Another survey in January 2005 by the Council of Better Business Bureaus and Javelin Strategy & Research highlighted the prevalence of identity fraud. The 2005 Identity Fraud Survey, based on data collected in 2004, found that computer crime accounted for 11.6% of identity theft cases, with an average loss of $551 for online theft. Perpetrators were identified as family members (32%), strangers (24%), friends/neighbors (18%), and others. The study concluded that identity theft was not worsening, with a decrease in victims from 10.1 million in 2003 to 9.3 million in 2004. The 2005 Identity Fraud Survey reported a decline in the number of identity theft victims from 10.1 million in 2003 to 9.3 million in 2004. The annual dollar volume remained consistent at $52.6 billion. Identity theft complaints to the FTC in 2005 accounted for 37% of total complaints, with credit card fraud being the most common form. \"Phishing\" is a method used to obtain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Phishing is an Internet-based practice where someone misrepresents their identity to obtain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Common scams involve fake emails from financial institutions or ISPs directing individuals to enter PII on a fraudulent website. The FTC issued a consumer alert on phishing in 2004, and an industry association called the \"Anti-Phishing Working Group\" was established to combat this type of fraud. Another form of phishing, known as \"pharming,\" involves fraudulent use of domain. Pharming is a version of phishing where hackers hijack a legitimate website's domain name to redirect traffic to their own site, tricking users into providing personal information. The FTC enforces federal laws to protect consumer information and data security. The FTC enforces laws like the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as well as specific laws on identity theft such as the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. These laws aim to protect consumer information and provide assistance to victims of identity theft. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act) requires consumer reporting agencies to place fraud alerts on credit files, allows consumers to request one free copy of their consumer report each year from nationwide CRAs and specialty CRAs, and mandates credit card issuers to follow specific procedures for address changes and additional card requests. The FACT Act mandates procedures for address changes and additional card requests, requires credit card numbers to be truncated on receipts, provides guidelines for handling identity theft cases, and extends the statute of limitations for such cases. The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act establishes mandatory sentences for aggravated identity theft in conjunction with felonies, with additional years added for those involved in terrorist acts. FTC Chairwoman Majoras highlighted the complexity of laws governing consumer data at a Senate hearing, suggesting the need for additional legislation, particularly regarding notice and security. The Secret Service testified about jurisdiction over identity theft crimes, while Congress considers ways to reduce identity theft. Legislative approaches include strengthening penalties, regulating data brokers, limiting SSN use, and making phishing unlawful. Despite attention and bills introduced, no legislation passed during the first session of the 109th Congress. Four bills were acted upon in committee or subcommittee. Legislative action on bills related to credit protections stalled due to differing views among stakeholders. Consumer groups push for protections opposed by financial institutions. Small banks argue with larger ones over reissuing costs for credit/debit cards. Debate continues on notification triggers for breaches requiring customer alerts. Markup of H.R. 4127 split on party lines, while S. 1326 was reported without amendment. S. 1789 markup involved considerable debate. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee reported S. 1408 (Smith) on December 8, 2005, involving considerable debate. The table provides a summary of Internet privacy-related legislation introduced in the first session of the 109th Congress, with varying details and definitions.
