    "title": "AB 2215",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 8880.5 of the Government Code is amended to create the California State Lottery Education Fund within the State Treasury. The fund is continuously appropriated for education purposes, with payments distributed quarterly to public school districts based on average daily attendance. In each fiscal year from 2008-09 to 2014-15, average daily attendance for public school programs serving kindergarten to grade 12 includes adult classes and regional occupational programs. Payments are also made to public school districts serving community colleges based on average daily attendance. Payments are made directly to the California State University, University of California, and Hastings College of the Law based on full-time enrollment units. Funds are deposited in respective trust accounts for expenditure. Payments are made directly to various educational programs and institutions based on average daily attendance or full-time enrollment units. This includes programs serving kindergarten through grade 12, California Schools for the Deaf and Blind, Diagnostic Schools for Neurologically Handicapped Children, and state hospital education programs for clients with developmental or mental disabilities. (i) Payments for public education under this chapter cannot be used for certain specified purposes authorized by other statutes.\n(j) School districts and agencies can choose to use funds from this chapter for enrichment or expansion of prescribed programs.\n(k) School districts must establish a separate lottery education account to receive and spend funds allocated under this chapter. The 1998\u201399 fiscal year onwards, average daily attendance will increase by the statewide average rate of excused absences from 1996\u201397. Funds from the California State Lottery Education Fund must be used solely for pupil education, not for noninstructional purposes. The act aims to streamline administrative procedures for the California State Lottery Education Fund, without expanding the allowable uses of funds allocated to the Board of Trustees of the California State University."
