    "content": "The severity of the September 11, 2012, attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, has led to a reexamination of measures to protect U.S. diplomatic personnel and facilities abroad. Concerns exist about the growing danger to U.S. diplomatic facilities from extremists in the Middle East. Congressional and State Department actions are crucial in responding to this evolving threat and preventing similar tragedies in the future. The 1983-1984 bombings in Beirut and the 1998 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania prompted the establishment of security measures like the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 and the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999. After the Benghazi attack, Congress conducted investigations and hearings on diplomatic security, proposing legislative changes for Accountability Review Boards and contract procedures. The Department of State implemented measures in response to the Benghazi attack, including bolstering security at posts worldwide and conducting an investigation through an Accountability Review Board. Congressional and State Department efforts are ongoing to enhance security for U.S. embassies and personnel globally. The State Department took actions to enhance security at posts worldwide following the Benghazi attack. This included deploying Interagency Security Assessment Teams to high-threat posts and reorganizing the Diplomatic Security Bureau. The number of High Threat Posts is subject to annual review. The Benghazi Accountability Review Board found systemic failures in Washington led to security shortfalls at the Special Mission in Benghazi. Leadership failures in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security were highlighted in the unclassified report published on December 18, 2012. Key leadership failures in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs contributed to confusion over decision-making in Benghazi, leading to insufficient priority given to security requests. The Benghazi Accountability Review Board found no clear breach of duty by any single U.S. government employee. The board also noted that senior leadership decisions regarding the unclear status of Special Mission Benghazi resulted in it being outside normal procedures for security measures. The Department of State accepted the panel's recommendations upon the release of the ARB's report. The Department of State accepted the ARB's recommendations and formed a task force to implement 29 recommendations translated into 64 action items. Four employees, including three from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and one from the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, were removed from their positions after a review of leadership failures. They were reinstated on August 20 and reassigned to other positions within the department. Members of Congress sought clarification on their administrative status before their reinstatement. The Department of State accepted the ARB's recommendations and formed a task force to implement 29 recommendations. Some officials believed more senior department officials should have been held accountable. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reported that over 80% of recommendations were on track to be completed by March 2013. Secretary of State John Kerry committed to implementing all recommendations. Progress in implementing the recommendations was detailed in a fact sheet released in May 2013. The Department of State has addressed all 24 unclassified recommendations and hired new diplomatic security personnel. Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Greg Starr testified that 25 of the 29 ARB recommendations had been closed. State has improved its ability to assess risk in high-threat areas with a Vital Presence Validation Process. The State Department has implemented a new risk management process for overseas presence, which was used in the decision to return to Bangui, Central African Republic. The department worked with the Department of Defense to assess security and develop a plan for the return. This demonstrates that enhanced risk management procedures are effective. The Best Practices Panel, chaired by former Director of U.S. Secret Service Mark Sullivan, recommended the elevation of the diplomatic security function through the creation of an Under Secretary for Diplomatic Security to address security issues more effectively. The State Department accepted 38 recommendations from a panel on security issues, implementing 30 fully. They rejected the idea of creating an Under Secretary for Diplomatic Security to avoid further \"stove-piping\" and instead established direct access for the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security to the Secretary of State for sharing security concerns. Waivers to security standards were not accepted. The State Department did not accept the panel's proposal for waivers to security standards to be provided only after implementing mitigating measures. An outside panel led by Grant Green reviewed DS's organization and management structure, with 30 out of 35 recommendations accepted by the State Department. Organizational changes were made in response to the report. The State Department made organizational changes in response to the report, including raising three DS Assistant Director positions to Deputy Assistant Secretary positions. However, proposals for a Chief of Staff position in the DS Bureau and restructuring responsibilities for the new High Threat Programs Directorate were declined. Funding requests for security were impacted for FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015, with a revised budget request submitted in December 2012 totaling approximately $1.419 billion. The Administration's FY2014 budget request included reallocating funds for increased security measures at diplomatic facilities, such as adding Marine Security Guards and Diplomatic Security personnel to medium- and high-threat posts, as well as funding facility security upgrades and new embassy compounds. This request aimed to sustain initiatives from the FY2013 Increased Security Proposal, with a significant increase in Worldwide Security Upgrades funding compared to FY2012. The FY2015 budget requested increased funding for embassy security, including Worldwide Security Protection and Worldwide Security Upgrades. President Obama urged Congress to fully fund embassy security and support ARB recommendations. The request included funds for security personnel, technical tools, training, and upgrades to diplomatic facilities. The FY2015 budget included $44 million for hiring additional Diplomatic Security personnel recommended by the ARB after the Benghazi attacks. The ARB also suggested restoring the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program to its full capacity of $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2015, prioritizing construction in high-risk areas. The FY2015 request for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) funding was $986.5 million, down from $1.4 billion in FY2014 due to higher contributions from other agencies. The request meets the $2.2 billion level recommended by the post-Benghazi ARB. Congressional activity on protecting U.S. personnel and facilities abroad has included legislative actions, hearings, and investigations. The Benghazi attack has been investigated by multiple congressional committees, resulting in seven publicly released reports. The Senate report from the 112th Congress highlighted the Department of State's failure to address security concerns in Benghazi and the Libyan government's inability to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities. Recommendations included increasing protective measures or withdrawing U.S. presence, even without specific intelligence of an imminent attack. The Senate report's recommendations after the Benghazi attack included enhanced security assessments for high-risk U.S. diplomatic facilities, adequate funding for security, increased Department of Defense presence in Africa, and clear communication about terrorist attacks. Another report in April 2013 found that State Department leadership approved security reductions before the attack. The Senate report on the Benghazi attack criticized the Administration for inaccurately presenting the attack to protect State Department interests. House Oversight Committee's report questioned the State Department's actions post the attack. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued its Review on the matter on January 15, 2014. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report on the Benghazi attacks, stating they were likely preventable due to security shortfalls. The report included 14 findings and 18 recommendations on security standards, intelligence capabilities, and bringing the attackers to justice. Another report by the House Foreign Affairs Committee questioned State Department accountability. The report on Benghazi highlighted key findings, including extensive threat reporting before the attack, denial of security requests, deficiencies in the Accountability Review Board, and a focus on protecting reputation over accountability. The report on Benghazi found that the absence of a permanent State Department Inspector General contributed to a lack of accountability. The House Armed Services Subcommittee released a report on Defense Department actions related to the attack, noting military posture assessments did not consider Libyan security, vulnerabilities in Benghazi, and a reduction in DOD personnel favored by the State Department. The House Armed Services Subcommittee report on Benghazi found that the U.S. military's response to the attack was severely degraded due to the location of Benghazi, lack of clarity about events, and a reduction in DOD personnel favored by the State Department. Military commanders did not adequately prepare for an extended operation, and roles and responsibilities of forces were not well understood. DOD was taking measures to address issues exposed by the attack. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a report on the Benghazi attack, stating that the CIA provided security and assistance during the attacks. There was no evidence of denial of military support, and no intelligence failure prior to the attacks. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report found no specific warning about the September 11 attacks. The early intelligence assessments and public narrative on the attack were inaccurate. No evidence of unauthorized CIA activities or intimidation in Benghazi was found. Multiple hearings on the Benghazi attack have been held by various committees. The House established the Select Committee on Benghazi with subpoena powers. Chaired by Representative Trey Gowdy, it held its first hearing in September 2014. Two bills related to embassy security were approved in the 113th Congress. The House established the Select Committee on Benghazi with subpoena powers, chaired by Representative Trey Gowdy. Two bills related to embassy security were approved in the 113th Congress, including H.R. 2848 and S. 1386, which differ significantly in their provisions. H.R. 2848 authorized $2.65 billion for FY2014 for the Department of State's Embassy Security, Construction. S. 1386 authorized $1.383 billion for the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program in FY2014, with allocations for threat mitigation, language training, improved training facilities, and the construction of a new Foreign Affairs Security Training Center. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 provided additional funds for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, as well as Worldwide Security Protection. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 met the Administration's request for Worldwide Security Protection funds, increasing the account by 12.7% over FY2014 levels. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 increased funds for Worldwide Security Protection by 12.7% over FY2014 levels. Some observers question the independence and effectiveness of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board process. Measures have been introduced in the House to reform the accountability review board process. H.R. 1768 and S. 1386 proposed reforms to increase the independence of Accountability Review Boards from the State Department by changing the composition of board members and specifying conflict of interest guidelines. Chairman Royce intended to conduct a more comprehensive review of the ARB process in the fall of 2013. The Benghazi Accountability Review Board found leadership failures but did not recommend disciplinary action. Recommendations included clarifying future boards' authority to recommend disciplinary action for unsatisfactory leadership. Both H.R. 2848 and S. 1386 addressed the recommendation to broaden the standard for disciplinary action in cases of unsatisfactory leadership by senior officials. H.R. 2848 included a measure from the SAFE Embassies Act to require Accountability Review Boards to recommend disciplinary action for misconduct contributing to serious incidents abroad. S. 1386 allowed ARBs to recommend disciplinary action for unsatisfactory leadership in security incidents. The Department of State has requested authority to use best-value contracting for local guard contracts, rather than \"lowest price technically acceptable\" criteria, in response to unsatisfactory leadership in security incidents. Legislative measures have been introduced in both the House and Senate to address this issue. The Department of State requested authority to use best-value contracting for local guard contracts in high-risk areas. Legislative measures in S. 1386 and H.R. 3547 authorized this method, requiring reporting to relevant committees. H.R. 2848 would have further required the Secretary of State to submit a list of high-risk posts in classified form. The Secretary of State would be required to evaluate high-threat posts within 30 days of the enactment of this section, in classified form. The Secretary must convene a working group to assess the rationale for the post, ensure proper funding and security measures, and establish \"tripwires\" for changes in status. Congress must be notified at least 30 days before opening or reopening such a post. The State Department Inspector General's Office would review security requests for high-threat posts and assess staffing, training, and contingency planning. H.R. 2848 mandates security training for personnel at high-risk posts and training for senior officials on threat evaluation and resource allocation. Diplomatic security personnel at high-risk posts would receive additional training. The text discusses the need for diplomatic security personnel at high-risk, high-threat posts to receive adequate language training to manage security discussions with locals. S. 1386 proposed funding for improved training facilities and a Foreign Affairs Security Training Center. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for language training for personnel at these posts. The Marine Security Guard Program involves collaboration between the Departments of Defense and State. In response to the Benghazi attack, efforts were made to expand the Marine Security Guard program at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic facilities by up to 1,000 Marines. The program's focus on protecting classified information was reassessed, and the budget request was separated from the Marine Corps. The Department of State also planned to increase its participation in the program. S. 1386 required the Secretary of State to develop a plan for incorporating additional Marine Security Guard teams as mandated by the FY2013 NDAA. The FY2013 NDAA mandated the expansion of the Marine Security Guard program at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic facilities by up to 1,000 Marines. The Secretary of State was required to develop a plan for incorporating additional Marine Security Guard teams, conduct annual reviews of the program's size and composition, and assess the distribution of marine teams to posts. H.R. 2848 also called for similar annual reviews and additional provisions such as developing contingency plans for attacks at high-risk posts and making physical security enhancements at schools for government-employed U.S. citizens' children. Following the FY2013 NDAA mandate to expand the Marine Security Guard program, S. 1386 proposed key qualifications for the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for High Threat, High Risk Posts, regular briefings on State's Security Environment Threat List, reporting on risks at posts in high counterintelligence threat nations, and a report on implementing the Benghazi ARB's recommendations. The independent Benghazi Accountability Review Board issued 29 recommendations to the Department of State in Libya. The Department accepted all recommendations and began implementation work to strengthen security for personnel and platforms. This includes fundamentally reforming the organization and receiving sustained support from Congress. The goal is to minimize risks for those working overseas to advance American interests and values. The Department of State has implemented the Vital Presence Validation Process (VP2) to make risk-managed decisions regarding U.S. presence in high-threat locations. A Security Accountability Framework has been created to define key actors and governance mechanisms. Additionally, a Deputy Assistant Secretary for High Threat Programs has been appointed. The Department of State has established a Deputy Assistant Secretary for High Threat Programs in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to ensure high-threat posts receive focused attention. A panel reviewed Diplomatic Security's organization and management structure, making 35 recommendations for improvement. The Department accepted 30 recommendations, including prioritizing overseas positions and reviewing personnel allocation. Establishing a Diplomatic Security strategic planning unit and providing augmented support within regional bureaus on security matters. Improved communication between security professionals and policy experts, with shared responsibility for security issues. Proposal to establish a panel of outside independent experts with relevant experience. The Department established a panel of outside independent experts to identify best practices in high-risk, high-threat areas and evaluate U.S. security platforms. The panel made 40 recommendations, with 38 currently being implemented, including the development of minimum security standards for temporary facilities in such environments. The Department has re-affirmed that Overseas Security Policy Board Standards apply to all facilities and identified flexible funding authorities for security upgrades in high-risk environments. Before opening critical threat posts, a multi-bureau support cell should be established, with standard operating procedures now incorporated into the Foreign Affairs Handbook. The Foreign Affairs Handbook at 2 FAM 420 covers actions for regular and high-threat posts, requiring collocation of State Department and government facilities in the same area unless waived. A review of overseas facilities is ongoing, with plans to relocate personnel as needed. The Secretary should request an action plan for dealing with fire as a weapon against diplomatic facilities. The Department has issued formal guidance on weapons of opportunity and expanded training on survival in smoke and fire situations. DS agents receive medical training on smoke inhalation effects and treatment, and participate in escape exercises from smoke-filled buildings. Collaboration with outside entities helps identify emerging threats and enhance training. The Department should revise guidance on post tripwires and require status checks. The State Department established a \"Tripwires Committee\" in Washington to review security benchmarks and respond quickly to breaches. They developed an application called ALERT to track breached tripwires overseas. The Department also uses ALERT to review high-threat posts annually. Additionally, the State Department must work with Congress to restore the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program for embassy construction. The President's Budget requests $2.2 billion for the CSCS program, including reimbursements and OCO funding. The Board supports expanding the Marine Security Guard Program and deploying additional detachments. Marines from combat arms and military police specialties are trained for MSG duties. The Department of State has established nine squads with extra training in close-quarters battle, trauma, and weapons and tactics. These squads have been dispatched to high-risk, high-threat posts to augment security. The Department has hired 75 new Diplomatic Security agents in 2013 and plans to hire an additional 29 employees in 2014 to support these efforts. The Department of State has established specialized squads for high-risk posts and increased Diplomatic Security agent hires. High-threat posts now require a minimum one-year tour of duty for key personnel, with a focus on staffing levels and support for Locally Employed Staff. The Department of State is enhancing its language capacity, especially in Arabic, for American employees, including Diplomatic Security agents. This effort aims to better equip security experts to engage with local populations and host nation security forces. The Department of State is enhancing language capacity, especially in Arabic, for American employees, including Diplomatic Security agents. They have completed ALERT training in Arabic and Urdu since October 2013, with plans to offer more languages in 2014. A panel of Senior Special Agents and Supervisory Special Agents reviewed high-threat training, resulting in revised standards and training plans. The Department of State has developed a new High Threat Training Strategy for DS special agents operating in high-risk environments. This strategy includes a career-long cycle of instruction and new training courses for agents at different career levels. Additionally, there is collaboration between the Diplomatic Security Training Center and Foreign Service Institute to design joint courses for senior and mid-level agents and Foreign Service Officers to better prepare them for leadership positions in high-threat posts. Personnel heading to high-threat posts are now required to receive specialized security and fire survival training. The Department of State has collaborated with the Diplomatic Security Training Center and Foreign Service Institute to provide specialized security and fire survival training for personnel heading to high-threat posts. The Department has ensured that all high-threat posts have adequate fire safety equipment and additional personal protective equipment, funded by Congress in FY 2013. The State Department has upgraded surveillance cameras at high-risk posts and improved non-lethal deterrent options. Attention is given to deteriorating threat situations for enhancing security posture. The Department has addressed the recommendation to quickly identify and use threat information for risk calculations. The DS Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis now reports directly to the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security for threat reporting, supplying analysis to regional Assistant Secretaries and Chiefs of Mission. The Board suggests using findings of unsatisfactory leadership performance for potential discipline recommendations by future ARBs. The Department is working with Congress to increase accountability by proposing legislation for future ARBs to recommend disciplinary action for unsatisfactory leadership. The Board commends the courage and integrity of personnel in Benghazi and Tripoli and urges recognition of their valor. The President and Secretary of State have acknowledged their bravery. The Department honored personnel for their bravery in Benghazi, including Ambassador Chris Stevens and those who defended the facilities. Congressional hearings and legislation related to diplomatic security were also highlighted."
