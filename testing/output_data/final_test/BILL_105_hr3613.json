The \"Military Health Care Fairness Act\" allows eligible beneficiaries to enroll in any health benefits plan under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, offering medical care comparable to authorized care. The Secretary of Defense and other administering Secretaries will enter into an agreement with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to implement this provision. The \"Military Health Care Fairness Act\" allows eligible beneficiaries, including military retirees and their dependents, to enroll in an FEHBP plan if they do not have guaranteed access to comparable health care benefits under TRICARE or are eligible but not enrolled in TRICARE for various reasons. Eligible beneficiaries, including military retirees 65 years of age or older and those retired under chapter 61, can enroll in an FEHBP plan without needing to meet chapter 89 eligibility criteria. Enrollment priority is based on the order of application. Eligible beneficiaries can apply to enroll in an FEHBP plan for a minimum period of three years. The Secretary maintains a list of applicants unable to enroll due to funding constraints. Enrollment is provided for 90 days before program implementation and annually thereafter. Discontinuing enrollment before the minimum period renders a beneficiary ineligible for reenrollment. Eligible beneficiaries enrolled in an FEHBP plan can receive care at a military medical treatment facility, with the plan reimbursing the facility for the cost of treatment. Adjustments may be made to copayments to ensure no additional costs to the plan. Contributions for enrollment are made as if the beneficiary were a federal employee, with the administering Secretary responsible for government contributions. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management determines Government contributions payable by the Secretary under section 8906 of title 5 for enrolled eligible beneficiaries. Each beneficiary in an FEHBP plan must contribute as a similarly situated Federal employee. The Director manages participation in the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, maintaining separate risk pools for eligible beneficiaries. The Director manages participation in the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, ensuring Government contributions for enrolled eligible beneficiaries. A joint report to Congress by the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management is required annually, detailing healthcare provision to beneficiaries under the program.

The Secretary of Defense must offer health benefits under section 1079b(a) of title 10 within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. The option will be available through 2003, with care provided until 2005. $100 million is authorized for fiscal year 1999 and $200 million for fiscal year 2000.
