    "content": "In the late 1950s and 1960s, public awareness and concern about the environmental impact of human activity grew. This led to debates in Congress about the need for a national environmental policy and an Executive-level council. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) was signed into law by President Nixon on January 1, 1970, declaring a national policy to protect the environment. NEPA requires federal agencies to provide environmental impact statements for every recommendation or report. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies to provide an environmental impact statement (EIS) for proposals significantly affecting the human environment. The act created the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to oversee NEPA's implementation and issue regulations for federal agencies. NEPA aims to ensure agencies consider environmental impacts before taking action and inform the public about their decisions. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental consequences before proceeding with actions. It does not prioritize environmental concerns over others but ensures they are evaluated. Agencies can proceed with actions if environmental effects are identified and weighed against benefits. NEPA is often used as a framework to coordinate compliance with other environmental laws, leading to potential confusion. The absence of enforcement authority under NEPA has led to litigation as a means for individuals and groups to challenge agency compliance with environmental review requirements. Critics may argue that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is inadequate or that environmental impacts are downplayed by agencies. Compliance with NEPA does not negate the need to adhere to other environmental laws like the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act. Critics of NEPA argue that it can be used for litigation to delay or stop federal projects, while environmental groups see it as crucial for responsible planning and public involvement. The law is criticized for creating regulatory delays, but supporters view it as essential for considering environmental impacts before decisions are made. The report provides information on NEPA's background, legislative history, provisions, court and CEQ roles, agency implementation, public involvement, coordination with other environmental requirements, and claims of delays in federal actions. Congress responded to environmental concerns in the 1950s and 1960s, considering a national environmental policy to guide federal agency actions. A national environmental policy was debated for years before the enactment of NEPA. The policy aimed to ensure federal agencies consider environmental impacts in their actions. There were discussions about creating an Executive-level board to advise the President on environmental matters. The act was modeled after the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959. In 1968, a joint House-Senate colloquium was convened to discuss the need for a national environmental policy. Governor Laurence Rockefeller expressed concerns over federal agency actions affecting the environment. The joint committee discussed the lack of a clearly stated national attitude toward the environment, highlighting the need for better guidelines for administrative agencies. Concepts from the colloquium would later influence the bills that became NEPA, with Senator Jackson advocating for new approaches to environmental management. The discussion also focused on implementing \"action-forcing\" processes to address environmental issues. The bills that would become NEPA were introduced in 1969 by Senator Jackson and Representative John Dingell, aiming to establish a framework for research and study to ensure a safe environment for future generations. Federal agencies were authorized to investigate environmental issues, and a Council on Environmental Quality was created to analyze data and advise the President. The Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs held a hearing in April 1969 to discuss proposed bills related to creating an action-forcing mechanism for implementing a national environmental policy. Dr. Lynton Caldwell provided testimony during the hearing, suggesting the need for a policy that includes measures to require Federal agencies to consider environmental impacts in their proposals. Senator Jackson expressed concerns about the inadequacy of the current policy declaration in the bill and emphasized the need for a more action-forcing procedure for Federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their proposals. He proposed broadening the policy provision to apply to all agencies with environmental responsibilities. Senator Jackson introduced amendments to the Senate bill, including a declaration of national environmental policy and a requirement for all federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of their actions. The Senate and House passed their versions of the bill in 1969, with the conference committee making additional additions in December. The conference committee made additions and compromises to the bill, changing the requirement for environmental impact assessments to a detailed statement known as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Other federal agencies were also required to review the EIS. The legislative history suggests a focus on action-forcing provisions and the consideration of impacts by federal agencies. The Senate report emphasized the need for federal agencies to consider environmental impacts in their actions. The legislation provided a mandate for all agencies and officials to assess the consequences of their actions on the environment. President Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) into law on January 1, 1970, with minimal debate. Congress made minor technical amendments to NEPA over the years, and a section was added to the Clean Air Act within a year of NEPA's passage. A year after NEPA's passage, a section was added to the Clean Air Act that clarified agencies' responsibilities regarding public involvement in the NEPA process. The Administrator of the EPA was mandated to review and comment on all EISs, making comments public and referring environmentally \"unsatisfactory\" proposals to the CEQ. EPA developed a program for reviewing federal agency projects to ensure NEPA goals are implemented. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) includes action-forcing provisions to ensure policy goals are met, establishes the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) for advice to the President on environmental matters, and requires an annual report on the environment to Congress. NEPA declares a national environmental policy emphasizing cooperation for harmonious coexistence of man and nature. The government aims to improve and coordinate federal plans to fulfill environmental responsibilities, ensure safe surroundings for Americans, achieve beneficial uses of the environment, preserve national heritage, balance population and resource use, and enhance renewable resources. Title I of the government's environmental plan focuses on maximizing the use of renewable resources and promoting the recycling of depletable resources. It includes procedural requirements to ensure federal agencies comply with the goals of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Section 102 outlines the framework for federal decision-making, emphasizing the use of a systematic, interdisciplinary approach to consider environmental impacts. NEPA mandates that all federal agencies include a detailed statement on the environmental effects of proposed legislation and major federal actions. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to provide a detailed statement on the environmental impact of proposed actions, including adverse effects, alternatives, and resource commitments. NEPA also mandates the study and development of appropriate alternatives for projects with unresolved conflicts over resource use. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) directs federal agencies to review their existing authority, regulations, and policies to ensure compliance with the act's purposes. It establishes the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to report to Congress on environmental quality, trends, and programs addressing environmental concerns. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) establishes the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to support the President in addressing environmental concerns. NEPA is a policy declaration with action-forcing provisions, setting the framework for integrating environmental considerations into federal decision making. However, it lacks specific implementation details, leading to varied reactions from federal agencies in complying with its requirements. Litigation to enforce agency compliance with NEPA's provisions began immediately, with courts and CEQ playing significant roles in determining implementation. Courts emphasized procedural EIS requirements but did not specify compliance with substantive environmental policy goals until the U.S. Supreme Court clarified NEPA's twin aims in 1983. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified in 1983 that NEPA has twin aims: requiring agencies to consider every significant environmental impact of a proposed action and informing the public of this consideration. Congress did not mandate prioritizing environmental concerns over other factors but required agencies to take a \"hard look\" at environmental consequences before major actions. This \"hard look\" is meant to be integrated into the agency's decision-making process for pursuing federal actions. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified in 1989 that NEPA does not mandate specific results but requires a process to identify and evaluate adverse environmental effects. NEPA allows agencies to prioritize other values over environmental costs if adequately considered. The Court emphasized that NEPA prohibits uninformed, not unwise, agency action. Additionally, courts have determined specific procedural elements of NEPA compliance. The courts have played a significant role in interpreting key phrases in agency actions related to the environment. They have also determined requirements for preparing Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and addressed issues such as EIS adequacy and handling of adverse comments. Critics argue that litigation related to NEPA processes is used to delay or stop projects, while others believe it is necessary when agencies fail to comply. Litigation related to NEPA processes is sometimes used to delay or halt projects. President Nixon authorized CEQ to develop regulations to make the environmental impact statement process more useful and concise. The executive order directed federal agencies to make impact statements concise, clear, and supported by evidence. CEQ issued guidelines for EIS preparation in the 1970s, leaving NEPA implementation to agency discretion. Delays in decision-making due to NEPA processes were a concern in the mid-1970s. President Carter amended President Nixon's executive order to standardize the NEPA process, directing CEQ to issue legally binding regulations for federal agencies. The final regulations, effective in 1979, aimed to improve decision-making, reduce paperwork, and clarify compliance procedures. The purpose of the NEPA process was to inform agencies of their obligations and goals. The CEQ's regulations, based on NEPA guidelines, aim to inform federal agencies on compliance procedures, ensure high-quality environmental information, improve decision-making, and facilitate public involvement in the decision-making process. Noteworthy clarifications include project \"scoping\" to identify environmental issues, multiple stages for EIS preparation, and requirements for supplemental EISs. The CEQ's regulations for NEPA compliance include defining criteria for impacts, roles of lead and cooperating agencies, setting time and page limits, dispute resolution with EPA, public involvement, and environmental review procedures for projects with uncertain impacts. The CEQ regulations for NEPA compliance required public involvement, publication of a record of decision for actions involving an EIS, and alternative compliance procedures for emergencies. Each federal agency had to develop specific NEPA procedures for typical actions. CEQ's regulations were unique as they were issued eight years after the law, reflecting CEQ's interpretation, court rulings, and other agencies' experiences. The CEQ regulations for NEPA compliance included provisions from the Clean Air Act and provided support to federal agencies in implementing NEPA requirements. CEQ issued guidance documents such as the \"Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ's NEPA Regulations\" and proposed guidance to \"Modernize and Reinvigorate NEPA\" in 2010. CEQ proposed guidance in 2010 to \"Modernize and Reinvigorate NEPA\" for federal agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in their actions. The draft guidance aimed to clarify how agencies should analyze these impacts under NEPA regulations. In determining whether NEPA applies to a federal action, it is crucial to establish if the action is indeed federal and if its environmental impacts are significant. Federal actions include projects funded, assisted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies, requiring compliance with NEPA for actions needing federal permits or regulatory decisions. It is often clear if a project is federal, but in some cases, further assessment is needed. CEQ regulations specify categories of actions within which NEPA-covered federal actions tend to fall. A broad NEPA review may be done for the adoption of programs, plans, or policies, followed by a site-specific review for subsequently implemented projects. This process, known as \"tiering,\" involves summarizing issues discussed in the broader document and incorporating previous discussions by reference to avoid repetitive discussion. Table 2 provides examples of projects at selected agencies that may require environmental review under NEPA, including agency proposals for federal legislation. CEQ's definition of legislation involves significant agency cooperation, with the primary agency responsible for preparing a legislative EIS if the action will significantly impact the human environment. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to determine the significance of a project's impacts on a case-by-case basis, based on context and intensity. CEQ regulations do not provide a definitive list of projects with significant impacts, instead requiring agencies to analyze impacts on society, regions, interests, or localities. A site-specific project's significance may vary based on factors like location and scope. Intensity of impacts must be assessed case-by-case, considering factors like environmental impacts, public health, and unique geographical characteristics. CEQ regulations require evaluation of impacts on society, regions, interests, or localities. The significance of a site-specific project is determined by factors such as location and scope. The evaluation must consider impacts on the quality of the human environment, controversy, uncertainty, precedent setting, cumulative impacts, historic resources, and endangered species. The significance of a site-specific project is determined by factors such as location, scope, impacts on the environment, controversy, uncertainty, precedent setting, cumulative impacts, and endangered species. Agencies may also consider additional environmental factors specific to their projects and may need input from other agencies to determine impact intensity. A clear administrative record is necessary to demonstrate how the significance of a project was determined. The NEPA process involves steps for agencies to determine the significance of a project's impacts. CEQ regulations classify actions into three categories based on impact level: Actions Requiring an EIS, Actions Requiring an EA, and Categorically Excluded Actions. The NEPA process involves determining the significance of project impacts. Most federal actions require an EA or are categorically excluded from EIS preparation. Agencies track the total number of EISs filed, not individual actions subject to NEPA. In 2007, approximately 4% of highway projects required an EIS, 4% required an EA, and almost 92% were categorically excluded. Projects needing an EIS or EA represented 8% of total projects but accounted for almost 23% of FHWA funds. The lead agency must publish a notice of intent in the Federal Register after deciding to prepare an EIS. The lead agency is required to publish a notice of intent (NOI) in the Federal Register as the formal announcement of the project to the public and interested agencies. The agency must determine the scope of the project, identify affected parties, significant issues for analysis in the EIS, allocate assignments for preparing the EIS, and identify other environmental review requirements. The lead agency must determine project scope, identify affected parties, allocate EIS assignments, and identify environmental review requirements. EIS preparation involves setting time and page limits, determining applicable environmental laws, and addressing potential impacts on historical property, endangered species habitat, and wetlands or navigable waters. Preparation occurs in two stages, resulting in a draft and final EIS. The draft EIS should meet NEPA requirements and respond to agency comments. A supplemental EIS may be needed. The purpose and need statement is crucial for subsequent EIS sections. The statement should not exclude reasonable alternatives. The purpose discusses action goals, while the need addresses existing conditions requiring improvement. The purpose and need evaluation in the EIS defines goals for viable project alternatives. CEQ regulations emphasize considering practical and feasible alternatives. The final EIS requires a public record of decision (ROD) with the final decision and all considered alternatives. The final decision in the EIS includes all alternatives considered by the agency, ensuring environmental harm is minimized. The ROD allows the agency's action to proceed, supported by planning documents, public comments, and agency responses. An environmental assessment (EA) clarifies potential impacts on the environment before determining the extent of an action's effects. The CEQ regulations require a concise public document that aids agency compliance with NEPA by providing evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI. Agencies must include a brief discussion of the proposal's need, alternatives, impacts, and agencies consulted in the EA. Some agencies recommend a process similar to developing an EIS for developing an EA. The Environmental Assessment (EA) process involves discussing the project's purpose, identifying alternatives, and mitigation measures for adverse impacts. Public participation is at the discretion of the lead agency. If significant impacts are found, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required. Otherwise, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is prepared, which serves as the agency's decision record. Projects with no significant environmental impacts may be categorically excluded from EA or EIS requirements. Individual agencies must list projects likely to be considered categorical exclusions in their NEPA regulations. DOT has identified actions like constructing bicycle lanes as categorical exclusions. Documentation may be needed for excluded actions with significant environmental effects. Agencies may require proof of CE determination even for categorically excluded projects with no significant impacts. The NEPA process requires documentation to prove CE determination for projects with environmental impacts. Compliance with other environmental laws may be necessary even if a project is not deemed to have a significant impact under NEPA. CEQ released guidance in 2010 to ensure appropriate and transparent use of categorical exclusions by agencies. Agencies are urged to periodically review their categorical exclusions to avoid outdated procedures. The NEPA process involves a lead agency responsible for preparing documentation, with cooperating agencies assisting. Various statutes may require different agencies to participate in the NEPA process. The NEPA process involves a lead agency responsible for preparing documentation, with cooperating agencies assisting in developing information and preparing environmental analyses. The cooperating agency may be excused from some responsibilities if precluded by other program requirements. Disagreements have arisen regarding the authority and extent of coordinating agencies in the NEPA process. In a correspondence between Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta and CEQ Chairman James Connaughton, Mineta sought clarification on the role of lead and cooperating agencies in developing purpose and need statements for highway projects. Connaughton emphasized that the lead agency has the authority to define a project's purpose and need, citing CEQ regulations and federal court decisions. Connaughton highlighted the lead agency's responsibilities throughout the NEPA process. Before completing an EIS, the lead agency must consult with cooperating agencies and obtain comments on any environmental impacts. CEQ regulations outline requirements for inviting and responding to comments on the draft EIS. Comments must be requested from state, local, tribal agencies, the public, agencies interested in similar actions, and the applicant. The lead agency must assess and consider received comments and respond accordingly. The lead agency must assess and respond to comments on the draft EIS by modifying proposed alternatives, developing new alternatives, improving analyses, making factual corrections, or explaining why certain comments do not require further response. Lead agencies are required to invite and respond to comments from cooperating agencies and the public. Negative comments do not necessarily prevent a project from moving forward but may lead to legal challenges. The lead agency must address negative comments on the draft EIS to avoid legal challenges. EPA has a duty to review and comment on environmental impacts of federal activities, rating EIS adequacy and environmental impact. EPA's rating determines the lead agency's response, with four possible ratings for environmental impacts. The EPA has two main duties regarding the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) filing process. Firstly, it must determine if the action is environmentally unsatisfactory and refer the matter to the CEQ for dispute resolution if necessary. Secondly, the EPA is responsible for carrying out the operational duties associated with the EIS filing process, as outlined in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the CEQ. EPA maintains a national EIS filing system to facilitate public access to EISs. The NEPA requires agencies to involve the public in decisions affecting the environment by providing notices of EIS availability and encouraging public participation in hearings and meetings. Public input, such as comments and transcripts, must be included in the final EIS. The lead agency must seek and respond to public comments from various stakeholders, including individuals, groups, and special interest groups with concerns about environmental impacts. For example, a road-widening project may elicit comments from the local business community and area homeowners, while projects impacting sensitive environmental resources may generate comments from environmental interest groups. Stakeholders may direct their concerns towards any element of the project. CEQ recommends maintaining continuous contact with nonagency stakeholders throughout the decision-making process to address stakeholder comments effectively and avoid conflicts. A 1997 CEQ study emphasized the importance of considering the views of the surrounding community and other interested members of the public during project planning and decision-making. CEQ regulations specify public involvement requirements for federal actions requiring an EIS. Agencies may set their own policies for public involvement in preparing an EA or making a categorical exclusion determination. Large actions like bridge construction or mining may need to comply with numerous laws. Compliance with legal requirements depends on the project site's resources. NEPA regulations require agencies to prepare the EIS concurrently with any environmental requirements to avoid duplication of effort. The EIS must list federal permits, licenses, and entitlements needed for the project. NEPA acts as an umbrella statute, coordinating compliance with environmental laws. Compliance with NEPA does not eliminate the need to comply with other applicable laws, leading to potential confusion. The NEPA process may involve compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA), requiring a biological assessment. Stakeholders sometimes criticize NEPA for being inefficient, but some agency representatives believe it helps projects run more smoothly. Environmental organizations argue that blaming the NEPA process for project delays is misplaced, as resource agencies may be overburdened and underfunded. Delays can be attributed to the time it takes to complete required documentation and NEPA-related litigation. The NEPA process may have caused delays in federal actions in the past, but currently, there is limited data to support this claim. Many federal agencies do not track the time taken to complete NEPA documentation, making it challenging to determine if NEPA directly causes project delays. Changes in project specifications can extend the NEPA process, leading to the perception of extensive delays. The NEPA process may lead to perceived delays in federal projects due to compliance with multiple environmental laws and regulations, extensive reviews by various agencies, and litigation being a common cause of project delays. Litigation is a common cause of NEPA-related project delays, with a small number of cases filed in the past 10 years. Most cases were against the USDA's Forest Service and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management, mainly due to inadequate environmental impact assessments. NEPA litigation has decreased since the 1970s but has remained steady since the late 1980s. The trend of NEPA litigation has remained relatively constant since the late 1980s, possibly due to improved agency compliance with regulations and expertise. Decrease in major federal actions funded by Congress may also contribute. Agency concern about litigation threat still impacts NEPA process, especially for complex projects. Project sponsors may consider previous judicial interpretations to create \"litigation-proof\" EIS, leading to increased cost and time for NEPA documentation without necessarily improving quality. In the past 20 years, surveys and reports have studied the effectiveness of the NEPA process in improving document quality. A 2004 survey identified reasons for project delays, including decision maker changes, court challenges, poor documentation, changes in project alternatives, and compliance requirements of the Endangered Species Act. In 1997, a study was published by CEQ to assess NEPA's effectiveness and ways to enhance its implementation. Participants, including supporters and critics of NEPA, highlighted the framework for collaboration it provides between federal agencies and stakeholders. However, concerns were raised about the lengthy process, high costs, decisions made before public input, complex documents, and inadequate training for agency officials. The study found that efficient NEPA implementation requires early integration of NEPA goals into agency planning, adequate public information provision, and public involvement in decision-making to reduce litigation. Some entities believe certain EAs are designed to avoid public input, leading to conflicts. Preparation of EAs, rather than EISs, is a common source of conflict and litigation. NGOs and citizens feel their input is not effectively considered in agency decisions. Citizens feel their input is not effectively considered in agency decisions, leading to frustration and a perception of being treated as adversaries in the NEPA process. Litigation is sometimes seen as the only way to influence environmental decisions significantly. In 2002, a study by CEQ's NEPA Task Force aimed to review and improve NEPA implementation practices and procedures. In 2003, a task force released a report with findings and recommendations after receiving over 739 stakeholder comments on NEPA implementation challenges. Many comments highlighted issues with NEPA analysis requirements, litigation effects, and the perception of excessive document production leading to \"analysis paralysis\" and public distrust. The stakeholders expressed concerns about vague requirements in public lands management, leading to public distrust and disengagement. Some felt agencies were pressured to produce more analysis due to uncertainty about court expectations. Others believed agencies predetermined outcomes, failed to consider alternatives, and provided inadequate analysis to support management plans. Inadequate consideration of environmental effects, reliance on outdated data, and insufficient research were also highlighted. The stakeholders expressed concerns about agencies relying on inadequate or outdated data, not meeting rigorous scientific standards, and ignoring public concerns. Some believed litigation was necessary to ensure compliance with NEPA requirements and to make agencies address environmental effects seriously. Budget, training, and staffing constraints were also identified as challenges for agencies. The Natural Resources Council report highlighted that most federal agencies lack a national tracking system to monitor NEPA documents due to budget and staff constraints. This hinders their ability to document workload, preparation times, costs, and trends, making it difficult to respond to proposals to streamline the NEPA process. In the 108th Congress, laws were enacted to streamline the NEPA process by improving interagency coordination for large projects. The term \"streamlining\" refers to expediting the NEPA process through better coordination among federal, state, tribal, or local agencies. In 2008, most agencies filed fewer than 10 EISs, with the majority filed by seven agencies including USDA-Forest Service and DOT's Federal Highway Administration. Streamlining activities involve actions sponsored by various agencies such as DOT's Federal Highway Administration, Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management, and Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers. Some bills enacted since the 108th Congress include projects like hazardous fuel reduction on federal land and airport capacity enhancement projects. The Equity Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-59) focuses on surface transportation projects, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) deals with energy development projects, and the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-114) pertains to water resources projects by the Army Corps of Engineers. Streamlining provisions in these acts include categorical exclusions and designating lead agencies for specific actions. The Equity Act of 2005, Energy Policy Act of 2005, and Water Resources Development Act of 2007 focus on streamlining environmental review processes for transportation, energy, and water projects. This includes delegating authority to lead agencies, establishing deadlines, specifying project purposes, and developing dispute resolution procedures. Stakeholders have differing opinions on these streamlining proposals. Some stakeholders believe that streamlining the compliance process for federal projects is necessary, but there is debate on how to do it. Industry representatives want lead agencies to have more authority to reduce delays, while environmental groups are concerned that this could overlook public and agency concerns. Some environmental groups argue that \"streamlining\" is an attempt to weaken environmental protection and reduce public involvement in federal decision-making. NEPA requires agencies to consider environmental impacts and involve the public in the process, without dictating the final decision. Courts have played a significant role in NEPA's implementation due to unique factors like the initial lack of binding regulations for the EIS. The NEPA process involves public involvement and can lead to litigation if stakeholders feel their concerns are not addressed, potentially slowing down federal projects. However, the number of projects affected by NEPA-related litigation has decreased in recent years. Unlike other environmental laws, NEPA itself cannot stop projects. NEPA is a policy statute that supplements other environmental laws, requiring agencies to comply with various environmental requirements before proceeding with a project. While NEPA itself cannot halt a project, agencies may choose to abandon a project during a NEPA-related lawsuit. Stakeholders agree that agencies can improve their NEPA compliance methods, despite disagreements on the extent to which NEPA delays federal actions. Many elements of recent legislative proposals aim to streamline NEPA compliance, already existing in CEQ's regulations. This includes integrating NEPA early in the planning process, aligning NEPA requirements with other environmental regulations, eliminating duplication with state and local procedures, resolving disputes with other agencies promptly, and setting appropriate time limits on the EIS process. Debate continues on further streamlining possibilities. CEQ's NEPA regulations were published in 1981 and have been the subject of various studies and reports over the years, including a 1997 study on its effectiveness and a 2003 report on modernizing its implementation. Additionally, a 2002 report by Smythe and Isber examined NEPA implementation in agencies."
