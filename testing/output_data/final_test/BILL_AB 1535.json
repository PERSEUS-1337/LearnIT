    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 103 of the Elections Code is amended to allow voters to withdraw their signature from an initiative, referendum, or recall petition by filing a written request with the appropriate elections official. This request must include the voter's name, address, and signature. Additionally, Section 3106 of the Elections Code is amended. Section 3106 of the Elections Code is amended to allow military or overseas voters to return their ballot by facsimile transmission, with specific requirements for the ballot to be counted. When voting by mail, the voter's signature is kept secret and separated from the ballot to maintain secrecy during tabulation. My residence address for voter qualification is (Street Address) _____ _____ (City) _____ _____ (ZIP Code). My current mailing address is (Street Address) _____ (City) _____ _____ (ZIP Code). Contact information includes email and fax number. I am a resident of __________ County, State of California, or qualified as an elector. I declare under penalty of perjury that the information provided is true and correct. Signed on (date). The voter must sign an oath and include it with their ballot and identification envelope for it to be counted when returned by facsimile transmission. Procedures must be in place to protect the secrecy of ballots. The elections official will verify the voter's eligibility by comparing signatures and duplicate the ballot according to set procedures. A military or overseas voter is encouraged to return their ballot by mail or in person if possible, but can use facsimile transmission if necessary to ensure it is received before the close of polls on election day. A district can conduct elections by all-mailed ballots with a resolution of its governing board. A district conducting an election by all-mailed ballots may consolidate its election with other political subdivisions if certain conditions are met. The election must be held on the same day, in the same territory, and conducted wholly by mail. The district must comply with additional statutory requirements for the consolidated election. The election date can be prescribed in Section 1500 or on any other date. Section 9602 of the Elections Code allows voters to withdraw their signature from an initiative or referendum petition by filing a written request with the elections official before the petition is filed. This request must include the voter's name, address, and signature. This withdrawal request is not considered a petition under Section 104. Section 10404 is also amended in the Elections Code. Section 10404 of the Elections Code is amended to allow special districts to hold elections for governing body members on the same day as the statewide general election in odd-numbered years. Special districts are defined as agencies formed for local governmental functions within limited boundaries. The resolution for election consolidation must align with primary or general election dates, including nominations, notices, canvassing of votes, and certification. It should be submitted to the board of supervisors 240 days before the district election date. The board will notify all districts in the county and request input on the consolidation's impact. The elections official will provide an impact analysis to the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors must approve the resolution for election consolidation within 60 days, unless there are capacity issues. The elections official will provide a cost-effectiveness report before the resolution is adopted. After approval, registered voters will be notified by mail at the district's expense. Public notices will be made according to the Government Code. If a special district is located in multiple counties, it cannot consolidate an election if any county denies the request. Governing body members with expiring terms will continue in office until successors are elected, not extending beyond December 31 of the following year after consolidation approval. If a board of supervisors approves the resolution for a special district election, it will be conducted on a specified date unless later rescinded. Any changes to the election date require at least one election before the resolution can be repealed or amended. The terms of office for elective officers in new districts are determined accordingly. The terms of office for elective officers in new districts are determined based on whether the district is formed in an odd-numbered year or an even-numbered year. Officers elected at the formation election will hold office until noon on the first Friday in December of the next following odd-numbered year or the second next following odd-numbered year. The directors elected in a district shall classify themselves into two classes, with terms of four years and two years. Other elective officers hold office for four years or until their successor is elected. Special districts may align governing body member elections with the statewide general election. Section 11303 of the Elections Code is amended to allow voters to withdraw their signature from a recall petition by filing a written request with the elections official before the petition section is filed. The written request must include the voter's name, address, and signature."
