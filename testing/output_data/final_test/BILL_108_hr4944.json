Congress finds that at the end of the last Ice Age, cataclysmic floods occurred in the northwest United States, leaving dramatic features on the landscape. Geological features of exceptional value are present on various lands in the region. In 2001, a study team endorsed the establishment of an Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail is designated in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon to showcase the national significance of the floods and educate the public through collaborative efforts of public and private entities. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail, designated in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, showcases the cataclysmic floods from the last Ice Age. The Trail is defined in the Act as a significant geological feature. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail is designated to showcase significant natural and cultural features of the Ice Age Floods. The Trail follows public roads from Montana to Oregon, as depicted on a specific map. The Secretary has the authority to revise the map. The Secretary has the authority to revise the map of the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. The revised map will be part of the Cooperative Management and Interpretation Plan for the Trail and will be available for public inspection in National Park Service offices. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary, through the Director of the National Park Service, administers the Trail as per the Act. A Trail management office may be established for coordination with public agencies and private entities. An interagency technical committee advises on technical planning for the Cooperative Management and Interpretation Plan, including representation from various government levels and the Ice Age Floods Institute. The Secretary administers the Trail with a Trail Advisory Committee comprised of various stakeholders. A Management Plan will be prepared within 3 years, involving consultation with governments, private property owners, and interested parties. The Trail Advisory Committee will develop strategies for interpretive facilities, educational programs, and partnerships to enhance public understanding of the floods. They will also refine the inventory of flood features and potentially update the Trail map. The Secretary may acquire up to 25 acres of land for public information and administrative purposes to enhance the geographic diversity of the entire trail in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Acquisitions must align with the Cooperative Management and Interpretation Plan, with private land acquired from willing sellers through exchange, donation, or purchase, and non-Federal public lands acquired through donation or exchange after consulting with local governments. The Secretary is also authorized to plan, design, and construct interpretive facilities for Trail sites in partnership with State and local entities. The Act allows for the construction of facilities in partnership with various entities, following the Cooperative Management and Interpretation Plan. Private property rights are protected, with no requirement for public access or modification of laws. Liability for injuries on private property remains with the owner. Cooperative management is encouraged for interpretation, education, stewardship, facility development, and research. The Secretary may enter into cooperative management agreements with officials in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon for the Trail. The Trail is considered a unit of the National Park System. The Secretary can also enter into cooperative agreements with public or private entities. The United States Geological Survey will assist in carrying out the Act. The Secretary may not promulgate regulations specifically for management of the Trail, as the Committee and the National Park Service carry out this Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the Act, with a limit of $500,000 per fiscal year for Trail administration."
