    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Housing Preservation Matching Grant Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that over 55,300 affordable housing units have been lost due to termination of low-income affordability requirements, with an additional 265,000 units at risk of prepayment. This loss will have a significant impact on current tenants and worsen the housing crisis for low-income households. The demand for affordable housing exceeds supply, with 5.3 million households in worst-case housing needs. The shortage of affordable housing in the US reached a record high in 1995, exceeding low-cost rental units by 4.4 million. In the United States, housing increased by 1,000,000 units, but the supply of low-cost units decreased by 100,000. The number of low-income renter households increased by 900,000, leading to a shortage of affordable housing. This shortage results in low-income households paying a large portion of their incomes for rent, with 82 percent of low-income renter households paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent and utilities in 1995. The Act aims to preserve affordable housing units by providing grants to States with programs for privately owned housing. It also seeks to prevent displacement of elderly and disabled tenants and maintain partnerships for affordable housing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will make grants to States for low-income housing preservation, subject to availability of funds.
