The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow for the carryover of unused nontaxable benefits from cafeteria plans and flexible spending arrangements to later taxable years without affecting their tax treatment. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the carryover of unused nontaxable benefits from cafeteria plans and flexible spending arrangements to later taxable years. Amounts carried forward are limited to $3,000 annually, and participants can choose to have unused benefits distributed to them instead of carrying them over. The distribution under subparagraph (A) is not included in gross income if transferred to various retirement plans within 60 days. This includes individual retirement plans, 401(k) plans, 403(b) annuity contracts, 457 deferred compensation plans, and medical savings accounts. Any amount rolled over under this subparagraph shall be treated as a rollover contribution for the taxable year from which the unused amount would otherwise be carried. The rollover shall be treated as an eligible rollover under applicable sections and shall not be taken into account in applying any limitation on participation requirements. The text discusses the cost-of-living adjustment for taxable years after 1999 and the creation of a Health Care Reimbursement Rollover Account in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The text introduces Health Care Reimbursement Rollover Accounts under Section 530A. Health care reimbursement rollover accounts are exempt from taxation unless they cease to be such accounts. They are subject to taxes on unrelated business income if they no longer qualify. These accounts are trusts created for paying qualified medical expenses, with specific requirements for contributions. The trustee of a health care reimbursement rollover account must be a bank, insurance company, or another qualified person. Trust assets must be invested in guaranteed principle and interest investments with 100% liquidity. Contributions to the trust cannot be invested until the second year after the year they are made. The trustee of a health care reimbursement rollover account must be a bank, insurance company, or another qualified person. Trust assets must be invested in guaranteed principle and interest investments with 100% liquidity. Contributions to the trust cannot be invested until the second year after the year they are made. The interest of an individual in the balance in his account is nonforfeitable. Qualified medical expenses refer to amounts paid for medical care for the account holder, their spouse, and dependents, not compensated for by insurance. Health insurance cannot be purchased from the account. The account holder or their spouse cannot use payments from a group health plan of their employer for coverage. Exceptions include coverage during continuation required by Federal law, long-term care insurance, and Medicare supplemental policies. The tax treatment of health care reimbursement rollover accounts under section 1882 of the Social Security Act is similar to rules for custodial accounts. Amounts distributed from these accounts not used for qualified medical expenses are subject to specific tax rules. Amounts paid or distributed from a health care reimbursement rollover account exclusively for qualified medical expenses are not taxable. However, any amount not used for qualified medical expenses will be included in the account holder's gross income. Payments from this account for medical expenses cannot be claimed as a deduction under section 213 or 162(l). Transferring the account due to divorce is also addressed. Transfer of a health care reimbursement rollover account to a spouse in divorce is not taxable. After transfer, the account is treated as belonging to the spouse. Upon the account holder's death, the account value is excluded from estate tax calculations. If an individual acquires the account holder's interest in a health care reimbursement rollover account as the designated beneficiary, the account is treated as if the beneficiary were the account holder. If a non-individual acquires the account holder's interest in the account as the designated beneficiary, the account ceases to be a health care reimbursement rollover account upon the account holder's death. The Secretary may require the trustee of a health care reimbursement rollover account to make reports regarding contributions, distributions, and other matters as determined appropriate. Reports must be filed and furnished as required by the Secretary. Effective Date: The amendments for health care reimbursement rollover accounts apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1999."
