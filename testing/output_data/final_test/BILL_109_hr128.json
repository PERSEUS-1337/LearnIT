Congress found incidents of fraternity fires at universities due to lack of fire alarms and sprinklers. On January 1, 2003, a fire at Pennsylvania State University displaced 11 students from their off-campus housing. Smoke detectors alerted 2 occupants who escaped, while others were away for the holiday break. The fire caused $40,000 in damage, and the cause is under investigation. The building did not have a sprinkler system. A fire at a university in Greencastle, Indiana, caused over $1,000,000 in damage. It started from an electrical appliance in a fourth-floor room, leading to the evacuation of 116 students. Another fire at Amherst College in Massachusetts was caused by a halogen lamp in a second-floor room. The fire alarm system was activated, and an occupant tried to extinguish it. On January 19, 2000, a fire occurred at a Seton Hall University dormitory, resulting in the deaths of three freshmen. The dormitory, built in 1952, housed approximately 600 students and was equipped with smoke alarms but no fire sprinkler system.
