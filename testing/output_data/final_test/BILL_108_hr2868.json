FINDINGS.\" Summarized chunk:\nThe Congress finds that Dr. Michael Ellis DeBakey was born in 1908 in Louisiana, invented a roller pump for blood transfusions as a medical student, volunteered for military service during World War II, and rose to the rank of Colonel. Dr. DeBakey's military service during World War II led to recommendations for managing war wounds, resulting in the development of MASH units. Post-war, he advocated for medical follow-up of veterans and specialized medical centers, leading to the creation of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center System. Joining Baylor University College of Medicine in 1948, he developed innovative surgical techniques. Dr. DeBakey's groundbreaking surgical innovations at the College of Medicine in Houston included the first successful aneurysm procedures in 1953 and the pioneering coronary bypass surgery in 1964, revolutionizing modern cardiac surgery. In 1968, Dr. DeBakey supervised the first successful multi-organ transplant, involving a heart, both kidneys, and a lung from a single donor transplanted into 4 recipients. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. DeBakey as Chairman of the President's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke in 1964, leading to the establishment of Regional Medical Programs to promote research and training collaborations among medical institutions. In the mid-1960's, Dr. DeBakey pioneered telemedicine with the first open-heart surgery transmitted overseas by satellite. He was elected the first President of Baylor College of Medicine in 1969 and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction from President Lyndon B. Johnson in the same year. Additionally, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Dr. DeBakey also collaborated with NASA engineers to create the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, which may eliminate the need for heart transplantation in some patients.
