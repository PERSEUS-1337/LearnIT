The \"Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2005\" acknowledges that the telephone is crucial for families to stay in touch with incarcerated loved ones. Inmates are usually only allowed to make calls through payphones in correctional facilities, often limited to collect calling. Family members typically bear the cost of these calls, whether collect or through a debit account. Inmates' families bear high telephone charges for collect calls, with rates as high as $1 per minute and $3.95 connection fees. Lack of competition among telephone companies serving correctional institutions contributes to these excessive rates. The lack of competitive forces in the inmate telephone service industry leads to high calling rates, as only one carrier is typically allowed in each correctional institution. These carriers pay commissions to administrators for exclusive rights, with some commissions making up 50% or more of total charges. This collection of commissions burdens interstate commerce. Due to limited competition in inmate telephone services, families of prisoners are forced to pay high rates set by the exclusive carrier in correctional facilities. The US aims to provide fair communication services to all, including those paying for inmate calls to maintain crucial family connections. The high rates of inmate telephone services hinder frequent communication between incarcerated individuals and their families, impacting successful reintegration and increasing the likelihood of recidivism. Regulatory intervention by the Commission is necessary to address this issue. Congress reaffirms the Commission's authority to address excessive inmate telephone service rates through regulatory intervention. SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON INMATE TELEPHONE SERVICE. The terms 'collect call', 'commission', and 'debit account' are defined in an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 regarding inmate telephone services. The amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 defines terms related to inmate telephone services, including 'inmate telephone service' and 'provider of inmate telephone service'. It also includes regulations for inmate telephone services. The Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2005 introduces regulations for inmate telephone services, including setting maximum compensation rates per minute and per call to ensure fairness and non-discrimination. The regulations for inmate telephone services include setting variable maximum compensation rates based on carrier costs and facility size, requiring providers to offer collect calling and debit account services, prohibiting commissions to administrators, and allowing multiple providers for interstate calls. The regulations for inmate telephone services aim to provide interstate calling options for prisoners while ensuring technological neutrality and not compromising security interests. The regulations will not consider revenue reductions for correctional institutions as a threat to security interests. The Commission will establish deadlines for implementing these regulations. The Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2005 requires the Commission to prescribe regulations for inmate telephone services within one year of enactment. The Commission will review these regulations every three years and may modify compensation rates. State requirements inconsistent with the Commission's regulations on interstate inmate telephone service will be preempted. Inmate telephone service is fully subject to Sections 251 and 252. Inmate telephone service must comply with Sections 251 and 252 of the Act. Providers cannot block calls based on lack of contractual arrangements with local carriers."
