    "title": "AB 1276",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1347.1 of the Penal Code allows for the testimony of a minor 15 years of age or younger in cases of human trafficking to be taken in another location via closed-circuit television to protect the minor's privacy. The impact on a minor of certain factors must be substantial to make them unavailable as a witness, such as serious emotional distress or the use of a deadly weapon by the defendant. The defendant used a deadly weapon, threatened serious bodily harm or family separation, inflicted great bodily injury, or obstructed the minor's testimony during the trial. The court considers various factors when determining the need for a special procedure for a minor witness, such as age, relationship with the defendant, disabilities, and nature of the charges. The minor's refusal to testify alone is not enough evidence. Closed-circuit television must accurately convey the minor's image and demeanor to all parties involved. If the court orders closed-circuit television for a minor witness, two-way communication is preferred, but one-way may be used if the minor's unavailability is proven. The prosecution must notify the defendant at least 30 days in advance, unless good cause is shown. The hearing on this motion is conducted without the jury present. The court, in deciding a motion involving a minor, cannot force the minor to testify or deny the motion based on the minor not testifying, regardless of Evidence Code Section 804 or any other law. The court may question a minor in chambers to determine if their impact is substantial enough to require the use of closed-circuit television for testimony, with the support person, prosecutor, and defense counsel present. The defendant is not allowed to be present, and the prosecutor and defense counsel cannot examine the minor. Defense counsel can submit questions beforehand and consult with the defendant after the session. After questioning a minor in chambers to assess the need for closed-circuit television testimony, defense counsel can consult with the defendant before the session concludes. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, it must provide reasons on record, instruct the jury not to draw inferences from the use of closed-circuit television, and advise counsel not to comment on the procedure during the trial. Instruct the support witness not to influence the testimony of the minor. Order for a video recording of the minor's examination to be made and preserved, to be available for viewing by relevant parties, and to be destroyed after five years or upon final judgment on appeal. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, only specific individuals are allowed to be present, including the minor, a support person, a nonuniformed bailiff, necessary technicians, and a court-appointed representative. Video recording devices capture the minor's testimony and the support person's image. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, the minor meets with the judge, prosecutor, and defense counsel in the judge's chambers. A support person is also present to explain the court process and establish rapport with the minor for later questioning via closed-circuit television. No discussion about the defendant or case facts is allowed during this meeting. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, the minor can be brought into the courtroom for specific purposes. The examination is done under oath, with the defendant able to see and hear the minor witness. The cost of using closed-circuit television for testimony will be covered by the court. Defendants are allowed to have legal representation during closed-circuit testimony."
