The Oregon Caves National Monument, established in 1909, covers approximately 480 acres in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon. In 1933, administration of the Monument was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. The 1999 general management plan includes a recommendation to add surrounding land for better protection. The purpose of this Act is to add surrounding land to the Oregon Caves National Monument to enhance protection of resources and increase public recreation opportunities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"grazing allotment\" refers to specific areas in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest and a parcel of land managed by the Secretary of the Bureau of Land Management. The terms \"grazing lease\" and \"grazing permit\" authorize the use of these allotments for grazing livestock for commercial purposes. The terms \"lessee\" and \"permittee\" refer to livestock operators with valid grazing leases or permits. The term \"map\" pertains to a specific map for Oregon Caves National Monument. The \"Monument\" is the Oregon Caves National Monument established by Presidential Proclamation. The \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"Secretary concerned\" includes the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land. The Secretary of the Interior manages land held by the Bureau of Land Management, including land for the benefit of an Indian tribe. Boundary Adjustment and Land Transfer: The Monument's boundary is adjusted to include 4,070 acres of Proposed Addition Lands and exclude 4 acres in Cave Junction. The Secretary of Agriculture will transfer the added land to the Secretary and adjust the boundary of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest accordingly. The map will be available for public inspection. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to include segments in Oregon, administered by the Secretary of the Interior: Cave Creek as a recreational river, Lake Creek as a scenic river, No Name Creek as a wild river, and Panther Creek.

Forest restoration activities are conducted to preserve ecosystem components, restore fire's role, and maintain forest attributes. The Secretary administers the Monument to preserve ecosystem components and maintain forest attributes, ensuring that its composition and structure remain intact within a historical range. SEC. 7. VOLUNTARY GRAZING LEASE OR PERMIT DONATION PROGRAM. The Secretary concerned shall accept any grazing lease or permit donated by a lessee or permittee, terminate the acquired lease or permit, and ensure no new lease or permit is issued in the grazing allotment, leading to a permanent end to livestock grazing. When a lessee or permittee donates a grazing lease or permit, they waive any claim to range improvements on the associated allotment. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
