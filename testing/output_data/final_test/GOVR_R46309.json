    "content": "The federal R&D enterprise, with an estimated $141.5 billion in FY2019, is crucial for U.S. economic prosperity, national security, and health care. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting its operation, and this report outlines how the nation's response to COVID-19 is impacting federal R&D, how the government is addressing these effects, and potential issues that may arise. The report focuses on the effects of COVID-19 on federally funded R&D, excluding the broader U.S. R&D enterprise and resources directed towards understanding and addressing the pandemic. It highlights key concerns and agency actions in response to the evolving national understanding and response to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the closure or limited operations of many R&D organizations, including federal facilities and academic laboratories. Social distancing measures have been implemented to reduce virus transmission, impacting businesses, schools, and government offices. Independent decisions by agencies, universities, and institutions have driven these actions rather than coordinated national policies. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the closure or limited operations of R&D organizations, including federal facilities and academic laboratories. Decisions on the status of centers are based on local conditions and may be influenced by state or local government actions. NASA and DOE facilities have implemented different response stages, with some allowing mission-essential personnel and others closed except for critical infrastructure protection. Some R&D activities may continue despite closures if deemed important or can be done remotely. For example, NIST employees are mostly teleworking with limited lab access, but some provide essential services onsite. Terms like essential or critical guide these decisions, similar for field research. NASA and DOE facilities have different response stages, allowing mission-essential personnel or closed except for critical infrastructure protection. In the NASA response framework, mission-essential work includes tasks necessary for human safety, property protection, and maintaining project operations. The Office of Management and Budget provides guidance on what travel is considered mission-critical based on factors like national security importance. Presidential Policy Directive 21 identifies defense R&D as critical infrastructure. Defense contractors' development and testing are also highlighted as essential by the Department of Defense. Some state emergency orders exempt defense-related R&D as critical infrastructure, allowing it to continue when other R&D is suspended. State and local authorities, not federal agencies, decide on the criticality of private-sector organizations. R&D projects may continue based on the impact of suspension, like NASA missions to Mars having narrow launch windows. NASA has halted some major projects amidst the pandemic. NASA is continuing work on the Mars 2020 mission, with 26 months until the next launch window. Other time-sensitive projects include experiments requiring data continuity, caring for live animals, and maintaining cell cultures. Universities make decisions on essential research functions based on local conditions, federal directives, and ethical considerations. Columbia University defines essential functions to include COVID-19 research, clinical trials, and maintenance of equipment and resources. Johns Hopkins University categorizes clinical research into three tiers. Johns Hopkins University has defined three tiers of clinical research. The top tier includes trials of potential COVID-19 treatments and trials addressing acute, life-threatening conditions like Huntington's disease. Only trials in this tier can continue normally, including enrolling new patients. Essential research functions identified by universities include COVID-19 related research, maintaining critical equipment and samples, and supporting essential human subjects. Some time-sensitive research activities are considered essential, such as clinical trials for patient care and essential human subjects research. Agricultural research dependent on annual cycles is generally not considered essential. Remote work may be possible for certain R&D projects, such as scientific computations and data analysis, but tasks like handling physical samples and operating specialized equipment require researchers to be present in the laboratory. Specialized equipment in research labs may require researchers to be present, impacting research involving human subjects during social distancing. The duration of disruptions can affect research activities, with some disciplines like mathematics and computer science more adaptable to remote work than agricultural science or microbiology. Travel restrictions have led to the cancellation of scientific conferences, impacting knowledge exchange. Scientific conferences are crucial for knowledge sharing, peer feedback, and technology transfer. Canceling these events can hinder advances in knowledge and impact federal scientists, engineers, academia, and the private sector. In fields like computer science, conference papers are influential, making the cancellation even more significant. In some fields like computer science, conference papers are as influential as journal articles. Virtual conferences are being held to replace in-person events, with prerecorded presentations and online interactions. For example, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections and the International Conference on Learning Representations have shifted to virtual formats. Scientific and technical conferences are crucial for professional societies and organizations for revenue. Cancellations result in financial losses due to unrealized revenues and incurred costs. The American Physical Society lost $7 million from canceling its March 2020 meeting, wiping out 12% of its annual revenues. Other societies have also reported significant losses. Federal agencies also face one-time cancellation costs for scientific conferences. Researchers facing considerable costs from cancelled conferences may be able to charge nonrefundable expenses to their research awards. Some agencies are allowing this despite regulations. The cancellation of meetings, including DOE scientific user facility annual meetings, limits outreach and engagement opportunities. Restrictions may impact R&D project efficiency and quality, causing delays and miscommunications in tasks like launch preparation or spacecraft building. The inefficiency of remote guidance for installing electronics on an exploratory spacecraft is highlighted. Institutions may face unplanned expenses for additional equipment and services to support remote work. Janitorial expenses may increase for facilities remaining open, and prices for materials and equipment may rise due to shortages. Supply chain disruptions could also affect R&D projects at open institutions. Laboratories are experiencing shortages of essential supplies like RNA-extraction kits and personal protective equipment due to high demand for COVID-19 testing. NASA's 2021 launch of the James Webb Space Telescope from French Guiana may be at risk due to pandemic-related closures. Some agencies and researchers are shifting focus to COVID-19 related topics, with the National Institutes of Health issuing funding opportunities. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies are redirecting research efforts to COVID-19, with funding opportunities and priority access to research facilities. The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking ideas from the research community on how to contribute resources to address the pandemic. A consortium of agencies, universities, and companies is providing supercomputing resources to accelerate COVID-19 research. NASA Earth Science program offers guidance for reprioritizing funded projects. NIST announces grant opportunity to support rapid projects for pandemic response. Suspending research under the Manufacturing USA institutes program may lead to additional costs for activities like animal care, maintenance of cell cultures, and safe storage of hazardous materials. Restarting research could also incur costs for staff time and supplies to bring equipment back to operational status and replace personal protective gear donated during the pandemic. The extent of coverage for these costs from existing federal research awards is uncertain, potentially leading to auditing issues for redirected research or researchers who incurred shutdown and restart expenses. The flexibilities provided to funding agencies in time-sensitive circumstances may not align with accounting and auditing requirements for research infrastructure supported by federal funds. Shared university research facilities, such as core laboratories and animal care facilities, face challenges in documenting approvals for changes made with grant funds. The university's grant-funded research relied on core facilities, while NIH-funded research used shared animal care facilities in FY2019. Closure of infrastructure has raised concerns about funding for shutdown and restart costs, continuity of pay for technical staff, and delays in planned R&D. NASA has suspended work on projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Space Launch System rocket due to interruptions in development and manufacturing. The federal laboratories engage in R&D activities under Work for Others (WFO) agreements, allowing access to unique facilities, equipment, and personnel. The cancellation or suspension of WFO projects due to COVID-19 may reduce costs for sponsoring organizations but also impact revenue supporting staff, facilities, and equipment. DOE and NIST have conducted significant R&D under WFO agreements, with DOE accounting for 13%-17% of total laboratory revenues. NIST conducted $94.4 million in research and provided over 1,300 Standard Reference Materials (SRM) for instrument calibrations and measurements. Revenues from SRMs in FY2019 were $21.8 million, and calibration and testing services generated $33.5 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NIST's ability to continue providing these services is uncertain. Some agencies and researchers may shift R&D priorities to address COVID-19, potentially reducing funding for other topics in the near term. Federal funding for the national COVID-19 response could limit overall resources for R&D. Increased spending on the pandemic, along with decreased revenue from economic contraction, may lead to constrained government spending in the future. The impact on university research, which involves postdocs, graduate students, and faculty, remains uncertain. Many universities are limiting the participation of postdocs and students in research projects due to COVID-19. This can be concerning as remote work may be challenging for those with families. Cancelled conferences are also a worry for early-career researchers who rely on them for networking and job opportunities. Uncertainty about pay continuity may also arise in some cases. Due to COVID-19, universities are limiting postdocs and students' participation in research projects, leading to uncertainties about pay continuity. Disparities in research disruptions between disciplines may affect students and postdocs differently, potentially discouraging them from continuing in their field. Travel restrictions may also impact the enrollment of foreign science and engineering students in U.S. universities for the 2020-2021 academic year. Reduced international enrollment of foreign science and engineering students in U.S. universities for the 2020-2021 academic year could lead to financial challenges and long-term workforce consequences. OMB provided relief for research grants affected by COVID-19, expanding flexibilities for recipients facing operational capacity and increased costs. The Appendix summarizes OMB's government-wide administrative actions, extensions of authorities, and guidance related to the COVID-19 crisis, including special guidance from agencies like NIH and NSF for awardees. COGR has compiled links to agency guidance and institutional guidance from universities. Some agencies have extended due dates for grants. Some agencies have extended due dates for research proposals, reduced institutional approvals required, and provided accommodations for late applications. Accommodations for existing awardees include no-cost extensions, changes to reporting deadlines, and allowability of certain costs. These measures offer flexibility but may pose challenges when research resumes. Some legislation has been enacted to provide R&D-related funding in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020. This act allocated $836 million for NIH and $3.1 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, which may be used for COVID-19 medical countermeasures. The CARES Act allocated over $1 billion for COVID-19 R&D, with funding for NIH, DOD, NASA, and U.S. Forest Service. It also established a $14 billion Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund for colleges and universities. The CARES Act established a $14 billion Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund for colleges and universities. At least half of this total must be allocated for emergency financial aid grants to students. Section 3610 of the CARES Act allows federal agencies to reimburse contractors for paid leave to keep employees ready when unable to work on-site. Section 12004 authorized the Patent and Trademark Office to adjust timing deadlines during the COVID-19 emergency period. The CARES Act provided additional funding for NIST laboratories, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, and research activities at NIIMBL related to COVID-19. It also allocated funds for the EPA's Science and Technology account to respond to the coronavirus. The CARES Act provided $76 million to NSF for research on methods to reduce the risks from environmental transmission of coronavirus. This funding includes $75 million for NSF's RAPID grant mechanism and $1 million for grant administration. Speaker Pelosi announced plans for a special committee to oversee federal response to COVID-19. Several organizations from industry and academia have proposed policy recommendations to address R&D challenges due to COVID-19. The Commercial Spaceflight Federation has requested legislation for immediate refunds of accumulated R&E tax credits to promote continued innovation. Companies often face limitations in utilizing the full credit amount due to insufficient tax liability, and unused credits can be carried forward for up to 20 years. Several organizations representing research institutions have requested Congress for additional funding and flexibility to cover researcher salaries and benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. They propose measures such as providing $13 billion in extra research funding and allowing agencies to reprogram unspent funds for new awards to stimulate research competitiveness. Additionally, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology has suggested including zero-interest loans and grants to support scientific societies impacted by cancellations of meetings and conferences. Biology has requested Congress to include measures like zero-interest loans and grants for tax-exempt organizations in future economic stimulus packages. OMB has issued guidance to agencies, but implementation has varied. The Association of American Universities suggests more uniform implementation to reduce administrative burdens. Congress may consider other legislative actions to improve the response to future crises, including understanding the impact of COVID-19 on federally funded R&D. The impact of COVID-19 on R&D includes mandates for agency reports, support for academic studies, and the development of uniform guidance for essential R&D activities. A post-pandemic task force will examine lessons learned and recommend policy changes for future pandemics. The effects on the nation's R&D enterprise will become more apparent over time. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on the nation's R&D enterprise will be monitored by Congress for implications on national policy objectives like national security, economic growth, public health, and workforce development. The pandemic may adversely affect the pace of R&D and innovation, impacting economic growth, workforce, and competitiveness. The full extent of these effects is still unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the long-term effects on R&D activities, with potential impacts on national security, economic growth, and workforce development. Congress may address issues such as cybersecurity R&D and broadband access for remote work. Office of Management and Budget Memoranda provide relevant information for the federal R&D enterprise. The Office of Management and Budget Memoranda provide guidance for federal agencies on utilizing technology for mission continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevant memoranda include M-20-19 and M-20-18 addressing IT workforce guidance and federal contract performance issues related to COVID-19. The Office of Management and Budget Memoranda provide guidance for federal agencies on utilizing technology for mission continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes flexibility with System for Award Management (SAM) registration/recertification, waivers for Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) publication, pre-award costs, no-cost extensions on expiring awards, abbreviated noncompetitive continuation requests, expenditure of award funds for project activities, waivers from prior approval requirements, exemption of certain procurement requirements, extension of reporting, and Single Audit submission. OMB allows federal agencies to grant exceptions to support emergency response efforts. The memorandum M-20-17 provides administrative relief for recipients and applicants of federal financial assistance impacted by COVID-19. It outlines steps to ensure safety and contract performance, including maximizing telework and flexibility with performance dates. Agencies are encouraged to work with contractors to evaluate telework options. The memorandum M-20-17 provides administrative relief for federal financial assistance recipients impacted by COVID-19. It suggests being flexible with performance dates, considering telework options, and leveraging emergency procurement authorities for pandemic response. The memorandum M-20-17 under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act provides guidance for federal agencies to prioritize resources to slow the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring critical activities continue. Agencies are required to review and implement risk-based policies based on CDC guidance to safeguard federal workplaces. The memorandum M-20-15 directs federal agencies to offer maximum telework flexibilities to employees in response to COVID-19. Additionally, memorandum M-20-14 advises that only mission-critical travel is recommended at this time. The memorandum M-20-14 authorizes executive branch agency heads to determine mission-critical travel and lists factors to consider. It also encourages agencies to maximize telework for high-risk populations without requiring medical certification. The memorandum M-20-13 encourages agencies to extend telework flexibilities to accommodate state and local responses to the outbreak, considering the mission-critical nature of employees' work. It also accepts self-identification by employees in high-risk populations and advises consultation with public health officials for broader telework options. The memorandum authorizes agency actions to relieve administrative, financial, and audit requirements for federal awards related to COVID-19 emergency response. OMB allows class exceptions for continued research and services, with existing flexibility for case-by-case exceptions. Agencies can grant telework flexibilities for state and local responses to the outbreak. The OMB has authorized agencies to provide flexibilities for federal awards related to COVID-19 emergency response, including telework options for state and local responses.
