    "content": "Seven nations have developed and deploy nuclear weapons, with North Korea and Israel also believed to possess them. This report details the organizations overseeing nuclear weapons research and development in these countries, including a brief history of the United States' organizations. It explores the civilian or military nature of these organizations, noting blurred lines between the two in many nations. This information may be valuable to Members of Congress and their staff. The U.S. program for nuclear weapons research and development began during World War II under civilian control. In 1946, Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act, establishing civilian control of atomic energy through the Atomic Energy Commission. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to develop nuclear weapons and oversee atomic energy research. The AEC was independent from the War Department and later the Department of Defense. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 replaced the 1946 Act and remains the fundamental U.S. law for civilian and military uses of nuclear materials. The Energy Research Reorganization Act of 1974 abolished the AEC and established the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration. The Energy Research Reorganization Act of 1974 abolished the Atomic Energy Commission and established the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). In 1977, the Department of Energy Organization Act abolished ERDA and established the Department of Energy (DOE). In 1999, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000 established the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) as a semiautonomous agency within DOE. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) operates independently within the Department of Energy, responsible for nuclear weapons work, defense programs, nonproliferation efforts, and naval reactors. The Secretary of Energy establishes policy for NNSA, and its budget is separate from the DOE budget. The Nuclear Weapons Council coordinates NNSA and DOD work on nuclear weapons, established under P.L. 99-661. Members include Under Secretary of Defense, Vice Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of DOE (also NNSA Administrator), Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and Commander of US Strategic Command. NNSA's nuclear weapons activities are conducted at eight sites. The National Laboratories in NM and CA, Pantex Plant in TX, Kansas City Plant in MO, Y-12 National Security Complex in TN, Savannah River Site in SC, and Nevada National Security Site in NV are all involved in nuclear weapons research, production, and testing. The Nevada National Security Site conducts weapons-related experiments and remains available for nuclear tests if needed. Concerns were raised in the FY2013 budget cycle about the relationship between NNSA and DOE, with discussions on potentially granting NNSA more autonomy. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act established a panel to examine governance of the nuclear security enterprise. The People's Republic of China's nuclear weapons development is controlled by the military. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) controls China's nuclear weapons development, including the Second Artillery missile force and the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP). The CAEP oversees nuclear weapons work through various research institutes and reports to the PLA's General Armaments Department. The PLA also manages the nuclear weapon testing base at Lop Nur. The last announced nuclear weapons test by China was in July 1996. The PRC's nuclear weapons testing in Xinjiang region in July 1996 is overseen by various organizations including the Central Special Commission, Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, Fudan University, and others. The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is a key player in defense industrial activities related to nuclear fuel and power plants. The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is a defense industrial conglomerate involved in nuclear activities. CNNC was re-organized in 2008 under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China is estimated to have around 240 nuclear warheads, with uncertainty surrounding their nuclear weapons program. The PLA's Second Artillery utilizes an extensive network of underground tunnels to hide and move strategic missiles. Professor Phillip Karber of Georgetown University suggested in a study that China may have up to 3,000 nuclear weapons, while retired Russian general Viktor Yesin estimated China's arsenal to be between 1,600-1,800 warheads. However, Air Force General Robert Kehler of the U.S. Strategic Command disagreed with these assessments in August 2012. France's nuclear weapons research and development is overseen by the French Ministry of Defense, with the French Atomic and Alternative Energy Commission (CEA) playing a key role in these programs. The French Atomic and Alternative Energy Commission (CEA) is a public entity active in low-carbon energies, defense and security, information technologies, and health technologies. CEA's programs are determined by a committee chaired by the French Prime Minister. The CEA Chairman, appointed by the government, serves as the Chief Executive Director and is a permanent member of the committee. A High Commissioner advises the Chairman on scientific and technical issues and chairs the CEA Scientific Committee. CEA's military activities are carried out in the Direction des Applications Militaires (DAM), supervised by the Ministry of Defense. The French Atomic and Alternative Energy Commission (CEA) oversees various programs, with program management delegated to CEA. The Comit\u00e9 Mixte Arm\u00e9es-CEA commission supervises program execution, especially financial aspects. CEA receives funding from multiple government ministries, with each ministry submitting a separate budget proposal to parliament. In contrast, research and development for India's nuclear weapons are controlled by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in India, established in 1954 under the Prime Minister's direct control, includes facilities related to the country's nuclear weapons program. Israel maintains a policy of \"nuclear opacity\" regarding its nuclear weapons status, neither confirming nor denying their existence. Israel has maintained a policy of \"nuclear opacity\" for over four decades to deter adversaries without causing regional proliferation. The Office of the Military Censor prohibits reporting on Israel's nuclear infrastructure implying a weapons program, despite international reports alleging its existence. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission advises the government on nuclear policy and research, with civilian control over the nuclear program. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) advises the government on nuclear policy and research. Shimon Peres reduced IAEC's role during the development of the Dimona nuclear site, but it regained responsibility for Israel's nuclear weapons program in 1966. The IAEC reports directly to the prime minister and operates similarly to the Mossad, with activities not defined by Israeli law. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) advises the government on nuclear policy and research. In 2007, the IAEC established a website with basic unclassified information on Israel's nuclear program. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert appointed Dr. Shaul Horev as the IAEC director general. The defense ministry reportedly plays a significant role in steering the program, controlling key aspects like budget and security. The IAEC is described as Israel's most secretive security organization. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) is the country's most secretive security organization, directing research at nuclear research centers in Nahal Sorek and the Negev. The Sorek center has a civilian research reactor under IAEA safeguards, while Dimona is off-limits to international inspectors and reportedly produces highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Plans were announced in 2012 to phase out the civilian reactor at Sorek by 2018 due to aging and fuel shortages. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission plans to phase out the civilian reactor at Sorek by 2018 due to aging. Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines prohibit exporting additional reactor fuel to Israel because it is not an NPT signatory. Israel will replace the reactor with a particle accelerator. Policy-making for North Korea's nuclear program is vested in the National Defense Council, led by Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un has supreme decision-making authority on nuclear policy. North Korea's Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry oversees various nuclear-related organizations and research centers, including the Yongbyon nuclear research center with 10 branches. Pyongyang also houses a nuclear energy institute. The South Korean government estimates that North Korea has around 20 nuclear facilities, including a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor, a plutonium reprocessing plant, a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant, and a light-water reactor. There are also uranium mining and milling facilities, storage for plutonium and possibly nuclear weapons, and clandestine uranium enrichment facilities. Approximately 3,000 people work in these facilities. The National Command Authority (NCA) oversees Pakistan's nuclear weapons research, development, and military operations. The Prime Minister chairs the NCA, which includes senior military and civilian officials. The NCA consists of two committees, with the Development Control Committee (DCC) exercising control over strategic organizations and research facilities related to nuclear weapons. The Strategic Plans Division (SPD) in Pakistan manages the country's strategic assets and oversees key organizations like the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and Dr. A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories. The Russian Federation follows a similar model with civilian government control over its nuclear infrastructure, inherited from the Soviet Union's nuclear program. The Russian Federation's Ministry for Atomic Energy (MinAtom) was restructured in 2004 to become the Federal Agency for Atomic Energy (FAAE), known as Rosatom. Under the leadership of Sergei Kiriyenko, Rosatom expanded nuclear power exports and international collaboration. A 2007 law consolidated civilian nuclear assets under Atomenergoprom, a joint stock company under Rosatom. Rosatom itself was converted into a government-owned corporation, the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation, with Kiriyenko accountable to the Prime Minister. Rosatom, accountable to the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, manages Atomenergoprom and is responsible for defense-related nuclear work, nuclear science, fuel cycle, and nuclear safety. Its Nuclear Weapons Complex branch oversees the development, testing, production, and dismantling of all nuclear weapons, with two divisions managing major Russian nuclear weapon design research institutes. Russia also maintains a test site at Novaya Zemlya. The Ministry of Defense oversees the storage and deployment of nuclear weapons in Russia. The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in the UK is responsible for designing, producing, and maintaining nuclear weapons. AWE sites are owned by the British government and controlled by the Ministry of Defence. The top official in charge is the Secretary of State for Defence, who has always been a civilian Member of Parliament. The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in the UK, overseen by the Ministry of Defense, was made a government-owned entity in 1993 and managed by a private consortium. A new 10-year contract was awarded to AWE Management Limited (AWE ML) in 2000, which took over AWE plc's operations. The MoD retains a \"golden share\" in AWE plc, and in 2008, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. acquired British Nuclear Fuels Limited's share of AWE ML. The majority of funding for AWE comes from the UK defense budget, managed by the Directorate Strategic Weapons of DE&S. AWE facilities are subject to strict licensing and safety regulations, regularly inspected by the Office for Nuclear Regulation. A cooperation agreement between the UK and France in 2010 commits to joint nuclear weapons R&D. The UK and France plan to collaborate on a new hydrodynamics research facility in Valduc, France, and a Technology Development Center at AWE Aldermaston. These joint facilities are set to be operational by 2015."
