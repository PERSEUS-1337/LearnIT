    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Counterfeiting Prevention Act of 1996\" and establishes an interagency task force on international counterfeiting of United States currency. The Act establishes an interagency task force to monitor the use of US currency abroad, estimate counterfeit currency production, and coordinate agency activities. The interagency task force established by the Act includes the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement, the Director of the United States Secret Service, the Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, other officers of the Department of the Treasury, and a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The interagency task force established by the Act includes various officials from the Federal Reserve System, the Department of State, and other agencies as determined by the Secretary of State. The interagency task force established by the Act may include representatives from other US agencies with the approval of their respective heads. The representatives will consist of the agency or department head, or their designee, along with other appropriate officers designated by the head of the agency or department. The Secretary of the Treasury serves as the chairperson of the task force, which is responsible for establishing an international evaluation audit plan to enable agencies to fulfill their duties regularly. The task force must submit a detailed summary of the audit plan to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment and conduct the first evaluation audit according to the plan. The task force, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, must begin the first evaluation audit within a year of the Act's enactment. Subsequent audits must be conducted every two years. Reports on the audit results must be submitted to the relevant Congressional committees within 90 days of completion. The task force, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, conducts evaluation audits every two years. Reports submitted to Congress include details on the audit process, currency samples examined, entities included, and quantities of US currency found at each audit site. The evaluation audits conducted every two years by the task force chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury include details on counterfeit US currency found at each audit site, analysis of counterfeit currency types, and classification of information submitted to Congress in unclassified form. The task force may submit a report with classified information in both classified and unclassified forms if deemed necessary. SEC. 3. Law enforcement and sentencing provisions for international counterfeiting of US currency. The Congress finds that US currency is being counterfeited outside the country, laws have been enacted to address this, but delays in posting agents overseas have hindered enforcement. Despite a maximum 20-year imprisonment for international counterfeiting, sentencing guidelines have not been updated by the US Sentencing Commission. The US Sentencing Commission failed to enhance punishment for counterfeiting US currency outside the country. The Secretary of State must consider requests for placing Secret Service agents in overseas embassies promptly and reach agreements with the Secretary of the Treasury by December 31, 1996. Cooperation from the Treasury is required for this initiative. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide requested information to the Secretary of State promptly. Both officials must submit reports by February 1, 1997, explaining any rejections or failures to fill approved posts. Enhanced penalties for international counterfeiting of US currency are under the authority of the US Sentencing Commission. The US Sentencing Commission must amend sentencing guidelines to enhance punishment for defendants convicted under section 470 of title 18 of the United States Code."
