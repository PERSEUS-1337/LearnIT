It funds Mission Assignments for federal assistance and serves as a reserve for future incidents and ongoing projects. The majority of federal disaster assistance is funded through the DRF. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is not used for every incident, but is released after the President declares an emergency or major disaster under the Stafford Act. Incidents not covered by the Stafford Act are handled by states, localities, or other federal entities like the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) with their own funding mechanisms. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is utilized for recovery projects after a natural disaster, funded through federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), and emergency disaster loans. The DRF has been in use for over four decades, originating from legislation post-World War II. Prior to this, disaster response was mainly funded locally or through voluntary groups. Presidential actions, such as emergency declarations and major disaster authorizations, provide federal assistance to states and localities from the DRF. Emergency declarations and major disaster declarations provide federal assistance to states and localities from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Emergency declarations aim to protect property and public health, while major disaster declarations offer broader support for recovery efforts after significant incidents. The federal declaration process is scalable, with emergency declarations issued before a threat materializes, and major disaster declarations responding to actual events. Local governments and communities are the first to respond to incidents, requesting assistance from higher levels of government if needed. The Stafford Act requires a formal request from the state governor to the President for federal assistance, triggering funding allocation from the Disaster Relief Fund for disaster aid categories like Individual Assistance. FEMA provides various types of assistance, including grants for needs not covered by insurance, public assistance for emergency measures like debris removal and structure repairs, and hazard mitigation to prevent future disasters. Assistance is determined based on authorized categories after a disaster declaration, and the Disaster Relief Fund also funds the Fire Management Assistance Grant program. The Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) program is funded by the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The President or FEMA can issue a FMAG declaration, authorizing federal assistance for fire control and mitigation on public or private land. FMAG declarations are less costly than emergency or major disaster declarations, with the most expensive year being 1998 at $105 million for 53 declarations. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded annually through regular appropriations, with a \"no-year\" account structure allowing funds to carry over to the next fiscal year. This flexibility enables unobligated balances to be used for future disasters and remains available during government shutdowns or funding lapses. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to disaster assistance needs, leading Congress to provide additional funding through supplemental appropriations. The need for funds is usually triggered by major disasters like Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy, but more recently, it has been tied to a series of incidents rather than a single event. Replenishing the DRF with supplemental appropriations has become common practice in the last decade, with Congress passing multiple additional appropriations in some fiscal years to meet disaster needs. Funding the DRF at a sufficient level has been a persistent challenge for Congress, historically attributed to previous decisions. Chronic shortfalls in the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) are mainly due to the decision not to budget for high-cost catastrophic disasters and the unpredictability of disaster events over time. Congressional debate revolves around how the DRF should be budgeted and whether the federal government is providing adequate assistance. The budgetary process for the DRF starts with the Administration's annual budget request. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) determines budget requests for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) based on available appropriation, monthly average costs of disasters, and estimated recoveries of unobligated funds. Available appropriation includes prior-year funds, current fiscal year appropriation, and supplemental appropriations. The DRF monthly average is calculated based on a five-year rolling average of \"normal\" disasters costing less than $500 million. The report discusses the calculation of monthly cost estimates for catastrophic events using estimates obtained from pending disaster projects. Estimated recoveries represent the recovery of obligated funds that have not been used, including duplication of benefit funds and unfinished long-term projects. The end-of-fiscal-year projection is revised monthly based on actual obligations recorded and new estimates for open projects. The average annual budget request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) from FY2000 to FY2011 was approximately $2 billion, with a spend-out rate of $350 million per month. Without additional resources, the DRF would have faced a budget shortfall. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) and the Budget Control Act (BCA) impose discretionary spending caps but allow adjustments for disaster relief and emergencies. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments for disaster relief and emergencies, with a new approach for accounting for disaster-related activity. FEMA categorizes funding requests for disaster relief into two categories: disaster relief cap adjustment and base/non-major disasters. Funding requested under the disaster relief cap adjustment is for major disasters declared pursuant to the Stafford Act and designated by Congress for disaster relief. The base/non-major disasters category includes Emergencies, Pre-disaster Surge Support, Fire Management Assistance Grants, and non-disaster specific activities like Disaster Readiness Support. FEMA's funding request for major disasters is based on past spending plans, while the non-catastrophic funding request uses a 10-year average for non-catastrophic events. This approach provides a more accurate projection of non-catastrophic needs. The 5-year average of costs provides a more accurate projection of non-catastrophic needs by normalizing outlier years. FEMA's new approach to disaster-related activity has led to higher budget requests for DRF funding. For FY2013, the Administration requested almost $6.1 billion for the DRF, with enactments reaching $7 billion. In FY2014, the request was nearly $6.2 billion, with enactments at $6.2 billion. The allowable adjustment has enabled historically high funding levels in recent years. The DRF has been funded at historically high levels in recent years without supplementals, but this mechanism will expire after FY2021. Congress has passed legislation for greater control over federal disaster assistance funding, including requirements for FEMA to publish status reports on the DRF and for audits and investigations related to disaster response activities. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (P.L. 109-295) requires FEMA to submit detailed monthly reports on allocations, obligations, and expenditures of funds from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The report includes information on DRF funding for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, national flood insurance claims, and funding by state for various assistance programs. Mission Assignment obligations by agency are also provided in the report, which has been reauthorized through various appropriations laws. The DRF report is valuable to policymakers for DRF Appropriations. The DRF report provides a detailed summary of funding allocations, commitments, and recoveries. It categorizes funding into \"Major Declarations\" and \"Base\" categories, showing annual and supplemental appropriations. Recoveries come from completed projects under budget, and sometimes funds are disbursed before insurance payments. This information is crucial for policymakers. FEMA implemented Immediate Needs Funding (INF) guidance to keep the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) solvent by diverting funds from long-term projects to focus on immediate response efforts. While FEMA has been successful in identifying recoveries in the past, recent improvements may impact future reliance on recoveries during INF implementation. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has been a topic of congressional interest due to funding appropriations, effectiveness of additional funding, and policy mechanisms for disaster assistance. There is ongoing debate about the federal role in providing disaster assistance, especially in light of the national debt. Critics argue that weaknesses in budget methodology have led to reliance on supplemental appropriations for major disasters. Critics argue that relying on supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance has drawbacks, including exceeding spending limits, circumventing budgetary enforcement mechanisms, and limiting time for assessing actual disaster needs and scrutinizing spending. Advocates of supplemental disaster assistance argue that unpredictable timing and severity of disasters necessitate a separate funding mechanism, as relying on regular appropriations may divert funds from other programs. They also point out that the President can unilaterally authorize federal assistance after a disaster, while Congress still retains control over federal spending. Supplemental appropriations for disasters allow Congress to express preferences in disaster assistance and address needs based on the actual incident. Proposals to reduce the need for supplemental appropriations include restructuring budgetary procedures. The need for supplemental appropriations for disasters may lead to unrelated provisions being included in a bill, potentially hindering the passage of necessary legislation. Increasing regular annual appropriations to the Disaster Relief Fund could reduce the need for supplemental funding. A \"rainy-day fund\" could be established through cuts in discretionary accounts or revenue-raising measures. A \"rainy-day fund\" could be established through cuts in discretionary accounts or revenue-raising measures. Proponents argue that it would not add to the federal deficit and would only be used for expensive disasters. Opponents claim it is infeasible due to the high costs of catastrophic events like Hurricane Katrina and Sandy. A contingency fund based on cost analysis of previous disasters could be created for use after a large disaster occurs. It would be funded at a level sufficient for large disasters, while routine disasters would still be funded through the DRF. Funds from the contingency fund would only be disbursed under certain conditions, such as a \"catastrophic declaration\" for events characterized by extraordinary devastation. A catastrophic declaration could be used for events like a nuclear bomb explosion, a tsunami in a populated area, or a destructive earthquake. The feasibility of a contingency fund for such incidents is questioned due to the significant funding needed. Large supplemental appropriations for disasters are usually uncontroversial due to sympathy for victims, but passing a large appropriation without a disaster is challenging, especially considering the federal deficit. Large-scale disasters are rare. The contingency fund for disasters may need adjustments for inflation and transfers if perceived as unused. Some propose offsetting supplemental funding to have no net cost. Recent debates focus on using offsets for disaster relief due to the budget deficit. Legislative attempts have been made to offset disaster assistance costs. Attempts have been made to offset the costs of disaster assistance by transferring funds from the Department of Energy to the DRF. This includes a proposed amendment to the Disaster Relief Appropriations bill. In the 113th Congress, a proposed amendment aimed to offset $17 billion in emergency funding for Hurricane Sandy victims by making a 1.63% across-the-board rescission to all discretionary appropriations for FY2013. Proponents argue offsets control spending, while opponents claim they politicize disaster assistance and slow delivery of needed aid. One argument against relying solely on offsets to limit federal spending on disaster assistance is that it may not address the increasing number of declarations issued each year, leading to higher total costs. Critics suggest that the large size of offsets needed for major disasters, like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, could negatively impact other parts of the federal budget. Restructuring the budgetary process or using policy mechanisms may reduce the need for supplemental funding for disaster costs. Many propose policy changes to decrease federal disaster assistance funding by reforming the declaration process, adjusting federal share, and shifting responsibility to states or the private sector. Despite concerns over costs, providing aid to disaster victims is seen as crucial for national budget impact. Assistance is deemed necessary for immediate and long-term needs, aiding in economic recovery post-disaster. Some suggest limiting the number of disaster declarations to save costs. One option is to prevent marginal incidents from triggering federal assistance, such as questioning if snowstorms or ice storms exceed the state's response capacity. Changing definitions in the Stafford Act could help eliminate marginal incidents. Some argue for changing definitions in the Stafford Act to limit the number of disaster declarations and prevent marginal incidents from triggering federal assistance. This could involve altering the criteria used by FEMA to determine if a major disaster is warranted, potentially enhancing presidential declaration authority. One potential method to reduce the number of major disasters declared is to increase the per capita amount used by FEMA for recommendations to the President. The current per capita amount is $1.32, and if damages exceed this amount per person in a state, FEMA recommends a major disaster declaration. Increasing this amount could decrease the number of incidents eligible for federal assistance. The DHS Inspector General report in May 2012 highlighted that FEMA had been using a $1 per capita damage amount since 1986 to recommend federal assistance for disasters. Adjusting for inflation only began in 1999, and if done earlier, 36% fewer disasters would have qualified for assistance. The public announcement of declaration factors only became available in 1999, prior to which it was kept confidential within the executive branch. FEMA did not widely disclose its use of a per capita damage amount since 1986 for disaster assistance recommendations. The Government Accountability Office recommended developing more specific criteria for assessing state capabilities in responding to disasters. The Government Accountability Office recommended using a more sensitive measure, Total Taxable Resources (TTR), to assess state funding capacity for disaster response. TTR includes various resources subject to state taxation, providing a more comprehensive indicator of state capacity. This measure is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states in certain grant programs. Adjustments for TTR are also considered in FEMA's Public Assistance program for setting disaster thresholds. The use of Total Taxable Resources (TTR) in assessing state funding capacity for disaster response is recommended by the Government Accountability Office. TTR is considered in FEMA's Public Assistance program for disaster thresholds, and advocates argue it could improve accuracy and reduce federal costs by denying assistance for marginal incidents. The proposal suggests using an expert panel to review gubernatorial requests for major disaster declarations. The panel would assess the severity of the incident and make recommendations to the President on federal assistance. Some argue it would bring objectivity, while others fear it may slow down the process and infringe on the President's authority. One method to reduce federal disaster assistance costs is to convert assistance into low-interest recovery loans instead of grants, giving states the option to handle incidents without federal aid. Another option is to expand FEMA's Community Disaster Loan program. Expanding FEMA's Community Disaster Loan program to include loans for disaster recovery could provide federal assistance to local governments facing revenue loss after disasters. Repealing Section 320 of the Stafford Act might make disaster declarations less discretionary and more predictable by allowing formulas to establish thresholds for states to qualify for assistance. Section 404 of the Stafford Act could be amended to tie mitigation assistance to state codes, incentivizing mitigation work and potentially reducing damages. This amendment may lead to a higher federal contribution for states meeting certain standards. Additionally, other amendments could limit the number of disaster declarations or the amount of assistance provided. The Stafford Act could be amended to limit the number of disaster declarations or the amount of federal assistance provided to states. This could include requiring states to have specific programs in place to receive federal assistance, such as Public Assistance, Individual Assistance, and housing assistance. Another amendment could discontinue federal assistance for snow removal unless directed by Congress, with states and localities having five years to adjust their budgets. Currently, the federal government covers 75% of disaster costs under the Stafford Act. The federal government currently covers 75% of disaster costs, with the possibility of increasing the share based on damage thresholds. Efforts may be made to reduce costs by shifting more responsibility to state and local governments. Adjusting cost-shares could potentially decrease federal funding for major disasters. If the federal share for disaster assistance was reduced by 10% or 25%, federal assistance would be reduced by $21.5 billion or $53.9 billion respectively. Savings from reducing federal share for major disasters could be significant, with no statutory limit on the number of people helped or federal funds expended on repairs. The federal government provides open-ended commitment for disaster-related damage to eligible facilities, with a 25% state share. Some suggest increasing the state share or making cost-share arrangement not subject to administrative adjustment. Adjusting federal cost-share could reduce disaster costs but may burden states and localities. For example, Arizona faced a $1.4 million matching requirement for the Wallow Fire in 2010. The federal government may provide assistance for emergency declarations through loans. States affected by disasters could receive low-interest or no-interest loans through the CDL program. States that implement preparedness measures may qualify for a larger federal share or lower interest rates for disaster recovery loans. The Government Accountability Office recommended improving transparency in FEMA's reports on hurricane relief. The OMB and FEMA agreed on the need for transparency and accountability in hurricane-related funding. Congress could authorize oversight mechanisms to ensure improvements are made, as proposed in H.R. 5351 in the 109th Congress. This legislation would require reporting on federal assistance funds received by states, local, tribal, and non-profit entities, as well as reporting by agencies on the purpose, amounts disbursed, and status of resources provided. Since the 1950s, federal financial assistance for disaster relief to states has increased steadily, raising questions about equitable funding. The model for emergency response is based on local government handling incidents unless overwhelmed, leading to debates on whether some federally funded incidents meet this criterion. The debate surrounds whether federal disaster relief should be subject to thresholds and maximums, with considerations for states' fiscal capability. In 1986, FEMA proposed measures to reduce its contributions towards disaster relief by allocating funds based on each state's ability to fund its own recovery efforts. Federal disaster relief allocations should be based on each state's ability to fund its own relief efforts, determined by comparing per capita income to the national average. This would create a sliding scale for assistance, with struggling communities eligible for more federal aid. Some argue that current federal funding for disaster relief may discourage states from adequately preparing for emergencies. Advocates argue for changes in disaster relief funding to be fiscally responsible, while others believe federal government should support states in times of crisis. Concerns arise about perception of unused funds leading to potential transfers to other assistance programs. Advocates debate potential transfer of unobligated disaster relief funds to other programs not authorized by Stafford Act, raising questions about funding drought and fire assistance. Congressional debate on disaster relief funding past and future may lead to these concerns."
