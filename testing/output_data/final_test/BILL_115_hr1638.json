    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act\". The Congress finds that Iran has high levels of corruption, with the IRGC involved in the economy. Senior leaders have gained wealth through their positions, and sanctions relief has removed corrupt entities from the US sanctions list. The Treasury designated Iran's financial sector as a jurisdiction in 2011. The USA PATRIOT Act has identified the entire Iranian financial sector, including Iran's Central Bank and private banks, as posing money laundering risks. Iran is listed by the FATF as a non-cooperative country in the fight against terror finance and money laundering, along with North Korea. Iran is ranked 130th out of 168 countries in the Transparency International index of public corruption. The State Department has identified Iran as a major money-laundering country and a state sponsor of terrorism, supporting terrorist groups worldwide through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. Iran, Hizballah, and other Shia militia groups support the Asad regime in Syria, prolonging the civil war and worsening the human rights crisis. The Iranian Government's tolerance of corruption and nepotism hinders foreign and domestic investment, with the IRGC and bonyads controlling a significant portion of Iran's economy. The IRGC and bonyads control major economic sectors in Iran, providing funds for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, further disadvantaging the average Iranian. SEC. 3.
