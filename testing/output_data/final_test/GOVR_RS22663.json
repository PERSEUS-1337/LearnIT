    "content": "U.S. foreign assistance in China focuses on promoting human rights, democratic norms, rule of law, public health, sustainable development, and Tibetan culture. Assistance programs align with U.S. human rights policy, including dialogue, diplomacy, and reporting. Economic growth and poverty reduction are not primary objectives, except for some Tibetan and infectious disease programs. USAID is not heavily involved in assistance efforts in China. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) does not have an aid mission in China and administers PRC programs through its regional mission in Bangkok, Thailand. The Department of State refers to China as a development partner with the resources to invest in its own future. Between 2001 and 2015, the United States government allocated over $417 million for foreign operations or aid programs in China, with a focus on democracy, human rights, the rule of law, Tibetan communities, and the environment. Program areas supported by U.S. assistance include civil liberties, governmental transparency, legal training, capacity building of NGOs, criminal justice reform, labor rights, private sector competitiveness, job skills training, and support to traditional artisans. The State Department and USAID have provided grants for various programs in China, including job skills training, support for traditional artisans in Tibetan areas, and HIV/AIDS prevention. Most grants have gone to U.S.-based NGOs and universities, with some involvement from Chinese entities. Concerns exist about Chinese restrictions on civil society impacting U.S. aid programs due to increased monitoring of Chinese NGOs receiving foreign support. Draft regulations on the management of foreign NGOs in China impose greater limitations and controls on their activities, funding, and staffing. Experts fear these laws will give public security authorities more arbitrary power, hindering the development of Chinese civil society. In 2015, U.S. Senators expressed concerns about human rights in China, emphasizing the importance of protecting civil society. Funding for programs in China has decreased since FY2010. Funding for programs in China has decreased since FY2010, with Congress reducing funding for various law and environmental programs. Multilateral and bilateral official development assistance to China has also declined, with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Denmark being the largest bilateral aid donors in 2013. Japan, once a major provider of loan assistance, has reduced its aid to China. In 2013, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States provided ODA grants to China. The United States was the largest supporter of \"government and civil society\" sector activities, followed by Germany. Some donors have reduced assistance to China due to its ability to self-finance and provide aid to other countries. In 2011, the UK, Australia, and the EU announced plans to phase out aid programs in China. The EU funded projects in China worth \u20ac224 million from 2007-2013, focusing on various areas such as democracy, health, and education. China has transitioned from an aid recipient to a strategic partner, providing aid to other developing countries. The EU has ongoing aid efforts in China worth \u20ac15 million, focusing on activities like combating HIV/AIDS, empowering young migrant populations, and supporting sustainable development in Tibet. Other U.S. agencies like the Department of Energy and Department of Health and Human Services also supported major activities in China in 2013-2014. In China, various U.S. agencies and organizations, such as DOE, TDA, HHS, DOI, EPA, and NED, support programs focused on nuclear security, export promotion, infectious disease control, endangered species protection, air pollution, democracy, human rights, rule of law, civil society, and environmental conservation. The Ford Foundation also contributes to these efforts independently. The Ford Foundation, without U.S. government support, provides significant assistance to China in civil society and governance. Grants totaling over $350 million have been given since 1988, with $18 million allocated for 87 programs from 2012-2015. Activities focus on promoting civil society, accountable government, justice system reform, education access, community involvement in policy, and awareness in sexuality and health. Programs include research, courses, legal aid, and training for NGO leaders and villagers. Oxfam Hong Kong has been involved in poverty alleviation, HIV/AIDS prevention, disaster relief, and civil society development in mainland China since 1987. In 2013, the organization spent $14.2 million on programs related to labor conditions, education for migrant children, violence against women, and environmental protection. Some observers believe that U.S. assistance in promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in China has not led to significant changes due to the Chinese Communist Party's resistance to foreign-funded efforts. Some experts argue that the Chinese Communist Party's rejection of institutional checks on state power hinders reform efforts in China. They point to obstacles such as lack of judicial autonomy, restrictions on lawyers, weak law enforcement, and curbs on civil liberties. Human rights activists suggest that U.S. stakeholders may avoid supporting tougher approaches towards China's human rights abuses to protect their interests. They recommend focusing U.S. assistance on changing China's understanding of the rule of law. Other experts believe U.S.-funded programs in China have strengthened rights protections, promoted good governance, and built foundations for civil society. Efforts by the United States government and organizations like the Dui Hua Foundation have contributed to progress in criminal justice reform in China. U.S. programs have helped promote access to legal counsel, professionalism among judicial personnel, and awareness of legal rights in Chinese society. Some Members of Congress have proposed limiting U.S. assistance in China, except for aid to Tibetans and specific human rights programs. During the 112th Congress, some Members debated U.S. assistance to China, questioning its necessity due to China's trade surplus and human rights issues. Proponents argued that U.S. programs benefit American interests and fill gaps where China lacks capacity. Opposition arose against U.S. environmental programs in China, with concerns about bolstering China's economy and technology transfer. Some U.S. officials defended environmental programs in China, citing the impact of Chinese air pollution on North America. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China monitors human rights and submits policy recommendations. The CECC's 2015 report advocates U.S. engagement in various areas, including those where U.S. assistance programs are active. The CECC's 2015 report recommends U.S. government support for programs in China focusing on legal aid, citizens' rights, criminal justice reform, workers' rights, and environmental policies. It also suggests promoting democracy and rule of law programs tailored to China and fostering partnerships between U.S. and Chinese academic institutions and NGOs. Congress influences foreign assistance policies for China through initiating programs and inserting special provisions in appropriations. In 1999, Congress approved funding to foster democracy in China and in 2000, authorized programs to promote the rule of law and civil society in the PRC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $1 million for NGOs outside China to support activities in Tibetan areas. In 2002, Congress allocated $10 million from the Economic Support Fund for China. In 2002, Congress allocated $10 million from the Economic Support Fund for activities supporting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in China, including $3 million for Tibet. In 2006, special funds were set aside for American universities to engage in education programs related to democracy, the rule of law, and the environment in China. HIV/AIDS programs were implemented in the PRC in 2007, and criminal justice programs expanded in 2009. U.S. laws like Sections 116 and 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 can be used to deny foreign assistance on human rights grounds. Legislation may impose restrictions on U.S. representatives supporting projects in Tibet to prevent the erosion of Tibetan culture. U.S. contributions to UNFPA cannot be used for programs in China. The Department of State's DRL administers programs in China to promote rule of law and government transparency. Funding levels for DRL's efforts in China are determined by Congress. The State Department's DRL administers programs in China to promote rule of law and government transparency. Funding for these projects complements U.S. policy of engagement and focuses on areas where Chinese government support is unlikely. DRL funds U.S.-based and international organizations to engage with various Chinese entities, including NGOs, women's groups, universities, and legal institutions. Grant recipients are not openly disclosed due to political sensitivities in China. Major program areas include strengthening legal and judicial institutions, promoting independence, training professionals, and increasing public access to the justice system. Since 2000, Congress has provided Economic Support Funds (ESF) for sustainable development, environmental conservation, and cultural preservation in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Tibetan communities in China, with a focus on promoting civil society, citizen participation, labor rights, good governance, and civil liberties. This includes support for legal and judicial professionals, NGO capacity building, public dialogue on policy formation, labor law advocacy, government transparency, freedom of expression, and media development. Nearly half of China's ethnic Tibetans reside in the TAR. The US provides assistance to Tibetan communities in China, including the TAR and other Tibetan areas in provinces like Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Programs focus on citizen involvement in economic enterprises, development planning, and social services, as well as increasing Tibetans' capacity to compete in the formal economy. Despite restrictions, US-funded programs have continued, with approximately $70 million allocated between 2002 and 2015. This includes support for health, education, refugee, and scholarship programs for Tibetan exile communities in India and Nepal. The National Endowment for Democracy supports programs in Tibetan areas through congressional appropriations. Funding for U.S. assistance in China has decreased, but assistance for Tibetan programs has increased. Assistance is allocated to NGOs and projects that do not promote migration or land ownership transfer. USAID activities aim to strengthen Tibetan communities and support sustainable livelihoods. USAID programs in Tibetan areas focus on cultural preservation, education, and community development. This includes support for small enterprises, vocational training, scholarships, health awareness programs, and Tibetan language instruction. Additionally, efforts are made to involve women in community activities and protect the environment through conservation initiatives. USAID programs in Tibetan areas focus on conservation, sustainable resource management, and renewable energy development. Efforts include improving rangeland management, reducing deforestation, protecting wetlands, and addressing climate change impacts. The primary implementing partners in the Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan communities are the Bridge Fund, Winrock International, and the Poverty Alleviation Fund. International NGOs in Tibetan areas have faced challenges due to government crackdowns, leading to a decline in their numbers. The Bridge Fund has been active in the TAR and Tibetan communities since 1996. The Bridge Fund, Winrock International, and the Poverty Alleviation Fund have implemented programs in Tibetan communities since the 1990s. These programs focus on preserving cultural heritage, promoting sustainable economic development, and environmental conservation through activities such as job skills training, income-generating projects, and digital technology for cultural preservation. The Poverty Alleviation Fund has also worked on microfinance and promoting local handicrafts in Tibetan communities in Yunnan Province. Since 2007, the United States government has collaborated with U.S. NGOs to address HIV/AIDS in high-incidence regions in China, focusing on prevention, care, treatment programs, and support for orphans and vulnerable children. Assistance has also been provided to Chinese NGOs, community-based groups, government-sponsored organizations, health bureaus, and clinics. USAID has worked with the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but has not provided direct assistance. Since 2002, U.S. public health efforts in China have included responses to outbreaks of influenza strains like avian flu H7N9. The International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account funding has supported a Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to promote criminal justice reform in China by engaging with Chinese courts, prosecutors, legal scholars, and bar associations on issues like pre-trial detention and judicial independence. The State Department reported that the Chinese government has implemented some reforms in rule of law and environmental efforts. Congress allocated funds for programs to enhance legal training, citizen awareness of the legal system, and strengthen laws safeguarding civil and women's rights in China. USAID's criminal justice efforts focused on making trial procedures more open and supporting the adoption of a national law to exclude illegally obtained evidence. Administrative law programs promoted transparency and public participation in government. During the same period, USAID administered environmental programs in China, including legal clinics, public defenders' offices, and training for judicial officials on consumer protection and intellectual property. The U.S.-China Partnership for Environmental Law and other initiatives promoted environmental law reform, capacity building, energy efficiency, and low greenhouse gas emissions in factories and power plants. These programs received support from USAID, U.S. private corporations, research institutions, and Chinese communities and government. USAID provided a grant to the Thailand-based Freeland Foundation for countering wildlife trafficking in China and Asia. Other USAID environmental efforts in China included clean energy investment, energy efficiency in buildings, water projects, and combating illegal logging. Congress phased out Development Assistance for rule of law programs in China in 2012, but some programs continued through the ESF account with decreased funding. Economic Support Funds in FY2015 supported programs promoting... In FY2015, Economic Support Funds ($1 million) and environmental programs using ESF funds ($2.5 million) supported activities promoting human rights, rule of law, civil society development, and environmental initiatives in China. Congress allocated $15 million in ESF for democracy, rule of law, civil society, and environmental programs in China for FY2016. The US government has been promoting global Internet freedom, especially in China and Iran, for over a decade. The US government has been promoting global Internet freedom in China and Iran. Between 2008 and 2014, Congress allocated approximately $95 million for State Department and USAID efforts in this area.
