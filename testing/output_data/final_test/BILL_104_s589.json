    "content": "The Act titled \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1995\" amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act by adding a new section on interstate transportation of municipal waste. The Act \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1995\" allows Governors to restrict out-of-state municipal waste disposal in landfills or incinerators upon request by affected local governments. Prior to making a request, the local government must provide notice, allow public comment, and take formal action at a public meeting. Governors can also restrict waste disposal without a request starting from 1995 for certain landfills. The Act allows Governors to restrict out-of-state municipal waste disposal in landfills based on quantities received in 1993 or 1994. Landfills with over 50,000 tons of out-of-state waste in 1993 are prohibited from disposing a certain quantity annually. The Act allows Governors to restrict out-of-state municipal waste disposal in landfills based on quantities received in 1993 or 1994. Beginning in 1997, Governors can further limit out-of-state waste disposal by reducing the 30 percent annual quantity if requested by affected local governments. The Act allows Governors to restrict out-of-state waste disposal by reducing the annual quantity limitation to 20% in 1998 and 1999, and 10% in subsequent years. States can ban imports from large exporting States if reduction targets are not met, with specific ton limits for each calendar year from 1996 to 2002. The Act allows Governors to restrict out-of-state waste disposal by reducing the annual quantity limitation. Any limitation imposed by the Governor must be applicable throughout the State, not discriminate against any landfill, and not discriminate against out-of-State waste based on origin. Governors must respond to requests without discrimination and submit information to the Administrator within 120 days. The Act allows Governors to restrict out-of-state waste disposal by reducing the annual quantity limitation. Governors must submit information to the Administrator documenting the quantity of out-of-State municipal waste received for disposal in their state during specific years. The Administrator will then determine the quantity of out-of-State waste received at each landfill and provide notice to the Governors. The Administrator's decision on out-of-State waste disposal is final and not subject to judicial review. Exceptions to the authority to prohibit out-of-State municipal waste include landfills that received documented shipments of out-of-State waste in 1993. Proposed landfills and incinerators must comply with State laws regarding waste disposal. Landfills must have received authorization and a construction permit before 1993, while incinerators must have been in operation in 1993. Proposed landfills and incinerators must comply with State laws and regulations. States can deny permits for new facilities if they have an approved solid waste management plan. Proposed landfills and incinerators must comply with State laws and regulations. States can deny permits for new facilities based on the determination that there is no local or regional need for the landfill or incinerator. Denial of a permit is not considered an undue burden on interstate commerce.
