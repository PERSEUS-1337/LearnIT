    "content": "The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a $500-per-child nonrefundable tax credit to help families with children. Legislative changes since 2001 have increased the credit amount and made it partially refundable, benefiting low-income families. Subsequent acts made these changes permanent. The goal of the report is to analyze the economic impact of the child tax credit. The child tax credit, created in 1997, has evolved to provide up to $1,000 per child. Low-income families may receive a refundable credit, based on earnings above $3,000. This report analyzes the economic impact and distribution of the credit, focusing on equity and taxpayer behavior. The child tax credit provides a refund equal to 15% of a taxpayer's earnings above $3,000, up to the maximum credit for the family. The credit is phased out for higher-income taxpayers, reduced by $50 for every $1,000 a family's AGI exceeds specific thresholds. The credit is not indexed for inflation and can offset AMT liability. Roughly half of the credit benefits go to taxpayers with incomes under $40,000. The child tax credit provides significant benefits to both low-income and middle-income families, with roughly equal proportions going to taxpayers with AGI between $10,000 and $20,000 and those with AGI between $50,000 and $75,000. Taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 are generally ineligible for the credit due to phase-out thresholds. The credit was expanded to lower-income Americans by EGTRRA and ARRA, making it available to those with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000. Prior to these changes, the credit was mainly for middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The child tax credit benefits low-income and middle-income families, but those with incomes under $10,000 receive little to no benefit. Taxpayers with very low income do not benefit from the credit because they have no income tax liability, making the credit nonrefundable to them. Making tax credits refundable would allow taxpayers with little or no tax liability to benefit from the child tax credit. The child tax credit is refundable for taxpayers with earnings above $3,000, calculated as 15 cents for every dollar above this threshold. Low-income individuals may not claim the full credit due to their income level. Economists evaluate tax policy like the child tax credit based on equity, or fairness. The child tax credit is evaluated based on equity, efficiency, and administration. Economists use these lenses to analyze the provision, considering vertical and horizontal equity. The child tax credit is evaluated based on vertical and horizontal equity. Economists also consider its efficiency in affecting taxpayer behavior and its administration. The child tax credit is analyzed for its impact on tax code complexity, equity, taxpayer behavior, and administration. It has made the tax code more complicated for lower-income taxpayers. The credit may or may not be considered equitable, as the federal income tax is progressive. The child tax credit is considered vertically equitable as it reduces the tax burden for families earning between $3,000 and $150,000. It lowers the average federal tax rate for taxpayers with income under $200,000, especially benefiting lower-income taxpayers more than higher-income ones. The child tax credit's impact on horizontal equity depends on whether equal circumstances mean equal income or equal spending choices. Some economists argue that families with the same financial resources should pay the same taxes, regardless of how they use their income. If children are seen as discretionary expenses, the credit could violate horizontal equity. The child tax credit provides greater benefits as the number of children increases, potentially violating horizontal equity. Families with more children pay less tax under the \"ability to pay\" approach. According to the \"ability to pay\" approach, the child tax credit does not generally violate horizontal equity. Congress justified the structure of the child tax credit in 1997 based on this interpretation. The creation of the child tax credit aimed to reduce tax liability for families with dependent children, recognize their financial responsibilities, and promote family values. Policymakers may want to evaluate child tax benefits like the child tax credit alongside other tax policies. The child tax credit may not be horizontally equitable at low incomes, but increasing refundability could help. However, overall child tax benefits disproportionately favor larger families at lower income levels. Expanding refundability could worsen horizontal inequities. Economists also analyze tax provisions in terms of their impact on goods production or consumption. The child tax credit subsidizes low-wage work and children, but there is limited research on its impact. The current refundability structure creates a wage subsidy for low-income families, potentially affecting work decisions. Economic theory suggests it may encourage more work among low-income workers. The child tax credit may not significantly influence families to have more children due to the high cost of raising a child. The credit reduces the cost of a child, but expenses far exceed its value for most taxpayers. Families decide to have children based on various factors beyond economics, such as happiness and fulfillment. In a 2010 report to Congress, the IRS Taxpayer Advocate highlighted the complexity of the current tax code as a major issue for taxpayers. Tax policies, especially those for families with children, add to this complexity. For instance, a single parent with a 16-year-old child and $20,000 income in 2010 can receive a child tax credit of $1,000, a dependent exemption of $3,650 (reducing tax liability by $548), and $2,487 of EITC. In 2011, the parent loses the child tax credit but retains the dependent exemption ($3,700 in 2011, reducing tax by $555) and around $2,598 of EITC. These benefits change with marriage, additional children, or income fluctuations. Tax complexity related to child tax provisions burdens lower-income families, reducing utilization rates and benefits. Policymakers could modify the child tax credit parameters to benefit different income groups. For middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers, increasing the credit amount and phase-out thresholds would be beneficial. Lower-income taxpayers could benefit from reducing the refundability threshold or increasing the refundability rate. Increasing the maximum amount of the child tax credit per child could benefit families, especially those with income below phase-out limits. However, for lower-income families, the value of increasing the credit may depend on their ability to claim it as a refund using the earned income formula. If their earnings are too low, they may not benefit from an increase in the credit amount. For example, doubling the child tax credit to $2,000 per child could have varying impacts on different income groups. If the maximum child tax credit value doubled, a family with two children would need earnings of at least $29,667 to claim the full credit, compared to the current requirement of $16,333. Indexing the credit to inflation could increase its value. However, this may not benefit lower-income taxpayers whose earnings grow more slowly than inflation. Refundability is crucial for lower-income taxpayers, as their tax liability may be less than the value of the child tax credit. The child tax credit's refundability parameters are crucial for lower-income families. Lowering the refundability threshold and increasing the refundability rate would make more low-earning families eligible for a larger credit. Economic modeling shows that reducing the refundability threshold to zero would benefit taxpayers with cash income levels below $30,000, with nearly half of the benefit going to those below $10,000. Increasing the child tax credit's refundability rate would benefit low-income households by allowing them to receive a larger refundable credit, but it would not help those with earnings below the refundability threshold. Economic modeling suggests that a 40% refundability rate could result in 94% of the tax benefits going to eligible households. Changing the refundable portion of the child tax credit, such as adjusting the refundability threshold or rate, would primarily impact lower-income families. Approximately 80% of the benefit from these changes would go to families earning less than $20,000. In 1997, the child tax credit phase-out thresholds for higher-income taxpayers were set at $110,000 for married couples filing jointly and $75,000 for head of household filers. These thresholds have not been adjusted for inflation, leading to a decrease in their real value over time. One policy option is to increase the phase-out limits or index them to inflation like other elements of the tax system. This would prevent more taxpayers from being pushed into the phase-out range and reduce the child tax credit amount they are eligible for. Increasing the AGI phase-out limits for the child tax credit would expand eligibility for more taxpayers, especially those in high-cost living areas. Critics question the necessity of this relief, but empirical evidence shows a decrease in federal tax burden for households with children. Legislation since 2007 has further reduced taxes for many Americans. Tax benefits, including the Making Work Pay tax credit, payroll tax reduction, and extension of EGTRRA's income tax provisions, play a significant role in federal benefits for families with children. Studies show that tax provisions like the child tax credit, EITC, and dependent exemption are among the top programs benefiting children. The EITC and child tax credit's refundable portions target low-income families, reflecting Congress's focus on providing financial assistance through the tax code. Some experts believe that the eligibility rules for child-related tax benefits create complexity for taxpayers, leading to financial costs. President Bush's 2005 Panel on Federal Tax Reform highlighted the difficulty in claiming the child tax credit, requiring multiple calculations and forms. The differing age limits for eligible children in child-related tax benefits create complexity and budgetary costs. Expanding the child tax credit to 17- and 18-year-olds could reduce revenues by $6.1 billion. The tax benefits are structured differently, leading to middle-income families receiving smaller benefits than higher-income taxpayers. President Bush's 2005 Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended simplifying the tax system. President Bush's 2005 Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended simplifying the tax code by consolidating standard deduction, personal exemption, and child tax credit into a family tax credit. Experts have proposed combining child tax benefits into a uniform child credit to simplify eligibility rules and benefit calculation. Policymakers need to consider the competing functions of current tax benefits, such as the EITC and refundable portion of the child tax credit, before creating a uniform benefit. The nonrefundable portion of the child tax credit provides a uniform benefit per child for taxpayers with sufficient earnings that do not exceed the phase-out level. Recent changes to the child tax credit made by the EGTRRA and ARRA are now permanent. Policymakers interested in modifying the child tax credit in the future should understand the economic impact of these past legislative changes. The ARRA modifications provided more benefit to lower-income taxpayers, while the EGTRRA changes benefited more children. Extending the ARRA modifications will affect the number of children and budgetary costs, compared to the EGTRRA changes. EGTRRA increased the child tax credit to $1,000 per child and made it partially refundable, while ARRA further expanded refundability by lowering the earnings threshold. The PATH Act made the $3,000 threshold permanent. The PATH Act (Division Q of P.L. 114-113) made the $3,000 threshold permanent for the child tax credit. Distributional impact analysis shows that under EGTRRA, 60% of benefits went to taxpayers with income above $50,000, while under ARRA, 70.5% went to those with income below $20,000. Research indicates that after EGTRRA, Hispanic and African American households were less likely to receive the full credit compared to white households. Estimates show that a significant percentage of African American and Hispanic households with qualifying children were ineligible for the full child tax credit due to low incomes, compared to white households. Data from 2013 indicates the number of children benefiting from the EGTRRA and ARRA changes, highlighting the distributional impact on tax filers. The EGTRRA and ARRA changes to the child tax credit have a significant impact on millions of children. In 2013, 18.6 million children became eligible for the credit due to EGTRRA, with 3.4 million receiving a larger credit. The ARRA extension benefited 17.1 million children, with 10.2 million receiving a larger credit. The cost of extending EGTRRA and ARRA modifications to the child tax credit is significant. Historical data shows that the majority of the cost is due to the EGTRRA provisions, with 78% of the total cost associated with extending EGTRRA provisions. The cost of extending EGTRRA child tax credit provisions for two years is $71.7 billion over 10 years, while the cost of extending ARRA provisions is $19.7 billion over the same period. Approximately 60% of the total annual cost of the child tax credit in 2012 was due to the EGTRRA changes. In 2012, the annual cost of the child tax credit was mainly due to EGTRRA changes (60%), ARRA modification (16%), and underlying parameters (24%)."
