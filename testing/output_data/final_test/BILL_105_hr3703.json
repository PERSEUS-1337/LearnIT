Congress established the Adams Mansion National Historic Site in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1946 under the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act. The site was later enlarged and renamed the Adams National Historic Site in 1952. In 1972, the boundaries were expanded by 3.68 acres through Public Law 92-272. In 1978, the National Parks and Recreation Act authorized the Secretary to accept the conveyance of the birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams in Quincy, Massachusetts. In 1980, Public Law 96-435 allowed the Secretary to accept the conveyance of the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts, the burial site of John Adams, Abigail Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Louisa Adams. The birthplaces, burial site, and property of John Adams, Abigail Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Louisa Adams have been preserved without specific legislation, resulting in a multi-site unit of the National Park System.
