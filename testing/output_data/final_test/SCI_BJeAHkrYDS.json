    "content": "Successor features and rewarding policies for distinguishable behaviors in a Markov decision process can be limited in generalization. A new algorithm, Variational Intrinsic Successor FeatuRes (VISR), combines these techniques to enhance generalization and fast task inference in the Atari suite. VISR is validated on the full Atari suite, achieving human-level performance on 12 games and surpassing all baselines. Unsupervised learning has been crucial in the advancement of deep learning, with neural decoders enabling the training of large-scale generative models. In unsupervised learning, representations can improve sample efficiency in supervised learning. In reinforcement learning, intrinsic motivation is studied for improved exploration beyond extrinsic rewards. Unsupervised learning in reinforcement exploration involves acquiring useful state representations and behavioral skills without extrinsic rewards. This approach emulates scenarios where interaction with the environment is inexpensive, allowing for data-efficient adaptation. The current state-of-the-art for RL with unsupervised pre-training focuses on maximizing mutual information between latent variable policies and state visitation. This approach aims to achieve diverse behavior and adaptability to downstream RL tasks. However, existing methods like variational intrinsic control (VIC) and diversity is all you need (DIAYN) suffer from poor generalization and slow inference processes. The current state-of-the-art for RL with unsupervised pre-training focuses on maximizing mutual information between latent variable policies and state visitation. However, existing methods like variational intrinsic control (VIC) and diversity is all you need (DIAYN) suffer from poor generalization and slow inference processes when the reward signal is introduced. Our main contribution addresses this by utilizing successor features (SF) for fast transfer learning between tasks with different reward functions. The construction of reward function features was a research problem. Behavioral mutual information (BMI) maximization offers a solution to this feature learning problem. The algorithm VISR, based on BMI, improves RL performance with unsupervised pre-training. VISR achieves human-level performance on 12 games and outperforms all baselines. The curr_chunk discusses algorithms operating in different regimes within a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. It defines an MDP as a tuple with state and action spaces, transition probabilities, a discount factor, and a reward function. The interaction between the agent and the environment is split into an initial unsupervised phase and a reinforcement learning phase. The agent aims to find a policy that maximizes expected return in the reinforcement learning phase of a Markov decision process. Dynamic programming methods, like value functions, are used to compute a policy that improves over time. Policy evaluation and policy improvement are key steps in many reinforcement learning algorithms to converge towards an optimal policy. In reinforcement learning, policy evaluation and improvement are crucial steps in algorithms to find an optimal policy. The agent incurs a cost during learning, but is free to interact with the environment in the unsupervised phase to gather information. The goal is to speed up the learning process by collecting data about the environment. In reinforcement learning, the goal is to collect information about the environment to speed up the learning process. The reward function can be written as a task vector with weights specifying the desirability of features. Successor features (SFs) decompose the value of a policy, acting as multidimensional value functions computed using standard RL methods. Successor features (SFs) in reinforcement learning act as rewards and can be computed using standard RL algorithms. SFs allow for quick evaluation of a policy \u03c0 by computing Q \u03c0 through regression. By extending this strategy to multiple policies using a policy-encoding mapping, it is possible to improve upon policies that are agnostic to rewards. The universal successor features (USFs) defined by Borsa et al. (2019) can evaluate any policy \u03c0 by computing Q \u03c0. Generalized policy improvement (GPI) allows for leveraging multiple policies to improve solutions. USFs can be approximated by a universal successor feature approximator (USFA) \u03c8 \u03b8, enabling data-efficient reinforcement learning. In unsupervised pre-training, the agent learns a USFA \u03c8 \u03b8 before using rewards from RL to find an approximate solution w. Multiple policies \u03c0 i are generated, leading to a derived policy \u03c0. The key questions involve defining features \u03c6 and policies \u03c0 i for effective implementation. During unsupervised pre-training, the agent utilizes a strong inductive bias to learn features relevant to rewards. This bias involves representing only the subset of the observation space that the agent can control. The objective is to maximize mutual information between a policy-conditioning variable and the agent's behavior, achieved by finding policy parameters that maximize this mutual information. Various algorithms exist for maximizing this quantity, with the goal of finding policy parameters that maximize mutual information between the policy-conditioning variable and the trajectory induced by the conditioned policy. The objective is to minimize the conditional entropy of the conditioning variable given the trajectory by sampling from the steady state distribution induced by the policy. A variational approximation is used to lower-bound the intractable conditional distribution, with variational parameters optimized by minimizing the negative log likelihood of samples from the true conditional distribution. The appropriate intrinsic reward function can be derived through the REINFORCE trick, resulting in log q(z|s) serving this role. The discriminator q is frozen after initialization for the random feature baseline, but the same objective is used to train \u03c8. The desired product of this optimization was the conditional policy (\u03c0), traditionally used for imitating demonstrated behaviors. The proposed approach combines SFs' task inference with BMI's unsupervised behavior learning by restricting conditioning vectors to correspond to task-vectors in the SFs formulation. This restriction requires that conditioning vectors correspond to task-vectors, enhancing the ability to parameterize tasks. The proposed approach combines SFs' task inference with BMI's unsupervised behavior learning by restricting conditioning vectors to correspond to task-vectors in the SFs formulation. This requires that the BMI discriminator q must have the form log q(w|s) = \u03c6(s) T w, parameterized as the Von Mises-Fisher distribution with a scale parameter of 1. This form of discriminator differs from the standard choice of parameterizing q as a multivariate Gaussian. Completing the base algorithm involves factorizing the conditional policy into policy-conditional successor features (\u03c8) and the task vector (w), which can be represented by a UVFA and a USFA, respectively. The proposed approach combines SFs' task inference with BMI's unsupervised behavior learning by restricting conditioning vectors to correspond to task-vectors in the SFs formulation. UVFA can be represented by a USFA with a feature basis derived from the conditional policy structure. Training involves sampling a task vector w and inferring it from the conditioned policy. The key difference in VISR is the task/dynamics factorization enforced by the conditional policy structure, reducing task inference to a regression problem. With SFs having a feature-learning mechanism, obtaining a diverse set of policies for GPI application is possible. The selection of policies for GPI involves choosing a set of vectors w. The base vector w base is derived from a regression problem, with additional task vectors sampled based on similarity to w base using a Von Mises-Fisher distribution. The concentration parameter \u03ba determines the diversity of these additional vectors. The experiments are divided into four groups (Sections 6.1 to 6.4) to evaluate the performance of VISR in the RL setup with unsupervised pre-training. Results are compared to ablations on the full VISR model and a variant of DIAYN. Performance is also compared to algorithms operating in an unsupervised manner and standard RL algorithms in a low data regime. The proposed approach infers the task through a regression solution. The proposed VISR approach infers tasks through regression and is evaluated on 57 Atari games. Agents undergo unsupervised training followed by a test phase with rewards. VISR includes features learned through BMI and GPI to enhance policy execution. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of these components in VISR's functioning. The VISR approach infers tasks through regression and is evaluated on 57 Atari games. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of components in VISR's functioning. DIAYN adapted for Atari domain with same conditions as VISR, but performance weaker than even ablated versions of VISR. Comparisons in Table 1 show varying RL interactions and performance levels. In comparison to fully unsupervised approaches, the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (Pathak et al., 2017) uses forward model prediction error to generate an intrinsic reward signal. Two variants, RF Curiosity and IDF Curiosity, were evaluated on a subset of Atari games. These methods did not use terminal signals from the environment to prevent the intrinsic reward from becoming a simple \"do not die\" signal. The VISR model was tested in an unsupervised manner without reward regression, showing promising results after 100k steps of reinforcement learning. Comparisons to existing unsupervised methods and reinforcement learning algorithms were made, demonstrating VISR's potential for outperforming in low-data regimes. The VISR model, compared to standard RL algorithms like PPO, Rainbow, and DQN, shows competitive results in low-data regimes. VISR's performance is based on solving a linear regression problem, which can be used to \"warm start\" an agent for further policy refinement using any RL algorithm. The VISR model shows competitive results in low-data regimes by solving a linear regression problem to \"warm start\" an agent for policy refinement using any RL algorithm. Eysenbach et al. (2018) suggest an exhaustive search approach over linear reward-regression for inferring task vectors. The hypothesis is that exploiting VISR's reward-regression task inference mechanism should yield more efficient inference than random search. Linear regression substantially improves performance in the VISR model compared to random search, with mean performance at 109.16 for reward-regression versus 63.57 for random search across 57 games. VISR outperformed random search on 41 games, supporting the hypothesis that VISR's task inference mechanism is more efficient than random search. The VISR algorithm shows notable performance on the full Atari task suite with few-step RL and unsupervised pre-training, outperforming all baselines. Future work could explore incorporating curiosity-based intrinsic rewards to encourage better exploration of controllable policies. The VISR algorithm has shown impressive performance on the full Atari task suite with few-step RL and unsupervised pre-training, outperforming all baselines. Future work could involve combining approaches to enforce distinguishable policies and exploring the relationship between BMI and SFs. The proposed approach, VISR, addresses open questions in the literature by computing features and inferring tasks. The goal is to minimize the loss function for parameters \u03b8 = (\u03b8 \u03c0 , \u03b8 q ) by optimizing the parameters of the policy \u03c0 and variational approximation q. The text discusses minimizing the loss function for parameters \u03b8 by optimizing the policy \u03c0 and variational approximation q. It explains how to derive a score function estimator using the log-likelihood or REINFORCE trick. The gradient of the probability of a trajectory under the policy can be computed to adjust it for better performance. Minimizing the loss function for parameters \u03b8 by optimizing policy \u03c0 and variational approximation q involves maximizing the value function using the policy gradient theorem. Log q(z | s) acts as the reward function in reinforcement learning algorithms. Analyzing the representations learned by VISR is challenging due to the complexity of the Atari task suite. The VISR model was trained on a smaller grid-world with a reduced network architecture. The model was trained for a longer duration to capture representations at convergence. The representations of the variational approximation \u03c6 across all states of the grid-world were shown in Figure 3. The reward functions were generated by sampling in Figure 4. The VISR model was trained on a smaller grid-world with a reduced network architecture and representations of the variational approximation \u03c6 were shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 demonstrates that the space of \u03c6 contains many different partitionings of the state-space, supporting the claim that externally defined reward functions are likely to be not far outside of this space. Figure 5 shows the value functions corresponding to the reward functions sampled in Figure 4, indicating a clear correspondence between them. The distributed reinforcement learning setup involved 100 separate actors running on their own instances of the environment. After every roll-out of 40 steps, experiences are added to a queue for the centralized learner to calculate losses and adjust network weights. Roll-out length determines hyper-parameters like backpropagation through time and task vector resampling every 40 steps. The approximations are under review for a conference paper at ICLR 2020. The approximations to the optimal value functions for reward functions in Figure 4 were computed by VISR through GPI on 10 randomly sampled policies. Results are averages of 3 random seeds per game per condition. Controlled fast-inference experiments were computationally expensive, so an online evaluation scheme was used for experiments comparing training steps on fast-inference performance. No-reward reinforcement learning was split into 2 phases, with reward information exposed to 5 out of 100 actors using task vectors from solving reward regression via OLS."
