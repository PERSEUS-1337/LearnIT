    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Prescription Drug Discount Act of 2002\". Congress finds that over 70 million Americans, including 18 million Medicare beneficiaries, lack adequate prescription drug coverage, leading to high drug prices that prevent access to necessary care and result in increased healthcare costs. State medicaid programs receive discounts for prescription drugs, providing over 40% off retail prices. In one State, the \"Healthy Maine\" program has given discounts to over 100,000 Americans since 2001 through a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The \"Healthy Maine\" program, which provides discounts on prescription drugs, has been successful and should be replicated in every State. The Federal and State governments are crucial in assisting uninsured or underinsured Americans. The State Prescription Discount Program is outlined in Section 3. The amendment to Section 1927(a) of the Social Security Act introduces requirements for manufacturers to make rebate payments for drugs obtained through state prescription drug discount programs. Manufacturers must enter into agreements with states to ensure rebate payments are equivalent to those made to the state under existing rebate agreements. The term 'State prescription drug discount program' is defined as a program where at least 95 percent of rebates paid to the State are provided to eligible residents as discounted prices for outpatient prescription drugs. Eligible residents are defined as individuals who are State residents. State resident eligible for benefits under title XVIII or whose income does not exceed 300 percent of the official poverty line may receive additional subsidies without requiring State funds. State funds can be used for a State prescription drug discount program, but a State cannot use its funds to provide greater subsidies to eligible residents. Amounts received under an agreement will not offset medical assistance expenditures in the quarter. The first sentence of section 1927(a)(1) of the Social Security Act is amended to include paragraph (7) in addition to paragraph (6) for medical assistance purposes under the State plan. Enhanced rebates for state Medicaid programs are provided under section 4. Section 1927(b)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act is amended to include an enhanced rebate provision for states with a prescription drug discount program. The enhanced rebate provision for states with a prescription drug discount program only considers half of the difference between the rebate received by the State and the rebate that would be paid for the covered outpatient drug under subsection (c) as a reduction in the amount expended under the State plan for medical assistance. The amendments made by this Act take effect on January 1, 2004."
