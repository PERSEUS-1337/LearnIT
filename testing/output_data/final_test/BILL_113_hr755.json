FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the unpaid volunteer members of the Civil Air Patrol provided extraordinary humanitarian, combat, and national services during World War II, using their own aircraft for essential tasks including attacks on enemy submarines. This service led to the post-war CAP becoming a valuable nonprofit organization providing emergency and public services to communities. The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) was established by air-minded citizens one week before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. During World War II, the CAP provided essential services using their own aircraft, including attacks on enemy submarines. The post-war CAP became a valuable nonprofit organization offering emergency and public services to communities. During World War II, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) played a crucial role in patrolling coastal waters to protect shipping from submarine attacks. General George Marshall expressed concern over the losses suffered, with 52 tankers sunk between January and March 1942. Despite initial resistance due to their nonmilitary status, CAP leaders urged the military to utilize their services. The Tanker Committee of the Petroleum Industry War Council also urged the Navy and War Departments to address the escalating submarine threat. The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) began coastal patrols in March 1942, funded by oil companies and organizations. Initially rejected by the Navy, the Army saw merit in the idea. CAP aircrews, ranging from 18 to over 80, spotted enemy submarines and provided vital services, with the Navy eventually utilizing their services. During the Coastal Patrol flights, a pilot quickly spotted a torpedoed tanker and coordinated rescue operations. The Civil Air Patrol set up 21 bases along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, with 40,000 volunteers using various civilian-owned aircraft, including single-engine and twin-engine planes. These planes were painted in prewar colors and had special markings for identification. During Coastal Patrol flights, CAP aircraft with special markings conducted patrols up to 100 miles offshore, often flying in pairs with basic navigation and communication equipment. Operations were carried out in all weather conditions, including winter, with limited emergency equipment such as inner tubes and duck hunter vests for flotation. The Coastal Patrol conducted patrols up to 100 miles offshore with limited emergency equipment. CAP pilots had opportunities to attack submarines, but assistance from armed military aircraft was unavailable. After limited emergency equipment, the military armed CAP aircraft with bombs and depth charges, leading to 57 attacks on enemy submarines. CAP volunteers incurred great economic costs for their patrols. During the Coastal Patrol service, CAP volunteers lived in primitive conditions along the coast. The patrols resulted in 26 fatalities, 7 serious injuries, and 90 aircraft lost. The heroic aircrews were credited with possibly damaging 2 submarines, attacking 57 submarines, dropping 82 bombs against submarines, reporting 17 floating mines, 36 dead bodies, and 91 vessels in distress. During the Coastal Patrol service, CAP volunteers reported 91 vessels in distress, 363 survivors in distress, and 836 irregularities. They also conducted 1,036 special investigations at sea, flew 86,685 total missions, logged 244,600 flight hours, and flew over 24,000,000 total miles. One high-level German Navy Officer credited CAP for moving submarine attacks away from the United States. CAP was dismissed from coastal missions in August 1943 when the Navy took over the mission. During the Coastal Patrol service, CAP volunteers performed various missions including border patrol, forest and fire patrols, military courier flights, emergency transportation of military personnel, target towing, searchlight tracking training missions, and missing aircraft searches. During the Coastal Patrol service, CAP volunteers conducted various missions such as missing aircraft and personnel searches, air and ground search and rescue operations, radar and aircraft warning system training flights, aerial inspections of military and civilian facilities, city and town blackout condition inspections, simulated bombing attacks for testing air defenses, scrap metal material searches, river and lake patrols including ice surveys in the Great Lakes, support for war bond drives, and management and guard duties at airports. The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) conducted various missions including management and guard duties at airports, support for emergencies, predator control, rescue of livestock, recruiting for the Army Air Force, initial flight screening for military recruits, mercy missions, emergency communications services, and a cadet youth program providing aviation and military training. The CAP flew over 500,000 hours on these missions. The Civil Air Patrol conducted various missions, including target towing, courier service, southern border patrol, pilot rescues, and state flights. These missions resulted in casualties, cargo transportation, border patrol hours, pilot rescues, and flight hours. During World War II, the Civil Air Patrol flew 790 hours on forest fire patrol missions, reporting 576 fires to authorities. In 1943, the CAP was transferred to the Army Air Forces, leading to its association with the United States Air Force. Women pilots trained by the CAP joined military units like the Women's Air Force Service Pilots program. The emphasis on safety and training led to only 64 CAP members dying by the end of the war. During World War II, the Civil Air Patrol had 64 members die in service and lost 150 aircraft. Approximately 100,000 civilians participated in CAP, flying 750,000 hours in their own aircraft. After the war, Congress and the President thanked CAP for its service, but little recognition was given to the volunteers. During World War II, the Civil Air Patrol proved its capabilities and strengthened ties with the Air Force and Congress. In 1946, Congress chartered CAP as a nonprofit organization, and in 1948, it became the Auxiliary of the United States Air Force. Today, CAP continues its missions, including homeland security, with unpaid civilian members using privately-owned aircraft and personal funds. The Civil Air Patrol flew combat-related missions in support of military operations off the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts for 18 months during a time of great need for the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. The President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for the award of a single gold medal to honor the World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol for their military service. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the gold medal with suitable emblems. Following the award, the medal will be housed in the Smithsonian Institution. The gold medal awarded to honor World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and made available for research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other locations associated with the Civil Air Patrol. The Secretary may create and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal to cover costs. The costs of the medals, including labor, materials, machinery, and overhead expenses, are covered. Medals struck under this Act are considered national medals. Authorization of up to $30,000 from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund is allowed to cover the cost of the medals authorized under section 2. Proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals will be deposited into the same fund."
