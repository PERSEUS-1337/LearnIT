The \"Military Family Stability Act of 2015\" introduces a new section allowing spouses of armed forces members to elect the timing of their relocation in connection with a permanent change of station. Members and spouses eligible to make elections for the timing of their relocation in connection with a permanent change of station include those where the spouse is gainfully employed or enrolled in a program, or if the member and spouse have dependents, at least one of whom is a child in elementary or secondary school at the beginning of the covered relocation period. Members eligible for timing elections during a permanent change of station include those with a gainfully employed spouse, enrolled spouse, or dependents in school. Spouses covered by the Exceptional Family Member Program or caring for a family member with a chronic illness also qualify. Individual augmentees or specified deployment arrangements are considered for relocation. The regulations applicable to a member's armed force specify deployment arrangements for timing elections during a permanent change of station. Eligibility for the election is determined based on qualifications outlined in the regulations or by the commander for family stability and the interests of the armed force concerned.

Dependents over 19 years old under the member's power of attorney for residence and those under 20 years old residing with a caregiver as per the Family Care Plan can be relocated. If the spouse relocates before the member, housing arrangements are made accordingly. If a member elects to relocate during a permanent change of station, they may be assigned bachelor housing until the permanent change of station. Spouses and dependents can continue to reside in US housing during the relocation period, and eligible dependents can move into US housing at any time during the relocation period. During the covered relocation period, a member undergoing a permanent change of station will receive basic allowance for housing at the with dependents' rate, regardless of when their spouse and dependents relocate. The portion of the allowance for dependents is based on their geographic location.

During a permanent change of station, members and spouses can allocate transportation allowances among personal property. The Secretary of Defense will establish a uniform approval process for coverage applications under this section to ensure timely processing.

The report will assess the impact of relocation on employment, education, and licensure of military spouses undergoing a permanent change of station.
