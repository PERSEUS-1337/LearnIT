    "content": "The Constitution limits Congress's powers through enumerated powers and external constraints. Enumerated powers restrict Congress to specific grants, while external constraints are prohibitions found elsewhere in the Constitution. The Supreme Court's federalism jurisprudence establishes internal and external limits on Congress's power regarding the states. Internal limits are embedded in clauses granting enumerated powers, while external constraints come from the Tenth Amendment and structural features of the Constitution. The Supreme Court's federalism jurisprudence recognizes internal and external limits on Congress's power over the states. The Tenth Amendment and structural features of the Constitution acknowledge the sovereignty of both National and State Governments. The Court's decision in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority exemplifies one viewpoint on federalism, stating that state governments are not insulated from generally applicable laws enacted by Congress under the Commerce Clause. The main limit on Congress's power towards states is the system's built-in restraints through state participation in federal affairs. The Garcia Court concluded that the political processes, not the Court, should enforce federalism-based limits on Congress's powers. However, recent years have seen a shift towards judicial safeguarding of state governments from federal overreach. For example, in United States v. Lopez, the Court struck down a federal law for exceeding Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause. This modern view emphasizes the judiciary's role in enforcing federalism-based limitations on Congress's powers. The modern Court recognizes the judiciary's role in enforcing limits on Congress's powers, but emphasizes that the political branches also play a central role in preserving the federal balance. Justice Kennedy highlighted Congress's substantial discretion in maintaining federalism and the political branches' obligation to protect the Constitution. The federalism-based limits on Congress's power are crucial for democratic liberty and the endurance of federalism. Congress's powers under various clauses are essential for defining the allocation of power between the federal government and states. The Spending Clause empowers Congress to collect taxes and provide for the common defense and general welfare. The debate over the Clause's limitations involved James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, with Madison advocating for a more restricted view of Congress's power. Madison and Hamilton debated the scope of Congress's power under the Spending Clause. Madison argued for a limited view, while Hamilton believed Congress had independent power to promote national welfare. The Supreme Court sided with Hamilton in the 1936 case of United States v. Butler, stating that the Spending Clause was not confined by specific grants of legislative power in the Constitution. The Supreme Court upheld the Social Security Act of 1935's unemployment insurance and pension system, reaffirming Congress's broad spending power under the Hamiltonian view of the Spending Clause. However, the Court also recognized limitations on Congress's spending power, derived from both the text of the Spending Clause and principles of governance. The Spending Clause limits Congress's spending power to promoting the \"general Welfare,\" but courts generally defer to Congress's judgment on what constitutes the general welfare. Congress has discretion to determine and expand on what serves the general welfare, with only clear abuses of power subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court has never ruled that a federal expenditure was not for the general welfare. External limitations on the Spending Clause are important when Congress imposes conditions on the provision of federal funds to influence state policy objectives. The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to regulate a wide range of economic and social activities. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Congress's commerce powers has varied throughout history. From a narrow view during the Progressive Era to a broad view starting in 1937, culminating in the Wickard v. Filburn case where Congress was allowed to regulate almost any activity affecting commerce. The Court believed that disputes over Congress's commerce power should be resolved by Congress rather than the courts. The Supreme Court shifted power to Congress for resolution rather than the courts regarding Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Congress used its commerce powers for federal legislation in the 20th Century, but the Court later ruled some legislation exceeded Congress's power. The modern test was set in United States v. Lopez in 1995, outlining three categories of activity Congress can regulate under its commerce power. Congress has the authority to regulate the channels of interstate commerce, including the movement of goods across state lines. This power is not limited to economic activities and allows Congress to exclude items deemed harmful to public health, morals, or welfare. The Court has upheld Congress's ability to prohibit the interstate shipment of stolen goods, goods produced without labor protections, transportation for prostitution, and mailing of lottery tickets. Congress has the authority to regulate interstate transportation, including lottery tickets. Congress can regulate the means of interstate commerce and persons or things transported across states. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's power to address threats to interstate commerce, even from intrastate activities. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to regulate threats to interstate commerce, including the destruction of aircraft used in interstate commerce and theft of goods moving interstate. This power extends to protecting instrumentalities or persons in interstate commerce, not all people or things that have crossed state lines. Additionally, Congress can regulate activities related to interstate commerce. Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, even if they are purely local. The Court has emphasized that there must be a rational basis for Congress to conclude that the activities in question would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. However, Congress cannot regulate purely intrastate activity that is not clearly connected to a larger regulation of economic activity. The Supreme Court has set criteria to determine if an activity substantially affects interstate commerce, including factors like whether the activity is related to commerce, if there is a jurisdictional element in the statute, congressional findings on interstate commerce effects, and the relationship between the activity and interstate commerce. Congress cannot regulate purely intrastate activity not connected to a larger economic regulation. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress cannot use the Commerce Clause to regulate purely intrastate non-economic activities. In cases like United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, laws were invalidated for lacking a jurisdictional element related to interstate commerce and not being supported by congressional findings on interstate commercial activity. The Court emphasized the need for a clear connection to interstate commerce in order to regulate such activities. The Morrison Court ruled that Congress cannot regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct solely based on its aggregate effect on interstate commerce. However, legislation regulating economic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce has been upheld. For example, in Gonzales v. Raich, the Court upheld the application of the federal Controlled Substances Act to intrastate marijuana cultivation for medical use under the Commerce Clause. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act litigation resulted in another limitation on congressional power. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) case of National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius established a limitation on Congress's commerce powers, stating that the Commerce Clause cannot compel individuals to engage in commercial activity. Chief Justice Roberts interpreted the ACA's \"individual mandate\" as requiring individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase health care coverage, emphasizing that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to regulate individuals for doing nothing. This decision added to previous rulings on Congress's regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause. Chief Justice Roberts rejected the government's argument that there were \"no temporal limitations in the Commerce Clause,\" warning that it would expand congressional authority significantly. He upheld the individual mandate under Congress's power to \"lay and collect taxes,\" while the dissenters in NFIB shared his concerns about the Commerce Clause granting unlimited power to Congress. The lack of a majority opinion makes it uncertain if these views will be binding precedent. The dissenters' conclusions on the Commerce Clause in NFIB may not be binding precedent. Lower courts rarely invalidate Commerce Clause legislation on \"inactivity\" grounds as much of what Congress regulates can be seen as \"activity.\" For example, the Fourth Circuit differentiated the employer mandate from the individual mandate in the ACA, stating that employers are already engaged in economic activity and not compelled to become active in commerce. The Commerce Clause does not compel employers to become active in commerce but regulates existing commercial activity. Challenges based on NFIB's inactivity principle have been largely unsuccessful in other cases. For example, the First Circuit rejected the argument that a law forbidding convicted felons from possessing a firearm exceeded Congress's commerce powers. The Second Circuit also held that the Sex Offender Registration Act was constitutional. The Second Circuit ruled in United States v. Robbins that SORNA did not unlawfully regulate non-economic inactivity by requiring sex offenders to update their registration when traveling interstate. The court reasoned that sex offenders had \"opted in\" to the regulations through their criminal activity. Lower courts have not seen NFIB's limitations on Congress's commerce power as a significant restriction on regulatory authority. Congress has broad power, as recognized since Missouri v. Holland in 1920, especially when implementing ratified treaties. The Supreme Court upheld a federal law regulating the killing of migratory birds adopted pursuant to a treaty between the US and Great Britain, stating that treaties made under US authority are the supreme law of the land. The Holland Court concluded that valid treaties are the supreme law of the land, allowing Congress to enact legislation to implement them. However, the extent to which Congress can infringe upon state authority through treaty-implementing legislation remains unclear. Some scholars suggest that Congress may not pass laws that undermine the essential character of U.S. states. In Bond v. United States, the Court considered the Tenth Amendment's constraints on Congress's ability to enact treaty-implementing legislation. The petitioner was convicted under the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act for attempting to poison someone. The Court chose not to revisit the scope of the treaty power as stated in Missouri v. Holland. Three Justices believed Congress's power to implement a treaty does not extend beyond its enumerated authority. The Court in Bond v. United States considered the limits of Congress's power to enact treaty-implementing legislation under the Tenth Amendment. The Court ruled that the criminal provisions of the CWCIA should be interpreted in line with federalism principles, not covering the petitioner's conduct. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments grant Congress additional powers beyond those in the original Constitution, ratified after the Civil War to end slavery and secure equal rights. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments were ratified after the Civil War to end slavery and secure equal rights. They prohibit slavery, ensure due process and equal protection, and guarantee voting rights regardless of race. These amendments shifted power from states to the federal government to protect civil rights. Congress has the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments through appropriate legislation, even if it prohibits conduct that is not unconstitutional. For example, to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress can eliminate the \"badges and incidents of slavery,\" such as racial discrimination in property sales. Similarly, to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress can ban racially discriminatory voting restrictions like literacy tests. The limitations to Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment include legislating only against \"state action\" and only \"remedially,\" without changing the substantive scope of guaranteed rights. Enforcement legislation must target conduct violating the Fourteenth Amendment's provisions with congruence and proportionality. The state action requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment limits Congress's power to combat discrimination only through state governments, not private conduct. This preserves individual freedom, limits federal law reach, and avoids blaming state agencies for conduct they cannot control. The state action requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment limits Congress's power to combat discrimination through state governments, not private conduct. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this requirement in United States v. Morrison, stating that laws targeting discrimination by private citizens are not permissible. Conduct by private actors can be considered state action only if there is a close nexus between the state and the behavior in question. This close nexus requires that the claimed constitutional deprivation resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege with its source in state authority, and the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may be considered a state actor. The state action requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment limits Congress's power to combat discrimination through state governments, not private conduct. A person charged with deprivation must be a state actor, which is a fact-bound inquiry. Discriminatory state legislation or conduct by individual state officials acting in their official capacity satisfies the state action requirement. Enforcement legislation must be \"remedial\" in nature, allowing Congress to go beyond actual constitutional violations to remedy and deter violations of constitutional rights. In City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court established a test to determine when legislation enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment becomes unconstitutional. The case addressed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibited governments from burdening religious exercise unless for a compelling interest using the least restrictive means. RFRA was a response to a Supreme Court decision that neutral state laws were not subject to heightened scrutiny under the First Amendment. In City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court established a test to determine when legislation enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment becomes unconstitutional. RFRA attempted to establish a stricter test for religious liberty claims than the legal standard articulated by the Smith Court. However, Boerne held that RFRA exceeded Congress's power because Congress could not \"decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States.\" The Court found that RFRA failed the proportionality requirement due to lack of examples of laws passed because of religious bigotry and its sweeping coverage threatening general state laws. The three-step approach in applying Boerne's test involves identifying the constitutional right, examining history of violations by states, and comparing the law's scope to the violations to determine proportionality. The Supreme Court decisions applying Boerne often involve congressional attempts to abrogate state immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. States can generally only be sued if Congress validly revokes their immunity, usually relying on the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power. The Court's rulings on abrogations of Eleventh Amendment immunity have been divisive, making predictions difficult. The Supreme Court's decisions on abrogating state immunity under the Eleventh Amendment have been divisive, making predictions difficult. In cases involving the Americans with Disability Act and the Family Medical Leave Act, the Court has ruled on Congress's ability to revoke state immunity in specific provisions. The Supreme Court's decisions on abrogating state immunity under the Eleventh Amendment have been divisive. Cases often hinge on whether there is a history of state violations of constitutional rights. For example, in Tennessee v. Lane, the Court found a pattern of discrimination against persons with disabilities justifying congressional abrogation of state immunity. In contrast, in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, legislation applying the ADA to state employment decisions was struck down due to lack of evidence of unconstitutional discrimination. Consideration of the specific constitutional right at issue is also crucial. The Fourteenth Amendment plays a significant role in determining the validity of abrogating state immunity. Courts are more likely to defer to Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment when violations involve suspect classifications or fundamental rights. For instance, the Supreme Court upheld abrogation for FMLA's family-care leave provisions to combat sex discrimination, while finding it invalid for the ADA's employment disability discrimination provisions due to the lower scrutiny of disability classifications. However, the Court later limited this ruling for Title II of the ADA, particularly in cases involving denial of courthouse access. The Tennessee v. Lane case involved the denial of courthouse access for disabled individuals, raising issues of disability discrimination and due process rights. The Boerne test evaluates the proportionality of congressional remedies to constitutional violations, with the Court finding valid abrogation of immunity when Congress provides limited remedies like reasonable accommodations. In contrast, the RFRA was deemed lacking congruence and proportionality as it subjected states to strict constitutional tests even for non-violative conduct. Courts only assess congruence and proportionality for prophylactic legislation that regulates conduct beyond actual violations. Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity without showing congruence and proportionality if legislation addresses actual Fourteenth Amendment violations. To avoid invalidation, legislators should establish a history of constitutional violations justifying the remedy and ensure it is tailored to the severity of the violations or fundamental rights involved. Congress can ensure that any remedy for constitutional violations is drawn in narrow terms to address or prevent those violations. The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to make laws necessary for carrying out its enumerated powers, including those in Article I of the Constitution. The Necessary and Proper Clause in the federal government, particularly in Congress's Article I powers, defines the outer limits of legislative authority and the boundary between federal and state powers. The Supreme Court has analyzed Congress's power under this clause independently in some cases, establishing its significance in delineating the extent of federal authority. The Supreme Court's 1819 opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland clarified the interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause in relation to Congress's power to establish a national bank. The Court rejected the argument that powers under the Clause are limited to those that are \"indispensable\" or \"absolutely\" necessary, instead defining \"necessary\" as \"conducive to\" or \"needful.\" This decision emphasized the broad scope of Congress's authority under the Clause. The Supreme Court's 1819 opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland clarified the interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause, defining \"necessary\" as \"conducive to\" or \"needful.\" This broad interpretation has been foundational for many federal laws, including federal criminal statutes, which rely on the Necessary and Proper Clause for constitutional authority. The Necessary and Proper Clause, as interpreted since McCulloch v. Maryland, allows for broad federal legislation that is \"convenient\" or \"useful\" to the exercise of federal power. United States v. Comstock is a modern case illustrating this interpretation, involving a law for indefinite civil commitment of \"sexually dangerous\" individuals in federal custody. The Supreme Court upheld the civil commitment provision for sexually dangerous individuals in federal custody under the Necessary and Proper Clause, despite the lack of explicit tie to enumerated federal powers. Justice Breyer justified this decision by stating that Congress has the authority to provide for imprisoned individuals and maintain security for others affected by federal imprisonment. The Court found the law valid based on five factors related to Congress's Necessary and Proper Clause authority. The Supreme Court upheld the civil commitment provision for sexually dangerous individuals in federal custody under the Necessary and Proper Clause, citing reasons such as federal involvement history, statute's accommodation of state interests, and narrow scope. In a related case, United States v. Kebodeaux, the Court reaffirmed the broad reading of the Necessary and Proper Clause in regulating sex offenders. In 2007, Kebodeaux was convicted of violating SORNA by not updating his registration when he moved. The Supreme Court upheld SORNA's application to him as necessary and proper under Congress's power to regulate the military. This was based on the finding that Kebodeaux's release from federal custody was not \"unconditional\" due to the Wetterling Act imposing similar registration requirements. The Court found that Congress could modify registration requirements through SORNA, applying the Necessary and Proper Clause. While Congress's powers are not unlimited, lower courts have followed this broad interpretation in cases like Comstock and Kebodeaux. Lower courts have been deferential to Congress's power under the Necessary and Proper Clause, upholding various challenges to SORNA. This includes criminalizing hostage taking, theft from organizations receiving federal funds, bribery of state officials, and sexual abuse in federal prisons. The Supreme Court has recognized federalism doctrines that limit Congress's authority, including the \"anti-commandeering\" doctrine and restrictions under the Spending Clause. Additionally, the Eleventh Amendment and state sovereign immunity are discussed, along with the equal sovereignty doctrine established in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013. The \"anti-commandeering\" doctrine prohibits the federal government from forcing states to implement federal policies. The anti-commandeering doctrine prohibits the federal government from forcing states to adopt or enforce federal policies, based on the Constitution's structure and the Tenth Amendment. It originated from the Supreme Court's 1992 decision in New York v. United States, which struck down a provision of a federal statute that required states to regulate low-level radioactive waste according to Congress's instructions. The anti-commandeering doctrine prevents the federal government from compelling state governments to implement federal policies. This limitation on Congress's authority is essential for maintaining political accountability and protecting citizens' liberties. The Supreme Court applied this doctrine in cases like New York v. United States and Printz v. United States. In Printz v. United States, the Court struck down a provision of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that required state law enforcement officers to perform background checks on prospective gun purchasers. The Court concluded that Congress cannot require states to enforce federal policies, citing the Constitution's \"structural protections of liberty\" and the need for political accountability. The Supreme Court has explained that the anti-commandeering doctrine has limits, such as not applying when Congress regulates activities involving both states and private actors. This exception was invoked in Reno v. Condon, where a Tenth Amendment challenge to a federal law restricting states' disclosure of personal information from DMVs was rejected. The law also restricted private actors from disclosing such information, and was upheld by the Court. The anti-commandeering doctrine does not prohibit Congress from requiring state courts to enforce federal causes of action, as seen in the 1947 Testa v. Katt case where Rhode Island courts were required to enforce the federal Emergency Price Control Act. This ruling clarified that states can be compelled to enforce federal laws without impinging on their sovereign capacity to regulate their citizens. The Court rejected the argument that Rhode Island courts were not required to enforce the federal Act, stating that under the Supremacy Clause, the federal policy prevails in every state. Congress can displace conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause by preempting them with federal regulation. Conditional preemption schemes are common in federal environmental law, allowing states to regulate a field as long as they consider federal standards. The Supreme Court has ruled that states can be required to consider federal standards without enforcing federal law. In Murphy v. NCAA, the Court explored the relationship between commandeering and preemption in the context of New Jersey's attempt to legalize sports gambling under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. In 2014, New Jersey partially repealed its prohibition on sports gambling, allowing it at casinos and racetracks but with restrictions. The NCAA and sports leagues challenged the law, but the Supreme Court sided with New Jersey, striking down the prohibition on state authorization of sports gambling. The Supreme Court sided with New Jersey in 2014, striking down PASPA's prohibition of state \"authorization\" of sports gambling. The Court found this provision unconstitutional as it placed states under the direct control of Congress, rejecting the argument that it was a valid exercise of Congress's power to preempt state law. The Supreme Court ruled that PASPA's \"anti-authorization\" provision conflicted with the anti-commandeering doctrine, which prohibits Congress from requiring states to enforce federal policies. Congress can still incentivize states to adopt federal policies through the Spending Clause, but this power is not unlimited. The Court has set limitations on Congress's Spending Clause authority, stating that conditions on federal funds to states must be clear and allow states to choose knowingly. This was established in Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, where states were not required to follow a statute's \"bill of rights\" for the developmentally disabled to receive funds. In Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, the Supreme Court ruled that states were not obligated to adhere to a federal statute's \"bill of rights\" for the developmentally disabled in order to receive funds. The Court emphasized that conditions on federal funds must be clear and allow states to choose knowingly. In Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, the Supreme Court ruled that states must be provided clear notice of any conditions attached to federal grants in order to accept them voluntarily and knowingly. This was also seen in the 2006 decision in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy regarding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Court ruled that the IDEA's fee-shifting provision does not allow prevailing parents to recover expert fees from states and municipalities, citing the lack of \"clear notice\" to states and localities regarding potential liability for such fees. Lower courts frequently apply the \"clear notice\" requirement to conditional spending schemes, demanding that funding recipients receive three types of notice before being held liable for violation of a funding condition. Courts have held that when the plain language of a federal statute imposes a condition on the receipt of federal funds, it falls within Congress's Spending Clause authority under the \"clear notice\" doctrine. In Madison v. Virginia, the Fourth Circuit rejected an argument regarding the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. The court rejected the argument that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) fails to provide clear notice that recipients of federal prison funds must abide by its religious liberty protections. The plain language of RLUIPA specifies that no government shall burden prisoners' religious exercise without a compelling interest, and states that its protections apply to programs receiving federal financial assistance. Additionally, the Supreme Court has hinted that conditions on federal grants may be invalid if unrelated to the grant's purpose. The Supreme Court discussed limitations on Congress's Spending Clause authority in South Dakota v. Dole, where it rejected a challenge to a federal statute withholding highway funds from states without a legal drinking age of 21. The Court acknowledged the \"relatedness\" requirement but quickly disposed of the issue as South Dakota did not dispute the connection between the drinking-age condition and the purpose of the funds. The Court quickly disposed of the issue on \"relatedness\" grounds, stating that the drinking-age condition was directly related to safe interstate travel, in line with Congress's Spending Clause authority. Lower courts have upheld various funding conditions without clear relationships to underlying legislation. The Supreme Court also noted that other constitutional provisions could limit conditional federal fund grants. In Dole, the Court considered if the Twenty-First Amendment prohibited Congress from withholding federal funds based on states' adoption of a minimum drinking age. South Dakota argued that the Amendment restricted federal establishment of a minimum drinking age and that the Spending Clause couldn't indirectly regulate what it couldn't directly. The Court disagreed, stating that the Spending Clause isn't a prohibition on indirect achievement of objectives Congress can't achieve directly. The Supreme Court in Dole ruled that Congress can condition federal funding on states' decisions, as long as it does not violate constitutional rights. This includes not inducing states to engage in unconstitutional activities or discriminatory actions. Congress cannot require states to adopt federal policies under the anti-commandeering doctrine. Under the anti-commandeering doctrine, Congress cannot attach conditions to federal funding that are so coercive as to become compulsion. The Supreme Court's decision in Dole upheld this limitation, stating that withholding federal highway funds to enforce a drinking age was not overly coercive. Lower courts have since rejected challenges to statutes based on their level of coerciveness. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB case marked a shift in the interpretation of Congress's Spending Clause authority. It held that a federal statute crossed the line from permissible \"pressure\" to impermissible \"coercion\" for the first time. This decision challenged the assumption that the Court's anti-coercion limitation did not effectively constrain federal power. The Court also considered whether the ACA provision allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to withhold Medicaid grants unconstitutionally coerced states into accepting federal policy. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB case found that a provision in the ACA violated the Tenth Amendment by unconstitutionally coercing states into accepting federal policy. Chief Justice Roberts explained that the provision threatened to terminate independent grants, acting as a \"gun to the head\" that left states with no real choice but to comply. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB case found that a provision in the ACA violated the Tenth Amendment by unconstitutionally coercing states into accepting federal policy. Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the threat to withhold federal funds was unacceptably coercive. Lower courts are still grappling with the implications of this \"anti-coercion\" decision. The court upheld a provision in the Clean Air Act that withholds federal funding for state transportation projects in non-compliant areas. Texas failed to show a significant number of non-compliant counties and the potential funding loss was minimal. The court deemed the provision not unduly coercive. The D.C. Circuit upheld a provision in the Clean Air Act withholding federal funding for state transportation projects in non-compliant areas. Observers argue that this decision may not be final on the constitutionality of the sanctions, as another provision allows broader withholding of federal highway funding. Some suggest that the anti-coercion doctrine should apply beyond financial inducements to pressure states to adopt federal policies. In West Virginia v. EPA, states challenged the Clean Power Plan (CPP) which requires them to submit plans to reduce carbon emissions from power plants meeting federal standards. If states fail, EPA will impose a federal plan. States argue this is federal coercion similar to ACA provision struck down in NFIB. States challenged the Clean Power Plan (CPP) which requires them to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. The federal plan implementing the CPP could lead to the closure of fossil-fuel fired power plants, forcing states to adopt other power sources. The Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the CPP in February 2016, indicating concerns about its legality. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) under the Trump Administration, potentially ending litigation over its legality. The Eleventh Amendment limits federal power over states, requiring dismissal of lawsuits against states without their consent. The Eleventh Amendment limits federal power over states by restricting Congress's authority to subject states to suit under federal laws. States generally enjoy immunity from private suits under federal law, imposing significant constraints on the national government's power. The Supreme Court has affirmed that states, as separate sovereigns, have immunity from suit. The Supreme Court has affirmed that states, as separate sovereigns, enjoy immunity from suit to safeguard their dignity and financial solvency. State sovereign immunity is not derived from the Eleventh Amendment but is inherent in their sovereign nature. The doctrine of state sovereign immunity shields states from suits without their consent, preserving their dignity and resources. The Supreme Court has emphasized that allowing unlimited congressional power to authorize suits for monetary damages against states would pose a severe danger and give Congress leverage not intended by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has extended state sovereign immunity beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment, applying it to suits by citizens against their own states and certain state officials and agencies. States also retain immunity from private suits in their own courts. The Supreme Court has ruled that states retain immunity from private suits in their own courts, stating that an unlimited congressional power to authorize such suits would give Congress a leverage over the States not contemplated by the constitutional design. Additionally, the doctrine of state sovereign immunity generally prohibits federal administrative agencies from adjudicating disputes against nonconsenting states. The Eleventh Amendment limits federal judicial power but exceptions exist. States can be sued by the United States and in certain instances by litigants. State sovereign immunity can be waived, allowing lawsuits against states or their officials. The Eleventh Amendment allows states to waive their sovereign immunity, permitting lawsuits against them if they voluntarily submit to federal court jurisdiction. This waiver must be clearly expressed, and cannot be implied. Congress can also incentivize states to waive immunity by linking it to receiving federal funds. Congress may require a waiver of state sovereign immunity as a condition for receiving federal funds, allowing private plaintiffs to sue state educational departments under certain circumstances. However, the Supreme Court has a strict standard for evaluating claims of Congress abrogating states' sovereign immunity due to the constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States. Congress may not abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court unless it has made its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute. Congress must also act pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority when authorizing suits against a state in federal court. The Supreme Court has ruled that only a few constitutional grants of legislative power provide a valid means for Congress to abrogate a state's sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Amendment generally prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting States. The Eleventh Amendment generally prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting States. However, Congress may authorize litigants to sue a state in federal court in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, which altered the balance between state and federal power by granting Congress the power to enforce constitutional provisions that constrain the states. This allows Congress to enact legislation that permits private suits against States or state officials. Congress can enact legislation authorizing private suits against States or state officials, which may not be allowed in other contexts. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress can use the Fourteenth Amendment to remove states' Eleventh Amendment immunity in certain cases of employment discrimination. However, Congress must ensure that the legislation qualifies as \"appropriate\" under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to do so. Federal courts can hear cases against state officers for ongoing violations of federal law, but only for injunctive or declaratory relief, not monetary damages. The Ex Parte Young exception allows federal courts to hear lawsuits against state officials for violations of federal law, providing injunctive or declaratory relief. This exception is based on the idea that suing the officer is like suing an individual, not the state itself, to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution. The Ex Parte Young exception allows federal courts to hear lawsuits against specific state officers in their official capacities for violations of federal law, providing injunctive or declaratory relief. However, this exception is narrow and does not apply to suits against the States or their agencies, and monetary damages cannot be sought under this exception. The Ex Parte Young exception allows federal courts to hear lawsuits against state officials for violations of federal law, but only for prospective relief. This exception does not apply to suits against states or their agencies, and monetary damages cannot be sought. Additionally, the equal sovereignty doctrine limits Congress's ability to enact legislation that imposes unequal burdens on states. The equal sovereignty doctrine restricts Congress's ability to pass laws that treat states unequally, as seen in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder case. While the principle is not clearly defined, it applies in limited contexts where federal laws impose unequal burdens on states. The Constitution mandates equal treatment of states in specific provisions, such as Article I, Section 8, clause 1. The Constitution mandates equal treatment of states in specific provisions, such as Article I, Section 8, clause 1, but does not explicitly require Congress to treat each state equally as a general matter. However, an implied principle of equal treatment has been recognized by the Court since the 19th Century, especially regarding the admission of new states. In cases like Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan and Coyle v. Smith, the Supreme Court emphasized that new states must be admitted on an equal footing with existing states, and Congress cannot impose conditions that limit their sovereignty. The Supreme Court emphasized that new states must be admitted on an equal footing with existing states, without limiting their sovereignty. This principle was extended in cases involving the Voting Rights Act, where the Court considered the constitutionality of certain sections. The Voting Rights Act's Section 4 imposed preclearance requirements on jurisdictions to prevent voting discrimination based on race or color. The Supreme Court upheld this provision in South Carolina v. Katzenbach due to states' efforts to perpetuate discrimination. Despite repeated reauthorizations, no changes were made to Section 4's coverage formula after 1975. The plaintiffs in Northwest Austin and Shelby County challenged this provision. The plaintiffs in Northwest Austin and Shelby County argued that racial discrimination in voting had decreased since 1975, questioning the constitutionality of treating certain states differently under the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court in Shelby County invoked the equal sovereignty principle to strike down Section 4 of the VRA, stating that departures from equal sovereignty must be justified. The Supreme Court in Shelby County struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, stating that a departure from equal sovereignty must be justified by a statute's geographic coverage being related to the problem it targets. The Court found that the coverage formula was outdated and not based on current conditions, leading to Congress imposing differential burdens on states without rational reason. Since Shelby County, few federal courts have considered equal sovereignty challenges outside of voting rights, with none striking down a federal statute on those grounds. The Third Circuit considered an equal sovereignty challenge to PASPA, which prohibited states from sponsoring sports gambling but had an exception for Nevada. New Jersey argued that this exception violated equal sovereignty after the Shelby County decision. The Third Circuit rejected New Jersey's equal sovereignty challenge to PASPA, noting that the regulation of gambling under the Commerce Clause is different from the regulation of elections. The court did not see a need for a one-size-fits-all test for equal sovereignty in the Commerce Clause context, suggesting that it may not apply outside sensitive areas of state and local policymaking. The Supreme Court upheld PASPA due to its purpose of preventing the spread of sports gambling, deeming it rational. However, PASPA was later invalidated on different grounds. In Mayhew v. Burwell, the First Circuit examined the equal sovereignty doctrine in a case involving Medicaid coverage under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In Mayhew v. Burwell, Maine challenged the Medicaid coverage policy for 18- to 20-year-olds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, arguing it violated equal sovereignty. The First Circuit ruled that ARRA did not involve disparate treatment like the VRA cases, as the criteria were applied uniformly without targeting specific states. The First Circuit ruled that the ARRA's condition on Medicaid coverage did not violate the Constitution, as it aimed to protect low-income individuals during transitions and did not involve the sensitive areas of state policymaking like the VRA. This decision aligns with the view that lower courts have largely upheld the ARRA's provisions. Lower courts have mostly limited the equal sovereignty doctrine to voting rights and have not used it to strike down federal laws, as seen in the context of the ARRA's Medicaid coverage condition being upheld by the First Circuit."
