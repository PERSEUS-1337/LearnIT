    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Robert S. Walker and George E. Brown, Jr. Hydrogen Energy Act of 2001\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to focus on research, development, and demonstration of hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use for various applications. It also aims to promote technology assessment, information dissemination, education, and environmentally friendly methods of hydrogen production. The Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to focus on research, development, and demonstration of hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use for various applications, aiming to minimize adverse environmental impacts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The advisory board established under section 108 is defined as the 'advisory board'. SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS. Section 103 of the Act is amended to require reports to Congress. The Secretary must provide Congress with an annual report on the progress of programs authorized under the Robert S. Walker and George E. Brown, Jr. Hydrogen Energy Act of 2001. The report should include an analysis of hydrogen-related research activities, evaluate the technology assessment program, and incorporate recommendations from the advisory board for program improvements. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the progress of programs authorized under the Robert S. Walker and George E. Brown, Jr. Hydrogen Energy Act of 2001, including an analysis of research activities, technology assessment program evaluation, and recommendations for program improvements. SEC. 5. HYDROGEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Section 104 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to focus on hydrogen research and development. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a hydrogen research and development program focusing on production, storage, transportation, and use of hydrogen for various applications. The program aims to address technical issues hindering hydrogen's market introduction and accelerate research for more cost-effective production and utilization. The Secretary is required to evaluate hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use, focusing on renewable energy sources. Private and public sector research activities worldwide will be surveyed to avoid duplication and competition with US industry-funded research. The Secretary will evaluate new technologies for hydrogen production, storage, and transportation. Research activities will be funded competitively through peer review, with industry required to contribute at least 20% of project costs. SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATIONS. Amends Section 105(c) of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to include a Non-Federal Funding Requirement. \n\nSEC. 7. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. Amends Section 106 to focus on Technology Assessment, Information Dissemination, and Education Program. The Secretary will conduct a program to accelerate hydrogen technologies globally, including in foreign countries, for economic development and environmental benefits. This includes updating the inventory of hydrogen technologies and their commercial capabilities. The Secretary will develop an information exchange program to improve technology transfer for hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use across various sectors. This program aims to foster the exchange of nonproprietary hydrogen information and technology among industry, academia, and government entities. SEC. 8. COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION.\n\nAmends Section 107 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to streamline management responsibility and require consultation with other Federal agencies and the advisory board.\n\nSEC. 9. ADVISORY BOARD.\n\nAmends Section 108 to establish an advisory board for the Act. The Secretary will establish an advisory board with experts from various sectors to review and advise on the progress of programs authorized under this Act. Federal agencies must cooperate with the advisory board and provide necessary information. The advisory board will review and make recommendations on program implementation and its economic, technological, and environmental aspects. The advisory board will review the economic, technological, and environmental consequences of hydrogen production systems. SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Amendment to Section 109 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 regarding authorization of appropriations. Authorization of appropriations for research and development and demonstration under the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Act:\n- Research and Development; Advisory Board: \n  - $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2002\n  - $45,000,000 for fiscal year 2003\n  - $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2004\n  - $55,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n  - $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n- Demonstration:\n  - $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2002\n  - $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2003\n  - $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2004\n  - $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n  - $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.
