    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural Energy for America Act of 2006\". Congress acknowledges the rising energy costs and risks to energy security in the United States. It recognizes the potential of the agricultural sector to provide clean and sustainable energy, which can reduce dependence on imported energy and lower costs for all citizens. Agriculture-based energy also contributes to rural economic development. The Act aims to boost rural economic development, increase farm-based income, create jobs in manufacturing, construction, and services, expand economic opportunities, and improve environmental quality. It sets a goal for the agricultural sector to provide 25% of the energy consumed in the US by 2025 through renewable energy resources and energy efficiency improvements. This aligns with the recognition of agriculture's potential to reduce energy costs and dependence on imports while contributing to rural economic development. The systems and energy efficiency improvements program is the first agricultural program to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in the agricultural and rural business sectors. It has been successful, providing $64 million in grants and loan guarantees for 412 projects in 37 states, leveraging $699 million in additional investments. These projects will produce or save over 17 trillion British thermal units of energy annually. The program aims to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in the agricultural and rural business sectors. It has provided funding for projects that produce ethanol and biodiesel fuel, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and have received a high number of applications exceeding available funding. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to create the Rural Energy for America Program under Section 9006. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to establish the Rural Energy for America Program under Section 9006. Subsection (a) is modified to include rebates and rural school districts. Subsection (f) is removed, subsection (e) is redesignated as subsection (h), and a new subsection (e) is added for Production-Based Incentive in Lieu of Grant, allowing for payments based on energy production from renewable energy systems. The Rural Energy for America Program allows for production-based incentives based on energy production from renewable energy systems. The total incentive value is limited to 25% of project costs. The Secretary may provide assistance for feasibility studies of eligible projects. The Secretary will establish criteria for assistance under this program, applicants cannot receive duplicative assistance for feasibility studies, and recipients must contribute at least 75% non-Federal funds. Additionally, the Secretary will provide competitive grants for rebates to farmers, ranchers, rural school districts, and rural small businesses. The program provides grants for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements to eligible entities such as State energy or agriculture offices, nonprofit organizations, and consortia. Eligible entities must undergo a merit review process to receive the grants. The Secretary will establish a merit review process involving various agencies and organizations to review applications for grants under the program. The review will consider the entity's experience in clean energy programs and projected energy savings. The grant recipient must assure the Secretary that funds will supplement, not supplant, existing federal, state, and local funds for rebate programs. The rebate amount from the grant shall not exceed $10,000 or 50% of the purchase cost. The Secretary shall make funds available from the Commodity Credit Corporation for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements, with specific allocations for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. For fiscal years 2011 and 2012, $180,000,000 and $250,000,000 respectively are allocated for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements, with specific amounts designated for subsection (g). SENSE OF THE SENATE: The Senate supports implementing a direct loan program to complement grants for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements, modeled after a similar program for small businesses."
