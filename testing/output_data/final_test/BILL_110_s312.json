    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Brigadier General Francis Marion Memorial Act of 2007\". Congress finds that Brigadier General Francis Marion was born in 1732 in South Carolina, married Mary Esther Videau, and had no children but raised a relative's son as his own. He commanded the Williamsburg Militia Revolutionary Force, used unconventional tactics to disrupt British forces, and earned the nickname \"Swamp Fox.\" Brigadier General Francis Marion, known as the \"Swamp Fox,\" gained fame when British Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton couldn't catch him. Marion's racially integrated troops won at Eutaw Springs in 1781. He also served as a statesman in South Carolina and represented the state at the Constitutional Convention. Congress has authorized commemorative works in DC for celebrated Americans like George Washington. Brigadier General Francis Marion, known as the \"Swamp Fox,\" lacks a memorial in Marion Park in Washington, DC, despite his crucial role in the Revolutionary War. It is time to honor his legacy and ensure future generations remember his contributions to American heritage. Marion, a South Carolina hero, deserves proper recognition for his historical significance to the Nation. The Act defines key terms such as \"commemorative work,\" \"Committee,\" \"the District of Columbia and its environs,\" and \"Project.\" It also establishes a Commemorative Work to honor Brigadier General Francis Marion and his family. The Project and Committee may establish a commemorative work in DC to honor Brigadier General Francis Marion. The work must comply with standards and be funded solely through contributions, with no federal funds allowed. The Project and Committee must deposit any excess funds for the commemorative work authorized under subsection (a) to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in a specific account. This includes funds remaining after expenses for establishment, maintenance, and preservation, or funds remaining after the authority for the commemorative work expires."
