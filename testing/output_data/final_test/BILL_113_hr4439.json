    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section titled \"DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM.\" Congress acknowledges the ongoing discrimination faced by minority-owned and women-owned businesses in federally assisted surface transportation markets, leading to the establishment of the disadvantaged business enterprise program. Discrimination hinders the full participation of minority and women business owners, including African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans. Congress has reviewed evidence of discrimination against minority and women business owners in the transportation sector, including significant disparities in the utilization of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in federally and locally funded transportation contracting. Research on discrimination against minority and women business owners in transportation contracting includes statistical analyses of disparities, anecdotal reports of discrimination, individual cases of discrimination, and evidence of reduced participation in jurisdictions without minority-owned and women-owned business programs. Research on discrimination against minority and women business owners in transportation contracting includes statistical analyses of disparities in credit availability, research demonstrating the negative impact of discrimination on firm formation and success, and evidence showing that race-neutral and gender-neutral efforts are insufficient to remedy discrimination. Congress has reviewed compelling evidence of discrimination against minority-owned and women-owned businesses in the transportation sector. Congress has received compelling evidence of discrimination in transportation from various sources, including hearings, studies, reports, news stories, and lawsuits. This evidence highlights the need for a disadvantaged business enterprise program to address race and gender discrimination in intercity rail passenger transportation under the Federal Railroad Administration. To ensure fair competition in rail projects, at least 10 percent of funding must go to disadvantaged business enterprises. An annual list of these enterprises, including their ownership demographics, will be compiled. The Secretary of Transportation will establish uniform criteria for certifying small business concerns, including on-site visits, interviews, license inspections, and financial analyses. Recipients of Federal Railroad Administration funds must participate in a unified certification program. The Secretary will also establish reporting requirements. The Secretary of Transportation will set minimum reporting requirements for recipients of Federal funding for rail projects, including information on minority-owned and women-owned business awards. Compliance with court orders does not limit eligibility for funding if a court finds a requirement unconstitutional. Definitions for this section will be provided. In this section, definitions for terms like commuter rail passenger transportation, intercity rail passenger transportation, covered rail project, and disadvantaged business enterprise are provided. The curr_chunk defines a small business concern as one owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with specific criteria for exclusion based on annual gross receipts. The term \"socially and economically disadvantaged individuals\" is also defined in relation to the Small Business Act. The curr_chunk states that women are presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for subcontracting regulations under the Small Business Act."
