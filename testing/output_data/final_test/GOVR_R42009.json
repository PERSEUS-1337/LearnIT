    "content": "Behavioral health disorders affect a large number of people in the United States, with an estimated 26% of adults experiencing these disorders in a given year and 46% over a lifetime. In 2005, $135 billion was spent on behavioral health care, with $40 billion paid by the federal government and $44 billion by state governments. Despite this spending, 40% of adults with severe behavioral health disorders received no treatment due to barriers such as cost and lack of access. The federal government plays a significant role in financing and delivering behavioral health care services, including through Medicare and Medicaid programs. It also regulates private health plans to cover a minimum set of benefits, such as behavioral health care services. Additionally, the government supports safety net services directly and through training programs for health care providers to address provider shortages. The recently enacted health reform law (PPACA) reflects Congressional interest in behavioral health care by increasing access to services through changes in financing and delivery systems. This includes impacting financing arrangements like Medicare and Medicaid, coverage of specific services, and the development of the health workforce. The PPACA includes sections relevant to behavioral health, impacting financing and delivery of services. Access to care is influenced by financing arrangements and covered benefits. Addressing both components together may improve access more efficiently. PPACA may increase access to behavioral health services by improving availability and affordability of financing arrangements, potentially benefiting individuals with mental illness who currently have higher rates of uninsurance and lower rates of private health insurance coverage. PPACA is expected to increase coverage for individuals with behavioral health disorders through Medicaid expansion, market reforms for private insurance, and health insurance exchanges. Researchers estimate that Medicaid program users of behavioral health services will increase after PPACA implementation. The Medicaid program is expected to see an increase of approximately 2.3 million users of behavioral health services. Private health insurance market reforms under PPACA will remove eligibility requirements, allowing individuals with behavioral health disorders to access private insurance. Health insurance exchanges will also play a role in expanding coverage for those with behavioral health disorders. Health Insurance Exchanges under PPACA will create marketplaces for purchasing private health insurance plans, potentially making coverage more affordable for individuals with behavioral health disorders. Exchanges will certify plans, identify Medicaid and CHIP eligibility, and offer premium and cost-sharing credits. This expansion of financing arrangements may increase access to care, depending on the benefits covered. PPACA addresses coverage of behavioral health services through essential health benefits and mental health parity, creating a partial coverage mandate for mental health and substance use disorder services. Plans offered in the exchanges must include a minimum set of benefits, which statutorily include mental health and substance use disorder services. PPACA requires certain types of plans to offer Essential Health Benefits (EHB), including mental health and substance use disorder services. It expands federal mental health parity law to ensure coverage terms for behavioral health services are no more restrictive than medical and surgical services. Compliance with parity law is extended to Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through various markets. PPACA addresses compliance with the law for three types of plans: QHPs, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. It also focuses on improving health care service delivery, including the safety net, workforce, and patient-centered care models. PPACA funding supports safety net facilities like community health centers, which are crucial for individuals with behavioral health disorders. The law is expected to increase capacity in these facilities, with health center caseloads projected to rise significantly. Additionally, PPACA includes provisions to impact the healthcare workforce providing behavioral health services. The PPACA funding supports safety net facilities like community health centers, which are crucial for individuals with behavioral health disorders. The law aims to increase capacity in these facilities, with health center caseloads projected to rise significantly. Additionally, efforts are being made to incentivize the development of the safety net workforce and alleviate mental health provider shortages. PPACA includes funding for training in primary care and education of providers about behavioral health services. 95 million Americans live in mental health professional shortage areas, requiring an additional 6,221 practitioners. The law creates a program targeting training funds for mental health professionals treating high-need populations. It incentivizes changes in healthcare delivery likely to impact behavioral health services. PPACA supports patient-centered care models with improved coordination, integrated delivery of behavioral health services, and emphasis on primary care. It allows states to establish \"health homes\" for individuals with chronic conditions. Grant programs will educate primary care physicians on behavioral health and promote co-location of primary and specialty care in mental health settings. Key sections in PPACA related to behavioral health care are organized into nine tables, including essential health benefits and mental health parity. The curr_chunk discusses essential health benefits, mental health parity, private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid in relation to behavioral health care. It also covers safety net services, workforce, and miscellaneous sections related to the delivery of behavioral health care under PPACA. Relevant Indian Health Service sections are included in the appendix. Each table in the curr_chunk presents sections by issue area, such as private market reforms and health insurance exchanges, with descriptions, section numbers, and whether they are new or existing authorities. Sections specific to behavioral health are noted with \"S,\" while general sections affecting behavioral health care are noted with \"G.\" The curr_chunk provides information on sections in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 related to behavioral health. A search strategy was used to identify relevant sections impacting behavioral health care providers and patients. Relevant sections are listed in tables by issue area, with descriptions and section numbers. Sections specific to behavioral health are marked with \"S,\" while general sections affecting behavioral health care are marked with \"G.\" The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms related to healthcare, including organizations and acts such as CDC, CMS, and FDA. The CRS acknowledges the challenge of ensuring a comprehensive list due to the lack of specific language dedicated to behavioral health in the PPACA. The curr_chunk lists various healthcare-related acronyms such as IHS, IT, IMD, LTC, MIPPA, NHSC, PPACA, PhRMA, PHSA, SBHC, SSA, SAMHSA, TO, and UIO."
