This approach aims to produce high-quality adversarial perturbations that can mislead deep neural networks, potentially accelerating adversarial training as defenses. AdvGAN is used for semi-whitebox and black-box attacks. In semi-whitebox attacks, no access to the original target model is needed after training the generator. In black-box attacks, a distilled model is trained dynamically for the black-box model and the generator is optimized accordingly. Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN have high attack success rates on different target models, outperforming other attacks. The attack achieved 92.76% accuracy on a public MNIST black-box challenge. Deep Neural Networks have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations, where small changes can mislead the system into misclassifying inputs. Various algorithms have been developed to generate such adversarial examples. Different algorithms like FGSM and optimization-based methods are used to generate adversarial examples. To improve realism, a feed-forward network is trained to create perturbations based on a discriminator network. AdvGAN utilizes GANs to produce realistic adversarial examples in white-box and black-box settings, outperforming other attacks with a 92.76% accuracy on a MNIST challenge. AdvGAN is a method that can produce adversarial perturbations for input instances without needing access to the model itself. It operates in a semi-whitebox setting and has shown high attack success rates against different target models. The effectiveness of AdvGAN is evaluated against state-of-the-art defenses in both semi-whitebox and black-box settings. AdvGAN is a method that can produce adversarial examples with a high attack success rate. It differs from previous methods by training a conditional adversarial network to directly generate realistic adversarial examples. AdvGAN can also attack black-box models by training a distilled model dynamically, achieving high success rates. Additionally, AdvGAN shows higher attack success rates against current defense methods. AdvGAN achieves high attack success rates against current defenses, winning the top position in the MNIST challenge. Various attack strategies have been proposed in the white-box setting, including the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) by Goodfellow et al. to generate adversarial examples. AdvGAN is a feed-forward network that can produce perturbation for any instance, achieving higher attack success rates against different defenses and performing much faster than current attack algorithms. It optimizes adversarial perturbation for targeted attacks while satisfying constraints, outperforming optimization-based methods in speed and versatility. The adversarial instance is constrained to be close to the original one using a re-ranking loss and L2 norm loss. A deep neural network discriminator helps distinguish the instance from real images to improve perceptual quality. Black-box attacks analyze transferability phenomenon for generating adversarial examples against different models using query-based access. AdvGAN can perform black-box attacks without relying on transferability by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate visually appealing adversarial samples. The approach involves training a local substitute model with queries to the target model to create perturbed images that are indistinguishable from real ones in the original class. The text discusses the generation of adversarial examples using adversarial networks to mislead target learning models. It defines the problem of generating adversarial examples in the feature space X, with the goal of creating visually realistic outputs that can deceive classifiers. The adversary aims to generate adversarial examples xA that are classified as the true label y or a target class t, while being close to the original input x. The architecture of AdvGAN includes a generator G, a discriminator D, and the target neural network f. The generator G creates a perturbation G(x) from the original instance x. The discriminator D distinguishes between generated data and the original instance x. The goal is to make the generated instance indistinguishable from the original class data. The white-box attack is performed with the target model f, which outputs the loss Ladv representing the distance between the prediction and the target class t. The adversarial loss in targeted attacks aims to fool the target model by generating perturbed data close to the original class. The loss function encourages misclassification as the target class, focusing on targeted attacks rather than untargeted ones. In targeted attacks, a soft hinge loss is added to bound the perturbation magnitude. The objective includes terms controlled by \u03b1 and \u03b2, with LGAN encouraging similarity to original data and Lfadv optimizing for high attack success rate. G and D are obtained through a minmax game. For black-box attacks, adversaries distill data disjoint from the model's training data. To conduct black-box attacks, adversaries distill data separate from the model's training data to create a distilled network f based on the black-box model's output. The attack strategy involves minimizing a network distillation objective to make the distilled model behave similarly to the black-box model. This allows for carrying out attacks on the distilled network. Unlike training the discriminator D with real data from the original class, the distilled model is trained with data from all classes. A dynamic distillation approach is proposed to train the distilled model and generator G jointly, making queries and updating the model in each iteration. This method aims to address the performance of the black-box and distilled model on generated adversarial examples not seen during training. The distilled model f i is updated using new query results for generated adversarial examples against the black-box model and original training images. Comparing static and dynamic distillation approaches, updating G and f simultaneously improves attack performance. AdvGAN is evaluated for semi-whitebox and black-box settings on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets, generating adversarial examples for different target models and testing attack success rates under various defenses. See TAB1 for more details. AdvGAN is a method that achieves higher attack success rates compared to other existing strategies. It outperforms white-box and black-box attacks in terms of computation efficiency, even faster than FGSM. AdvGAN can perform targeted attacks and attack in a semi-whitebox setting. The code and models will be available upon publication. The code and models for AdvGAN will be available upon publication. The architecture of generator G is adopted from BID17, while the discriminator D's architecture is similar to model C for MNIST and ResNet-32 for CIFAR-10. The loss function used is from BID6, with a confidence \u03ba = 0 for both Opt. and AdvGAN. Adam is used as the solver with a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 0.001. LSGAN's least squares objective is used for GANs training, along with Wide ResNet derived from the variant of \"w32-10 wide.\" The classification accuracy of pristine MNIST and CIFAR-10 test data and the attack success rate of adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different models are shown in TAB1. AdvGAN successfully generates adversarial instances to attack all models with high success rates, even targeting different classes from the same original instance. The generated adversarial examples closely resemble the ground truth images. AdvGAN generates adversarial examples on MNIST and CIFAR-10, successfully fooling black-box models with high success rates. Different loss functions affect the attack success rate, with AdvGAN achieving 98.3% on MNIST. On CIFAR-10, AdvGAN applies a semi-whitebox attack on ResNet and Wide ResNet models. AdvGAN successfully generates adversarial examples on ImageNet with an L \u221e bound of 8, maintaining visual quality while misclassifying into other target classes. The black-box attack evaluation is based on a dynamic distillation strategy using a local model to distill model f, with Model C's architecture selected for this purpose. AdvGAN uses a dynamic distillation strategy with Model C's architecture to generate adversarial examples with high attack success rates on MNIST and CIFAR-10. The adversarial instances maintain high perceptual quality compared to the original digits. The original digit is highlighted by adversarial perturbations, implying realistic manipulation. Adversarial examples on CIFAR-10 appear photo-realistic compared to the original ones. Various defense strategies have been developed against different attack methods, with adversarial training being the most effective. AdvGAN aims to generate more realistic adversarial perturbations by mimicking the true data distribution. AdvGAN is evaluated for its ability to produce adversarial examples that are resilient against different defense methods. The threat model considered is where the adversary attacks the original learning model without knowledge of defenses. Different attack methods are applied to generate adversarial examples, followed by applying various defenses to defend against these instances. AdvGAN is evaluated for its ability to produce adversarial examples that are resilient against different defense methods. In the semi-whitebox attack setting, adversarial examples are generated against different models using three adversarial training defenses. The attack success rate of AdvGAN on different models is higher than FGSM and optimization methods. AdvGAN is used for black-box attacks by training a distilled model to target model B, achieving higher success rates compared to FGSM and optimization methods. The same approach is applied to attack model A on MNIST, with AdvGAN consistently outperforming other methods. For CIFAR-10, a distilled model is trained to perform black-box attacks against ResNet, showing superior results compared to other attack methods. AdvGAN is utilized for black-box attacks, achieving high success rates compared to other methods. The perturbations generated do not resemble the original image or target class, showing AdvGAN's unique ability in generating adversarial examples. AdvGAN is used for black-box attacks with high success rates. High resolution adversarial examples are generated for Inception_v3, evaluated for attack success rate and perceptual realism. Toy poodle is chosen as the target label, with adversarial examples generated under an L \u221e perturbation bound of 0.01. Architecture details for generator and discriminator are provided in the appendix. AdvGAN's adversarial examples were validated for realism through a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Workers were asked to choose between original images and AdvGAN examples, with AdvGAN examples being perceived as more realistic in 49.4% of cases. This demonstrates that high-resolution AdvGAN adversarial examples are comparable in realism to benign images. AdvGAN proposes generating adversarial examples using GANs, allowing for efficient production of adversarial perturbations. It can execute semi-whitebox and black-box attacks with high success rates, outperforming competing methods against state-of-the-art defenses. AdvGAN's generated adversarial examples maintain high perceptual quality due to GANs' distribution approximation property. The architecture of models BID16 includes various layers like Convolution-InstanceNorm-ReLU and residual blocks. The discriminator architecture uses CNNs with Convolution-InstanceNorm-LeakyReLU layers. The discriminator for ImageNet consists of Convolution layers and a Fully Connected layer."
