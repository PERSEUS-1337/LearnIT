It consists of department heads, the Vice President, and other officials with Cabinet rank appointed by the President. Currently, there are 15 department heads and additional positions like the White House Chief of Staff and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The President's Cabinet is an informal institution consisting of department heads, the Vice President, and officials with Cabinet rank appointed by the President. Past Presidents have also accorded Cabinet rank to positions like Director of National Drug Control Policy and Counselor to the President. Presidents have used their Cabinets in various ways, with some administrations using it as a key advisory body while others have seen it as a symbolic institution. President Clinton added four positions to his Cabinet during his time in office. The President's Cabinet is a symbolic institution with members exercising influence over their departments. Nominations to Cabinet-level positions are a high priority for the Senate. The appointments process involves three stages: selection and nomination by the President, consideration in the Senate, and appointment by the President. The White House selects and clears prospective Cabinet appointees before formal nomination to the Senate. After selection and vetting by the White House, the candidate for a Cabinet-level position undergoes a clearance process overseen by the Office of the Counsel to the President. This process includes submitting various forms and background investigations by the FBI, OGE, and agency ethics officials. Conflicts of interest are addressed, and once cleared, the nomination is made. After clearance by the Office of the Counsel to the President, the nominee is ready for Senate submission. Senate confirmation grants authority to assume duties, with a focus on nominee's views and impact on policy. The Senate committee handles the nomination process, including investigation and hearings. Committee nomination activity on Cabinet nominations involves investigation, hearings, and reporting. Committees gather information from the White House and conduct their own investigations. Hearings provide a public platform to discuss the nominee and relevant agency issues. Senators use hearings to assess qualifications, express policy views, and address oversight concerns. Committees can choose not to act on a nomination at any stage, but this is uncommon for Cabinet nominations. If the committee votes to report the nomination, it moves forward in the confirmation process. After committee investigation and hearings, Cabinet nominations are reported to the full Senate with three possible outcomes: favorable, unfavorable, or without recommendation. If the nomination fails to obtain a majority vote, it will not be reported. Once reported, the nomination is assigned a calendar number and considered in executive session. Cloture may be needed to end debate and reach a vote, with a simple majority required for cloture on all executive branch nominations, including Cabinet positions. The Senate has historically confirmed most Cabinet nominations. Cabinet nominations are confirmed by the Senate, with rare failures. Once confirmed, the nominee receives a commission signed by the President and is sworn into office. The appointee then has full authority to carry out their responsibilities. The report examines Cabinet nominations during inter-term transitions of recent Presidents. The Appendix lists nominations for Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama. During inter-term transitions, Cabinet nominations are confirmed by the Senate. The data in the Appendix includes nominations for Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama. A total of 48 nominations were made, with 46 confirmed by the Senate. President Clinton had two nominations withdrawn during Senate consideration. The inter-term transition period is defined as between November 1 of a President's re-election year and December 31 of the first year of his second term. During inter-term transitions, Cabinet nominations are confirmed by the Senate for Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama. The data in the Appendix includes nominations for traditional Cabinet positions and those given Cabinet rank by the President. Table A-1 in the Appendix lists all Cabinet nominations made during inter-term transitions for the four Presidents covered in the report. The report details the timeline of actions from the President's nomination announcement to the Senate's final confirmation. It includes dates of announcement, nomination receipt, hearings, nomination reporting, and confirmation. Some nominations were withdrawn. Table A-2 in the Appendix shows the days between each step. The table also shows the total duration of the appointments process in two different measures. The report outlines the timeline of actions from the President's nomination announcement to Senate confirmation. Table A-2 in the Appendix displays the duration of the appointments process in two measures: number of days from nomination receipt to confirmation, and total duration. Data on early vetting stages timing is not publicly available. The vetting process for nominations is often not publicly available until the President formally announces his intention to nominate an individual. The number of days elapsed during the Senate's consideration of a nomination can indicate its level of controversy or opposition, but other factors like workload and legislative priorities can also affect the timeline. The duration of Senate consideration for Cabinet nominations varies based on factors like workload and legislative priorities. Different methods can be used to measure this duration, including counting days from nomination announcement to confirmation, from nomination receipt to confirmation, or between individual process steps. Table 2 summarizes these methods. The duration of Senate consideration for Cabinet nominations varies based on factors like workload and legislative priorities. Table 2 provides a summary of the information by President using different methods to measure the total duration of the nomination process. From the date of announcement to confirmation, the average confirmation time was 61.6 days, while from nomination receipt to confirmation, the average time was 34.8 days. During inter-term transitions, nominations to Cabinet positions typically went through Senate confirmation in just over a month. The average time from announcement to confirmation was approximately two months for each President, with some variation. The duration from nomination receipt to confirmation varied more, with President Reagan having the shortest average confirmation time. President Reagan had the shortest average confirmation time for nominations, with an average of 22.2 days under Senate consideration. President Obama had the longest average of 57.3 days. The duration of Senate consideration varied, with President Reagan's nomination of Edwin Meese III for Attorney General taking the longest at 156 days. Edwin Meese III was nominated for Attorney General by President Reagan on February 3, 1984. His confirmation was delayed due to a financial investigation, but he was cleared of any violations. President Reagan announced his intention to renominate Meese on September 20, 1984. President Reagan announced his intention to nominate James A. Baker III as Secretary of the Treasury on January 8, 1985. The Senate confirmed Baker 21 days later by a vote of 95-0, making it the nomination with the shortest consideration period. President Obama's nomination of Regina McCarthy to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 2013 took 133 days to be confirmed, while former Senator John F. Kerry's nomination as Secretary of State was confirmed in just seven days. The Senate confirmed President Obama's nomination of Regina McCarthy as Administrator of the EPA in 133 days. The longest period from nomination to first hearing was 70 days for President Clinton's nomination of Alexis M. Herman as Secretary of Labor in 1997. Alexis M. Herman's nomination for Secretary of Labor in 1997 was under Senate consideration for 113 days, with discussions about her alleged involvement in campaign fundraising. She was confirmed by a vote of 85-13. Madeleine K. Albright and Carlos M. Gutierrez had their hearings one day after nomination and were confirmed without roll call votes. President Clinton's nomination of William S. Cohen to be Secretary of Defense and President George W. Bush's nominations of Mike Johanns for Secretary of Agriculture and Margaret Spellings for Secretary of Education all went through Senate consideration stages on the same day and were confirmed shortly after."
