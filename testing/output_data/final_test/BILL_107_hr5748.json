    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public Lands Forever Wild Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that the Constitution of the State of New York's prohibition on extraction on State-owned public lands is a good model for managing Federal public lands. Federal agencies currently permit massive corporate extraction on these lands without considering their other assets. The Congress finds that vast areas of Federal public lands are being exploited by private industry without proper accounting, leading to significant costs and risks to the public, including threats to human health and the environment. These lands, including National Forest System lands, are crucial for providing fresh drinking water, topsoil, oxygen, and moderating weather patterns. Surveys show that 80% of Americans believe National Forest System lands should be protected like national parks. They want all Federal public lands, including rivers and resources, safeguarded from harm. The lands should not be developed, leased, sold, or exploited for timber, minerals, or other resources. PROHIBITIONS ON COMMERCIAL EXTRACTION ON FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS. Federal public lands must be fully protected from all forms of development and harm, including tree cutting, road building, logging, mining, grazing, drilling, water degradation, motorized trail and recreation area development, and commercial recreational building. No exceptions are allowed, and these lands cannot be leased, sold, exchanged, or exploited for resources. The term \"lands\" refers to federally-owned lands and waters within various national parks, forests, monuments, wildlife refuges, and other designated areas. All roads on federal public lands must be inventoried, with essential roads maintained and unnecessary ones obliterated and revegetated within 10 years. Federal agencies must also prepare inventories of federal public lands by acre, roads, rivers, and streams. The inventory of federal public lands must include a description of the status and condition of the lands, with recommendations for restoring natural conditions. Fires, insects, disease, and other natural forces are considered part of a healthy ecosystem, and no further attempts to correct for them shall occur on federal public lands. Enforcement aims to ensure widespread compliance with this section. Congress finds that violations of prohibitions on Federal public lands injure all people of the United States. Enforcement of this section will be carried out by Federal agencies and the Attorney General. Citizens harmed by violations can enforce this section through legal action in any district court, with a preponderance of evidence as the standard of proof. The court will impose a damage award of not less than $5,000 nor more than 1,000 times the value of the damaged public assets for violations of prohibitions on Federal public lands. In addition to the damage award, the court may issue injunctions, award litigation costs, and order seizure and forfeiture of assets belonging to the violator. The damage award must be paid to the United States Treasury. Damage awards for violations on Federal public lands must be paid from the United States Treasury within 40 days after judgment. The United States waives its sovereign immunity in all actions under this subsection. No notice is required to enforce this section. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will be in effect upon enactment."
