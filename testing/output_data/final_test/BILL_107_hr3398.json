    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer and Retail Sales Stimulus Act of 2001\" provides state and local sales tax relief for consumers. The Secretary will reimburse each State for uncollected State and local sales tax during the sales tax holiday period. Reimbursement includes an amount based on sales tax collected in 2000 with an acceleration factor and an additional 1 percent for State administrative costs. The Secretary will reimburse each State for uncollected State and local sales tax during the sales tax holiday period, with the reimbursement amount based on specific calculations. The State must inform the Secretary of their intention to qualify for reimbursement by not collecting sales tax during the holiday period. During the sales tax holiday period, the chief executive officer of a State must inform the Secretary and retail sellers of tangible property about the intention to elect for reimbursement of a reconciliation amount. This notification must be done within 10 days of the enactment of the Act. The chief executive officer must inform the Secretary and retail sellers of the intention to elect for reimbursement of a reconciliation amount within 10 days of the Act's enactment. Additional information may be required for reporting periods, including the sales tax holiday period. The CEO must report the determined amount to the Secretary and Director of Management and Budget within 45 days after the holiday period. If the paid amount exceeds the determined amount, the CEO agrees to remit the excess to the Secretary. The CEO agrees to remit any excess amount to the Secretary within 60 days after the sales tax holiday period. If a retail seller is unable to report taxable sales during the holiday period, their reported sales revenue will be considered a good faith effort to comply with the requirements. The CEO of a home rule State must certify that all local governments agree to provide a sales tax holiday. The State's CEO must also pay each local government's share of reimbursement within 20 days. Retail sellers making a good faith effort to comply with requirements will not be held liable for errors unless they act recklessly or fraudulently. The Director of Management and Budget certifies reimbursement amounts for states under subsection (b)(2) based on reports by chief executive officers. Local government reimbursement is based on the ratio of local sales tax to State sales tax. The term \"home rule State\" refers to a state that does not control local taxes. \"Local\" refers to subordinate revenue authorities within a state. \"Sales tax\" is a tax on retail sales of tangible property or services, collected by retail sellers from purchasers.

The \"sales tax holiday period\" is a 30-day period starting on the 21st day after the enactment of the Act, and the \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. The term \"State\" includes states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The use tax applies to the storage, use, or consumption of tangible property not subject to sales tax."
