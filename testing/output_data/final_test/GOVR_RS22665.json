    "content": "The saga of Massachusetts v. EPA began in 1999 when environmental organizations petitioned EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under CAA Section 202(a)(1). Despite receiving 50,000 comments, EPA denied the petition in 2003, citing a General Counsel memorandum that concluded the CAA does not grant authority to regulate CO2 and other GHGs. The EPA denied a petition to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under CAA Section 202(a)(1) in 2003, citing a General Counsel memorandum that concluded the CAA does not grant authority to regulate CO2 and other GHGs. This denial led to a lawsuit, Massachusetts v. EPA, in the D.C. Circuit involving multiple states, cities, territories, environmental groups, and trade groups. In 2005, a split panel of the D.C. Circuit rejected a lawsuit challenging EPA's denial of regulating GHG emissions from motor vehicles under CAA Section 202(a)(1). Judge Randolph supported the rejection, stating that EPA had the discretion not to regulate based on policy considerations. This included the George W. Bush Administration's preference for voluntary GHG control measures. The D.C. Circuit rejected a lawsuit challenging EPA's denial of regulating GHG emissions from motor vehicles under CAA Section 202(a)(1). Judge Tatel asserted that Massachusetts had standing due to climate-change-induced sea level rise. He found that EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions and that discretion does not extend to policy considerations. The Supreme Court agreed to review the decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of petitioner states and environmental groups in Massachusetts v. EPA, authorizing regulation of GHG emissions under CAA Section 202(a)(1). The Court found that EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and cannot inject policy considerations into its decision. The decision was based on the documented rise in global temperatures and carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA authorized regulation of GHG emissions under CAA Section 202(a)(1). The Court found that petitioners had standing to sue based on specific factors in their favor, including the injury to Massachusetts's shore land from global-warming-induced sea level rise. The Court emphasized the quasi-sovereign duty of states to preserve their territory in climate change litigation. The Court emphasized the quasi-sovereign duty of states to preserve their territory in climate change litigation, focusing on Massachusetts's injury as owner of shore land. EPA acknowledged the causal relationship between GHG emissions and climate change but disputed the effectiveness of reducing emissions through litigation. The Court ruled that even a small reduction in GHG emissions could be significant for environmental plaintiffs, as it could help slow or reduce climate change. The remedy sought was EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, which was deemed likely to redress the plaintiff's injury. The Court emphasized the importance of addressing the potential effects of climate change. The Court emphasized the significance of even a small reduction in GHG emissions for environmental plaintiffs to help slow climate change. It ruled in favor of EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, rejecting EPA's argument that GHGs are not included in the CAA's definition of \"air pollutant.\" The Court ruled in favor of EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, rejecting EPA's argument that GHGs are not included in the CAA's definition of \"air pollutant.\" Congress intended to limit EPA's use of mandatory regulations for air pollutants, and the Court narrowly interpreted the Administrator's discretion in setting emission standards. The Court ruled in favor of EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, stating that EPA must base its reasons for action or inaction on the statute. The D.C. Circuit vacated EPA's denial of the rulemaking petition and remanded the matter to the agency. Chief Justice Roberts dissented on the finding of standing. The Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA required EPA to find that new motor vehicle GHG emissions may \"endanger public health or welfare\" in order to limit them under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. EPA took this option in 2009, leading to efforts to control GHG emissions under various CAA programs. The EPA has been regulating GHG emissions since the Section 202 \"endangerment\" finding in 2009, including emissions from new motor vehicles and stationary sources. The Clean Power Plan rule aimed to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants, but it was stayed by the Supreme Court. The Massachusetts v. EPA decision still stands, allowing EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles unless reversed by the Supreme Court or Congress. The Massachusetts v. EPA decision has not been helpful to non-state plaintiffs in other climate change cases. It has been used to bar federal common law claims related to climate change, strengthening the argument that the Clean Air Act intended to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to a defeat for the \"environmental\" side in federal cases. The 2011 ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA led to the defeat of the \"environmental\" side in federal common law cases. EPA proceeded to regulate GHGs under CAA authorities for stationary sources, triggering regulations under the PSD program and Title V permitting program. In Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (UARG) in 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from power plants under the CAA. The Court in UARG affirmed EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants under the CAA, but clarified that EPA cannot always treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant in all contexts. The Massachusetts ruling upheld CAA coverage of Section 202, allowing EPA to exclude greenhouse gases from regulation in certain cases where inclusion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. The Massachusetts ruling upheld CAA coverage of Section 202 GHG emissions, leading to a 2010 litigation settlement committing EPA to establish NSPSs for new fossil fuel power plants and emission guidelines for existing ones under CAA Section 111. EPA published these rules in October 2015, both of which are being challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Clean Power Plan, one of the rules, is currently stayed during litigation. EPA's \"endangerment findings\" post-Massachusetts are objected to by some amici curiae, but the petitioners and intervenors challenging the Clean Power Plan do not dispute or reference the decision. The EPA defends the Clean Power Plan by referencing the Massachusetts ruling, which has implications beyond the current litigation. The ruling affirmed the CAA's coverage of GHG emissions and has influenced EPA's clean air program. Key terms discussed include \"air pollutant,\" \"in his judgment,\" and \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.\""
