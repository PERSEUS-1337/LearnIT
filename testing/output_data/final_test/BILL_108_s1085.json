    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Reclamation Rural and Small Community Water Enhancement Act\" and defines terms like \"Federal reclamation laws\" and \"regional rural water supply system\". The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the \"Secretary\". The Act grants general authority. The Secretary is directed to investigate and identify opportunities for safe regional rural water supply systems in small communities and rural areas. The Act allows for exceptions for towns with populations over 40,000 if they are critical partners in the proposed water supply system. The Secretary may consider a non-federal cost share exceeding the set percentage for a feasibility study of a regional rural water supply system serving a community with over 40,000 people. The program is limited to specific states, areas, and Indian reservation lands. The Secretary is authorized to make agreements and regulations to implement the Act. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND PLANNING. The Secretary must consult and coordinate with other agencies to develop criteria for the program. A report on the consultation and criteria must be submitted to the Senate and House committees. Within one year of enactment, the Secretary must report on the status and plan for completing rural water projects authorized before the Act. The Secretary must ensure completion of rural water projects within specified time frames. SEC. 5. APPRAISAL INVESTIGATIONS. The Secretary may conduct appraisal investigations at the request of a local sponsor to identify opportunities for regional rural water supply systems and enhance existing systems for small communities and rural areas. Considerations include the need for the system, alternative water supply options, and feasibility study recommendations. The Secretary conducts appraisal investigations to identify opportunities for regional rural water supply systems and enhance existing systems for small communities and rural areas. Key considerations include projected demand, environmental, public health and safety, Indian trust responsibility, and the availability of other Federal authorities or programs. Consultation and cooperation with various authorities are required during the investigation. The Secretary conducts appraisal investigations to identify opportunities for regional rural water supply systems and enhance existing systems for small communities and rural areas. Key considerations include projected demand, environmental, public health and safety, Indian trust responsibility, and the availability of other Federal authorities or programs. Costs of the investigations are nonreimbursable, and results are made public upon request and published in the Federal Register. \"Feasibility studies are conducted by the Secretary to identify opportunities for regional rural water supply systems and enhance existing systems for small communities and rural areas.\" The Secretary is authorized to participate in feasibility studies for regional rural water supply systems, with the Federal share not exceeding 50% of the total cost. The Federal share may be increased in cases of financial hardship for non-Federal participants. In-kind services can be accepted as part of the non-Federal cost share. Feasibility studies for regional rural water supply systems under this Act must consider factors such as water supply availability, water demand, public health and safety, environmental concerns, water conservation opportunities, and construction and operation costs. The feasibility studies for regional rural water supply systems must assess construction costs, operation and maintenance costs, communities' ability to pay, mitigation of fish and wildlife losses, coordination of assistance from Federal programs. The Secretary will utilize engineering reports from state, tribal, regional, or local authorities for feasibility studies. Results of feasibility studies will be made public, and no new requirements will be imposed on rural water projects already authorized. Authorization is granted to appropriate necessary funds for implementing the provisions of this Act."
