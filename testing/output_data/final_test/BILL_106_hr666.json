    "content": "The Act titled the \"National Materials Corridor Partnership Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that the region adjacent to the 2,000-mile border between the United States and Mexico is vital for energy-intensive manufacturing and materials industries, with over 800 multinational firms investing over $1 billion in the border regions of San Diego, California, Tijuana, Baja California, El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Chihuahua. Materials industries on both sides of the border generate over $6.8 billion in annual commerce on the Mexican side alone. The United States and Mexico have significant academic and research activities in materials, with the US investing approximately $1 billion annually in materials research. Major institutions like the Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Department of Defense are involved. Both countries have cooperative programs addressing natural resources, environment, and public health in the border region. Scientific and technical advances in materials processing offer opportunities to improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, use recycled resources, and minimize industrial waste. These advances benefit both sides of the United States-Mexico border by promoting environmentally friendly economic development. In 1998, the United States-Mexico Foundation for Science Cooperation prioritized promoting energy-efficient clean materials industries in the border region. Mexico proposed a joint funding initiative for a Materials Corridor Partnership, with $1,000,000 from Mexico if matched by the United States. The Materials Corridor Council was established in 1998 by academic and research institutions in border States of both countries, along with private sector partners, to implement cooperative efforts. The Materials Corridor Council implements a cooperative program for materials research, education, and sustainable industrial development as part of the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative. Successful implementation would advance US energy, environmental, and economic goals in the border region and serve as a model for similar initiatives worldwide. The Act aims to establish a program supporting the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative for energy-efficient economic development along the US-Mexico border through new materials technology. The program will be overseen by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will establish a program to promote energy-efficient economic development along the US-Mexico border through new materials technology. The program will involve collaboration with various federal agencies. The Secretary will collaborate with various federal agencies, private sector organizations, and Mexican entities to promote energy-efficient economic development along the US-Mexico border through research, development, education, and training activities. Private sector participation is encouraged, and Mexican organizations are urged to contribute resources to the program. In conducting the program, the Secretary will emphasize the transfer and use of materials technology developed by the national laboratories of the Department of Energy before the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. ACTIVITIES AND MAJOR PROGRAM ELEMENTS. Activities under this Act focus on research, development, education, and training related to materials, energy efficiency, emission reduction, waste minimization, and the use of recycled resources. The program includes applied research to advance materials technologies. The program focuses on research, development, education, and training in materials technologies for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Applied research projects involve private sector participation, while basic research projects are typically led by academic institutions. The program focuses on research, development, education, and training in materials technologies for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Projects under paragraph (1)(B) should typically be led by an academic or research institution. SEC. 7. PARTICIPATION OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES OTHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. The Secretary must enter into an agreement with departments and agencies for program coordination and implementation within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Actions taken under the agreement are the responsibility of the respective department or agency and do not require Secretary approval. Funds for the program can be used for research, development, education, and training activities by various organizations in the United States. Funds can be transferred to departments and agencies for program implementation under the Act. State and local governments, as well as organizations in Mexico, can receive funds if they contribute significantly to the project. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee with representatives from various sectors. The committee will consult and coordinate with departments and agencies receiving funds under the Act. Financial and technical assistance will be provided under the Act. Federal departments and agencies participating in the program may provide financial and technical assistance to other organizations for the purpose of the program. Cooperative agreements are encouraged for funding applied research activities by organizations outside the Federal Government, with exceptions for national laboratories. The Federal Government will cover a portion of the funding for these activities. The Federal Government will pay up to 50% of the cost of applied research activities under the program. No funds or resources outside the project scope can be used towards the non-Federal share. Federal departments will use grants for basic research and education by non-government organizations. National laboratories conducting basic research or education activities may use a funding method other than a grant for administrative convenience. The Federal Government can fund 100% of the cost of these activities. Projects funded under the program will be competitively selected based on criteria determined by the Secretary. Federal departments and agencies may waive Government accounting standards for organizations participating in the program. GAAP standards are required for program projects, and program funds cannot be used for construction. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004."
