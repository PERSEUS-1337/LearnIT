    "content": "The ESEA, amended by ESSA, outlines state assessment requirements for Title I-A funding, aiding disadvantaged students in low-income schools. States, LEAs, and schools must meet standards for accountability. All states receive Title I-A funds, with a FY2017 budget of $15.5 billion. High-quality academic assessments in reading are mandated by the ESEA. The ESEA requires states to implement high-quality academic assessments in reading, mathematics, and science for students in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school. States must also test students in science at least once within three grade spans. The ESSA provides states with flexibility in meeting assessment requirements, allowing them to choose between one summative assessment or multiple interim assessments. Additionally, states can now use \"nationally recognized tests\" to fulfill the high school assessment requirement. The ESSA allows states to use \"nationally recognized tests\" for high school assessments, aligning with state standards. It also permits alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities and computer adaptive assessments. Additionally, there are exceptions for 8th-grade students taking advanced math and a demonstration authority for states to create innovative assessment systems. The ESSA allows states to create innovative assessment systems, including competency-based assessments, to validate student readiness for mastery. It also permits the Secretary of Education to reserve funds for assessment audits. This report describes ESEA assessment requirements and discusses new flexibility for states. This report discusses issues related to student assessment, including student growth, assessments for students with disabilities and English learners, computer adaptive assessments, participation requirements, and testing burden. States face challenges in implementing these changes while maintaining assessment validity and reliability. States are required to administer 17 assessments annually in reading, mathematics, and science, typically using summative assessments for state accountability differentiation. The report focuses on assessments required in Title I-A of the ESEA, detailing academic assessment requirements and changes made by the ESSA. It also discusses the State Assessment Grants program and the Secretary's new ability to reserve funds. The report discusses the Secretary's new ability to reserve funds for competitive grants under the State Assessment Grants program and the ESSA's authority on innovative assessments. It examines current ESEA assessment requirements, including content areas, grades assessed, student participation, assessment properties, new options, and public information. States must implement high-quality academic assessments in reading, math, and science annually in grades 3 through 8, as required by the ESEA both before and after the ESSA implementation. Under the ESEA, academic assessments in reading and mathematics must be administered annually in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school. Science assessments must be given at least once within three grade spans. Assessments in other grades and subjects may be given at the state's discretion, but all assessments must align with state standards and provide information on student achievement. Results are used in the state's accountability system to differentiate school performance. States must measure the achievement of at least 95% of all students annually. The ESSA requires states to ensure that at least 95% of all students and each subgroup take the required academic assessments. These assessments must align with state standards and be used to measure student achievement. There are provisions for students with disabilities and English learners, including alternate assessments and assessments in the most appropriate language. The ESSA also added provisions for a parent's right to opt their child out of assessments. The ESSA requires states to ensure high assessment participation rates and align assessments with state standards. Parents have the right to opt their child out of assessments, and states must provide information on this option. State assessments must meet requirements on format, administration, and quality, including measuring higher-order thinking skills. The ESSA allows flexibility in assessment administration, such as using measures of student growth and alternative assessment formats like portfolios or projects. The ESSA provides flexibility in state assessment administration, allowing for either a single summative assessment or multiple interim assessments leading to a single score. States can set limits on assessment time as a percentage of instructional hours. States must ensure assessments meet technical quality standards and provide evidence of this. Under the ESSA, states must provide evidence of assessment validity and reliability on the SEA's website. Assessments must align with professional standards and measure academic achievement objectively. The ESSA allows for multiple measures of academic achievement and authorizes new assessment options for high school assessments. The ESSA requires high school assessments to align with state standards, provide valid and reliable data, meet general assessment requirements, and differentiate between schools. It also authorizes the use of computer adaptive assessments, clarifying that they can be used as state assessments. The ESSA allows for computer adaptive assessments to be used as state assessments, with the requirement that they measure each student's academic proficiency in state standards for their grade level and growth towards those standards. There is an exception for 8th grade students taking advanced mathematics, who can take an end-of-course assessment instead of the 8th grade mathematics assessment under certain conditions. The ESSA allows for computer adaptive assessments to be used as state assessments, with specific requirements for each LEA receiving funds under Title I-A to provide information to the public regarding state assessments. This includes details on the subject matter being assessed, the purpose of the assessment, the source of the requirement, time spent on assessments, assessment schedule, and reporting format. These assessments are part of a state accountability system that determines school performance. Prior to ESSA, states determined school accountability based on student performance in math and reading assessments, graduation rates, and assessment participation. Failure to meet these requirements for two consecutive years triggered accountability consequences. States had to set proficiency goals in math and reading. Under the accountability system prior to the enactment of the ESSA, schools and LEAs faced consequences for not meeting proficiency goals in math and reading assessments. This high-stakes system could result in schools failing to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and implementing improvement requirements. The ESSA has since made changes to the accountability system to reduce the high-stakes nature of assessment results. Under the ESSA, changes have been made to the accountability system to reduce the high-stakes association between student assessment results and school improvement identification. The state must establish a system for differentiating public schools based on various indicators, including student proficiency in math and reading. This system helps identify low-achieving schools and determines which ones need additional support to improve student achievement. Under ESSA, State Education Agencies (SEAs) identify low-achieving schools for comprehensive support and improvement, including the lowest-performing 5% of Title I-A funded schools, public high schools with low graduation rates, schools not improving despite targeted support, and other statewide categories at the state's discretion. SEAs also flag subgroups of consistently underperforming students for targeted support. The number of schools subject to accountability requirements varies by state's identification method. The ESSA has led to a decrease in the number of schools subject to outcome accountability requirements, shifting the emphasis away from high-stakes assessments. States now have more control over how assessment results are used in the accountability system, determining which schools need support based on various indicators. The ESEA authorizes funding for State Assessment Grants through formula and competitive grants based on trigger amounts. The allocation of funds depends on the annual appropriation level, with a portion reserved for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas. The ESEA authorizes State Assessment Grants funding through formula and competitive grants based on trigger amounts. The Secretary can reserve funds for assessment system audits and provide each state with a minimum grant of $3 million. Any excess funds are allocated to states based on student population. Additional funds can be awarded through a competitive grant process for assessment activities. The ESSA allows the Secretary to reserve funds for state assessment system audits from the formula grant portion of the program. The Secretary can reserve up to 20% of funds for state assessment formula grants to conduct audits. States receive annual grants of at least $1.5 million for audits and to provide subgrants to LEAs. States must submit an application detailing the audit, stakeholder participation, and subgrants. Each state must ensure LEAs conduct local assessment audits and develop a plan to improve the assessment system. The ESEA as amended by the ESSA allows for the development of innovative assessment systems, including competency-based assessments, instructionally embedded assessments, and performance-based assessments. States or consortia of states can apply for this demonstration authority, with a maximum of seven SEAs eligible. Funding is not provided separately for this authority. States or consortia may apply for an initial three-year demonstration period to develop and implement innovative assessment systems using existing grant funding. If successful, they can apply for a two-year extension to transition the system statewide. If all requirements are met, the state can continue operating the innovative assessment system. Applications must show that the assessments meet state requirements. States or consortia can apply for a three-year demonstration period to develop and implement innovative assessment systems. If successful, they can apply for a two-year extension to transition the system statewide. The innovative assessments must meet all state requirements, including being aligned with state achievement standards. States have the authority to select their own assessments and academic standards for grades 3-8, using state-specific or common assessments. The ESSA allows states to use state-specific, common, end-of-course, or nationally recognized assessments for high school subjects. NCLB expanded state assessments aligned with academic content. Examples of how states meet ESEA requirements are discussed. In 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative was established by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to create common standards for reading and mathematics, aiming to provide college- and career-readiness guidelines for high school graduates. This initiative aimed to address the lack of standardization in state-specific academic assessments and content standards, allowing for better comparison of student performance across states. The Obama Administration supported the adoption of common standards and assessments in schools through initiatives like Race to the Top State Grants and ESEA flexibility package. Federal government did not develop the standards but incentivized their implementation. Department of Education funded the development of assessments aligned with the standards. The RTT CAS Grant program funded two consortia of states to develop new assessment systems aligned with Common Core State Standards. PARCC and SBAC were the winning consortia with 25 and 31 states respectively. The Obama Administration offered ESEA flexibility waivers to states that adopted college- and career-ready standards. The Obama Administration encouraged states to adopt college- and career-ready standards in reading and mathematics, along with aligned assessments. Initial interest in common assessment administration was high, but participation declined in later years. Both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations supported measuring student achievement based on growth rather than proficiency only, with waivers allowing states to incorporate measures of student growth into their accountability systems. The pilot waiver allowed states to include student growth measures in their accountability systems for AYP. The Obama Administration required assessments to measure student growth in grades 3-8 and high school to receive waivers. ECS and Education Week collect data on state assessments for Title I-A requirements. The most recent surveys were published in January and February 2017. Based on data collected by ECS and Education Week, states used various assessments in the 2015-2016 school year for their state plans under ESEA. Some states used a combination of common assessments, state-specific assessments, end-of-course exams, and nationally recognized high school academic assessments. Michigan, Louisiana, and Massachusetts implemented blended approaches, while other states relied solely on common assessments like SBAC. In the 2015-2016 school year, states used various assessments for their state plans under ESEA. Some states used a combination of common assessments, state-specific assessments, end-of-course exams, and nationally recognized high school academic assessments. Seven states used only SBAC assessments, and four states used only PARCC. States have been submitting ESEA consolidated state plans to receive funding under Title I-A in 2017, with each state's plan needing approval by the Secretary. All states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were required to submit ESEA state plans to ED by April 3, 2017, or September 18, 2017, to continue receiving funding under various ESEA formula grant programs. States have indicated in their approved plans that they expect to use combinations of assessments to meet Title I-A requirements. States have more flexibility in using assessments for accountability purposes under the ESEA as amended by the ESSA. Changes to Title I-A requirements must be implemented to maintain the validity and reliability of state assessments for effective state accountability systems. Understanding how student achievement is measured with assessments is crucial for state accountability determinations. The section discusses various assessment-related issues under ESSA-enacted changes, including student growth, special needs assessments, computer adaptive assessments, student opt-out practices, and testing burden. It highlights how these adjustments aim to improve the use of assessments in accountability systems. Valid and reliable uses of assessments for accountability purposes are also addressed, drawing from reauthorization discourse and NCLB provisions. Prior to the enactment of ESSA, state accountability systems focused solely on reporting student proficiency, which has been criticized for not accurately measuring school quality or teacher effectiveness. This singular focus on proficiency led to unintended consequences, such as instruction being targeted towards students just below the proficient level. Under ESSA, schools and teachers may have focused on raising the percentage of proficient students, potentially neglecting those below or above proficiency levels. Education policy groups advocate for a \"performance index\" to measure achievement instead of solely focusing on proficiency. Some groups propose using a \"performance index\" or average scale scores to measure achievement under ESSA, aiming to incentivize schools to improve all students' achievement levels. Scale scores allow for more accurate comparisons across students, subgroups, and schools over time. The ESEA as amended by the ESSA allows for student achievement to be measured using student growth in addition to proficiency on required assessments. States can choose to incorporate measures of student growth into their accountability systems, with the type of growth model selected depending on various factors. The selection of an assessment can impact the choices states have in developing and implementing growth models. Different types of growth models are used by states to measure student growth, including state-set targets, student growth percentiles (SGPs), and SAS EVAAS. State-set targets measure student growth or reaching performance benchmarks, SGPs compare a student's growth to peers, and SAS EVAAS measures value-added growth. The model measures value-added growth, which is the additional positive effect on student achievement above expected growth. The CCSSO outlined considerations for growth models in ESEA accountability systems, identifying five common models like gain scores. Gain scores are calculated by subtracting earlier test scores from later ones. The use of gain scores in assessment requires a vertical scale for a common scale across grade levels. Growth rates are calculated by fitting a \"trend line\" across assessment data points. Student growth percentiles compare academic achievement to peers, reported as percentiles. Transition tables use growth in discrete performance levels. Residual models, also known as \"value-added\" models, analyze external factors affecting student growth over time, like teacher or school influence. They compare class, school, or LEA performance to expected changes without a vertical scale. Some caution against using growth models that measure progress towards proficiency standards. When measuring student growth, using a \"growth to proficiency\" model allows for weighting different types of growth to incentivize progress towards proficiency standards. This approach ensures that accountability systems can evaluate student learning over time effectively. Measuring student growth over time is a more valid measure of school accountability than proficiency alone. Schools should not be penalized for low achieving students as long as they meet growth targets. This growth model considers factors within the school's control and relies on reliable assessments. Special provisions are in place for students with disabilities and English learners to participate in annual academic assessments. The section discusses how students with disabilities and English learners are included in state accountability systems through various assessments. States must include all students with disabilities in the statewide assessment system and disaggregate their results. Most students with disabilities take regular academic assessments with their peers, but special provisions are in place to ensure their full participation. The ESEA requires state assessments to be developed using universal design for learning principles, which include providing multiple means of representation, action, and engagement to reduce cognitive burden. This helps in limiting complex language and visual clutter in assessments. States are also required to provide appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities. The ESEA requires states to provide appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities to ensure the validity of assessments. Accommodations aim to prevent interference with the measurement of a student's true ability. Additionally, the ESSA allows for alternate assessments aligned with alternate standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities. States must develop guidelines to identify students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities\" for participation in alternate assessments. The student's IEP team determines eligibility on a case-by-case basis, informing parents of the decision's implications on receiving a regular high school diploma. Students with intellectual disabilities, autism, or multiple disabilities may be eligible for an alternate assessment that aligns with alternate achievement standards. The \"1% cap\" limits the total number of students assessed in each content area to 1% of all tested students in the state, with no LEA-level cap. States must provide oversight for any LEA exceeding the cap, and scores over the limit are considered nonproficient in the state's accountability system. An alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards is considered more valid for students with significant cognitive disabilities as it aligns better with their academic content standards. However, there may be reliability issues due to different test formats such as portfolio assessments or rating scales. Using assessment scoring based on a rubric reflecting student mastery of alternate achievement standards is crucial for maintaining validity in the accountability system. Inter-scorer agreement is essential to ensure consistent and reliable rating of student performance. Inaccurate scoring could lead to misclassification of students with significant cognitive disabilities as \"proficient.\" States must include all English Learners (ELs) in the statewide assessment system and provide separate assessments for English language proficiency (ELP) and statewide accountability. ELs' participation in assessments varies based on language proficiency and years of schooling in the US. States must ensure that all LEAs provide an annual assessment of English language proficiency for ELs, aligned to state standards in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Most states use the WIDA consortium for ELP assessments, with ACCESS 2.0 being the most common test. The consortium updated achievement standards in 2017 to align with college- and career-readiness standards, leading to some states reporting declines in proficiency levels. Some states are seeing declines in English language proficiency levels for EL students due to updated achievement standards. This may result in longer inclusion of EL students in accountability determinations. States are required to assess ELs in reading, math, and science, with accommodations and assessments in their most accurate language. ELs must be assessed in English after three years in U.S. schools, but LEAs can decide on a case-by-case basis. The ESSA allows LEAs to assess EL students in a different language for up to two additional years if they have not reached English proficiency for reading assessments. States can exclude EL students from one reading assessment if they have been in the U.S. for less than 12 months. Recently arrived EL students can be assessed in reading and math but their results may be excluded from the state's accountability system. The ESSA allows states to include ELs' scores in the EL subgroup for up to four years after they cease to be identified as ELs, due to changes in English language proficiency standards for tests. The ESSA allows states to include ELs' scores in the EL subgroup for up to four years after they cease to be identified as ELs, due to changes in English language proficiency standards for tests. This change may result in ELs remaining in the subgroup for a longer time, potentially improving subgroup performance over time. The ESEA as amended by the ESSA permits the use of computer adaptive assessments to meet Title I-A requirements. The ESSA authorizes the use of computer adaptive assessments to meet Title I-A requirements. It clarifies that all students taking the assessment do not need to receive the same assessment items, as computer adaptive assessments adjust to individual abilities. Computer adaptive assessments adjust to individual abilities by administering more difficult items as students answer correctly, reaching a \"ceiling\" when all difficult items are completed or a certain number of incorrect answers are reached. These assessments measure academic proficiency based on state standards and can assess above or below grade level. Computer adaptive assessments are used to measure student growth and are authorized for alternate assessments for students with disabilities and English language proficiency assessments for ELs. Concerns include administration time for high-achieving students and accurate measurement of special populations with inconsistent knowledge within a content area. Some concerns with computer adaptive assessments include potential issues with measuring students with inconsistent knowledge within a subject area, as well as the possibility of testing computer literacy skills instead of content knowledge in reading and mathematics. Other issues raised relate to technical, financial, and reporting aspects of using computer adaptive assessments in schools. Using computer adaptive assessments in schools requires computers available to students, software purchase, technical staff for setup and troubleshooting, and teacher training. Computer assessments can be scored faster than paper-and-pencil tests, providing immediate feedback. Statewide assessment systems mandate assessing all students, with a 95% reporting requirement for accountability. The ESSA mandates that at least 95% of assessment results are reported for accountability, ensuring validity and reliability in school differentiation based on academic achievement. Parents have rights regarding student participation in assessments, with provisions allowing them to opt their child out of assessments if desired. Excessive numbers of opt-outs may undermine the validity of student achievement measurement in statewide assessments under the ESEA, potentially impacting the state's accountability system. In education research, a representative sample of students is carefully selected to reflect the whole population in terms of demographic characteristics. States under the ESEA are required to assess all students, and large numbers opting out may create an unrepresentative sample. The ESEA requires states to assess all students, but large numbers opting out may lead to an unrepresentative sample, affecting the accuracy of assessment results in the accountability system. The emphasis on educational assessment in federal policies has sparked debate on the time spent on testing in schools. Test-based accountability in schools can lead to a narrowing of the curriculum by increasing test preparation activities, taking away from instructional time, and reallocating time towards tested subjects. Teachers may feel pressure to \"teach to the test\" and engage in test preparation at the expense of broader instruction. Test preparation in schools can impact the validity of test scores, with a fine line between appropriate and inappropriate methods. While some preparation can benefit students unfamiliar with standardized testing, excessive alignment with test items, coaching, or cheating can compromise validity. Score inflation is a concern in high-stakes assessments due to the overuse of test preparation strategies, which can lead to discrepancies in student achievement levels and gaps. Studies have shown that comparing gains on state assessments to low-stakes assessments like NAEP can reveal the presence of score inflation. LEAs may be hesitant to provide test scores for research purposes, making it challenging to study the prevalence of score inflation. The ESSA added provisions to reduce testing burden by setting limits on the time spent on assessments for each grade, requiring information on the subject, purpose, source, and time spent on assessments. This aims to address concerns of score inflation in state assessments compared to low-stakes assessments like NAEP. The Secretary may reserve funds under the State Assessment Grant program to provide grants for conducting audit assessments to determine the necessity of tests used in a state and to provide subgrants to LEAs for a similar examination of assessments used at the LEA level."
