    "content": "Congress faces key issues in legislation regarding the sale or lease of federal lands and resources, including determining prices and how receipts should be used. This presents opportunities to increase federal receipts or reduce the deficit, but historically a portion of receipts has gone to state and local governments. Congress can choose how fees or prices are established, with some being competitively bid while others are set by law or administratively. Administered prices for federal land sales, such as grazing fees, have sparked debate over their fairness and impact on industries. Critics argue that low fees for BLM and USFS grazing are a subsidy to ranchers, while others believe higher fees could harm ranching operations. Hardrock mining fees cover administrative costs but do not share mineral value. The federal government collects fees for grazing on public lands, sparking debate over fairness and impact. Critics argue low fees are a subsidy to ranchers, while others fear higher fees could harm ranching operations. Hardrock mining fees cover administrative costs but do not share mineral value. Congress decides how to allocate receipts from land and resource sales, with debates over mandatory spending authority and how the funds should be used. The federal government collects fees for various purposes, including reducing the fiscal burden on taxpayers and funding activities to restore lands. Receipts from land sales are used for federal land management programs, with the BLM having the authority to sell lands it administers. Land sale authority is limited for other agencies like the USFS, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service. The federal government collects fees from land sales for various purposes, including funding land management programs. Prices for land sales are based on fair market value, with different pricing provisions under various authorities. A portion of receipts in Reclamation states are deposited in the Reclamation Fund, and 4% of land sale receipts are permanently appropriated to the states. FLTFA allocates 96% of land sale receipts permanently. Under FLTFA, 96% of land sale receipts are permanently appropriated to acquire inholdings and adjacent nonfederal lands with exceptional resources in the state where the receipts were generated.

Additionally, 10% of SNLPMA receipts go to the Southern Nevada Water Authority, and 5% to state payments. The Nevada Water Authority allocates a percentage of land sale receipts to the State of Nevada General Education Fund and the General Treasury. Recreational activities on federal lands are authorized, with fees charged under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. Restrictions may be imposed in certain areas to prevent conflicts between different recreational uses. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act establishes different fees for federal land management agencies, including entrance, amenity, and special recreation permit fees. The law aims to ensure fair and consistent fees, considering comparable fees charged by private providers. Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must minimize confusion and overlap of fees for recreation users and providers. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act directs the establishment of minimum fees and prohibits collecting multiple fees for similar purposes. All receipts are deposited into designated accounts for each agency and are permanently appropriated. 80% of receipts are to be used at the site where they were generated for visitor services, maintenance, and facility restoration, with the remaining funds available at the agency's discretion. Additional provisions govern the distribution of certain collections, including from the sale of recreation passes. The USFS and BLM sell timber from federal lands, with the majority coming from Oregon and California grant lands. Sales are based on land management plans, with prices set through competitive bids. Stumpage rights are sold for varying amounts of trees or acres, with fluctuating annual receipts.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and US Forest Service (USFS) establish grazing allotments for ranchers on federal lands, issuing permits or leases for specified numbers of private livestock. Fees are charged based on a formula set in the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 to represent the fair market value of grazing. The fair market value of grazing on federal lands is determined by a formula with a base value of $1.23 per animal unit month (AUM). The current fee is $1.35 per AUM for the period of March 1, 2011, to February 28, 2012.
