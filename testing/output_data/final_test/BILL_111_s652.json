The grant application for integrated health care delivery systems in defined communities must clearly define the community to be served, identify participating providers, describe proposed activities, and demonstrate the coalition's ability to build on the current system. The coalition must demonstrate the ability to develop coordinated systems of care that provide a broad range of high-quality services, involve the community, including the business community, and ensure continuity of care. The coalition must ensure individuals are enrolled in health coverage programs, leverage various revenue sources for sustainability, and have a plan for evaluating program activities to improve system performance. The eligible entity must demonstrate fiscal responsibility and commitment to serving the community by providing free or reduced charge care for the poor. An entity may receive a grant for up to 3 consecutive fiscal years and request an extension for 2 additional years. In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary may prioritize applicants with the greatest unmet need for coordinated care and those who best promote the objectives of the program. The applicant must demonstrate inclusion of community providers serving uninsured or low-income individuals, expand preventive and primary care services, and propose approaches to improve healthcare access for the underserved. The applicant must demonstrate collaboration with State and local governments, use non-Federal contributions to the greatest extent possible, and show likelihood of sustainable integrated delivery system development. Grantees may use funds for direct expenses associated with healthcare services. The grant funds can be used for direct expenses related to integrating a healthcare delivery system to provide culturally competent services and fill gaps in patient care within the system. The grant funds can be used for various purposes including increasing outreach activities, improving care management, coordinating transportation to health care facilities, and developing provider networks.

The section discusses the allocation of funds for direct patient care, national program purposes, and reporting requirements for grantees under the program. The grantee's progress in meeting goals and objectives set in the grant application is evaluated based on the effectiveness, efficiency, and coordination of services for uninsured and low-income individuals. The impact on the quality of healthcare provided and cost savings are also assessed. The Secretary may award a grant under this section only if the applicant and providers agree to maintain their non-Federal fund expenditures at or above the previous fiscal year level. Technical assistance may be provided to grant recipients by the Secretary through grants or contracts with organizations experienced in community coalition building. The Secretary will evaluate the success of projects funded under this section in improving services in communities, including quality healthcare provision at lower costs.
