    "content": "The National Park System, administered by the National Park Service in the Department of the Interior, encompasses 84.6 million acres of land. Units range in size from less than one acre to millions of acres, with two-thirds of the total acreage in Alaska. Yellowstone was designated as the first national park in 1872, leading to the development of a system of national parks. The NPS was created in 1916 to protect and regulate these areas for conservation and public enjoyment. The National Park System, managed by the National Park Service, includes various units with different designations. These units are managed to preserve resources for future generations, with restrictions on consumptive resource uses. Some units allow specific activities like hunting and mining as specified by Congress. The National Park System includes various units with different designations, reflecting the diversity of the areas. Congress has discretion in choosing the type of designation for a unit being established. Some common designations include national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, and national historical parks. Of the 412 units within the National Park System, 59 are national parks, considered the crown jewels of the park system. The National Park System includes various units with different designations such as national historic sites, national monuments, national historical parks, national memorials, national recreation areas, and national preserves. National Park System units are created by acts of Congress, with national monuments also able to be added by presidential proclamation. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to create national monuments on federally owned land containing historic landmarks or objects of historic or scientific interest. Presidents have designated 150 monuments since 1906, with many later converted to national parks by Congress. Most monuments are managed by the National Park Service, while newer monuments may be managed by other agencies. Creating a National Park System unit involves defining its purpose, boundaries, land acquisition, planning, uses, and operations, as well as authorizing appropriations. Legislation for new units is typically under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Congress may pass standalone bills or include unit authorizations in omnibus public land laws. Prior to creating a new unit, Congress may authorize an NPS study of the area. In 1998, Congress amended existing law (P.L. 105-391) to standardize procedures for creating units in the National Park System. The law prioritizes areas, focuses on outstanding areas, and requires specific authorization from Congress for any area study before adding a unit. This change aimed to streamline the process by eliminating separate sources for initiating studies due to funding constraints. The National Park Service (NPS) has the authority to take certain actions costing less than $25,000 for preliminary activities like resource assessments and surveys. Studies of areas must be completed within three fiscal years, but often take longer due to the number of studies authorized by Congress and resource limitations. The average cost of a study is around $500,000, with completion times ranging from three to six years depending on complexity. Public involvement, including at least one public meeting, is required for all studies. The National Park Service (NPS) conducts studies costing around $500,000, with public involvement required, including at least one public meeting. Studies must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and consider factors to determine national significance, suitability, and feasibility of an area for addition to the system. The National Park Service evaluates areas for national significance based on their exceptional natural or cultural qualities, public enjoyment opportunities, and unspoiled resources. This includes considering natural areas critical for species survival or outstanding scenic areas, and cultural areas with exceptional heritage interpretation like districts, sites, or structures. The National Park Service evaluates areas for national significance based on exceptional natural or cultural qualities, public enjoyment opportunities, and unspoiled resources. They generally exclude certain types of properties and assess feasibility based on various factors like ownership, access, land use, threats, public support, and management costs. The National Park Service evaluates areas for national significance based on exceptional natural or cultural qualities, public enjoyment opportunities, and unspoiled resources. Factors such as ownership, access, land use, threats, public support, and management costs are considered in determining feasibility. NPS studies also assess the rarity and integrity of resources, socioeconomic effects, interpretive and educational uses, and boundary possibilities. Options for protection may include other federal agencies, state or local governments, Native American authorities, and the private sector.

Options for protection may include other federal agencies, state or local governments, Native American authorities, and the private sector. NPS generally will not recommend adding an area to the National Park System if another arrangement already provides sufficient protection and public use. Each study sent to Congress must be accompanied by a letter from the Secretary identifying the preferred management option to minimize uncertainty about NPS's position. The Secretary of the Interior must recommend annually to Congress a list of areas for study for potential inclusion in the National Park System. NPS must consider three issues in developing the list of areas recommended for study: whether an area is nationally significant and suitable for inclusion.

The NPS evaluates areas for study based on national significance, feasibility, and public demand. The Obama Administration, like the Bush Administration, has not actively supported expanding the National Park System. There have been debates over adding new units to the system, with some arguing for growth to reflect current events and interpretations, while others believe the system is already complete. Limited resources for maintaining existing and new units are also a concern. The George W. Bush Administration focused on maintaining current units rather than creating new ones. The Obama Administration has debated adding new units to the National Park System, despite initially focusing on maintaining current units. Supporters argue for expansion to reflect current events and interpretations, while critics question the inclusion of inappropriate areas. Differences exist on the importance of including areas reflecting U.S. natural, cultural, and social history. Some argue that the National Park System has been weakened by including inappropriate areas, while others believe that new units meet high standards. It is challenging to expand the system due to criteria, congressional support, and funding constraints. Only a few new units are typically created each Congress, with many areas preserved outside the system. Affiliated areas are nationally significant sites that receive special recognition or assistance from the NPS, managed according to park unit standards. Created by Congress or the Secretary of the Interior, there are currently about two dozen affiliated areas primarily recognized for cultural or commemorative worth. National heritage areas established by Congress contain land and properties reflecting their people's history, mainly consisting of private properties with natural, historic, and cultural resources. Partnerships among governments and nonprofit organizations handle conservation and interpretation, with a recognized \"management entity\" coordinating efforts. The NPS provides temporary technical and financial assistance to support these areas, aiming to reduce pressure on the National Park System. However, concerns exist about extending federal control over non-federal land and creating a comprehensive heritage program. The NPS supports the designation of natural and cultural areas as national landmarks, world heritage sites, biosphere reserves, and components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. They also assist local and state governments in protecting resources. The NPS provides grants and technical assistance for projects to protect resources, including recreational facilities, rivers, trails, natural areas, and cultural resources. Resources are also protected by the private sector, state and local governments, and other federal agencies."
