    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transit Rail Accommodation Improvement and Needs Act for the 21st Century\". The Congress recognizes the importance of modern fixed guideway transportation for metropolitan areas, energy conservation, and self-sufficiency goals. It acknowledges the need for developing and expanding transportation systems in metropolitan areas, utilizing existing railroad trackage and rights-of-way to minimize disruption to the environment and communities. Voluntary negotiations between transportation authorities and rail carriers for shared use of railroad tracks have not been sufficient for developing efficient fixed guideway transportation systems. Rail transit access is addressed in a new chapter added to the United States Code, emphasizing the need for efficient fixed guideway transportation systems. The new chapter in the United States Code addresses rail transit access, defining terms like 'Board', 'capital work', and 'fixed guideway transportation'. The curr_chunk defines terms related to rail transportation, including 'mass transportation authority', 'rail carrier', and 'segregated fixed guideway facility'. The curr_chunk discusses the shared use of rail carrier trackage by mass transportation authorities, allowing them access to rail lines for fixed guideway transportation purposes if negotiations fail. The Board can intervene and order the rail carrier to provide the necessary services. The Board can prescribe terms and compensation for mass transportation authorities to use rail trackage and related services, including capital work if needed for efficient operations. Compensation standards and quality of service considerations are to be determined by the Board within 6 months of the Transit Rail Accommodation Improvement and Needs Act for the 21st Century enactment. The Board may prescribe terms for mass transportation authorities to use rail trackage, including number of trains, speeds, and maintenance levels. If agreement cannot be reached, either party can apply to the Board for an order. The Board may order a rail carrier to allow additional trains to operate under reasonable terms. If a mass transportation authority believes trackage maintenance has fallen below necessary levels, they can apply to the Board for an order requiring the rail carrier to provide increased maintenance or capital work. The Board may order a rail carrier to allow accelerated speeds for trains operated by a mass transportation authority. The Board will determine the feasibility of accelerated speeds and necessary capital work. The Board may order a rail carrier to give preference to fixed guideway transportation over freight transportation, unless an emergency arises. If the Board determines that this preference will negatively impact freight transportation quality, it will establish reasonable terms for both parties. The Board must make a final decision within 120 days of receiving an application from either party. If a mass transportation authority cannot reach an agreement with a rail carrier for a railroad right-of-way, they can apply to the Board for an order to convey an interest. The Board must make a decision within 120 days if the authority assumes costs and the purpose is for fixed guideway transportation. The Board can order a conveyance of property for a fixed guideway transportation purpose if it cannot be met reasonably by acquiring other property. Compensation and terms will be determined by the Board. Operations or conveyances under this order are not subject to Board review unless the mass transportation authority assumes rights or obligations. The Board can order property conveyance for fixed guideway transportation purposes, with compensation and terms determined by the Board. The Board's actions under this chapter do not limit a rail transportation provider's contractual obligations for claims. The Board can order property conveyance for fixed guideway transportation purposes, with compensation and terms determined by the Board. Chapter 283 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include a new item. SEC. 4. RAIL TRANSPORTATION POLICY. Amends Section 10101 of title 49, United States Code to encourage safe, efficient, and reliable commuter rail passenger service and other fixed guideway transportation systems."
