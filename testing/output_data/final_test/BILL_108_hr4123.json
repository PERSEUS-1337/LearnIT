    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Sexual Assault Crimes Revision Act of 2004\". It addresses military sexual abuse. The Act \"Military Sexual Assault Crimes Revision Act of 2004\" amends Section 920 of title 10, United States Code to address sexual abuse in the military. It defines aggravated sexual abuse and outlines punishable actions. Any person who engages in sexual acts with another person using drugs without their consent, impairing their ability to control conduct, is guilty of aggravated sexual abuse. Additionally, engaging in sexual acts with a child under twelve years old is also considered aggravated sexual abuse. Any person subject to this chapter who knowingly engages in a sexual act by threatening or causing fear, or with a person incapable of consenting, is guilty of sexual abuse and will be punished accordingly. Any person subject to this chapter who engages in a sexual act with a minor aged 12 to 16, at least four years younger, and not their spouse, is guilty of sexual abuse of a minor. It is not necessary to prove the accused knew the age or age difference. It is an affirmative defense if the accused reasonably believed the minor was at least 16. Any person subject to this chapter who engages in a sexual act with another person in official detention or confinement, under their authority, and not their spouse, is guilty of sexual abuse of a ward. The term 'sexual act' includes various forms of sexual contact and penetration. The text chunk discusses the definition of sexual abuse, including acts such as touching the genitalia of a minor with intent to abuse or gratify sexual desire. It also includes conforming amendments related to murder and sodomy in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The repeal of article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice is noted, with corresponding clerical amendments to the table of sections in title 10, United States Code. The amendments made by this section regarding sexual abuse shall apply to offenses committed after the enactment of this Act."
