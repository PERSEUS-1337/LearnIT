However, recent strains in U.S.-China trade relations stem from issues like intellectual property infringement, trade restrictions, and overcapacity in certain industries. China's economic reforms since 1979 have propelled it to become a major global economy. Recent strains in U.S.-China trade relations stem from issues like intellectual property infringement, trade restrictions, and overcapacity in certain industries. China's economic and trade conditions, policies, and acts significantly impact the U.S. economy and specific sectors. The Trump Administration has taken a harder line on trade policy towards China, initiating a Section 301 case against China's policies on intellectual property rights. This could lead to tit-for-tat trade sanctions. The United States and European Union plan to reform the WTO and address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies, mainly targeting China. Trade tensions escalated with the US imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures. The Trump Administration threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese products, further intensifying the trade dispute. The Trump Administration imposed additional import tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018, citing national security reasons. China retaliated by raising duties on $3 billion worth of US imports, focusing on agricultural products. US-China trade has grown significantly since diplomatic relations were reestablished in 1979, with total merchandise trade reaching $636 billion in 2017. In 2017, total U.S. merchandise trade with China was $636 billion, with U.S. merchandise exports to China reaching $115.6 billion, up 12.8% from the previous year. China was the third-largest U.S. merchandise export market and the second-largest U.S. agricultural export market, with soybeans accounting for 63% of exports. The top five U.S. goods exports to China in 2017 were aerospace products, oil seeds and grains, motor vehicles, semiconductors, and waste and scrap. U.S. exports to China grew by 491% from 2002 to 2017, outpacing growth to other top export markets. China's fast-growing economy and comprehensive economic reforms make it a significant market for U.S. exports. Economic growth has increased purchasing power, especially in urban areas along the east coast. China's goals of modernizing infrastructure and boosting industries could create new demand for foreign goods and services. China's large foreign exchange reserves and huge population make it a potentially enormous market. A study estimated that U.S. exports to China supported 2.6 million U.S. jobs and contributed $216 billion to U.S GDP in 2015. Chinese visitors to the United States totaled 3.0 million in 2016, spending $33 billion. By 2021, Chinese visitors to the United States are projected to reach 5.7 million, with China having the largest mobile phone network and internet user base. China's online sales in 2016 exceeded the U.S. levels significantly. Boeing delivered 202 planes to China in 2017, making it their largest market outside the U.S. General Motors sold more vehicles in China than in the U.S. annually from 2010 to 2017, with 4.0 million vehicles sold in China in 2017. General Motors (GM) sold 4.0 million vehicles in China in 2017, surpassing the 3.0 million sold in the United States. GM's equity income from joint ventures in China was $2.0 billion in 2017, with China accounting for 42.1% of its global sales. The Chinese middle class, estimated at 109 million adults, surpassed that of the United States in 2015. China's middle-class spending is projected to increase significantly. U.S. motor vehicle exports to China reached $9.9 billion in 2017, making it the second-largest export market after Canada. China's middle class consumption levels are predicted to triple U.S. levels by 2030. Private consumption in China grew at a rate of 8.9% annually from 2007 to 2016, compared to 1.6% in the United States. China was the largest source of U.S. merchandise imports in 2017, with a share rising from 8.2% in 2000 to 21.6% in 2017. The top five U.S. imports from China in 2017 were communications equipment, computer equipment, miscellaneous manufactured commodities, apparel, and others. China's imports to the U.S. include various products such as toys, apparel, and electronic components. Over the years, there has been a shift towards more technologically advanced imports from China. Additionally, China is a significant trading partner for services, with a trade surplus of $40.2 billion with the U.S. in 2017. The U.S. had a $40.2 billion services trade surplus with China in 2017, the largest among all U.S. trading partners. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China has been a concern, reaching $375 billion in 2017. Some argue that these deficits reflect global production shifts and complex supply chains, with China being the final point of assembly for many multinational firms. The increase in U.S. imports from China is attributed to production facilities moving from other Asian countries to China. In 1990, China accounted for 7.6% of U.S. manufactured imports from the Pacific Rim, but by 2017, that share increased to 55.4%. This shift in production sources has led to a growing bilateral trade imbalance between the U.S. and China. Between 1990 and 2016, China's role as a supplier of U.S. manufactured products among Pacific Rim countries significantly increased, while the importance of other Pacific Rim countries decreased. This shift was due to multinational firms moving their export-oriented manufacturing facilities to China, with Japan being a significant source in 1990 but decreasing by 2017. China's share of U.S. manufactured imports rose from 3.8% to 26.2%, surpassing Japan as the largest U.S. bilateral merchandise trade deficit. The OECD/WTO study estimated that a significant portion of China's gross exports in 2011 consisted of foreign imports, particularly in the manufacturing sector. This led to a decrease in the U.S. trade deficit with China when considering the value of trade that occurred domestically in each country. The role of trade in intermediate goods played a key factor in this reduction. For example, in 2016, U.S. intermediate exports and imports to and from China were significant. In 2016, intermediate exports and imports between the U.S. and China were $19.3 billion and $33.5 billion, respectively. Apple Corporation utilized over 200 suppliers globally, with China being the largest source of facilities. Apple iPhones are mainly assembled in China using imported intermediate goods. Many analysts believe that the value-added in China for the production of iPhones is small as it mainly involves assembling foreign components. Apple is considered the largest beneficiary in terms of profit from iPhone sales. However, trade data inaccurately attributes the value-added in each stage of production, inflating the U.S. trade deficit with China. In 2009, China exported 11.3 million iPhones to the U.S. at $179 per unit. China exported 11.3 million iPhones to the United States at $179 per unit, totaling $2.0 billion. The value-added in iPhone production is mainly from foreign suppliers, including the United States. Apple's innovation and sourcing from low-cost countries like China have made it a competitive and profitable company. The changing global supply chains make it hard to interpret U.S. trade data, especially regarding the impact of U.S.-China economic ties on manufacturing sectors and employment. Critics link job losses to imports from China and trade imbalances. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) study in December 2014 found that the growth in the U.S. goods trade deficit with China from 2001 to 2013 led to the loss of 3.2 million U.S. jobs, with three-fourths in manufacturing. Critics question the methodology used in the study, particularly the assumption that each $1 billion in imports displaces the same number of jobs as exports. The growth in the U.S. goods trade deficit with China from 2001 to 2013 led to the loss of 3.2 million U.S. jobs, with three-fourths in manufacturing. Not all imports from China directly compete with U.S. producers, as some contain U.S.-made parts and contribute to job creation through innovation. The overall impact of China's merchandise imports on the U.S. economy is relatively small. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco study found that U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) of domestically sourced goods and services accounted for 88.5% of total U.S. PCE in 2010, with imports from China making up 2.7%. However, only a small portion of this amount was attributed to the actual cost of Chinese imports. Economists generally believe that trade has a positive impact on the economy, benefiting consumer welfare, choices, and inflation. Nonetheless, some argue that the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed, with certain sectors experiencing negative effects on employment and wages. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) studies show that increased import penetration from China led to 2.0-2.4 million U.S. job losses and 10% decline in manufacturing jobs from 1999 to 2011. China's economic rise has challenged traditional labor market adjustments to trade shocks, with slow wage and employment recovery lasting a decade. The NBER studies found that increased import penetration from China resulted in significant job losses and a decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Critics argue that while trade impacts job composition, it has little long-term effect on job numbers, citing an increase in U.S. manufacturing jobs and output despite rising imports from China. U.S. manufacturing output increased by 15.3% during the period. A study by Ball State University attributed 88% of U.S. manufacturing job losses from 2000 to 2010 to productivity gains. Imports from China accounted for 2.7% of U.S. personal consumption expenditures in 2010. Imports from China accounted for 2.7% of U.S. personal consumption expenditures in 2010, with only 1.9% attributed to the actual cost of Chinese imports. China's investment in U.S. assets includes holdings of U.S. securities, foreign direct investment (FDI), and other non-bond investments. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) collects data on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the U.S., including investments from China. China's foreign exchange reserves drive its overseas investments, fueled by trade surpluses, FDI inflows, currency interventions, and capital outflow restrictions. These investments are not always reflected in BEA's data due to differing definitions of FDI. The Chinese government has diversified its investments abroad to obtain higher returns, encouraging firms to invest overseas for global competitiveness and access to resources. This has led to a significant increase in Chinese annual FDI outflows in recent years. Chinese annual FDI outflows have grown significantly, reaching $183 billion in 2016, making China the second-largest source of global FDI outflows. U.S. investment in China has focused on FDI flows, initially towards export-oriented manufacturing and more recently towards tapping into China's domestic demand. However, U.S. firms face challenges due to Chinese investment restrictions and requirements. China's holdings of U.S. securities are the largest category of Chinese investment. China's investment in U.S. securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, corporate securities, and equities, totaled $1.54 trillion as of June 2017, making it the fourth-largest holder after Japan, the Cayman Islands, and the United Kingdom. China's holdings of U.S. Treasury securities increased from $118 billion in 2002 to $1.24 trillion in 2014, but fell to $1.06 trillion in 2016 before rising to nearly $1.19 trillion in 2017, making China the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities. China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with holdings totaling $1.18 trillion as of April 2018, representing 19.2% of total foreign holdings. Concerns have been raised about China's potential leverage over U.S. foreign policy due to its large holdings, but some argue that China's economic dependency on the U.S. limits its practical leverage. China's economic dependency on the stable and growing U.S. economy and its substantial holdings of U.S. securities make it unlikely for China to sell a large share of those holdings, as it could harm both economies. The Secretary of Defense's report in 2012 stated that using U.S. Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and could potentially harm China more than the United States. Chinese purchases of U.S. residential real estate have increased significantly in recent years, with Chinese investors being the largest foreign buyers from 2015 to 2017. In 2017 alone, Chinese investors bought 40,572 properties. Despite the small level of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between China and the United States, analysts believe that expanding bilateral FDI could greatly enhance commercial ties. In 2016, U.S. FDI flows to China were $9.5 billion, making China the ninth-largest destination of U.S. FDI outflows. The stock of U.S. FDI in China was $92.5 billion, and Chinese FDI flows to the United States were $10.3 billion. At the end of 2016, the stock of Chinese FDI in the United States was $27.5 billion. Sales by foreign affiliates of U.S. firms in China totaled $481 billion in 2015. In 2015, affiliates of U.S. firms in China totaled $481 billion, making it the third-largest market for U.S.-affiliated firms overseas. U.S. affiliates in China employed 2.1 million workers, paid $35 billion in employment compensation, and spent $3.4 billion on R&D. The Rhodium Group estimates that Chinese FDI in the United States is higher than official data suggests due to round tripping and trans-shipping of investments. The Rhodium Group's data on U.S.-China FDI shows significant discrepancies with BEA's data, with higher estimates for both Chinese FDI in the U.S. and U.S. FDI in China. In 2016, Chinese FDI flows to the U.S. were 348.5% higher according to RG, while U.S. FDI flows to China were 45.3% higher. Both BEA and RG data indicate a sharp increase in Chinese FDI flows to the U.S. in 2016. In 2017, Chinese FDI in the United States dropped by 36.4% to $29.4 billion. In the first half of 2018, Chinese FDI in the U.S. decreased by 90% to $1.8 billion, the lowest level in seven years. This decline is partly due to new Chinese policies aimed at scrutinizing overseas investments to prevent \"irrational or illegal\" activities. Chinese FDI in the United States has decreased significantly, with a 36.4% drop in 2017 and a further 90% decrease in the first half of 2018. This decline is attributed to new Chinese policies scrutinizing overseas investments to prevent \"irrational or illegal\" activities. The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Heritage Foundation track Chinese global investments, listing the 10 largest Chinese investments in the U.S. through 2017. U.S. trade officials are urging China to liberalize its FDI regime to enhance business opportunities and exports to China. China imposes ownership barriers on nearly 100 industries, making it the fourth most restrictive country for FDI according to the OECD. Recent surveys show foreign firms in China are less optimistic due to growing protectionism. For example, a 2017 survey by AmCham China found that while most companies felt optimistic about their investments, 81% expressed concerns. While a majority of respondents felt optimistic about their investments in China, 81% said that foreign businesses in China were less welcome than before. The survey found that 55% of respondents said that foreign firms are treated less favorably by the Chinese government compared to domestic Chinese firms. The business environment in China was described as \"increasingly hostile\" and \"perpetually tilted in favor of domestic enterprises.\" Negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty between the United States and China began in 2008 to expand investment opportunities. In 2008, negotiations began for a bilateral investment treaty between the United States and China to expand investment opportunities. The goal was to improve the investment climate for U.S. firms in China by enhancing legal protections and obtaining a commitment from the Chinese government to treat U.S. investors no less favorably than Chinese investors. In April 2012, the Obama Administration released a \"Model Bilateral Investment Treaty\" addressing core principles for investors, including national treatment, expropriation rules, fund transfers, limits on performance requirements, arbitration of disputes, and investor freedom. During the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, China expressed willingness to negotiate a high-standard Bilateral Investment Treaty with the United States, including all investment stages and sectors. This marked a significant breakthrough as China had not agreed to such terms with any other country before. The agreement would be based on nondiscrimination and a negative list approach, identifying only sectors not open to foreign investment. During the 2014 S&ED session, the U.S. and China agreed on a timetable for reaching a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) but faced challenges in negotiations. Multiple rounds of talks and submission of negative lists were made in 2015 and 2016, with discussions at the G-20 Summit in 2016. Analysts believe a U.S.-China BIT could have significant implications for bilateral relations and the Chinese economy. China is pursuing a high-standard Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with the United States to boost economic growth and facilitate greater competition. This strategy is seen as a way for Chinese reformers to jumpstart economic reforms, similar to their efforts to join the WTO in 2001. Such international agreements may provide political cover for reformers and make it harder for vested interests to oppose reforms. Some critics raise concerns about China's compliance with a high-standard BIT due to its industrial policies. Questions have been raised about the impact on FDI flows and U.S. jobs in affected industries. The BIT was not concluded by the end of the Obama Administration's term, and the Trump Administration's position on continuing negotiations is unclear. U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin stated that BIT negotiations are on the agenda but not a top priority. The focus is on negotiating specific market issues and fairness with China before turning to the bilateral investment treaty. The USCC recommended a comprehensive assessment of Chinese FDI in the US before completing BIT negotiations. The USCC's 2016 annual report recommended amending the statute to prevent Chinese state-owned enterprises from gaining control of US companies. Chinese FDI in the US is under scrutiny for targeting critical industries. Calls for reforms in the evaluation process of foreign acquisitions, such as CFIUS, have been made. The USCC's 2017 Annual Report highlighted concerns about Chinese investment in the US, including China's strategic targeting of industries, use of private entities as fronts, and attempts to bypass US regulatory procedures. Recommendations were made to Congress, including a ban on Chinese state-owned entities acquiring US assets. In September 2017, President Trump blocked a US firm acquisition due to national security concerns. In 2017, President Trump blocked the acquisition of U.S. firm Lattice Semiconductor by China Venture Capital Fund Corporation Limited for $1.3 billion citing national security concerns. In March 2018, he also blocked a bid for Qualcomm Incorporated by Broadcom Limited, citing similar concerns about China's potential dominance in 5G technology. Some Members of Congress are pushing for modernization and strengthening of CFIUS to address loopholes in foreign investments, particularly those from China. Several CFIUS bills have been introduced in Congress with a focus on Chinese FDI activities. Several CFIUS reform bills have been introduced in Congress, including H.R. 4311 and H.R. 5841, aimed at addressing Chinese FDI activities and national security concerns. The legislation provides tools to track and evaluate Chinese investments, with a focus on preventing backdoor efforts to compromise U.S. security. Several CFIUS reform bills have been introduced in Congress to address Chinese FDI activities and national security concerns. Legislation aims to track and evaluate Chinese investments to prevent compromising U.S. security. Additionally, there is support in Congress to modernize and reform U.S. export control laws. President Trump announced that legislation under consideration in Congress would meet the Administration's goals on FDI restrictions and export controls against China. The integration of the U.S. and China economies due to growth and globalization has led to tensions over Chinese economic policies seen as protectionist and damaging to U.S. interests. U.S. trade disputes with China are attributed to its incomplete transition to a free market economy, particularly concerning industrial policies favoring domestic sectors and state-owned enterprises. China's economic policies are crucial for future growth, with concerns over intellectual property rights, government-directed cyber-theft, and mixed implementation of WTO obligations. The government's financial policies promote high savings and fixed investments, but may lead to overcapacity. Despite a significant private sector presence, the government still plays a major role in economic decision-making. The Chinese government plays a major role in economic decision-making by implementing policies at both macroeconomic and microeconomic levels to support savings, financing for firms, and industry development through various measures like subsidies, tax breaks, and trade barriers. The Chinese government's intervention in various sectors through industrial policies has intensified in recent years, diverging from the path of economic reform that had driven China's accession to the WTO. This heavy state role in the economy, reinforced by unchecked discretionary actions of Chinese government regulators, generated serious trade frictions. The extent of state-owned enterprise (SOE) involvement in the Chinese economy is hard to measure due to lack of transparency. The state sector in China consists of enterprises fully owned by the state, SOEs that control other enterprises, and entities owned and controlled by the state. The state sector in China includes enterprises fully owned by the state, SOEs controlling other entities, and those indirectly owned by SOE subsidiaries. The visible state sector accounts for over 40% of China's nonagricultural GDP, potentially reaching 50% when considering all state-owned and controlled entities. There are approximately 150,000 state-owned or state-controlled enterprises in China, excluding financial institutions. Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have total assets of $15.2 trillion and 30 million workers. The government aims for 68% of SOE-funded firms to be mixed-ownership. Industries like autos, banking, and telecommunications are areas where the state should dominate. Many SOEs are owned by local governments, providing various benefits. China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) dominate the economy, with significant control over the banking system. SOEs receive preferential credit treatment from government banks, accounting for 85% of all bank loans in 2009. The government aims for 68% of SOE-funded firms to have mixed-ownership, with industries like autos, banking, and telecommunications under state control. In 2009, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) received preferential credit treatment from government banks, accounting for 85% of all bank loans. 111 Chinese firms are listed in Fortune's 2018 list of the world's 500 largest companies, with 85% majority-owned by the Chinese government. Some firms, like banks, have large government ownership stakes. Lenovo, a global computer producer, was founded by the Chinese National Academy of Social Sciences in 1984. Huawei, a major telecommunications company, is described as employee-owned but has strong links with the Chinese government. Ping An Insurance is the largest non-state company on the 2017 Global 500 list. The New York Times reported in 2012 that family and friends of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao owned 135 million shares of Ping An Insurance. Ping An was described as having a complex shareholding structure. China's industrial policies since 2006 seem to be influenced by the National Medium-and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development, aiming to transform China's economy into a global innovation leader by 2050. The National Medium-and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development aims to transform China into a major center of innovation by 2020 and a global innovation leader by 2050. It includes goals of indigenous innovation, reducing dependence on foreign technology, and increasing R&D expenditures to 2.5% of GDP. Priority areas for R&D include space programs, aerospace, renewable energy, computer science, and life sciences. China aims to enhance its national competitiveness through indigenous innovation, economic restructuring, and growth model change. The government plans to implement regulations to promote and protect indigenous innovation, establish a coordination mechanism for procurement of innovative products, and support enterprises in acquiring domestic high-tech equipment. This has raised concerns among U.S. companies regarding Chinese government circulars on indigenous innovation. The Chinese government released circulars establishing an \"Indigenous Innovation Product Accreditation\" system, causing concern among U.S. business representatives due to preferential treatment for domestic firms in government procurement based on IP ownership. AmCham China criticized this linkage of IP ownership with market access as unprecedented worldwide. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and business associations raised concerns about China's indigenous innovation policies, stating they would hinder non-Chinese companies from participating in government procurement. A survey found that 40% of respondents believed these policies would harm their businesses, and 26% reported being affected already. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and business associations expressed concerns about China's indigenous innovation policies, fearing they would impede non-Chinese companies from accessing government procurement. A survey revealed that 40% of respondents believed these policies would negatively impact their businesses, with 26% already feeling the effects. In response, the U.S. WTO representative criticized China's policies for promoting discriminatory practices aimed at coercing technology transfer. China defended its policies, stating they did not discriminate against foreign firms or violate global trade rules. During talks in 2011, China pledged to eliminate indigenous innovation products catalogs and government procurement preferences linked to innovation policies. This came after concerns were raised by foreign business groups about discriminatory practices at the local level. Despite efforts to ensure compliance at all levels of government in China, some provinces have not yet issued measures to comply with Hu Jintao's commitments on indigenous innovation. A survey found that 85% of respondents saw little impact on their businesses from China's delinking of indigenous innovation with government procurement. While some U.S. business leaders support this move, others remain cautious about China's implementation of new policies. According to Adam Segal with the Council on Foreign Relations, concerns remain about China potentially favoring local firms over foreign ones despite pressure from the U.S. U.S. business groups are worried about how China's MLP blueprint may impact the enforcement of foreign IPR, as it emphasizes enhancing innovation through assimilation of imported technology. China's indigenous innovation policies have raised concerns about technology theft and the lack of acknowledgment or compensation for original IPR holders. US officials have warned that China's efforts to limit foreign participation in innovation may hinder progress. The direction China takes on this issue could significantly impact US economic interests. China's indigenous innovation policies could impact U.S. economic interests by accelerating technological progress in China, potentially benefiting other countries. However, if these policies favor Chinese firms over foreign firms, it could have a negative effect similar to imposing protective tariffs or discriminatory taxes. Progress has been made to separate indigenous innovation goals from procurement, but such policies continue in other areas, raising concerns for foreign business groups. Many foreign business groups are concerned about proposed laws in China that could restrict foreign access to ICT markets on national security grounds. The ambiguous term \"secure and controllable\" is used in some proposals, while others aim to promote indigenous ICT industries or require foreign firms to share proprietary information. These measures could harm U.S. businesses trying to sell ICT products in China, potentially impacting a market worth $465 billion. Proposed laws in China could restrict foreign access to ICT markets on national security grounds, potentially impacting a market worth $465 billion. Restrictions could add costs to foreign ICT companies and hinder them from supplying China with advanced products. U.S. ICT firms could be significantly affected, with exports totaling $12.8 billion in 2015. Measures include guidelines for IT security equipment in banks emphasizing local technology development and \"secure and controllable technologies.\" China emphasized the need for \"secure and controllable technologies\" in the banking sector, aiming for 15% in 2015 and at least 75% in 2019. They suspended some guidelines in April 2015 but agreed in June 2015 to ensure non-discriminatory bank ICT regulations. China's national security law enacted in July 2015 focuses on independent innovation, protecting technological secrets, and establishing national security review systems. The State implements national security review systems for foreign investments, technology products, and projects impacting national security. In October 2015, China's Insurance Regulatory Commission proposed cyber-security rules for the insurance industry, including data localization and domestic encryption. Business groups raised concerns about potential trade barriers. The United States raised concerns about draft regulations with the WTO Committee on Trade-Related Measures, arguing that it may lead to discrimination against foreign providers. China's new counterterrorism law requires technical support assistance from telecommunications operators and internet service providers for security agencies. China passed a new cyber-security law on November 7, 2016, promoting indigenous technologies and imposing restrictions on foreign firms. President Obama criticized provisions that would give the Chinese government access to user data. The law aims to support network security technology industries, protect intellectual property rights, and promote safe network products and services. Article 23 of China's new cyber-security law mandates that critical network equipment and specialized network security products must meet national standards and safety certifications before being sold. The state departments will release a catalog of approved products to avoid redundant certifications. Additionally, Article 37 addresses the protection of personal information and important data collected by critical information infrastructure operators. The new cyber-security law in China requires critical information infrastructure operators to store important data within China, leading to concerns about trade barriers and internet restrictions. Critics argue that the law is too broad and vague, potentially impacting cooperation with government authorities. The law is part of China's efforts to boost innovation and develop indigenous high tech sectors, with potential economic consequences if foreign ICTs are purged. The economic impact of intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement in China is significant, costing the Chinese economy nearly $3 trillion by 2025. U.S. businesses and government officials are concerned about the losses suffered due to IPR infringement, including cyber-attacks. U.S. innovation and IP are crucial for economic growth and competitiveness, supporting millions of jobs and contributing trillions to the economy. Foreign entities paid U.S. IP holders $128.4 billion in 2017. In 2017, foreign entities paid U.S. IP holders $128.4 billion for use of their IPR, with $8.8 billion from Chinese entities. A study found that U.S. workers in IP-intensive production earned 60% more than non-IP industries. Apple's innovation in developing the iPod and sourcing production to low-cost countries like China led to competitiveness and high-paying jobs in the U.S. IPR piracy is a global issue, with U.S. firms facing challenges in China due to lack of protection. U.S. firms in China face challenges with IPR protection and technology sharing pressures from the Chinese government. Despite improvements, piracy rates in China remain high, causing significant economic losses. Estimates suggest annual U.S. economic losses from China's IPR policies are around $50 billion, with China accounting for a significant portion of global IPR theft costs. In FY2017, goods from China and Hong Kong made up 78% of seized counterfeit goods worth $941 million. Business surveys show mixed reactions to China's IPR enforcement efforts, with improvements noted over the years. Among member firms, IPR enforcement and cyber-security were ranked as the fifth and sixth biggest challenges. Concerns include data flow restrictions, cyber-security, cross-border data flows, inability to use global IT solutions in China, data theft, Internet access issues, and IPR theft. China's internet restrictions have burdened foreign suppliers, with top global sites like Yahoo and Facebook being blocked in China. China's internet regime is highly restrictive, with major global sites like Yahoo and Facebook blocked. IPR violations in China have led to significant losses for U.S. firms, estimated at $48.2 billion in 2009. Improving IPR enforcement in China could create 923,000 jobs in the U.S. The software piracy rate in China is 70%, with illegally used software valued at $8.7 billion in 2015. Legal software sales in China are significantly lower compared to the U.S. Counterfeit products accounted for 2.5% of global trade in 2013, totaling $461 billion. Chinese officials acknowledge IPR protection improvements but cite resource limitations. A survey found that 58.7% of online products in China were genuine in 2014. Analysts believe China's innovation goals will drive stronger IPR laws. China's poor IPR enforcement in China is partly due to leaders wanting to boost technology production, leading to tolerance of piracy. The challenge to U.S. IPR from China is seen as a strategic move to reduce reliance on foreign innovations and IP, with a focus on creating a legal environment to support domestic companies. China potentially misappropriates U.S. and foreign IP in its industrial policies and market regulations, aiming to undermine foreign IP, promote national champions, and displace competitors both domestically and internationally. An example of alleged IPR theft involves Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd. illegally using American Superconductor Corporation's intellectual property in its wind turbines. AMSC accused Sinovel of refusing to pay for past shipments and breaching contracts, leading to civil cases seeking over $1.2 billion in damages. Sinovel was indicted for trade secrets theft, causing AMSC to lose market capitalization and stock value significantly. As of 2017, AMSC's stock value had dropped by 96% and its workforce by 70%. AMSC officials claimed to possess evidence of Sinovel officials ordering the theft of their IP, impacting 8,000 windmills in China. Chinese companies acquire technology and then abandon Western partners, aiming to gain a competitive advantage. AMSC pursued litigation for trade secret and copyright infringement in China and the United States. Market access in China is a significant issue for U.S. IP industries like music and films, leading to high piracy rates. China's middle class has boosted movie box office sales, making it the largest market outside the U.S. and Canada. China agreed to allow more American film exports and enhance distribution opportunities during a visit by Vice President Xi Jinping in 2012. China extended its foreign movie quota to 34, allowing U.S. blockbuster films to be distributed by Chinese SOEs. However, private firms are not given licenses to distribute movies nationally, leading to complaints about lack of competition. Chinese government entities control which foreign films enter the market, screen numbers, and opening dates, with a focus on promoting Chinese films. Hollywood's share of box office sales in China decreased from 45.5% in 2014 to 38.4% in 2015. In 2001, the WTO agreed that foreign firms should not be pressured by Chinese government entities to transfer technology. However, U.S. firms claim this is a common practice in China, with Chinese officials reportedly pressuring firms orally to transfer technology to invest in China. This pressure forces foreign firms to balance profits with technology sharing. In 2011, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner criticized China for pressuring foreign firms to transfer technology in exchange for market access. A 2012 survey by AmCham China found that 33% of respondents felt negatively impacted by technology transfer requirements. U.S. officials continue to address this issue with China, as highlighted in a 2014 U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade meeting. China clarified its stance on treating intellectual property rights equally, regardless of origin, and allowing enterprises to choose their base freely. China and the U.S. have agreed not to enforce policies requiring technology transfer as a condition of doing business. Concerns over intellectual property rights and technology transfer have been raised due to new Chinese laws promoting \"secure and controllable technology\" and cyber-attacks against U.S. firms. The 2011 McAfee report highlighted concerns about large-scale theft of U.S. intellectual property, with Chinese government being a major source of cyber economic espionage against U.S. firms according to analysts and policymakers. Representative Mike Rogers emphasized the difficulty in attributing this espionage but noted the widespread belief in a massive Chinese campaign. The Chinese government is conducting a massive campaign of economic espionage, stealing commercial data and intellectual property. The United States and its allies must confront Beijing to stop this piracy. A 2011 report by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence identified China as the most active perpetrator of economic espionage. China's economic espionage is driven by the policy of \"catching up fast and surpassing\" Western powers. Chinese cyber-espionage, linked to the People's Liberation Army, targets US firms since 2006. A report by Mandiant identified APT1 as a persistent government-sponsored threat actor. China's cyber threat actor APT1 receives direct government support, similar to PLA Unit 61398. The US and China should engage in a dialogue to address cyber-espionage risks. The US government warned China to investigate and stop cyber-espionage, with President Obama highlighting the economic impact of continued theft of US property. In 2014, the US Department of Justice indicted five members of the Chinese PLA for cyber-espionage against US firms, marking the first such action against state actors. The US government indicted Chinese state actors for cyber commercial theft against US firms, leading to China suspending its participation in the US-China Cyber Working Group. Some Members of Congress called for action in the World Trade Organization and new measures to identify and sanction entities benefiting from cyber-espionage. H.R. 3039 would authorize the President to impose penalties on state-sponsors of cyber-attacks. Growing U.S.-China disputes over cyber-theft could impact commercial ties. The Obama Administration sought to enhance U.S. commercial cyber-security, develop global rules on cyber-theft, and promote cooperation with trading partners. Executive Order 13964 allowed sanctions against those engaging in malicious cyber activities. Sanctions against Chinese entities over cyber-theft were considered before President Xi's visit in 2015. China sent a high-level delegation to Washington, DC for talks with U.S. officials over cyber issues. Chinese President Xi and President Obama reached an agreement on cyber-security, stating that neither country will support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property. They also agreed to set up a high-level dialogue mechanism to address cybercrime. The U.S. and China established a dialogue mechanism to address cybercrime and improve communication, including a hotline. They agreed on guidelines for requesting assistance on cyber-related issues and conducted a tabletop exercise in April 2016. Both sides pledged to develop the scope and procedures for using the hotline, enhance case cooperation on combating cyber-enabled crimes, and address various cyber threats. The U.S. and China established a Cyber Dialogue to address cybercrime and improve communication. They agreed to implement a cyber-hotline mechanism, strengthen cooperation in network protection, enhance case investigations, combat cyber-enabled IP theft, and create an action plan to address business email compromise scams. The first session of the U.S.-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue in October 2017 focused on continuing cooperation based on previous agreements. The U.S. and China agreed to continue cooperation based on the 2015 agreement, focusing on commitments to combat cybercrime, prevent cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, promote norms of state behavior in cyberspace, maintain a joint dialogue on fighting cybercrime, and enhance law enforcement communication on cyber security incidents. In April 2016, the United States Steel Corporation filed a case against Chinese steel producers for unfair trade practices. The U.S. Steel Corporation filed a Section 337 case with the USITC against Chinese steel producers for cyber theft of trade secrets, leading to unfair competition in the U.S. market. This case is the first of its kind and raises questions about the effectiveness of the U.S.-China cyber agreement in addressing cyber theft issues. Some view the U.S.-China cyber agreement as a positive step in addressing cyber-theft of commercial IPR, while others are skeptical of China's denial of engaging in such activities. Cyber-attacks against U.S. firms persisted after the agreement, with reports showing a decline in cyber-intrusions since mid-2014. Fireeye reported a decline in cyber-intrusions since mid-2014, attributing it to military reforms in China and actions by the U.S. government. CrowdStrike believes China's economic slowdown and innovation goals will drive continued state-sponsored cyber-espionage. China's negotiations for WTO accession took over 15 years, with the U.S. insisting on trade liberalization. China's WTO membership was approved in Doha, Qatar on November 10, 2001. China ratified WTO agreements on November 11, 2001, and formally joined on December 11, 2001. As part of the accession agreement, China agreed to reduce tariffs on industrial goods and U.S. agricultural products, limit subsidies for agriculture, and grant trade rights to foreign enterprises within three years. China's WTO membership in 2001 required China to grant full trade rights to foreign enterprises, provide nondiscriminatory treatment to all WTO members, end discriminatory trade policies, implement TRIPS Agreement, open the banking system to foreign institutions, allow joint ventures in insurance and telecommunication with varying degrees of foreign ownership. Tariffs fell from 15.9% in 2001. China's tariff concessions were largely on time, with the average tariff falling from 15.9% in 2001 to 9.9%. Significant cuts were made, such as reducing China's 2001 tariff rates on autos from 80-100% to 25% by 2006. Despite these reductions, China's average tariff rate remains three times higher than the U.S. China also imposes a value-added tax on most imports. China's WTO membership in 2001 aimed to encourage market reforms, promote the rule of law, reduce government intervention in the economy, and integrate China into the global economy. China's WTO membership in 2001 aimed to encourage market reforms and reduce government intervention in the economy. However, by 2008, concerns arose over China's slowing progress towards market liberalization and trends towards a more restrictive trade regime. U.S. officials highlighted issues with Chinese government interventionist policies, state-owned enterprises, and national champions in China's economy. The 2016 report highlighted U.S. concerns regarding trade distortions caused by state-owned enterprises and national champions in China's economy. Priority areas of concern included intellectual property rights, market access, industrial policies, restrictions on services, and various trade barriers. The United States has used the WTO dispute settlement mechanism on several occasions to address China's alleged noncompliance with restrictions on services, agricultural products, inadequate transparency, and restrictive aspects of the legal framework. China has been involved in 12 dispute settlement cases against the United States, including issues with Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs. Another significant case involves the U.S. treating China as a nonmarket economy for antidumping measures, with China arguing for market economy status based on its WTO accession agreement. China maintained a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, leading to restrictions on capital flows. This intervention increased Chinese foreign exchange reserves, some of which were invested in U.S. dollar assets. The central target exchange rate was set at around 8.28 yuan per dollar starting in 1998. China maintained a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar at around 8.28 yuan per dollar. Many Members of Congress argued that China's currency intervention was a subsidy, leading to a rise in U.S. imports from China and a trade deficit. In response to pressure, China reformed its currency policy in July 2005, appreciating the RMB by 2.1% and adopting a \"managed float\" exchange rate system. From July 2005 to July 2008, the official exchange rate of the Chinese yuan to the U.S. dollar decreased from 8.27 to 6.83. The Chinese government then maintained the exchange rate at 6.83 from July 2008 to June 2010 to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis. The yuan appreciated by 35.3% against the dollar from June 2005 to July 2015. In August 2015, China's central bank announced measures to improve the market-orientation of the yuan's exchange rate, leading to a 4.4% depreciation against the dollar. The RMB depreciated against the dollar by 4.4% over three days, and experienced a 13.6% depreciation from July 2015 to mid-December 2016. In 2017, it depreciated by 7.6% but appreciated by 4.4% from January to December. However, there was a 7% depreciation from April to July 2018, possibly due to concerns over tariff increases. China's government may be influencing the RMB's value to boost exports. The Facilitation and Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125) introduced new provisions for monitoring foreign exchange rates and identifying currency manipulators. It set criteria for countries subject to enhanced analysis, including those with large trade surpluses, current account surpluses, and intervention in foreign exchange markets. The law also outlined remedies for countries failing to address undervaluation and surpluses. The Facilitation and Enforcement Act of 2015 introduced provisions for monitoring foreign exchange rates and identifying currency manipulators. It set criteria for enhanced analysis, including large trade surpluses and current account surpluses. China met two out of three criteria in Treasury's April 2016 report, urging rebalancing of the economy and real appreciation of the RMB. In October 2016, China only met the large trade surplus criteria, with the RMB still stronger than the dollar. The first Treasury report under the Trump Administration in April 2017 did not find China (or any country) to be manipulating its currency. China's currency policy was closely monitored due to its trade surplus, which contributes to the overall U.S. trade deficit. The October 2017 report noted China's interventions to prevent RMB depreciation. The 2017 Department of the Treasury report highlighted China's interventions to prevent RMB depreciation and its current account surplus. The report urged China to deepen economic reforms and emphasized their commitments to avoid competitive devaluations. The Trump Administration initiated a \"100-day plan on trade\" and established the \"U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Trump Administration raised concerns about Chinese economic policies impacting U.S. jobs and exports, emphasizing the need for reciprocal market access. In May 2017, China agreed to open its markets to U.S. beef, biotechnology products, and other services, while the U.S. opened its markets to Chinese cooked poultry and welcomed Chinese purchases of U.S. liquefied gas. Chinese officials indicated support for continuing BIT negotiations, while Trump linked trade policy with China's pressure on North Korea. The first CED session aimed to create a new action plan for trade and investment to achieve a more balanced economic relationship. The outcome of the meeting remains unclear as no joint fact sheet was released. The U.S. side stated that China acknowledged the shared objective of reducing the trade deficit. The China-U.S. Comprehensive Economic Dialogue (CED) faced tensions and disagreements, with no meaningful results. China's excess steel capacity was a contentious issue, potentially stalemating the talks. The Trump Administration's trade actions have raised tensions with China, including Section 301 trade action on IPR policies and Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The future of CED talks is uncertain. President Trump took action against China's IPR policies and imposed Section 232 tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports. A Section 301 investigation was launched into China's protection of U.S. intellectual property rights and forced technology transfer policies. This marked the first use of Section 301 since 2010. The White House described the move as targeting China's \"economic aggression\" and identified four IPR-related policies that justified U.S. action under Section 301. The USTR released a study on China's IPR policies impacting U.S. stakeholders, estimating annual losses of $50 billion. The Administration proposed 25% tariffs on certain Chinese imports and initiated a WTO dispute settlement case against China's discriminatory practices. President Trump announced new measures against China, including initiating a WTO dispute settlement case over technology licensing and proposing investment restrictions. He highlighted intellectual property theft and trade deficit issues, aiming to reduce the deficit by $100 billion. President Trump urged President Xi to reduce the trade deficit by $100 billion and emphasized the need for reciprocal trade. China criticized the U.S. Section 301 actions as unilateralism and trade protectionism, stating it goes against global interests. China firmly opposes the move and will not sit idly in the event of damages. China criticizes U.S. Section 301 actions as unilateralism and trade protectionism, stating it goes against global interests. China is prepared to defend its legitimate rights and interests, not afraid of a trade war. China urges the U.S. to pull back and not endanger bilateral economic relations. China's WTO Ambassador warns that the WTO is under siege and calls for unity to defend it. The U.S. representative at the WTO countered China's claims, stating that the WTO system is not threatened by addressing harmful trade policies. The USTR proposed 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products. The USTR proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products related to high technology industrial policies. China retaliated with tariffs on various U.S. products and initiated a WTO dispute. President Trump then requested additional tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese products. President Trump is proposing an appropriate response to China's recent threat of new tariffs due to overwhelming evidence of China's harmful actions on the U.S. economy. China should change its behavior to benefit global economies, but instead, they are threatening unjustified tariffs on U.S. exports, causing harm to American workers, farmers, and businesses. The President is right to ask for additional appropriate action to address this issue. In response to China's harmful actions on the U.S. economy, President Trump is requesting additional action to address the issue. High-level talks were held in Beijing, where a draft Framework for Discussion was released, calling for China to reduce the trade imbalance, address IPR practices, halt subsidies, remove investment restrictions, and improve market access for U.S. products. A joint statement was released by the United States and China on May 19. On May 19, the United States and China reached a framework agreement on trade issues. China agreed to increase purchases of U.S. goods and services, strengthen IPR laws, and regulations. U.S. exports of agricultural products to China could rise by 35-40% in 2018, and energy exports could double. However, on May 29, the White House announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China. The White House announced plans to impose tariffs on imports from China, implement new investment restrictions, and pursue a WTO case against China's licensing policies. China criticized the actions as contrary to their recent agreement and warned that trade outcomes would not take effect if the US side does not comply. The U.S. announced plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to a two-stage retaliation plan from China. President Trump directed the USTR to consider increasing tariffs by 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese products if China retaliated further. The Trump Administration implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, leading to China increasing import tariffs on U.S. products. The USTR announced plans to retaliate by raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products. Public hearings were held on proposed tariffs on $16 billion worth of imports from China. The United States has implemented increased tariffs on Chinese products totaling $34 billion under Section 301. Proposed lists could raise tariffs on an additional $16 billion and $200 billion worth of Chinese products. Threats of increased tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese products have been made. These tariff increases could impact $450 billion in imports, representing 89% of U.S. imports from China. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) publishes the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSA) for applying applicable tariff rates on imported merchandise. The HTSA is globally used and arranged by chapters at different levels of detail. The USTR's Section 301 tariff lists are issued at 8-digit levels, impacting the top 15 U.S. imports from China. The largest import category, HTS 85 (electrical machinery and equipment), is most affected by the tariffs. HTS 84 (nuclear reactors, machinery) is the second largest import category from China. The U.S. imports from China impacted by USTR's tariff lists include toys, games, apparel, textiles, and footwear. The first round of U.S. Section 301 tariffs affected $34 billion worth of Chinese products, including motor vehicles, computer storage drives, pump parts, and printer parts. The U.S. imports from China impacted by USTR's tariff lists include toys, games, apparel, textiles, and footwear. The largest categories affected by the tariff increases are machinery, electrical equipment, and parts thereof. U.S. imports from China in 2017 of the commodities affected were estimated at $15.9 billion for machinery and $9.7 billion for electrical machinery. The USTR's second proposed list of tariffs on Chinese imports totaling $16 billion targets items such as radio navigational aid apparatus, automatic thermostats, and optical, photographic, and medical instruments. These tariffs aim to counter the Made in China 2025 initiative. Hearings were held on the proposed list, with a final list to be issued later. Top categories on the proposed list include HTS 85, HTS 84, and HTS 39. The USTR's proposed list of tariffs on Chinese imports targets key categories such as HTS 85, HTS 84, and HTS 39. The semiconductor industry is a major focus, with $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports at risk. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products include agricultural goods like soybeans and non-railway vehicles. China has a second list of potential retaliatory tariffs if needed. China's potential second-stage retaliation list includes tariffs on various U.S. commodities like plastics, mineral fuels, and chemical products. The top imports from China that could be impacted by the proposed 10% tariff increase cover a wide range of products, including furniture, bedding, mattresses, and cushions. China's potential second-stage retaliation list includes tariffs on various U.S. commodities like plastics, mineral fuels, and chemical products. The top imports from China that could be impacted by the proposed 10% tariff increase cover a wide range of products, including furniture, bedding, mattresses, and cushions. China has not issued a counter-retaliation list, making it difficult to measure the possible economic impact of increased tariffs on the U.S., Chinese, and global economy. The extent of tariffs employed by both sides and potential additional commercial restrictions remain unclear. For example, China could encourage boycotts of American products, impose new restrictions on U.S. firms in China, or increase enforcement of laws and regulations. China's potential retaliatory measures against the U.S. include increasing enforcement of laws and regulations, reducing holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, urging Chinese firms to seek non-U.S. suppliers, and banning the export of critical minerals. U.S. firms with significant sales in China in 2017 included Apple, Skyworks Solutions Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Ltd., and Micron Technology Inc. Various studies have been released to quantify the impact of increased tariffs on the U.S. economy, including a report estimating that under a scenario where both the United States and China impose tariffs on $150 billion worth of imports from each other, U.S. GDP could fall by 0.26% or $49.2 billion. The impact of increased tariffs on the U.S. economy includes a potential 0.26% decrease in GDP, a 15.01% drop in farm property income, and a decrease in U.S. exports and imports by $105.5 billion and $341.2 billion respectively. This could result in a net loss of 457,796 jobs, with gains in the manufacturing sector but losses in energy, agriculture, and services. Additionally, Chinese retaliation could lead to a further $30.6 billion decline in U.S. exports, with states like Louisiana and Washington being heavily affected. The Trump Administration imposed additional import tariffs on steel and aluminum, citing national security justifications. China, a major target of the action, requested consultations with the United States and retaliated by raising duties on certain imports. Louisiana, Washington State, California, South Carolina, and Alabama experienced the largest export declines. China retaliated against the United States by increasing duties on 128 tariff lines, including pork, aluminum waste, and fruits, totaling $3 billion in 2017. China also initiated a WTO dispute over Section 232 tariffs, arguing they were safeguards. The top 10 U.S. commodities affected by the tariffs include pork, aluminum waste, and fruits. China's economic rise has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S., with China being a significant market for U.S. exporters but still not fully transitioning to a free-market economy. China's government intervenes in the economy through subsidies and trade barriers, leading to market distortions. China is a major factor in global overcapacity in industries like steel and aluminum. They aim to boost innovation and competitiveness but rely on industrial policies that protect domestic firms. Some view China as exploiting the global trading system. China made concessions to enter the WTO in 2001 but maintained barriers on FDI and services. U.S. policymakers criticize China's implementation of WTO commitments and seek to press for economic policy changes. The Obama Administration aimed to negotiate a BIT with China, but no agreement was reached. The Trump Administration has shown no interest in resuming BIT talks. President Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was seen as a setback for U.S. efforts to influence economic liberalization in China. The TPP included provisions for IPR protection, digital trade, and SOEs. The remaining 11 TPP members formed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2018. Analysts believe the U.S. withdrawal weakened its economic leverage with China and damaged its credibility in Asia. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress advocate a tougher stance on China's economic and trade policies. Suggestions include requiring China to provide equal market access, addressing policies not covered by WTO agreements, and using trade remedy laws to combat dumped or subsidized Chinese imports. Some policymakers advocate for greater protection of U.S. firms from China's unfair trade practices, including addressing Chinese industrial policies that force technology transfer. Congressional Members express concerns over Chinese acquisitions of U.S. high technology firms and call for reforms to the CFIUS review process. Others support a balanced approach using multilateral processes in the WTO and negotiated trade agreements to boost market access in China. Some critics argue that focusing on bilateral trade imbalances to judge U.S. trade relations contradicts economic theory. U.S. trade data does not accurately reflect the value added in each country before reaching its final destination, as many products imported from China contain inputs from multiple countries. Some argue that focusing on reducing trade imbalances in negotiations with China is not logical, as products like iPhones contain inputs from various countries not reflected in U.S. trade data. The central focus should be on reducing trade and investment barriers deemed to limit U.S. trade flows, rather than using trade balance data to measure success. President Trump's emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China raised concerns about the true motive behind Section 301 actions against China's IPR policies. The Trump Administration's demand for reciprocal tariff levels with China is puzzling to some observers. China's higher tariff levels are largely what they agreed to when joining the WTO in 2001. Concerns have been raised that unilateral trade actions by the U.S. could undermine the multilateral trading system and global economic growth. The Trump Administration's demand for reciprocal tariff levels with China is puzzling to some observers as China's higher tariff levels were agreed upon when joining the WTO in 2001. Unilateral trade actions by the U.S. could undermine the multilateral trading system and global economic growth. Members are urged to work through WTO forums to address concerns and avoid disrupting trade flows, which could harm the global economy. Made in China 2025 is a plan to upgrade the Chinese manufacturing sector, focusing on ICT-based machines and networks. China's focus on promoting innovation in the manufacturing sector is driven by the need to address the innovation gap, avoid the middle-income trap, and counter the slowing economy. The Made in China 2025 plan aims to move the manufacturing sector up the value chain, transitioning from \"Made in China\" to \"Made by China\" by 2049. China aims to become a leading high-value manufacturing economy by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The Made in China 2025 plan, led by the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, focuses on innovation, quality efficiency, smart manufacturing, and green development. It includes 9 priority tasks, 10 sectors, and 5 definitive projects to achieve these goals. The Made in China 2025 plan aims to promote manufacturing-related service industries and internationalize manufacturing. It includes 10 key sectors and five projects with specific goals and timelines, such as constructing manufacturing innovation centers and reducing primary pollution emissions. The plan also targets decreased operating costs, shortened production timelines, and lower rates of defective products by 2025. The Made in China 2025 plan aims to increase self-sufficiency in development infrastructure by sourcing 80% of components and materials domestically by 2025. It also focuses on indigenous R&D in key sectors to achieve market share growth in high-value equipment by 2025. Additionally, the plan includes strengthened security reviews for investments, mergers, and acquisitions in manufacturing sectors related to national security, as well as expanding tax policies for smart manufacturing and enhancing cooperation with foreign companies in various industries. According to a report by CSIS, embracing intelligent manufacturing could facilitate collaboration between Chinese companies and multinational corporations, potentially reducing zero-sum elements in business relationships. Upgrading manufacturing capacities in China could lead to improved economic governance, including financial and fiscal systems, education, and access to information. The Made in China 2025 plan aims to make China a center of innovation, with innovation being key to becoming a manufacturing power. Li Beiguang from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the importance of innovation in promoting manufacturing and national development. The Made in China 2025 plan aims to promote innovation to enhance manufacturing and national competitiveness. Critics question the feasibility of some goals, such as 3D printing and robotics adoption. The plan's ambiguous language may affect foreign MNCs operating in China. The Made in China 2025 plan includes security reviews for investments and aims to boost indigenous innovation by increasing domestic handling of infrastructure development. Concerns have been raised about discrimination against foreign firms. The Internet Plus plan was introduced in 2015 to enhance government work and was followed by an implementation plan issued by the State Council. China's Internet Plus plan, introduced in 2015, aims to drive economic growth by integrating internet technologies with manufacturing and business. Premier Li Keqiang highlighted the plan during the 2015 Report on the Work of the Government, emphasizing the importance of innovation to avoid the middle-income trap. The plan seeks to help traditional enterprises in rural areas connect their businesses to the internet. The Internet Plus plan, introduced in 2015 by Premier Li Keqiang, aims to integrate internet technologies with manufacturing and business to drive economic growth. The plan includes developing the 'Internet Plus' action plan to encourage e-commerce, industrial networks, and internet banking, as well as promoting business development and innovation through government funds. Premier Li also emphasized the need to improve communication efficiency between governmental departments to reduce bureaucracy. The Chinese government's Internet Plus plan has four primary goals: upgrading internet infrastructure security, expanding internet access, making social services more convenient, and improving economic development quality. The plan includes development targets and measures for key sectors like entrepreneurship, manufacturing, agriculture, and artificial intelligence. To achieve these goals, barriers for Internet Plus products will be cleared, the credit system optimized, and a big data strategy implemented. The government will also focus on training local and foreign talent, providing financial support, and promoting legal services for companies adopting the Internet Plus system. The Chinese government's Internet Plus plan aims to upgrade internet infrastructure, expand access, make services more convenient, and improve economic development. They are providing financial support, tax preferences, and launching pilot zones to promote innovation. Families in large cities will have access to high-speed internet, and broadband services will reach 98% of the population in villages. Additionally, a new investment fund of 40 billion RMB has been created to further promote industry innovation and entrepreneurship under Internet Plus. The Chinese government's Internet Plus plan aims to increase research and development spending as part of GDP and tie it to the \"One Belt One Road\" Initiative. This initiative encourages Chinese internet companies to expand globally. The government believes that integrating the internet with economic and social sectors will drive innovation and economic growth, although some experts raise concerns about government intervention. Some experts raise concerns about government intervention in the Internet Plus plan, fearing it could slow down the beneficial impact of start-ups on the economy. Gordon Chang warns against direct government support for tech companies, pointing out the potential job losses and the rise of \"zombie shops\" in the e-commerce sector. Press reports question the level of internet censorship under Internet Plus, especially with the trend of increased censorship since Xi Jinping became president in 2012. Some analysts criticize the implementation of Internet Plus, particularly in the agricultural sector, due to concerns about coordination among various overseeing agencies and the potential for misallocation of resources. The implementation of Internet Plus in China has both positive and negative implications for the United States. It could open up new sectors like agriculture for modernization, but there are concerns about increased censorship and limited innovation in high-tech sectors. China's Internet Plus initiative aims to enhance web management, combat online threats, and control public sentiment. Recommendations from the US-China Business Council emphasize non-discriminatory regulations for IT equipment procurement. China's National Informatization Development Strategy focuses on big data development and outlines plans for national informatization. China's National Informatization Development Strategy, released in July 2016, outlines key regulations and directions for information-based development in China over the next decade. It emphasizes core information technology, strengthened IPR and standards, improved protection regulations, multi-level information management, international cyberspace cooperation, network identity administration, and centralized control over internet news services. President Xi Jinping leads the Central Network Security and Informatization Leading Group. The National Informatization Development Strategy, led by President Xi Jinping, outlines goals for the next 10 years. By 2020, China aims to strengthen its industry, expand internet access, and make breakthroughs in 5G technology. By 2025, the focus is on improving broadband connectivity, building a leading mobile network, and increasing information consumption and e-commerce trading values. This strategy builds upon previous ICT and big data goals but sets itself apart with new objectives. The Chinese government's strategy for the next 10 years, outlined in the National Informatization Development Strategy, includes goals to strengthen domestic industry and reduce dependence on foreign sectors. In 2014, a plan was released to promote the development of the domestic semiconductor industry, with a significant investment of 1 trillion RMB over 10 years. The strategy focuses on mergers and acquisitions, market power, and regulation to improve the semiconductor industry. China aims to acquire semiconductor know-how and reduce dependency on foreign technology by 2030. The country wants to produce 70% of chips consumed domestically, as it currently relies heavily on imports. In 2015, only 9% of semiconductors were domestically produced, with the majority coming from foreign sources, particularly the United States. China aims to reduce dependency on foreign technology by producing 70% of domestically consumed chips by 2030. Currently, only 9% of semiconductors are domestically produced, with the majority coming from foreign sources. Globally, China makes up 4% of semiconductor sales and views reliance on foreign companies as a national security concern. Analysts compare Chinese ambitions to the rise of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, noting differences in market entry strategies. The global semiconductor industry is facing slow growth and increased complexity in chip production. China has invested heavily in its semiconductor industry, with criticisms on its methods and goals. Simply acquiring technology may not improve competitiveness in the long run. Intel spends four times more on research and development than the entire Chinese chip industry. Emphasis on domestically made chips raises concerns among analysts. China's emphasis on domestically made chips raises concerns among analysts regarding the assumption that Chinese firms will buy Chinese-produced microchips solely because they are made in China. This could lead to a domestic industry lacking global competitiveness, especially if the quality of Chinese-produced microchips is inferior. Mandating Chinese high tech firms to use Chinese-made chips may also undermine their global competitiveness. The United States, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, has a significant interest in Asia, with a large portion of its semiconductor exports going to the region. In 2014, semiconductor exports from the United States were valued at $36.5 billion, growing to $8.45 billion in 2015. 82% of U.S. semiconductor products are sold overseas, supporting numerous jobs. The Department of Commerce is concerned about Chinese policies favoring domestic industries, posing long-term threats to the semiconductor ecosystem. There are predictions of increased investment in semiconductor companies in the short term, but potential reliance on Chinese companies in the long term. In January 2016, the Chinese provincial government of Guizhou and U.S. firm Qualcomm formed a joint venture with an initial capital of $280 million to focus on advanced server chipset technology in China. The Guizhou government will have a 55% controlling share, while Qualcomm will provide investment capital, license its server technology, and assist with R&D. Analysts predict strong but slowing growth in semiconductor demand by China, with a significant increase in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the short term. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology issued a report in January 2017 warning about China's efforts to reshape the semiconductor market with over $100 billion in government funds, posing a threat to U.S. industry competitiveness and national security."
