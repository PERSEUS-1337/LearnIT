    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Superfund Equity and Megasite Remediation Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 established a Federal Superfund trust fund for hazardous substance removal and remediation. The release of hazardous substances poses threats to public health, the environment, infrastructure, economy, and social well-being. The Environmental Protection Agency has evaluated over 45,000 sites and listed 1,086 non-Federal sites on the National Priorities List. One in 4 Americans lives near a Superfund site, and the expiration of Superfund taxes in 1995 has led to a funding shortfall for cleanup efforts. The funding shortfall has shifted cleanup burden to the public, delaying and slowing Superfund cleanup actions, increasing health risks and remediation costs. Responsible parties remain liable for hazardous releases. Some sites have substantial cleanup costs, straining Superfund resources. The Environmental Protection Agency considers Superfund sites with cleanup costs over $50,000,000 as megasites, which are larger, more complex, and severely contaminated sites. These megasites drive future funding needs for hazardous substance cleanup. A large percentage of annual Superfund obligations go towards ongoing cleanup at a few megasites, leading to funding shortages for other sites and construction delays. In fiscal year 2006, 45 percent of funds for Superfund activities went to only 14 sites. Megasites, defined by the EPA as sites with cleanup costs over $50,000,000, require significant long-term resources for remediation due to their size and complexity. Some megasites may not have a final remedy due to ongoing remediation actions and the need for perpetual institutional controls. The average annual cost per megasite is projected to be at least $140,000,000. According to the EPA, over half of mining sites on the National Priorities List will need perpetual operation and maintenance. Funding for long-term remediation activities is a concern, especially for megasites without responsible parties. The Federal Government covers 90% of construction costs for such sites, with the State responsible for ongoing maintenance costs, potentially lasting indefinitely. The Superfund taxes are addressed in Section 3. The Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate applies after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1996, or if the unobligated balance in the fund is less than $5,700,000,000. No tax is imposed if the fund's balance exceeds $5,700,000,000. The Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate does not apply if the unobligated balance exceeds $5,700,000,000. The corporate environmental income tax applies to taxable years after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1996, or after the enactment of the Superfund Equity and Megasite Remediation Act of 2007. The Hazardous Substance Superfund tax does not apply if the unobligated balance exceeds $5,700,000,000. Technical amendments are made to the tax code. During 2008-2012, a temporary tax increase was implemented to fund the cleanup of certain Superfund sites. Amendments were made to the tax code to adjust rates and remove references to exporting crude oil. During 2008-2012, a temporary tax increase was implemented to fund the cleanup of certain Superfund sites. Amendments were made to the tax code to adjust rates for specific chemicals and imported substances. During the taxable years 2008-2012, a temporary tax increase funded the cleanup of Superfund sites. Amendments to the tax code adjusted rates for specific chemicals and imported substances, including the establishment of the Megasites and High Risk Sites Cleanup Account within the Hazardous Substance Superfund. The Secretary transfers increased tax amounts to the Megasites and High Risk Sites Cleanup Account from Superfund appropriations. Amounts in the account are available for cleanup purposes. The Megasites and High Risk Sites Cleanup Account is funded through increased tax amounts transferred from Superfund appropriations. Funds in the account can be used for cleanup activities, with unexpended amounts reverting back to the Hazardous Substance Superfund by December 31, 2013, or upon a determination by the EPA Administrator. The effective dates for the amendments related to excise taxes are upon the enactment of the Act. The amendments related to income tax will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. EXPENDITURES FROM TRUST FUND. Amounts in the Megasites Cleanup and High Risk Sites Account established under section 9507(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are to be used for expenditures related to sites on the National Priorities List under the Superfund law that have high cleanup costs or pose significant health risks until the Administrator determines no further response actions are needed. Before initiating a rulemaking under this section, the Administrator shall notify the Congress of the intention to initiate the rulemaking. Annual reports to Congress are required under Section 5. The Administrator of the EPA must provide an annual report to Congress within 45 days of the President's budget submission, detailing the progress of response actions funded by the Hazardous Substance Superfund for non-Federal sites on the National Priorities List. The report includes information on identified hazardous substances, status of response actions, total estimated costs, funds obligated, and progress made at each site. The Administrator must report annually to Congress on the progress and funding of response actions for non-Federal sites on the National Priorities List. This includes details on cost overruns, schedule deviations, funds allocated, anticipated progress, and funding requests for the following five fiscal years. The report to Congress must include details on the total costs incurred, estimated costs for completing response actions, estimated schedules for completion, and activities such as grants for technical assistance."
