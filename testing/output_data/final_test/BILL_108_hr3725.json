Congress finds that Egypt is not a reliable ally in the war on terrorism, citing reports from the Middle East Media Research Institute about anti-American sentiments expressed in Egyptian newspapers before and after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, both parties agreed to prevent acts of belligerency or violence from originating within their territory. Israeli Defense Forces found arms smuggling tunnels between Egypt and Gaza, some originating from Egyptian army and police outposts. Egyptian President Mubarak supported Hezbollah's attacks on Israelis in Southern Lebanon. Dr. Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, appointed as the Mufti of Egypt, stated that martyrdom operations against Israeli occupation are permitted by Islamic law. He also emphasized that invading Iraq goes against Islamic law and morality. The editorial in Akhbar urges Palestinians to kill their enemies to achieve their demands through force. President Bush emphasizes the importance of freedom and liberty in promoting peace and security worldwide. In November 2003, President Bush called on Egypt to lead the way towards democracy in the Middle East. The United States Government's Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) aims to promote democratic voices and governance in the region. However, Egypt remains a dictatorship under President Hosni Mubarak, who uses emergency powers to suppress opposition and potentially pave the way for his son, Gamal, to succeed him. The Egyptian government under President Hosni Mubarak regularly tortures its citizens, with thousands detained without charge each year. The Coptic Christian minority in Egypt, numbering between 6 and 10 million, is victimized and lacks protection. Amnesty International reported that everyone detained in Egypt is at risk of torture, and The Washington Post documented 14 cases of alleged torture and killings in Egyptian jails in the past 2 years. In late 1998, responsibility for the arrest and torture of over 1,200 Copts was reported. Egypt's strained diplomatic relations with Israel, a member of the Arab League, were evident in the recall of its ambassador in 2000, impacting the peace treaty established in 1979. In the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, both parties agreed to foster mutual understanding and tolerance, abstaining from hostile propaganda. Egypt's government-controlled newspapers published controversial articles, including one titled \"Thanks to Hitler\". Additionally, a TV series based on the Protocols of the Elders was broadcast on state-run television in 2002. The television program was based on the anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion, suggesting Jews are planning world domination. In Egypt, a popular singer's tape titled 'I hate Israel' sold over 5 million copies, and a play 'Mama America' by Mohammed Sobhi, anti-American, has been running for months. SEC. 3. Prohibition on US military assistance for Egypt starting from fiscal year 2005. The President can waive this prohibition if it's in the national security interests. SEC. 4. Sense of Congress. The sense of Congress is that the US should provide economic support fund assistance to Egypt instead of military assistance, ensuring funds are not used by the Egyptian armed forces, and requiring the President to certify procedures before funds are obligated. The Comptroller General should have access to US financial information for review, and the US, Egypt, and Israel should decrease foreign assistance. SEC. 5. DEFINITION. The term \"United States military assistance\" includes assistance for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining, and related programs under various Acts."
