He played a key role in the legal strategy leading to the landmark Brown v. Topeka Board of Education decision in 1954. Marshall argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court, winning 29, before being appointed as a circuit court judge in 1962.

Elena Kagan, a Harvard Law School graduate, clerked for Judge Abner Mikva and Justice Thurgood Marshall before her career in law. Elena Kagan worked as an associate at Williams & Connolly before becoming a law professor at the University of Chicago. She also served in the Clinton White House, working on various legal and policy issues. In 1999, Elena Kagan became the first woman Dean of Harvard Law School, known for building consensus and hiring diverse professors. She faced controversy over Harvard's anti-discrimination policy and military recruitment. In 2009, President Obama appointed her as the 45th Solicitor General of the United States, where she argued cases before the Court. The federal statute 28 U.S.C. \u00a7455 requires disqualification and recusal of federal judges, including the Supreme Court, in cases of potential impartiality questioning or actual bias. This is relevant in cases such as Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, United States v. Comstock, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Salazar v. Buono, and Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Federal judges are held to the highest standards of impartiality and objectivity. The question arises whether Elena Kagan, if confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, would need to recuse herself from cases she was involved in as Solicitor General. Relevant portions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7455 state that a judge must disqualify themselves if their impartiality could be questioned or if they have personal bias or knowledge of disputed facts. The issue of recusal of government attorneys due to prior involvement with a case has mainly arisen when a judge had previously been a prosecutor and was involved in criminal proceedings related to a specific client. Courts have ruled that a judge may be disqualified if they were involved in a criminal investigation or prosecutorial functions regarding a defendant in a case before them. In cases where judges were previously involved in criminal proceedings as prosecutors, they may be disqualified from later criminal proceedings involving the same defendant. State courts have recognized that supervisory prosecutors may sign legal documents without knowledge of the case, allowing them to later try the defendant. However, this exception may not apply to federal judges. The role of the Solicitor General in the American legal system is unique. The Solicitor General represents the U.S. government before the Supreme Court and assists in its judicial function. The office has a special relationship with the Court based on trust and interdependence. It performs a gatekeeping function by recommending only the most meritorious cases for review and providing high-quality arguments. The Solicitor General aims to convince the Court that the government's position is correct. Since its establishment in 1870, only four former or current Solicitors General have been appointed to the Supreme Court. William Howard Taft, the first to make the transition, had experience in both the executive and judicial branches, serving as the 27th President of the United States. Stanley Reed and Robert Jackson, who followed, lacked judicial backgrounds but had notable careers in private practice and various positions within the Department of Justice. Thurgood Marshall, unlike Reed and Jackson, had little private practice experience but extensive Supreme Court litigation experience from his time at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and as Solicitor General. Elena Kagan, if confirmed, would be the fifth Solicitor General on the Court, raising questions about her lack of judicial and litigation experience for the role of Supreme Court Justice. The experience of serving as Solicitor General provides unique insights into the Supreme Court, influencing the qualifications for a Supreme Court Justice."
