    "content": "The \"Depleted Uranium Screening and Testing Act of 2004\" requires the Secretary of Defense to notify deploying forces of any known or likely use of depleted uranium and associated health risks. Training on handling depleted uranium is also mandated before deployment to affected areas. The Secretary of Defense must identify and test individuals in the Armed Forces exposed to depleted uranium, provide bioassay testing, and notify them of the results. Each military department must establish procedures to identify exposed personnel and units, based on known information. The Secretary of each military department must accept reports from individuals who believe they were exposed to depleted uranium during active duty in a theater of operations. Procedures for receiving these reports must be prescribed. Individuals who are no longer on active duty must also be identified for treatment purposes. The Secretary of Defense identifies depleted uranium exposure events, including being struck by depleted uranium munitions, being near vehicles or structures with depleted uranium, and responding to such events within 50 meters. An individual may inhale depleted uranium particulates during maintenance, recovery, or exposure to residues from fires involving depleted uranium materials. This can occur while handling contaminated equipment, wreckage, or during maintenance duties involving depleted uranium. Individuals exposed to depleted uranium may have incidental exposures while performing activities in contaminated areas, such as damaged vehicles or structures. Exposure events between January 1, 2003, and the enactment of this Act can be considered if reported within 60 days. The Secretary of Defense is required to provide health screening tests using a bioassay to individuals identified under this section. The Secretary of Defense must conduct bioassay tests for individuals exposed to depleted uranium using a procedure developed in consultation with the CDC. Tests must be done within specific timeframes based on the type of exposure event. Results of the tests must be provided to the individuals. The Secretary of Defense must provide bioassay results to individuals tested within 30 days. Military departments must track health status for long-term consequences of depleted uranium exposure. The CDC will review bioassay types and contamination thresholds. Treatment will be based on bioassay test results. The military department must provide appropriate treatment for any illness resulting from depleted uranium contamination or exposure. The Comptroller General will conduct a survey of radioisotope identification equipment used by the Department of Defense to assess their capability in identifying different radioisotopes in uranium. A report on the survey results must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of this Act."
