The Labor Code in California prohibits discrimination or retaliation against employees for engaging in protected conduct, such as filing complaints or lawsuits related to labor rights or unpaid wages, regardless of who is asserting those rights. Any employee who is retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct outlined in the Labor Code in California is entitled to reinstatement, lost wages, and work benefits reimbursement. An employer who willfully refuses to hire, promote, or restore an employee determined eligible for rehiring or promotion is guilty of a misdemeanor and liable for a civil penalty up to $10,000 per employee for each violation. Any applicant for employment who is discriminated against for engaging in certain conduct or making a complaint is entitled to employment, reimbursement for lost wages, and work benefits. This subdivision protects collective bargaining agreements and employer requirements for applicants to sign contracts that safeguard employer interests and firefighter health. The provisions of this section do not apply to certain entities, including state or local law enforcement agencies, religious associations, or individuals protected under specific codes. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who are family members of individuals involved in certain conduct. The definition of \"employer\" includes client employers and those listed in specific sections. Subdivisions (e) and (f) do not apply to claims under subdivision (k) of Section 96 unless lawful conduct during nonwork hours away from the employer\u2019s premises involves the exercise of employee rights covered under subdivision (a). Section 1102.5 of the Labor Code is amended. Section 1102.5 of the Labor Code is amended to allow employees to disclose information about violations or noncompliance without fear of employer retaliation. Employees are protected from retaliation for disclosing information about violations or noncompliance to authorities or testifying before investigative bodies. An employer cannot retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in activities that violate laws or regulations, or for exercising their rights in previous employment. Reporting to a government agency is considered disclosure under this law, and employers may face a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. The section exempts actions against employees violating confidentiality privileges or trade secrets. Employers cannot retaliate against employees related to individuals protected by the law.

The amended Section 2810.3 of the Labor Code defines \"client employer\" as a business entity that receives workers from a labor contractor. A third party in an employee leasing arrangement is included if the client employer assumes all civil legal responsibility. \"Wages\" are defined as sums payable to an employee or the state for any wage payment failures. The term \"worker\" excludes employees exempt from overtime compensation regulations for executive, administrative, and professional roles. The amended Section 2810.3 of the Labor Code defines \"client employer\" as a business entity that receives workers from a labor contractor. A client employer shares civil legal responsibility and liability for worker wages and workers' compensation coverage. The client employer cannot transfer legal duties to the labor contractor. Prior to filing a civil action, a worker must notify the client employer of violations. (e) No adverse action can be taken against a worker for reporting violations or filing a claim. (f) These provisions supplement other legal liabilities. (g) Client employers can still hold labor contractors accountable through lawful remedies. (h) Labor contractors can also enforce lawful remedies against client employers for their actions. (i) Client employers or labor contractors must provide requested information to state enforcement agencies to verify compliance with state laws. Records must be promptly available for inspection and copying. (j) The Labor Commissioner can establish regulations to enforce these provisions. The Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the Employment Development Department can adopt regulations to enforce specific provisions. Waivers of this section are void, and it does not impose individual liability on homeowners or home-based business owners for labor received. It also does not impose liability on client employers for using independent contractors. The section does not impose liability on client employers using third-party motor carriers for freight shipping, subcontracting with other carriers for transportation services, or using third-party household goods carriers for moving household goods. Client employers in specific industries, such as household goods carriers and cable operators, can subcontract with permitted companies to provide transportation services using their own employees and vehicles. The contractor's name must be visible on uniforms and vehicles for certain services like building, installation, maintenance, or repair work. A motor club with a certificate of authority can contract with third parties for motor club services using the contractor's employees and vehicles, with the contractor's name visible on their vehicles.

They are entitled to reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and work benefits if discriminated against. Employers who willfully refuse to rehire or promote eligible employees may face consequences through grievance procedures or arbitration. Employees who fail to be rehired or promoted through authorized grievance procedures, arbitration, or hearings may be guilty of a misdemeanor. An employer cannot retaliate against an employee for being a family member of someone engaged in protected acts. This includes client employers and employers listed in specific sections."
