The Congress enacted the National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993 to promote collaborative research and production ventures with antitrust disclosure. In 1995, the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act recognized the importance of technical standards for the national economy. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 replaced thousands of unique Government standards with technical standards developed by voluntary consensus bodies, promoting a more unified national economy. Federal agencies and the private sector using the same technical standards help avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 replaced Government standards with technical standards developed by voluntary consensus bodies to enhance quality, safety, and reduce costs. Technical standards are developed in a nonexclusionary manner by nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies, following principles of openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 replaced Government standards with technical standards developed by voluntary consensus bodies. These standards are developed in a nonexclusionary manner by nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies, following principles of openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. The Act ensures that there are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus standards available for government use, with key provisions such as the opportunity to participate in standards development, balancing interests, readily available access to essential information, the requirement for substantial agreement on all material points, and the right to express a position and appeal decisions. Standards developed by government entities are generally not challengeable under antitrust laws. Private developers of technical standards used as Government standards may not have the same protection, making them vulnerable to lawsuits despite low liability risk. Standards development organizations do not benefit from any antitrust violations that may occur. If voluntary consensus standards bodies are not granted relief from antitrust laws, they may have to reduce standards development activities, leading to significant financial costs for the Government and the national economy.
