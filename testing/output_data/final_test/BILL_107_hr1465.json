Congress finds that President Nixon and President Carter issued Executive Orders in 1972 and 1977, respectively, establishing standards for snowmobile use on public lands, including requirements for the National Park Service to monitor and halt use if adverse effects on natural resources occur in national parks. The National Park Service issued regulations in 1983 prohibiting snowmobiles in national parks unless designated routes are followed to protect natural, cultural, and scenic values, wildlife, and park resources. Special regulations have been issued for snowmobile routes in 41 units of the National Park System. The National Park Service found in a 1999-2000 survey that snowmobile use in many units of the National Park System did not comply with regulations. Snowmobiles were being used in units without designated routes and without proper assessments by the Service. The National Park Service found in a 1999-2000 survey that snowmobile use in many units of the National Park System did not comply with regulations. In April 2000, the Service announced plans to limit snowmobile use in most instances due to impacts inconsistent with standards. The National Park Service plans to limit snowmobile use in units of the National Park System, except in Alaska and Voyageurs National Park, to short routes for recreational use and necessary access to private property. This decision was based on a 2000 environmental impact statement for Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway, citing impacts inconsistent with Executive Orders 11644 and 11989. In January 2001, the National Park Service implemented regulations to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway by the winter of 2003-2004, in accordance with Executive Orders, the Clean Air Act, and the National Park Service Organic Act. The National Park Service implemented regulations in January 2001 to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway by winter 2003-2004. New regulations do not apply to other Federal lands where snowmobile use can continue. Restrictions on snowmobile use in the National Park System were implemented in January 2001 to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway by winter 2003-2004. These regulations do not apply to other Federal lands where snowmobile use can continue. In January 2001, restrictions were placed on snowmobile use in national parks, prohibiting their use except on designated routes approved by the Secretary of the Interior. These routes must align with the park's values and management objectives to avoid disturbing wildlife or damaging resources. Designated snowmobile routes in Grand Teton National Park must align with regulations and provide public access to adjacent public lands or private property. The Secretary must monitor snowmobile use in national parks to ensure it aligns with specified standards. Exceptions apply to certain parks and uses, such as in Alaska and Voyageurs National Park. Exceptions to the snowmobile restrictions in national parks include their use by the National Park Service for park management and in emergency situations as determined by the park superintendent. The Act takes effect in specific winters for different national parks."
