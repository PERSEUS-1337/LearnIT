    "content": "United Nations reform is a key policy issue for the United States, with Congress having the responsibility to appropriate funds and impose conditions on payments to the U.N. Member states and past secretaries-general have made cyclical reform attempts every 5 to 10 years since the organization's establishment in 1945. Proposed reforms in the United Nations have focused on inefficiencies, duplication, and fraud in the Secretariat. Reforms have been influenced by political and economic climates, such as increasing Security Council membership in the 1950s and addressing economic cooperation issues in the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, U.N. reform initiatives were driven by pressure from the United States. In the 1980s and early 1990s, U.N. reform initiatives focused on financial and structural issues, particularly decision-making processes related to the U.N. regular budget. Since the early 2000s, reform efforts have been driven by budgetary challenges, controversy over mismanagement, perceived ineffectiveness of U.N. human rights mechanisms, and allegations of sexual abuse by U.N. staff and peacekeepers. This report examines reform priorities from various key actors' perspectives and discusses congressional actions and mechanisms for implementing reform. In 2005, U.N. reform efforts gained momentum at a World Summit in New York, leading to reforms in U.N. management structures, Security Council, system coordination, and a new Human Rights Council. Member states have been working on implementing these reforms with varying results, including stalled initiatives and completed activities. The long-term impact of these reforms remains to be seen. The success of recent U.N. reform efforts depends on effective management and follow-through by the United Nations and its member countries. Congress generally supports the U.N. and authorizes U.S. funds for its activities, but can also be critical and use legislative tools to influence U.S. policy at the U.N. Congress has used its authority to limit U.S. funds to the United Nations as a mechanism for influencing U.N. policy, including withholding funds from programs it does not approve of, such as those related to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Since FY2012, the United States has withheld funding from UNESCO due to its decision to admit \"Palestine\" as a member. The impact of withholding payments depends on the program's funding sources, which may include the U.N. regular budget, specialized agency budgets, and separate conference and administrative budgets. This could make it challenging for U.S. withholdings to have a significant impact if the program is funded from multiple sources. The impact of U.S. withholding funding from international programs depends on the program's funding sources. Withholding funds from programs primarily funded by member state contributions could have a greater impact. Congress can enact legislation to decrease or increase U.S. assessment levels or link payment of U.S. arrears to favored policies, as seen in past examples like capping peacekeeping assessments at 25%. This strategy has been used to further U.N. reform policies. The Helms-Biden Agreement tied U.S. assessment levels and arrears payment to U.N. reform benchmarks. Some Members of Congress propose shifting U.S. funding from assessed to voluntary contributions, raising concerns about weakening U.S. influence at the U.N. and infringing on treaty obligations. Critics argue that withholding funds could impact diplomatic relations and that proposed U.N. reform legislation may be unrealistic. Some argue that tying U.S. funding to U.N. reform could push for comprehensive changes, citing past effective legislation like the Kassebaum-Solomon amendment. They believe this approach may motivate countries to find common ground on divisive issues and lead to substantive changes in U.N. operations and programs. Congress's influence over U.S. funding of the United Nations is a powerful tool for furthering U.S. reform policy at the United Nations. Other strategies for Congress to consider include proposing resolutions and working with the U.N. Secretary-General to advocate their positions. Developing a relationship with the U.N. Secretary-General can help bridge disagreements among member states. U.S. citizens in key U.N. reform-related posts may further U.S. reform policy interests. Collaborating with other member states to build consensus on reform policies is important. U.S. support for reform initiatives may be viewed as self-serving, so encouraging like-minded countries to advocate for the reform agenda is suggested. Identifying key priorities is crucial for the United States. The United States may wish to focus on a small number of reform priorities and pursue them vigorously in both multilateral and bilateral fora. It should continue monitoring ongoing reform initiatives and consider future reforms proposed by member states, the Administration, Members of Congress, or the Secretary-General. The U.S. generally supports the mission and mandate of the United Nations and plays a key role in the Security Council. Since President Obama took office, his Administration has focused on \"re-engaging\" with the United Nations by elevating the status of the U.S. Permanent Representative to a Cabinet-level position, paying U.S. arrears, and running for a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council. The Administration's reform priorities include enforcing budget discipline, eliminating vacant U.N. posts, freezing staff salaries, and exploring alternate budget practices. The Obama Administration has focused on reforming the United Nations by enforcing budget discipline, eliminating vacant posts, freezing staff salaries, and improving transparency and accountability through various initiatives. This includes strengthening evaluation and investigative bodies, reforming human resources practices, and overhauling day-to-day business practices. Additionally, initiatives within the State Department aim to evaluate and improve the UN system's transparency and effectiveness. The Obama Administration has focused on reforming the United Nations by enforcing budget discipline, eliminating vacant posts, freezing staff salaries, and improving transparency and accountability through various initiatives. This includes strengthening evaluation and investigative bodies, reforming human resources practices, and overhauling day-to-day business practices. The Administration has generally resisted legislation tying U.S. contributions to specific U.N. reforms due to concerns that it may interfere with the President's ability to conduct diplomacy. The George W. Bush Administration actively participated in U.N. reform efforts, focusing on management, budget, and oversight reforms. Despite attempts to work with like-minded countries, some reform initiatives were not approved by the General Assembly. Administration officials expressed dissatisfaction with the overall effectiveness of the reform agenda. The George W. Bush Administration participated in U.N. reform efforts but was dissatisfied with the pace and effectiveness. Advocates face challenges in finding common ground on reform definitions. Stakeholders have varying views on reform scope and effectiveness. Ban Ki-moon succeeded as U.N. Secretary-General on December 14, 2006. Ban Ki-moon succeeded Kofi Annan as U.N. Secretary-General on December 14, 2006. He prioritizes U.N. reform, focusing on improving delivery, maximizing resources, and enhancing accountability. Ban has initiated restructuring efforts and proposed staff mobility improvements, but the effectiveness of his reforms is still uncertain. Ban Ki-moon's efforts for U.N. reform are hindered by member states' reluctance to support comprehensive changes. The Secretary-General's ability to advocate for reform is limited by the power of member states, who fear losing authority. Developing countries have opposed reform initiatives, such as the Change Management Team, supported by the U.S., due to concerns about undermining their influence. Fundamental differences among member states, especially developing nations, have been highlighted in past reform debates. Developed countries, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union, focus on the U.N.'s role in peacekeeping and efficiency, advocating for reforms related to oversight and human resources. They contribute more financially and seek effective fund utilization. In contrast, developing countries, represented by the Group of 77, prioritize development-oriented policies and constitute the largest U.N. voting bloc. Developing countries, part of the Group of 77, focus on development-oriented policies and are wary of reforms that may divert resources from development programs. They believe reform proposals by the Secretary-General are influenced by major financial contributors to the U.N., leading to deadlocks in the General Assembly and delays in implementing management and budget reforms. Developed countries like the United States and Japan tied the U.N. budget to management reforms, setting a spending cap of $950 million on the $3.6 billion budget. The General Assembly's Fifth Committee voted on a resolution in May 2006, supported by the G-77, approving some reforms but delaying others. The budget cap was lifted in June 2006 to avoid a U.N. shutdown. Since 1945, various groups have been formed to improve the United Nations, including the Volcker Commission, U.S. Institute of Peace U.N. Reform Task Force, and Kofi Annan's 2005 report. They all recommended internal oversight and Secretariat reform for the organization. The Volcker Commission recommended enhanced internal oversight and Secretariat reform in the United Nations, including staff buyouts and financial disclosure requirements. It also called for streamlining and consolidating the U.N. system. An independent high-level commission led by Paul Volcker was appointed in 2004 to investigate corruption in the U.N.-led Iraq Oil-for-Food Program, leading to recommendations for fundamental administrative reform. The Chief Operating Officer oversees administrative matters, fair compensation for third parties in U.N. programs, and expanding financial disclosure requirements. Congress directed the U.S. Institute of Peace to create a task force to improve the United Nations, with a focus on internal oversight. The task force recommended management reforms for the U.N., including creating a Chief Operating Officer and a U.N. Ethics Office. It also supported broadening financial disclosure policies, reviewing older mandates, and incorporating results-based budgeting. Additionally, it proposed a one-time buyout for unneeded staff and the creation of a new U.N. Human Rights Council. The 2005 U.N. World Summit presented management reform recommendations in response to the findings of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change. These recommendations included reviewing all U.N. mandates over five years old, implementing a one-time staff buyout, establishing a Cabinet-style decision-making body in the Secretariat, and modifying the composition of the U.N. Security Council. The 2005 U.N. World Summit presented management reform recommendations, including streamlining the General Assembly agenda and committee structure for faster decision-making. U.N. reform initiatives involve organizational changes through Charter amendments or non-Charter reforms, with Charter amendment requiring approval by two-thirds of the General Assembly. The U.N. Charter can be amended by two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratified by two-thirds of U.N. member states, including all Security Council permanent members. Amendments have increased Security Council and ECOSOC membership. Possible reforms include changing Security Council membership, ECOSOC membership, or adding/removing a principal organ. Article 109 allows for a General Conference to review the Charter with a two-thirds vote in the General Assembly. The U.N. Charter can be amended by a two-thirds vote in the General Assembly and ratified by two-thirds of U.N. member states. A Charter review conference has never been held, but the General Assembly has authorized reforms without Charter amendment. Various fora have been established for discussing reform issues, and reforms have been implemented through proposals introduced by member states or the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General may also institute reform as the chief administrative officer. The Secretary-General can institute reform as the chief administrative officer of the U.N., making decisions on department organization. Various reforms have been implemented, such as consensus-based budgeting and the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. Achieving comprehensive U.N. reform is a significant challenge for member states. The 114th Congress should consider possible obstacles to reform when legislating oversight or support for reform efforts. Each member state has its own political agenda. Member states may have differing views on U.N. reform, leading to delays or failures in initiatives. Some countries use reform to advance their own agendas, causing distrust among members. The inability to prioritize reform initiatives is seen as a barrier to U.N. reform. The United Nations faces challenges in implementing reform proposals, with some suggesting that member states should focus on a few key priorities for adoption. There are concerns about a \"culture of inaction\" within the organization, leading to resistance to change and delays in implementing new programs or modifications. Many argue that the lack of clear plans for implementing reforms at the United Nations may hinder progress and success. The current U.N. budget constraints pose a challenge for reform efforts, as some initiatives may not be supported within existing resources. Proper implementation plans and follow-up are deemed necessary for member states to assess the effectiveness of reforms. Some member states, including the United States, believe that money saved from other reforms could fund further U.N. initiatives. Complex relationships among member states outside the U.N. system can also impact reform efforts, influenced by military, religious, political, trade, economic, and geographical factors. Congress may need to assess past legislative approaches when considering U.N. reform issues. The Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment and the Helms-Biden Agreement may have influenced U.N. reform. The Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment in 1986 required a reduction in the U.S. assessed contribution to the U.N. budget unless major contributors had a greater say. In 1986, major U.N. financial contributors gained more influence in the budget process through consensus-based decision-making. Concerns about oversight and accountability led to a directive in 1993 for the U.S. to withhold 10% of its assessed contributions until the U.N. established an independent oversight office. The U.N. General Assembly established the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in 1994 to provide internal auditing, investigation, and consulting services. The Helms-Biden Agreement in 1999 authorized payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations based on reform benchmarks being met. The U.N. General Assembly reduced U.S. assessment for contributions to the regular budget from 25% to 22% and for peacekeeping from 30% to 25%. The U.S. peacekeeping assessment has since decreased to around 26.5%."
