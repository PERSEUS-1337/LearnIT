    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"San Francisco Bay Shipping and Fisheries Enhancement Act of 1997\". The Congress finds that San Francisco Bay is a vital environmental, industrial, and recreational resource, with over 800 tank vessels entering each year carrying hazardous substances. The small oil spill in 1996 highlighted inadequate safeguards, costly mitigation, and harm to the environment. The Coast Guard's inability to improve vessel routing due to the bay's bathymetry is a concern. Multiple underwater hazards further compound the risks. The presence of multiple underwater hazards near shipping lanes in San Francisco Bay increases the risk of collisions and oil spills. Removing these hazards can reduce pollution, improve navigation safety, and protect the environment. Navigational improvements are needed to reduce risks of collisions and oil spills in San Francisco Bay. The Secretary of the Army will develop a navigation project in San Francisco Bay to remove underwater hazards near Alcatraz Island, reroute vessel traffic to prevent oil spills, and minimize environmental impacts. The Secretary will develop a plan for a navigation project in San Francisco Bay, including initial design, hazard removal, and environmental mitigation. The plan's first phase, a feasibility study, must be completed within one year of the Act's enactment, involving scoping, cost/benefit analysis, and final design selection. The Secretary will conduct a cost/benefit analysis and select a final project design for a navigation project in San Francisco Bay. The second phase involves underwater hazard removal, transportation, and disposal of materials. The final phase includes any necessary mitigation measures. The plan includes mitigation for environmental impacts, monitoring of removal, disposal, and mitigation sites for at least 5 years. Non-Federal participation requires a 25% cost share. The Secretary must report progress to Congress regularly. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will modify navigation lanes and reroute vessel traffic in San Francisco Bay to enhance safety and efficiency. A vessel routing program will be developed to reduce the risk of oil or hazardous substance spills. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Federal Maritime Administration, will survey vessels for oil spill risks and hazards. The Commandant will use the same standards as private vessels and submit a report to Congress with recommendations for corrective actions. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the Secretary of the Army and the Commandant of the Coast Guard to carry out their duties under this Act, with funds available until expended."
