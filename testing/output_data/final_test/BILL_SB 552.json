Section 116681 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to water supply in disadvantaged communities. \"Adequate supply\" refers to enough water for health and safety. \"Affected residence\" is a home in a disadvantaged community with insufficient or unsafe water. \"Consistently fails\" means not providing safe drinking water. \"Consolidated water system\" is a merged public water system. In the Health and Safety Code, terms related to water supply in disadvantaged communities are defined. \"Consolidation\" refers to merging public water systems or affected residences. \"Disadvantaged community\" is defined as per Water Code Section 79505.5. \"Extension of service\" is providing service through infrastructure other than consolidation. \"Receiving water system\" provides service through consolidation or extension. \"Safe drinking water\" meets all drinking water standards. SEC. 1.5 amends Section 116681 of the Health and Safety Code to define terms related to water supply in disadvantaged communities. \"Subsumed water system\" refers to merging public water systems or affected residences. \"Adequate supply\" means sufficient water for health and safety needs. \"Affected residence\" is in a disadvantaged community with inadequate or unsafe water supply. \"Consistently fails\" means not providing safe drinking water. (c) \u201cConsistently fails\u201d refers to a failure to provide safe drinking water. \n(d) \u201cConsolidated water system\u201d is the result of merging public water systems, state small water systems, or affected residences not served by a public water system. \n(e) \u201cConsolidation\u201d is the joining of two or more water systems or affected residences into a single public water system. \n(f) \u201cDisadvantaged community\u201d is defined as a community in an unincorporated area, mobilehome park, or served by a mutual water company or small public water system. \n(g) \u201cExtension of service\u201d is providing service through arrangements other than consolidation. SEC. 2. Section 116682 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to public water systems, including \"receiving water system\" and \"subsumed water system.\" Section 116682 of the Health and Safety Code allows for the consolidation of public water systems serving disadvantaged communities that fail to provide safe drinking water. The state board may order physical or operational consolidation with a receiving water system, or extension of service to areas lacking safe water access. Before ordering consolidation, voluntary efforts are encouraged. The state board may order consolidation of public water systems serving disadvantaged communities that fail to provide safe drinking water. Before ordering consolidation, voluntary efforts are encouraged, and various consultations with relevant agencies and commissions are required. The state board may order consolidation of public water systems serving disadvantaged communities that fail to provide safe drinking water. Notify the potentially receiving and subsumed water systems to negotiate consolidation within a reasonable deadline, with technical assistance and financing package development provided by the state board. Deadline extensions may be granted for good cause. Written consent is required from domestic well owners for consolidation or extension of service. Those who do not provide consent will be ineligible for future water-related grant funding from the state, except for funding to address emergencies. The state board must hold a public meeting at the beginning of the process near the affected areas, providing a 30-day notice to ratepayers, renters, and property owners. The meeting allows for testimony from representatives of the potentially subsumed water system and affected parties, with an opportunity for public comment. Initial meetings are not required for areas served only by domestic wells. Upon the deadline set by the state board, specific actions are taken. Before ordering consolidation or extension of service, the state board must consult with the potentially receiving and subsumed water systems. A public hearing must be conducted near the affected communities with a 30-day notice given to ratepayers, renters, and property owners. The hearing allows for testimony from representatives and affected parties, as well as public comment. Consolidation or extension of service is deemed necessary due to the consistent failure of the subsumed water system to provide safe drinking water. Efforts to negotiate consolidation have been made, and it is technically and economically feasible. There are no pending local agency formation commission processes to resolve the issue promptly. Concerns about water rights and contracts have been addressed, and consolidation is the most effective and cost-effective solution. The proposed interconnection capacity is limited to serving current customers of the subsumed water system. Upon ordering consolidation or extension of service, the state board shall take necessary actions. The state board will provide financial assistance for infrastructure needed for consolidation or extension of service, including replacing lost capacity, providing additional capacity, and legal fees, upon appropriation by the Legislature. Funding is available for general purposes and does not need to be specific to each project. The state board will provide financial assistance for infrastructure needed for consolidation or extension of service, including legal fees. The consolidated water system must not increase charges on existing customers solely due to the consolidation unless they receive a corresponding benefit. Fees for customers of a subsumed water system should not exceed the cost of consolidation or extension of service. The state board may contract with an administrator to provide services for safe drinking water in disadvantaged communities, without being subject to certain Government Code regulations. The state board may contract with an administrator to provide administrative and managerial services to designated public water systems, with only one administrator assigned per system. The board can order a water system to accept services from the selected administrator. Criteria from a policy handbook can be used, and the board must provide notice and an opportunity for the water system to respond before designating it as such. The state board may contract with an administrator to provide services to public water systems. The board can order a water system to accept services from the selected administrator. The public water system must be given notice and an opportunity to address any failures in providing safe drinking water. A public meeting must be held for affected community members to provide testimony and comments. The state board can provide financial assistance to an administrator for a public water system. The administrator can use the funds for infrastructure improvements, set water rates with state board approval, and cover operation and maintenance costs. Public comment is allowed at meetings. The state board collaborates with a designated public water system and communities to build capacity for safe drinking water delivery, eliminating the need for an administrator. The water system is not responsible for administrator costs. Contracts for administration are exempt from certain public contract regulations and can be awarded noncompetitively. For the purposes of this section, a local government setting water rates in accordance with the California Constitution is considered to be providing affordable water. This section does not apply to charter cities, counties, or city and counties. An \"Administrator\" is defined as a person competent to manage a public water system as determined by the state board. A designated public water system serves a disadvantaged community and consistently fails to provide safe drinking water. Section 1.5 of this bill includes amendments to Section 116681 of the Health and Safety Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 1611 or Senate Bill 839 before January 1, 2017. If this bill is enacted last, it will override the amendments made by the other bills."
