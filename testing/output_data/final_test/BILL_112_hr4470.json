    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The Act is titled the \"Routine HIV Screening Coverage Act of 2012\" and highlights the ongoing impact of HIV/AIDS in the United States, particularly on minority communities. It emphasizes the importance of increasing awareness and testing to combat the epidemic. Increasing the proportion of people who know their HIV status is crucial for comprehensive HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts. Early diagnosis is essential for timely life-extending therapy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine HIV screening for all patients aged 13-64, regardless of risk factors. Some health plans do not cover routine HIV screening, only providing tests for those with known risk factors or symptoms of AIDS. Not all individuals with HIV fit high-risk categories or show AIDS symptoms. Expanding health plan coverage for routine HIV screenings is important. Requiring health plans to cover routine HIV screening without cost sharing could help prevent HIV spread and ensure infected individuals receive treatment. SEC. 2. COVERAGE FOR ROUTINE HIV SCREENING UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS, HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND FEHBP. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include coverage for routine HIV screening under group health plans. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide coverage for routine HIV screening without imposing less favorable terms or conditions. They are prohibited from denying eligibility based on HIV screening and from denying coverage for such screening. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from denying coverage for routine HIV screening based on factors like the absence of known risk factors or lack of clinical indication. They cannot provide incentives to individuals to accept less protection, penalize providers for following HIV screening guidelines, or offer incentives to discourage proper care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from providing incentives to providers to induce them to provide care in a manner inconsistent with HIV screening guidelines. This section does not require individuals to undergo HIV screening and does not preempt any existing state laws regarding coverage of HIV screening. The amendment to U.S.C. 300gg-15 expands coverage to include routine HIV screening as defined by the Secretary after consultation with relevant stakeholders. The Routine HIV Screening Coverage Act of 2012 expands coverage for routine HIV screening under ERISA and IRC, and also applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The Routine HIV Screening Coverage Act of 2012 expands coverage for routine HIV screening under ERISA and IRC, and also applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. A new subsection is added stating that contracts and plans must comply with section 2719B of the Public Health Service Act. The effective date for this section and its amendments is 1 year after the enactment of the Act."
