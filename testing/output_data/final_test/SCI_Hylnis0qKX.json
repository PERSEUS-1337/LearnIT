Ensuring visually realistic results without hallucination or mode-collapse is crucial for downstream tasks like pathology and subject identification. Coupling GAN based image restoration with task-specific network, such as pathology recognition, improves deep learning based image restoration in medical imaging. The proposed method preserves detailed structures and diagnostic features, leading to enhanced performance and potential for super-human level pathology identification and diagnosis. The proposed method for image restoration can be generalized for diverse tasks, including super-resolution, in-painting, and denoising. Medical imaging restoration is particularly challenging but important, enabling imaging under more desirable conditions. Medical image restoration is a benchmark task for related techniques, requiring accurate restoration without altering pathological features. Prior information has evolved from sparse representation to deep learning based models. Existing algorithms face challenges like not considering non-local structural information in pixel-wise losses. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based methods improve visually realistic restoration but may still face challenges like hallucination or mode-collapses. The discriminator network focuses on general image distribution and visual quality, neglecting key characteristic features crucial for tasks like medical imaging and surveillance. Task-GAN is proposed to address challenges in realistic and accurate image restoration for vertical applications like medical imaging and surveillance. It extends the GAN framework with a Generator, Discriminator, and Task-specific Network. The new network predicts pathology recognition or face identity from ground truth and restored images, improving visual quality and preserving task-specific features. The contribution of this work includes proposing a Task Generative Adversarial Network framework (Task-GAN) for accurate image restoration in medical imaging and face super-resolution. It introduces a Task Network and task-driven loss to preserve important visual details and improve restoration accuracy. The method is validated on medical imaging datasets like MRI and PET, as well as a super-resolution face restoration dataset, with evaluations conducted by human experts. Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Task-GAN method in image restoration, showing potential for super-human level automatic classification/diagnosis. The theory behind the method and its improvement of GAN for one-to-one mapping approximation are discussed, with implications for better model design in various applications, including medical imaging tasks like de-aliasing and denoising. Deep learning techniques like deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks have advanced image restoration by learning nonlinear mappings to recover high-quality image information. These models show superiority in denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution applications compared to traditional methods like block matching and sparse coding. Pre-trained networks are also utilized for improved performance in image restoration tasks. Deep learning methods, including pre-trained networks and GAN models, are used for image restoration in medical applications such as MRI reconstruction and low-dose CT or PET image enhancement. These approaches outperform traditional methods like sparsity-regularized optimization, producing more accurate and sharper reconstructions. Deep learning methods, including GAN models, are utilized for image restoration in medical applications like MRI reconstruction and low-dose PET enhancement. GANs play a crucial role in generating sharper and more realistic images by regularizing training with an adversarial loss function. The Generator network learns to restore image quality while the Discriminator network distinguishes between ground truth and restored images. The adversarial training approach in GAN models ensures realistic image quality and sharper details by distinguishing between ground truth and restored images. Challenges in image restoration include reducing hallucination and mode collapse, which have been addressed through improvements in conditioning, cost functions, and model structures. This work proposes enhancing GAN with multiple networks to discriminate different information, improving the robustness of adversarial training. Multiple networks are trained to improve GAN by changing the role from a formidable adversary to a forgiving teacher. The proposed method introduces networks to improve the robustness of adversarial training in GAN models. Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks generate outputs in multiple domains, while Multi-Agent Diverse Generative Adversarial Networks force the discriminator to identify multiple generators for high-quality and diverse generation. Task-GAN extends the GAN-based image restoration framework to predict image restoration from corrupted measurements and incorporate additional information for learning. The text discusses the use of three different networks in image restoration tasks: a Generator network G for mapping inputs to restoration images, a Discriminator network D for adversarial training, and a Task network T for multiple image tasks. These networks aim to improve the robustness of adversarial training in GAN models. The Task-GAN architecture for image restoration involves a Task network T predicting properties of X to favor T(X) = Y. The framework includes a Generator network G for restoration, a pixel-level supervision for image content approximation, and optimization based on multiple cost functions. The optimization task for image restoration involves stabilizing the training process by challenging the Discriminator Network D and teaching the Task network T to recognize properties from images. The task consists of pixel-wise loss, Adversarial loss, and Task loss. The model weights are optimized to minimize the mixed loss function. The trained Generator network is used for image restoration by passing the input through it to output the restored image. The generator network and restored image are optimized with model weights to minimize a mixed loss function. Adapted from BID14, the generator and discriminator architectures differ slightly in structures and training schemes. The datasets used are summarized in table 1, with 40 subjects recruited for a study on low-quality medical image restoration. The proposed method aims to generate high-quality synthesized standard-dose PET images from 1% low-dose degraded PET images while preserving pathological features related to Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. In a study on medical image restoration, subjects were divided into Amyloid positive and negative groups. PET data was acquired using a standard dose of Amyloid radiotracer and reconstructed as low-dose PET. Experiments were also conducted on MR datasets to synthesize high-quality multi-contrast MR neuroimaging while preserving contrast-specific features for diagnosis. The study included 67 cases with 44 patients and 23 healthy controls scanned with 6 MR sequences for diagnosis. The proposed method was also tested on face reconstruction using LFW-a dataset with Gaussian blur and downsampling.

The proposed GAN-based approach for image restoration improves results by generating visually realistic high-quality images. The discriminator regularizes output samples but may lead to hallucinations or mode-collapse, affecting the restored image's label accuracy. Various improved GAN models and cost functions, like Cycle-GAN, have been proposed to address these issues. The cyclic relationship in image restoration can lead to mislabeling or mode-collapse, impacting the accuracy of medical imaging applications. This twisting of solution space can result in misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis, highlighting the importance of maintaining the positioning around the decision boundary of task-label space. Task-GAN regularizes the inter-sample and sample-label relationships, ensuring accurate mapping with mixed loss regularization. This includes pixel-level supervision, adversarial loss, and task-specific loss to preserve important features. The combination regularization enforces the solution to fall onto the intersection of manifold preserving pixel-level similarity, distribution consistency, and visual labels. In this paper, an improved design of GAN called Task-GAN is proposed for image restoration, specifically in medical imaging applications. The Task-GAN includes a task-specific network and loss to enhance image restoration performance while preserving important features. The method is also shown to generalize to natural image applications like super-resolution face restoration. The proposed Task-GAN method outperforms GAN in preserving face identity and achieving superior image quality metrics. It is validated by human experts for better preservation of anatomical and diagnostic features, with potential for super-human level diagnosis tasks. Task-GAN extends adversarial training regularization, balancing content similarity, distribution consistency, and important feature preservation. This results in accurate image restoration, avoiding mode collapse and hallucinations.
