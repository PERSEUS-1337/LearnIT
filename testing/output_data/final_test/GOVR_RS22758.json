    "content": "The United States has traditionally defined long-range or Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) as those capable of ranges greater than 5,500 kilometers. Five countries have operational ICBMs with nuclear weapons: the United States, Russia, China, France, and Britain. Iran is believed to have an ICBM program in development, with assessments suggesting they could have ICBMs by 2015 with Russian assistance. The U.S. assesses the Iranian ICBM threat and its impact on U.S. military and diplomatic efforts. There is no universal agreement within the U.S. intelligence community on the issue of an Iranian ICBM test before 2010. Some argue that an Iranian ICBM test is likely before 2010, with potential reliance on foreign technology. U.S. assessments vary, with some officials believing a test is unlikely before 2015. There are concerns that Iran could convert its space program into an ICBM program. Critics suggest the U.S. may be overestimating the threat from Iran. Iran's public statements on Iranian ICBM developments lack details, with uncertainty surrounding the Shahab-6 program. Despite Iran denying plans for an ICBM program, there is debate on the program's status. In 2004, Iran announced plans to launch a satellite, which was achieved in 2005 with a Russian rocket. In 2005, Iran launched a satellite on a Russian rocket and allocated $500 million for space projects. In 2008, Iran launched a low-orbit research rocket and attempted a satellite launch, which was criticized by the Bush White House. In 2009, Iran successfully launched its Omid satellite on a Safir-2 rocket, raising concerns about dual-use capabilities for long-range missiles. The Zelzal-3 ballistic missile, derived from the North Korean No-Dong 1, has a range of 1,000 to 1,500 kilometers, potentially reaching targets in the Middle East. Speculation suggests cooperation between North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan in developing this missile. Reports also mention Russian assistance in Iran's missile development. Iran may have deployed medium-range ballistic missiles, with more information available on the Zelzal-3 compared to other Iranian missile programs. Variants of the Shahab-3, including the Shahab-3A, Shahab-3B, Shahab-4, and BM-25, may have longer ranges. Iran has developed Shahab-3 variants with range capabilities of 1,500-2,500 kilometers, potentially reaching targets in the Middle East, Turkey, and southeastern Europe. There are suspicions of Chinese, North Korean, or Russian involvement in these missile programs. In 2006, Iran claimed to have successfully tested a Fajr-3 MRBM similar to the Shahab-3, but there were doubts from U.S. and Israeli intelligence analysts. Iran also conducted ballistic missile tests in 2008, including a 2,000 km version of the Shahab-3. Iran claimed to have successfully test fired a 2-stage solid-fuel missile with a 2,000 kilometer range in November 2008. Some analysts are skeptical of these claims pending further technical analyses, citing past Iranian exaggerations of missile capabilities. International media retracted images of the missile launches due to digital alterations. The Bush Administration stated Iran did not test new technologies but emphasized the need for a missile defense system in Europe. Secretary of State Rice criticized the exercises and urged Iran to refrain from such activities. Iran continues to develop a ballistic missile program that poses a threat to its neighbors and beyond. Reports suggest Iran is working on a longer-range missile with ranges of 4,000-5,000 kilometers, and possibly a space launch vehicle known as the Shahab-5. Iran is believed to have deployed short-range ballistic missiles and is developing others with the help of countries like China, North Korea, and Russia. However, there is uncertainty about the actual progress of these efforts, and open source materials do not provide a consensus on technical capabilities. Iran's ballistic missile program poses a threat to its neighbors and beyond, with reports indicating the development of longer-range missiles. There are uncertainties regarding the technical capabilities and performance of Iranian missiles, with discrepancies in operational numbers and names. Some of the commonly referenced Iranian missiles include the Chinese CSS-8 SRBMs, Fateh A-110 developed in the 1990s, and possibly acquired Chinese M-11 or CSS-7 SRBMs. These missiles may have ranges of about 150-200 kilometers and were developed with assistance from China, Syria, and North Korea. Iran's ballistic missile program in Iran has been operational since around 2004. There are reports of Iran acquiring Chinese M-11 or CSS-7 SRBMs with a range of around 280 kilometers in the mid-1990s, although China denies this. Iran may also have SRBMs with ranges of 200-300 kilometers from Libya or North Korea, referred to as SCUD-B or Shahab-1. Additionally, Iran might possess SRBMs with a range of 500-700 kilometers, known as SCUD-C or Shahab-2, and possibly an operational SRBM with a range up to 800 kilometers, possibly referred to as M-9 variant, DF-15, or CSS-6. Analysts are uncertain if these missiles were developed independently or with assistance from China and North Korea. Iran's ballistic missile program has been operational since around 2004. Reports suggest Iran may have acquired Chinese M-11 or CSS-7 SRBMs with a range of 280 kilometers in the mid-1990s. Additionally, Iran might possess SRBMs with ranges of 200-300 kilometers from Libya or North Korea, known as SCUD-B or Shahab-1, and SRBMs with a range of 500-700 kilometers, called SCUD-C or Shahab-2. There is a possibility that Iran has an operational SRBM with a range of up to 800 kilometers, possibly referred to as an M-9 variant, DF-15, or CSS-6."
