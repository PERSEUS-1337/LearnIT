    "content": "Domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP, child nutrition programs, and WIC, make up over two-thirds of the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. Appropriations acts provide funding to match the parameters required by the mandatory programs' authorizing laws, typically reauthorized in farm bills and child nutrition legislation. The enacted FY2019 appropriation for domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP and child nutrition programs, would provide over $103 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion from FY2018. Funding for these programs varies with participation and inflation under the terms of the authorization law. The enacted FY2019 appropriation for domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP and child nutrition programs, is over $103 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion from FY2018. Declining participation in SNAP is the main reason for the difference. Over 95% of the FY2019 appropriations are for mandatory spending. Funding levels are compared to prior years in Table 1, which also includes additional funding, rescissions, and policy changes. The President's budget request assists in determining funding levels for programs like SNAP and child nutrition programs. The FY2019 budget request included 14 legislative proposals for SNAP, aiming to restrict eligibility and change benefit calculation. It also suggested replacing part of SNAP benefits with USDA-purchased foods and limiting federal funding for administrative costs. These proposals were estimated to reduce program spending over the budget window but were not enacted in the FY2019 appropriation. The FY2019 budget request included 14 legislative proposals for SNAP, aiming to restrict eligibility and change benefit calculation. However, none of these policies were enacted as part of the FY2019 appropriation. Some policies were debated in the formulation of the 2018 farm bill, but only the elimination of performance bonus funding was enacted. The enacted FY2019 appropriation provides approximately $0.8 million for the Under Secretary's office, which is the same as FY2018 funding. The enacted appropriation under the Food and Nutrition Act provides approximately $73.5 billion for various programs, including SNAP, nutrition assistance block grants, Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, TEFAP commodities, and Community Food Projects. Coordination with USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area is required, along with a research and evaluation plan submitted to Congress. The FY2019 appropriation under the Food and Nutrition Act is approximately $73.5 billion, which is $540 million less than FY2018. This decrease is mainly due to a projected reduction in SNAP participation. The enacted appropriation includes $3 billion for the SNAP contingency reserve fund and nearly $295 million for TEFAP commodities, an increase of $5.0 million from FY2018. The FY2019 appropriation continues to limit USDA's implementation of December 2016 regulations regarding SNAP retailers' inventory requirements. The FY2019 appropriation maintains limits on SNAP benefits for authorized retailers. A final rule in 2016 aimed to implement changes to inventory requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers as per the 2014 farm bill. The final rule would have expanded the varieties of staple foods and perishable items retailers must stock, defined staple foods, clarified limitations on hot food sales, and increased stocking unit requirements. Section 727 of the enacted appropriation requires USDA to define \"variety\" more expansively and apply previous requirements on acceptable varieties and stock breadth. USDA-FNS implemented aspects of the 2016 final rule, including increased stocking units. A proposed rule was published on April 5, 2019, amending the definition of \"variety\". Child nutrition account funds various programs like NSLP, SBP, CACFP, SFSP, SMP, and \"Team Nutrition\". The enacted FY2019 appropriation provides approximately $23.1 billion for child nutrition programs, which is $1.1 billion less than FY2018. This includes funding for School Meals Equipment Grants and Summer EBT Demonstration Projects. The Summer EBT Demonstration Projects provide electronic food benefits to households with children during summer months to replace school meals. The projects were authorized and funded in the FY2010 appropriations law. The enacted appropriation for FY2019 provides $28 million, the same amount as FY2018, and extends funding for two expiring provisions through September 30, 2019. The enacted FY2019 appropriation includes $5 million for Farm to School Grants to assist schools in establishing farm-to-school programs. Additionally, a policy provision prevents processed poultry from China from being included in the National School Lunch Program. The enacted FY2019 appropriation includes a policy provision that prevents processed poultry from China from being included in various school meal programs. Additionally, for the school year 2019-2020, changes in federal policy on the pricing of paid meals require a subset of schools to review their revenue and adjust prices if necessary to prevent federal funding intended for free/reduced-price meals from subsidizing full-price meals. The enacted FY2019 appropriation includes a provision for schools with negative balances in their nonprofit school food service accounts to potentially raise prices. Additionally, the provision allows for more frequent substitution of starchy vegetables for fruits in the School Breakfast Program. The enacted FY2019 appropriation allows schools to substitute any type of vegetables for required daily and weekly servings of fruits. It also changes the calculation of commodity assistance in child nutrition programs, eliminating bonus commodities from the calculation. The FY2019 appropriation for WIC is $6.075 billion, with set-asides for breastfeeding peer counselors, infrastructure, and telehealth grants. $500 million in prior-year funds are rescinded. The enacted appropriation for the Commodity Assistance Program budget account remains unchanged at over $322 million in FY2019. Within the account, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program receives nearly $223 million, a decrease of approximately $15 million. The TEFAP Administrative Costs receive nearly $110 million, including $79.6 million in FY2019 funding, an increase of $15.2 million compared to FY2018. The budget account for federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs received nearly $165 million in FY2019, an increase of approximately $11 million from FY2018. This funding also supports special projects for program improvement and the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which provides nutrition education to consumers. In FY2019, the budget for federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs increased by $11 million to nearly $165 million. $2 million is allocated for fellowship programs by the Congressional Hunger Center. Child nutrition programs receive over $1.4 billion for commodity foods, with $485 million from Section 32 in FY2019 compared to $465 million in FY2018. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program for elementary schools is funded by Section 32. The School Lunch Act provides funds at the beginning of every school year. For FY2019, $171.5 million is available for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). The Food Service Management Institute receives $5 million annually for technical assistance. The Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets nearly $21 million in mandatory funding per year. USDA faced a funding lapse in FY2019, resulting in a 35-day partial government shutdown. Most of USDA's Food and Nutrition Service programs rely on appropriations acts for funding. During the FY2019 funding lapse, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) had to implement contingency plans, including staff furloughs, impacting program operations. FNS released program-specific memoranda to states and program operators to address the funding lapse. The furloughs of FNS staff may have affected program operations on a case-by-case basis. This appendix highlights key issues and impacts on SNAP, Child Nutrition, and WIC programs during the partial government shutdown. During the partial government shutdown, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) had to implement contingency plans due to the funding lapse. SNAP benefits are issued monthly, with a $3 billion contingency fund provided in the FY2018 appropriations law. This fund alone would not cover a month of SNAP benefits in case of a funding lapse. During the government shutdown, SNAP benefits for December 2018, January 2019, and February 2019 were provided through a provision in the continuing resolution. USDA-FNS issued memoranda with FAQs to states. Child Nutrition programs were not affected like SNAP. The child nutrition programs and WIC have funding that can be used over two years, with contingency funds available. Federal funds are typically provided retroactively, allowing programs to continue operating during a shutdown. The Administration had carryover and contingency funds during the FY2019 funding lapse. Programs with two-year funding from Child Nutrition Programs and WIC could potentially continue operations depending on the funding lapse duration and available funds. USDA continued child nutrition and WIC programs using prior-year carryover and allocated funding, ensuring operations through March 2019 if the shutdown persisted."
