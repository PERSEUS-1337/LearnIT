    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993\" amends Section 44 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for certain regulatory costs incurred by small businesses. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 provides a tax credit for qualified small businesses, allowing a 50% credit on regulatory costs exceeding $250. Qualified small businesses must meet specific criteria and elect to apply for the credit. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 offers a tax credit for qualified small businesses for certain regulatory costs incurred during the taxable year. Qualified regulatory costs include federally required nonproductive expenditures and product approval costs. Federally required nonproductive expenditures are amounts certified by the Federal certifying authority as necessary for the operation of a plant or property. The tax credit under the Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 covers regulatory costs necessary for plant or property compliance with federal or state regulations, without significantly enhancing output, capacity, or reducing operating costs. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 tax credit covers regulatory costs for plant or property compliance with regulations, excluding expenses for new property placed in service after specific dates. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 defines terms like \"Federal certifying authority\" and \"product approval costs.\" Special rules include the treatment of expenditures for providing access to disabled individuals as qualified regulatory costs. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 defines qualified regulatory costs as eligible access expenditures. If a credit is claimed for these costs, no other deduction or credit is allowed, and no increase in property basis is permitted. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 allows qualified small businesses to claim a regulatory cost credit under section 44. This credit is part of the general business credit and cannot be carried back if unused. The Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act of 1993 allows qualified small businesses to claim a regulatory cost credit under section 44, which may be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of the Act. A clerical amendment was made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by section 44 of the Small Business Regulatory Cost Relief Act apply to expenses incurred after the enactment date in taxable years ending after that date."
