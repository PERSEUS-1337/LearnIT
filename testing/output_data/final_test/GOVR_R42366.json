    "content": "The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was first enacted in 1992, allowing the FDA to collect fees from the pharmaceutical industry to support drug application reviews. It has been renewed multiple times, with the most recent extension in 2012 under the FDASIA. PDUFA revenue contributes significantly to FDA's budget, with 51% of the Human Drugs Program budget coming from prescription drug fees. The FDA budget is supplemented by industry fees through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), allowing for quicker drug application reviews. The 2012 reauthorization involved the submission of draft legislative language and performance goals to Congress. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) reauthorization became Title I of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144), covering various topics such as medical device user fees, generic drug user fees, and pediatric drug research. This report outlines the origin of prescription drug user fees, current law, and the impact of PDUFA on FDA application review time and budget. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) reauthorization, now part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144), addresses medical device user fees, generic drug user fees, and pediatric drug research. PDUFA aimed to reduce FDA application review time and the agency's Human Drugs Program budget. The median approval time for new drug applications was 29 months in the late 1980s, prompting industry, consumer groups, and FDA to seek faster decision-making processes. Delays in reviews were costly for manufacturers, with FDA estimating a $10 million loss for each one-month delay. FDA argued for more scientists to handle the increasing workload and backlog of drug applications. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was implemented due to FDA's insufficient appropriations for hiring additional scientists to conduct reviews. FDA had requested Congress for permission to implement user fees for years, which was finally achieved in 1992 under FDA commissioner David Kessler. This law included performance goals and ensured that user fees would supplement, not replace, Congress's funding for FDA. Subsequent reauthorizations (PDUFA II-V) allowed for the collection of user fees to expedite drug review processes. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) authorized the collection of prescription drug user fees for FDA review processes. Each five-year authorization sets a total fee revenue amount for the first year, with annual adjustments based on inflation and workload changes. Three types of fees contribute equally to the total revenue each year: application fee, establishment fee, and product fee. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) requires manufacturers to pay annual fees for manufacturing establishments and products. The fees aim to provide stable revenue and supplement congressional appropriations. Certain exemptions and waivers apply, and triggers enforce the goal of maintaining funding levels. FDA can only collect fees if appropriations meet specified conditions. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) authorizes FDA to use fee revenue to fund the review process of human drug applications, covering activities from basic research to postapproval marketing. PDUFA has been expanded with each reauthorization by Congress to include a broader scope of activities. PDUFA II and PDUFA III expanded FDA's use of prescription drug user fee revenue to cover activities from the clinical trial phases to postapproval marketing, including preclinical development and monitoring research necessary for application review. PDUFA IV expanded FDA's use of fees to support postmarket safety activities without a three-year limitation, including developing adverse-event data-collection systems and enforcing new FFDCA requirements. PDUFA IV expanded FDA's use of fees to support postmarket safety activities, including managing adverse event reports and implementing risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. PDUFA V maintained the scope of activities supported by PDUFA fees and codified requirements for goals letters and annual performance reports. Table A-2 in Appendix A displays annual performance and fiscal reports included in every PDUFA version. Table B-1 in Appendix B outlines commitments in the Agreement between FDA and industry for PDUFA V, highlighting differences between PDUFA IV and V. Approval times for drug and biologic applications are key indicators of PDUFA's success in reducing approval decision timelines. Various data presentations by FDA and industry analysts, such as median approval times for new molecular and biologic entities, demonstrate the effectiveness of PDUFA in advancing treatments. The FDA has met or exceeded performance goals for drug application submissions. The total program level for FDA's Human Drug Program from FY1990 to FY2012 shows budget contributions from budget authority and user fees. Table 1 displays the relative contributions of these funding sources over time. The PDUFA V program consists of statutory language reauthorizing the program and an agreement between FDA and industry. Differences between PDUFA IV and PDUFA V agreements address communication and timing concerns in the drug review process and support a broader range of FDA activities. The PDUFA V program includes statutory language reauthorizing the program and an agreement between FDA and industry. Tables in Appendix A relate to statutory language, while tables in Appendix B relate to the FDA-industry Agreement. PDUFA V sets total fee revenue for FY2013 at $693 million, with modifications to inflation and workload adjustments in FY2014 through FY2017. Several provisions added in PDUFA IV were omitted in PDUFA V. PDUFA V omits several provisions from PDUFA IV, including additional fees for postmarket safety activities and the reverse trigger for reducing fee revenue. PDUFA V includes a requirement for electronic submission of NDAs and BLAs. Section 745A of PDUFA V sets a timeline for implementation after final guidance on electronic format standards is issued. FDA negotiated commitments with industry representatives for user fee revenue support. New elements in the Agreement focus on drug review goals, regulatory science, risk-benefit assessment, drug safety, and information technology. The PDUFA V Agreement includes commitments on drug review performance goals, communication, and timing. FDA aims to review and act on 90% of standard submissions within 10 months and 90% of priority submissions within 6 months. Modifications were made for original biologics license applications and certain new molecular entities in PDUFA V. The PDUFA V Agreement establishes new review models to improve communication and transparency between the FDA and applicants. It also outlines extensions to review timeframes, reporting requirements, and activities to enhance regulatory science using PDUFA revenue. The PDUFA V Agreement focuses on developing meta-analysis methodologies, advancing biomarkers and pharmacogenomics in drug review, patient-reported outcomes, and drugs for rare diseases. It includes risk-benefit assessment, patient perspectives on risks and benefits, drug safety evaluations, REMS requirements, standardizing REMS for drug classes, and integrating REMS into the healthcare system. Additionally, it involves activities related to the Sentinel Initiative, pharmacovigilance systems, information systems, and infrastructure. The PDUFA V Agreement focuses on electronic submissions, data standardization, investments in information technology, and FDA performance management. It includes commitments to produce guidance documents, hold public meetings, and workshops. The urgency for PDUFA reauthorization is due to its significant contribution to the FDA Human Drugs Program budget. Congress passed a multi-titled bill in 2012, with the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments being the first title. The multi-titled bill passed in 2012, known as FDASIA, included the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments as the first title. It covered various provisions such as reauthorization of medical device user fees, new user fee authorization for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products, pediatric drug development, medical device regulation, pharmaceutical supply chain security, expedited drug approval, drug shortages, and more."
