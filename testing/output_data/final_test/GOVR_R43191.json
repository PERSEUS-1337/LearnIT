    "content": "More than 200,000 species of insects, bats, and birds are plant pollinators, with bees being the focus of this report. Honey bees are the most well-known species, but there are thousands of other bee species worldwide. Honey bees were introduced to North America by European settlers in the 1600s and are considered social bees with a structured social order within their colonies. There are an estimated 115,000-125,000 beekeepers in the United States, with most being hobbyists with fewer than 25 hives. Commercial beekeepers have over 300 hives and provide pollination services to farmers by migrating their colonies. Native bees like bumble bees are also managed for pollination, with some exhibiting social behaviors similar to honey bees. Bumble bees are used to pollinate greenhouse tomatoes and crops like cucumbers, watermelons, and cantaloupes. Native bees, including meliponine bees, are important pollinators for squash family plants like cucumbers, watermelons, and cantaloupes. There are roughly 4,000 native bee species in North America, with most being wild and not managed. The five most common families of native bees in North America are Andrenidae, Apidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae, with Andrenid bees being ground nesters. Data on native bees is limited compared to managed bees. The Apidae family of bees includes honey bees, bumble bees, carpenter bees, squash bees, and others. Bumble bees (Bombus) are well-studied, with 239 species worldwide and 60 in North America. Other bee families like Colletidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae also play important roles in pollination. These families consist of various species such as plasterer bees, sweat bees, and resin bees. Many bees are parasitic or cuckoo bees. The contribution of bees and other insects to worldwide crop production is valued at about $190 billion annually. In the United States, insect pollination is estimated at $16 billion per year, with honey bees accounting for three-fourths of the value. Bee pollination is crucial for the production of a variety of high-value fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other crops, contributing to as many as 90 agricultural crops. Both managed and wild bees play a critical role in plant pollination and are economically valuable to U.S. agricultural production. The importance of bee pollination for agricultural crops is significant, with as many as 90 crops depending on it. These crops include apples, avocados, blueberries, cherries, and more. Native bees also contribute to pollination services for various food crops, enhancing agricultural productivity and crop yields. Native bees are more efficient pollinators than honey bees, contributing to the pollination of native plants and commercial crops like almonds. The economic value of pollination services by both managed honey bees and wild bees is hard to quantify. Concerns arise about the availability of honey bee stocks meeting the increasing demand for pollination services. Researchers at Cornell University estimated the total monetary value of insect pollination to U.S. crops at $16.4 billion in 2010, with honey bees contributing $12.4 billion and other insects, including non-Apis bees, contributing $4.0 billion. The economic value of wild bee pollination services is estimated to add $0.9 billion to $2.4 billion per year in value to California's agriculture. California's agriculture heavily relies on pollination services, with native bees contributing up to 15% of the value. Commercial pollination services in the United States are mainly provided by migratory beekeepers who supply bee colonies during crop bloom cycles. Approximately 1.6 million bee colonies are needed to pollinate California's almond trees alone, out of the 2 million colonies rented annually for U.S. agricultural crops. Demand for pollination services is increasing, with bee colonies rented for various crops such as blueberries, apples, pears, cherries, and citrus fruits. Rental fees vary by crop type, with higher fees for berry and tree crops. California's almond industry, for example, has seen an increase in fees from $35 to $75 per colony in recent years. The almond industry has seen a significant rise in pollination fees, with recent estimates reaching $150 per colony or more. This increase is attributed to expanding almond acreage, high honey prices, and a decrease in available honey bees due to colony declines and bee mortalities. Commercial migratory beekeepers, mainly located in the Dakotas and some midwestern states, own the majority of bee colonies in the United States. The USDA does not have comprehensive annual survey data on honey bee colonies, with limited and non-ideal data available for evaluating population changes. Data on honey bee colonies are from statistics tracking operations producing honey for commercial sale and the Census of Agriculture. USDA and national bee laboratories have started surveying beekeepers annually for overwinter colony losses. Available data on bee colonies in honey production are not strictly comparable due to different data compilation purposes. The USDA data on honey bee colonies for commercial honey production may not accurately reflect changes in bee populations, as highlighted by a 2007 study. Concerns include lack of comparability among data compilations, potential misidentification of species, and miscounting due to data collection procedures. The NRC study concluded that long-term population trends for honey bees are declining, with colony losses not uncommon. USDA data shows declines in honey bee populations in various periods, with recent data indicating 3.3 million bee colonies on U.S. farms in 2012, up from 2.9 million in 2007. Limited historical data suggest there were around 6 million honey bee colonies in the past. Limited historical data indicate that there were an estimated 6 million honey bee colonies on U.S. farms during the 1950s, with ongoing consolidation and shifts in the agricultural sector. About one-third of bee colonies are in California, North and South Dakota, Florida, Texas, and Montana. These colonies are crucial for crop pollination, with inconclusive USDA data showing fluctuations but no clear downward trend over time. Over a 10-year period, the number of honey-producing bee colonies in the US dropped from 2.6 million in 2002-2003 to lows of 2.3-2.4 million in 2006-2008. In 2010, there was a 10-year high with nearly 2.7 million colonies. This increase may reflect efforts to replenish hives or the rising popularity of beekeeping as a hobby. Despite more colonies, honey production remains lower compared to a decade ago. States with the highest honey production in the US in 2013 were North Dakota (22%), South Dakota (10%), Montana (10%), Florida (9%), California (7%), and Minnesota (5%). Other major honey-producing states include Idaho, Texas, Michigan, Oregon, Georgia, Nebraska, New York, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The USDA and national bee laboratories track annual honey bee colony losses through a winter loss survey conducted by the Bee Informed Partnership and the Apiary Inspectors of America, supported by USDA and NIFA. Bee colony losses averaged 17%-20% per year between the 1990s and mid-2000s due to various factors like mites. Bee colony losses have increased significantly in recent years, with annual loss rates averaging nearly 30% between the winters of 2006/2007 and 2013/2014. The USDA's 2012/2013 survey showed that 70% of beekeepers reported losses greater than 14%, impacting their economic viability. During the winter of 2006/2007, about one-fourth of beekeepers reported conditions associated with Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). More than 50% of surveyed beekeepers experienced \"abnormally heavy losses\" with total colony losses of 55%, compared to 16% for those with \"normal losses\". Operations affected by CCD-like conditions reported losses of 45% of their managed bee colonies, mainly due to pest diseases. Subsequent surveys showed a decrease in managed honey bee colonies each winter, except for the overwinter of 2011/2012, which saw a nationwide total loss of colonies at 22%, marking an improvement from previous years. However, in the following year (2012/2013), total losses of managed honey bee colonies nationwide increased again. Based on annual surveys, USDA estimates that overwinter colony losses have averaged more than 30% annually since 2006/2007. Bee colonies have continued to decline each year for reasons beyond Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Beekeepers did not report CCD as a major cause of colony loss in recent surveys. Losses with no dead bees present may indicate CCD. Wild bee species are ecologically important for sustainable forests and fields. Comprehensive formal statistics are lacking. Comprehensive formal statistics on populations of wild bees in the United States are lacking, with no thorough surveys conducted on the estimated 3,500 species of solitary bees. Long-term data for wild bees are difficult to obtain, and there is evidence of decline in the abundance of some wild pollinators, particularly bumble bees. The paucity of long-term population data and incomplete knowledge of basic taxonomy and ecology make definitive assessment of wild bee species exceedingly difficult. Studies show that populations of native wild pollinators, including bumble bees, are declining. Various informal \"citizen science\" initiatives have been promoted in different states to gather data on wild bumble bees, but comprehensive information is still lacking. In 2010, scientists reviewed global trends in pollinator species, citing a study on bee diversity in the UK and Netherlands. Specialist and sedentary bee species declined, while mobile generalists thrived. The link between plants and pollinators is correlative, with the cause of declines still unknown. A North American study found that four bumble bee species have declined in abundance by up to 96% and contracted their ranges by 23% to 87%. The decline may be linked to a pathogen (Nosemi bombi) and reduced genetic diversity, but the exact cause is still unclear. Conservation groups have petitioned USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to regulate the movement of commercial bumble bees due to concerns about population declines and the spread of parasites and pathogens among wild bumble bees. Imported bumble bees for pollination of greenhouse crops may be infected with parasites, posing risks to wild bees and honey bees. The North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO) has guidelines for importing non-Apis pollinating insects. Endangered Species Act listings track population changes in wild bee species, like the extinct B. franklini bumble bee. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing species for listing. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is reviewing the rusty patched bumble bee for Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection due to population decline. The Xerces Society and NRDC filed a complaint in 2013, stating the bee has lost 87% of its historic range and is a crucial pollinator for various crops. Studies have shown that changes in flowering times are linked to shifts in bee emergence in spring. Research on pollination and flowering times revealed that 10 bee species emerged earlier in spring from 1970-2010, along with the plants they visited. The data supports climate change as the main driver of these phenological advances. While phenological mismatch has not yet occurred, it could in the future with increasing temperature warming rates. The study focused on generalist bees and flowers, which visit multiple plant species and are visited by various bee species. The study showed no clear connection between climate change and harm to bee species. Trophic cascade may play a role in pollinator interactions, where declining species can be replaced by others. Generalist bee species can provide pollination services even if less effective than specialists. The presence of highly efficient generalist bees like honey bees may mask the loss of native bee species. If honey bee populations decline, the effects of lost populations may be more severe as back-up pollinators have already been reduced. Reductions in honey bee populations could allow other bee populations to rebound. Loss of forest cover and shift to honey bees have impacted meliponine bees in Central and South America. Loss of forest cover eliminates nesting sites for stingless bees, while the shift to honey bees for more intensive production has also reduced their numbers. A study in Brazil found that most bee nests were in hollow trees over 50 cm in diameter. It is recommended that managed forests maintain hollow trees for these bees. Stingless bees are vulnerable to pesticides and other factors like parasites, pathogens, diseases, genetics, miticide resistance, and diet. Increased susceptibility and lowered disease resistance in bees can be attributed to various factors such as miticide resistance, poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding, and pollen scarcity from invasive plants. Other bee management issues include transportation stress, overcrowding, chemical use, and habitat loss. Pesticides, environmental stressors, and climate change also contribute to the decline in bee populations. The USDA's 2011 progress report states that no single factor or specific combination of factors has been identified as the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Researchers believe CCD may be a syndrome caused by many different factors working together, including pesticides, agricultural practices, and climate change. The USDA reports that Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) may not be the sole cause of honey bee colony losses, with more colonies dwindling away in recent years. The absence of dead bees is indicative of CCD, but beekeepers did not report it as a major cause of overwinter losses in 2012-2013 and 2011-2012 surveys. Honey bee population losses can be attributed to various factors such as pests, parasites, and pathogens. The extensive literature on honey bee population losses is attributed to bee pests, parasites, pathogens, and disease. Notable causes include declines due to parasitic mites like Varroa destructor and tracheal mites, as well as colony declines due to the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. Other reasons for bee colony declines include interspecific competition, habitat loss, invasive plant species, bee genetics, and pesticides. Mite infestations, such as Varroa and tracheal mites, have caused significant die-offs since the 1980s, with Varroa mites eliminating most feral bee colonies in the mid-1990s. Varroa parasitism affects both worker bees and male larvae. Varroa parasitism affects worker bees, male larvae, and queen reproduction. It is linked to viral pathogens and can lead to colony mortalities within six months to two years. Paenibacillus larvae causes American foulbrood, reducing colony losses with antibiotics and inspection programs. Mite and pathogen infestations increase beekeeper costs for miticides, antibiotics, labor, management, and colony replacement. USDA estimates mite controls and hive replacement costs every 1-2 years. The Obama Administration issued a Presidential Memorandum in June 2014 to promote the health of honey bees and other pollinators, directing federal agencies to protect and restore domestic populations. Colony losses are being caused by various factors, including mite controls and hive replacement costs every 1-2 years. Symptoms similar to Colony Collapse Disorder have been observed, with past conditions termed autumn collapse, May disease, spring dwindle, disappearing disease, and fall dwindle disease. The Obama Administration established a Pollinator Health Task Force, led by USDA and EPA, to develop a National Pollinator Health Strategy. This strategy includes a Pollinator Research Action Plan to address pollinator losses and improve their health. The task force involves various government departments and agencies to focus on understanding, preventing, and recovering from pollinator declines. The Pollinator Health Task Force, led by USDA and EPA, aims to develop strategies for reducing pollinator exposure to pesticides, targeting resources to high-risk areas, and promoting habitat restoration. Public education plans and public-private partnerships are also part of the strategy to address pollinator loss. The task force member agency will work on increasing and improving pollinator habitat through various means such as facility landscaping, land management, and the use of pollinator-friendly best practices and seed mixes. The National Pollinator Health Strategy aims to enhance pollinator habitat on federal lands through integrated vegetation and pest management. The release of the strategy was delayed to spring 2015. The Council on Environmental Quality and the General Services Administration issued guidance to help federal agencies incorporate pollinator-friendly practices. The Council on Environmental Quality and the General Services Administration issued guidance to help federal agencies incorporate pollinator-friendly practices in new construction, renovations, landscaping improvements, and facility leasing agreements on federal lands and facilities. This guidance amends previous recommendations from 2011 and aims to achieve sustainable federal landscape practices on a significant amount of land and building assets owned by the federal government. Public concerns about pesticide use, particularly from commercial beekeepers and environmental groups, continue to be a major topic of discussion. Conservation groups and land managers are concerned about potential competition between native bees and honey bees due to expanded access for commercial beekeepers on public lands. In October 2014, USDA and other federal agencies held a summit to improve forage plantings for pollinators. Ongoing efforts by USDA and other agencies aim to enhance nutrition and forage for pollinators through various conservation programs on federal lands. In 2013, USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a joint report on honey bee health, focusing on addressing risks from parasites and diseases, particularly the Varroa mite. The report highlighted the importance of understanding CCD, bee pests, pathogens, nutrition, potential pesticide effects, and bee biology. The need for increased genetic diversity in bee colonies is crucial for improving thermoregulation, disease resistance, and worker productivity. Emphasizing traits like hygienic behavior can enhance resistance to Varroa mites and diseases. Improved nutrition is also essential for individual bee and colony longevity, as a poor diet can make bees more susceptible to harm from disease and parasites. Bees require better forage and a variety of plants to support colony health, and land management strategies should be considered to maximize nutritional forage and protect bees from pesticide exposure. Collaboration and information sharing are needed between growers and beekeepers to protect bees from pesticide exposure. Beekeepers also require accurate reporting and monitoring of bee kill incidents. Additional research on pesticide effects on bees in the field is necessary. The National Honey Bee Health Stakeholder Conference Steering Committee includes representatives from various organizations like USDA and EPA. Current research on bee health is primarily conducted by scientists at USDA, the Bee Informed Partnership, and land-grant universities. USDA released an action plan in 2007 to address Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) by improving coordination, redirecting resources, and expanding research. The USDA released an action plan in 2007 to address Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) by conducting surveys, analyzing bee samples, conducting experiments, and developing best management practices to improve bee health. Since 2009, USDA has published annual progress reports on its CCD research. Since 2009, USDA has published annual progress reports on its CCD research, detailing ongoing research on honey bee health and conservation programs. Funding for honey bee research at USDA's ARS has increased since 2008, with total funding ranging from $7,675,000 in FY2007 to $10,128,000 in FY2012. Funding for honey bee research at USDA's ARS has increased since 2008, with total funding ranging from $7,675,000 in FY2007 to $10,309,000 in FY2014. About $3 million is spent annually to address the Varroa mite, with additional funding available for research on honey bees, CCD, and bee health. Emerging issues grants have been awarded to study the effects of pesticides, pathogens, and miticides on pollinator populations. Additional funding has been allocated in conjunction with the release of the June 2014 Presidential Memorandum, including $4 million in assistance to farmers from USDA's NRCS. The NRCS awarded $4 million in assistance to farmers in five midwestern states to improve honey bee health. The CRP provided $8 million in incentives for establishing new habitats for honey bees. NIFA granted $6.9 million to Michigan State University for sustainable pollination strategies. This funding is part of a broader initiative to address pollinator declines. Some beekeepers will receive disaster assistance aid through USDA's ELAP program. States and beekeeper associations are providing grants for new hives and equipment. EPA awarded grants for IPM practices to reduce pesticide use and risk to bees. The 2008 farm bill increased funding for bee research and other farm program support to protect pollinators. Concerns about honey bee health have led to ongoing legislative activity in Congress, with bee health being a top issue for the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research. The 2014 farm bill also includes provisions for bee and pollinator protections. The 2014 farm bill, also known as the most recent omnibus farm bill, reauthorized and expanded provisions from the 2008 farm bill related to honey bees and pollinators. It extends USDA research and conservation provisions through 2018, expands reporting requirements on bee health disorders, and mandates guidance on enhancing pollinator health and viability. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized provisions related to honey bees and pollinators, requiring USDA to assess federal efforts to mitigate pollinator losses and recommend better coordination. Some proposed provisions, like the Protection of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators, were not included in the bill. This provision aimed to improve federal coordination in addressing the decline of managed and native pollinators and promote their long-term viability. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized provisions related to honey bees and pollinators, requiring USDA to assess federal efforts to mitigate pollinator losses and recommend better coordination. It also included a provision for a federal task force on bee health and commercial beekeeping to coordinate efforts to mitigate pollinator losses and conduct research on factors contributing to colony collapse disorder. The 2008 farm bill authorized grants for research on pollinator health, including the effects of pesticides and pathogens on honey bees and native pollinators. USDA was directed to increase capacity to address colony collapse disorder and other threats to pollinator health. Annual appropriations were set at $7.25 million for research and $2.75 million for infrastructure improvements. The 2008 farm bill authorized funding of $7.25 million annually for honey bee and pollinator research at USDA's ARS, with an additional $2.75 million for honey bee pest and pathogen surveillance. The bill also directed USDA to submit annual reports to Congress on colony collapse disorder (CCD) and recommended strategies to reduce colony loss. The 2014 farm bill reiterated the focus on honey bee and native pollinator research efforts. The 2014 farm bill expanded efforts to counteract declining honey bee health and populations, requiring USDA to submit annual reports on colony collapse disorder and recommend strategies to reduce colony losses. Total authorized appropriations are $20 million annually through FY2018 for research and extension activities. The 2014 farm bill authorized $20 million annually through FY2018 for research and extension activities, USDA capacity and infrastructure, and honey bee surveillance. It also directed USDA to consult with other agencies and publish guidance on enhancing pollinator health. The conservation title of the 2008 farm bill encourages habitat development and protection for native and managed pollinators under USDA's conservation programs. The 2014 farm bill expanded USDA's conservation programs to include pollinator habitats and required a review of conservation practice standards for managed and native pollinators. In 2014, NRCS allocated $3 million for farmers to promote honey bee health through conservation practices in five midwestern states. In October 2014, USDA allocated over $4 million in funding to improve honey bee health in five midwestern states: Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. This initiative aligns with the Presidential Memorandum to enhance the health of honey bees and other pollinators. USDA also hosted a \"Honey Bee Nutrition and Forage Summit\" to address the importance of nutrition and forage for honey bee health and sustainable agricultural pollination services. Efforts to support forage areas for native pollinators and managed honey bees are being considered in some state legislatures. Efforts to support forage areas for pollinators are being considered in some state legislatures, including California. The 2008 farm bill supported pollinators through crop insurance and disaster assistance provisions. USDA established the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) as part of its conservation programs. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides relief to producers affected by disease, adverse weather, or natural disasters. Eligible honey bee producers must provide documentation of losses due to colony collapse disorder. ELAP initially covered losses from 2008 to 2011 and was reinstated in 2014 to cover losses from 2011 to 2018, providing up to $20 million annually. ELAP provides up to $20 million annually in funding for beekeepers with dead bees due to disasters like colony collapse disorder. Eligible honeybees include those used for honey production, pollination, or breeding. Wild or feral honeybees are not covered under ELAP. ELAP provides payments for honey bee colony or hive losses based on a percentage of the number of colonies or hives lost due to adverse weather conditions, multiplied by the average fair market value per colony or hive. The average fair market values ranged from $75 to $85 per colony and $210 to $230 per hive for the 2012-2014 program years. ELAP also compensates beekeepers for purchased or harvested feed costs. The USDA provides disaster assistance aid through ELAP for beekeepers who suffered losses from adverse weather conditions. The 2014 farm bill mandates USDA to establish a federal standard of identity for honey, seeking public input on the matter. The 2008 farm bill supports honey production through provisions for the National Honey Board, marketing assistance loans, and nutrition title provisions. In the 113th Congress, Representative Alcee Hastings introduced the Highways BEE Act to promote conservation practices on highway rights-of-ways. The proposed bill aims to promote native plantings on highway rights-of-ways to benefit pollinators and wildlife, reduce maintenance costs, and improve habitat. It was introduced in the 112th Congress as H.R. 2381 and actively supported by Pollinator Partnership/North American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC). In the 113th Congress, Representatives Earl Blumenauer and John Conyers, Jr. introduced H.R. 2692, Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013, which would suspend registrations of neonicotinoids and ban new pesticide registrations for use on bee-attractive plants. The bill aims to ban new pesticide registrations for use on bee-attractive plants until EPA determines no harm to pollinators. It also requires monitoring of native bee health and populations, in response to a mass bee death incident in Oregon. The bill aims to improve managed pollinator bee health by managing resistance to parasitic pests through expedited pesticide registration. USDA and EPA must report to Congress on the threat to bee health and availability of pesticides for managing bee pests like the Varroa mite."
