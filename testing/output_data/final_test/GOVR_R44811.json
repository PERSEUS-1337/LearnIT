States can make up for funding by raising state taxes. The federal government would maintain a smaller program for specific purposes like roads on federal lands and disaster repairs. This would reduce requirements attached to funding. Devolution of surface transportation programs would reduce federal regulations and oversight on projects funded solely by state and local resources. Advocates argue that this would lower construction costs and speed up project completion. Calls for devolution have been made periodically since the Reagan administration, with Congress already granting states more authority over federal highway funds in recent years. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1916 established a federal-state partnership for highway construction, with a required state match of federal funds and formula apportionment. The Federal Aid Highway and Highway Revenue Acts of 1956 increased federal involvement in highway planning and construction, creating the Highway Trust Fund to remove highway funding from the normal appropriations process. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) consolidated 92% of funding into five large formula-driven programs, reversing the proliferation of separate programs for state spending. State DOTs determine funded projects, oversee development, and construction. Federal funding for public transportation has been provided through the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) since 1982, with two accounts: the highway account and the mass transit account. The federal mass transit program involves a relationship between the federal government and transit authorities. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is funded primarily by federal fuel taxes on gasoline and diesel. Fuel taxes account for roughly 85% of the revenue, with the mass transit account receiving 2.86 cents per gallon. Congress has had to fill funding shortfalls with transfers from the Treasury's general fund since 2008. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has received $143.6 billion in transfers from the Treasury's general fund, with the last $70 billion authorized in the FAST Act signed in 2015. The gap between tax revenues and fund outlays is projected to widen, with general fund transfers filling the gap through FY2020. Opposition to raising fuel tax rates has left them unchanged since 1993, resulting in a loss of purchasing power. The Highway Trust Fund faces a funding gap that will need to be addressed after FY2020. Advocates of devolution argue that states are better equipped to handle highway planning and construction, suggesting limited federal involvement. However, even if programs were devolved to states, current revenue sources would still be insufficient to support transportation spending. Advocates of devolution argue for limited federal involvement in highway planning and construction, suggesting that states should handle their own highway needs. They believe public transportation should be a local or state responsibility with no federal involvement. Devolution would give each state control of its motorists' tax payments, reducing regulatory burdens and leading to efficiencies and cost reductions. Critics of devolution have raised concerns about national responsibilities. Critics of devolution argue that national interests, such as a properly functioning national highway network, could be at risk without strong federal support. They believe that devolution may hinder states from concentrating funds for large regional or national projects, as local interests may take precedence over national needs. Additionally, some parts of the nation may struggle to afford necessary infrastructure for economic development and national connectivity without federal funding and regulations. Surface transportation devolution proposals aim to reduce federal programs, lower fuel taxes, and shift funding responsibility to states. Recent changes have given states more control over highway spending, addressing some concerns that led to calls for devolution. Critics argue that devolution could jeopardize national interests like a functional highway network and hinder large regional projects. Surface transportation devolution proposals aim to reduce federal programs, lower fuel taxes, and shift funding responsibility to states. These proposals would eliminate the federal public transportation program and have differing approaches on maintaining the Interstate Highway System and major highway formula grant programs. The treatment of federal safety agencies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is also a point of contention. Devolution proposals aim to shift funding responsibility to states by eliminating the federal public transportation program. This would leave Congress with the choice of funding programs from the Treasury's general fund or letting them expire. The Federal Highway Administration uses contract authority to pay for project costs before construction, with payments made based on commitments from previous years. At the end of FY2016, outstanding obligations totaled $65.5 billion for the highway account and $18.6 billion for the mass transit account, representing previously approved activities that the federal government must pay for when vouchers are submitted. Devolution may require higher motor fuel taxation for funding new highway and public transportation projects. If the government shifts funding responsibility for new highway and public transportation projects to states, it would need to maintain motor fuels taxes or another revenue source to ensure repayment of existing obligations. This taxation would need to continue until all outstanding obligations are paid off, which could take three to four years. Devolution would decrease federal spending on transportation, but the actual savings would be less due to states using tax-exempt bonds. If states compensate for the loss of federal funding by issuing more tax-exempt bonds, the U.S. Treasury would lose revenue. Most devolution proposals would reduce federal motor fuels taxes. The proposal is to gradually reduce federal motor fuels taxes and have states increase their own taxes on gasoline and highway diesel fuel to make up for the reduction. However, replacing federal taxes with state taxes may not generate enough revenue to maintain current spending levels on highways and public transportation. This is because a significant portion of federal transportation spending comes from the general fund, not dedicated taxes. States may need to raise their fuel taxes by 5 or 6 cents per gallon more than the federal reduction. State legislatures may need to pass increases of about 20 to 21 cents per gallon in their state taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel to make up for the reduction in federal motor fuels taxes. States receiving large amounts of federal highway funding relative to their motorists' payments would have to increase their state fuel taxes even more to maintain current spending levels. Some states, like Alaska, may need to increase their fuel taxes by over $1 per gallon under the proposed devolution plan. Several states, such as Vermont, Rhode Island, and Montana, may need to raise fuel taxes by 30 to 40 cents per gallon to offset a 15-cent reduction in federal taxes. On the other hand, states like Texas could potentially lower fuel taxes for motorists. Devolution does not mandate replacement fuel taxes, allowing states to use other revenue sources for transportation funding. States could pass transportation costs to local governments or use tolling instead of higher taxes. Some states may choose to spend less on transportation if federal grants are reduced. Devolution would impact the U.S. Department of Transportation, particularly the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. Staffing at FHWA field offices could be significantly reduced depending on project oversight changes. FHWA would still have responsibilities for certain programs, projects, and safety activities. The Federal Transit Administration's staffing needs would depend on Congress's decision on the federal role in public transportation. The federal government's involvement in transportation planning would also need to be determined, as current law requires state and regional compliance for federal funding. The planning process involves public notification, state and regional goal identification, and development of state and metropolitan plans. Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) exist due to federal requirements, and devolution legislation may need to address the continuation and potential changes to federal mandates for planning. States would need to determine their response to devolution of public transportation responsibilities, potentially creating new mechanisms for oversight and funding if the federal government reduces its role. If the federal government were to retreat from funding public transportation, states may lose federal incentives and sanctions for highway safety. This could lead to states having more discretion over safety policies, potentially resulting in the relaxation of safety regulations. In the early 1970s, Congress enacted funding penalties for states without helmet laws for motorcyclists. By 1975, 49 states had helmet laws, but in 1976 Congress repealed the law, leading many states to also repeal their helmet laws. Advocates of devolution argue that federal requirements for transportation funds negatively impact cost efficiency. Even if federal funding is eliminated, certain requirements like the Davis-Bacon Act would still apply to state transportation projects. The Davis-Bacon Act requires companies with federal or D.C. public works contracts over $2,000 to pay prevailing wages. If states build highways without federal funding, federal prevailing wage requirements would no longer apply. However, 30 states have their own prevailing wage laws. It is uncertain if this would lower highway construction costs due to the higher skill sets of workers attracted by prevailing wages. Highway projects benefit from higher pay attracting skilled workers and increased machinery use for productivity. The Brooks Act mandates contractor selection based on competence and fair compensation for engineering services. Projects on the National Highway System must meet AASHTO standards, while other roads follow state standards. Bridge projects are also subject to these requirements. The AASHTO Bridge Design Specifications set standards for bridge projects using federal funds, while states can use their own standards for projects without federal funds. Compliance with federal bridge standards can be costly for small county or township bridges. States must allow firms from anywhere in the US to bid on highway construction contracts under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7112. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, applying to all employers and contractors regardless of federal funding. Title VI prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs. Devolution could potentially allow states to reserve contracts for in-state or local companies, impacting bid competition and costs. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs based on race, color, or national origin, with additional protections for sex, age, and disability. FHWA and FTA offices ensure funding recipients have Title VI plans and monitor compliance. State DOTs and transit agencies must adhere to Title VI in all programs, including contracts for construction and services. Public transportation agencies are also subject to Title VI regulations. The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program ensures equal opportunity for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses to compete for federally funded contracts. State DOTs must establish approved programs with participation goals. Affirmative action requirements are also enforced by U.S. DOT in contractor compliance programs. The contractor compliance program includes affirmative action requirements for federally funded contracts, ensuring nondiscrimination and civil rights protections for individuals with disabilities under the ADA and Section 504. Public agencies must make facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, regardless of federal funding. Buy America requirements apply to federally funded projects. Buy America requirements impact federally funded highway and public transit projects. Devolution proposals may reduce projects subject to Buy America, but FHWA mandates it for contracts under NEPA if any federal funds are used. DOT approval for federal-aid highway funds hinges on meeting federal environmental requirements, including ADA compliance for contractors. The curr_chunk discusses federal environmental requirements that apply to transportation projects, including those specified in the National Environmental Policy Act. Devolution may exempt state-approved projects from these requirements if they are no longer considered federal actions. The curr_chunk explains that if transportation projects are no longer considered federal actions, certain federal requirements, such as those under the National Historic Preservation Act and other acts, would no longer apply. This includes standards for highway beautification, noise abatement, and wetland protection. The curr_chunk discusses environmental requirements for highway projects, including abatement, mitigation of impacts on wetlands and habitats, and identification of environmental impacts. It mentions the \"Section 4(f)\" prohibition on using federal funds for projects affecting parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. The number of states adopting similar requirements is uncertain without federal direction. Devolution would not eliminate all environmental standards for highway projects, as some federal standards could apply regardless of funding source. The federal highway program would not eliminate environmental requirements under various acts such as the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, or Rivers and Harbors Act."
