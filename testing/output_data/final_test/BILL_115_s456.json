The \"RACE for Children Act\" mandates early discussions on pediatric study plans for drugs treating serious or life-threatening diseases, to address scientific and operational challenges promptly. The \"RACE for Children Act\" requires timely discussions on pediatric study plans for drugs to address scientific and operational challenges that may lead to deferral or waivers. The \"RACE for Children Act\" mandates guidance on pediatric study plans for drugs, with amendments to section 505B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including study designs. The \"RACE for Children Act\" requires guidance on pediatric study plans for drugs, including study designs, molecular targets relevant to pediatric cancers, implementation considerations, and waivers for certain molecular targets. This section applies to drug applications submitted under section 505 or 351 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Public Health Service Act 18 months after enactment. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is amended to include an assessment of the impact of the RACE for Children Act on pediatric drug labeling and efforts to implement earlier submission of pediatric studies. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is amended to include an assessment of the impact of the RACE for Children Act on pediatric drug labeling and efforts to implement earlier submission of pediatric studies. The assessment includes factors such as the average time for the Secretary to respond to pediatric study requests, issue written requests for studies, and the number of requests issued for investigational new drugs before their application submission. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is amended to include a list of sponsors who received exclusivity under section 505A before completing required studies. This section does not limit the Secretary's authority to issue written requests under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is amended to include a list of sponsors who received exclusivity under section 505A before completing required studies. This section does not limit the Secretary's authority to issue written requests under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. IMPROVING THE TIMELINESS OF PEDIATRIC STUDIES. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is amended to include informing the internal review committee about responses to pediatric study requests. The Secretary will review and act upon submissions of proposed pediatric study requests or sponsor's proposed amendments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a plan to achieve earlier submission of pediatric studies under the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. This plan includes recommendations for earlier discussion of study requests with sponsors. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act aims to expedite pediatric study requests by allowing earlier issuance of written requests and shorter timelines for completion of studies. SEC. 4. NEONATOLOGY EXPERTISE. Amendment to the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act regarding the timeframe for implementation."
