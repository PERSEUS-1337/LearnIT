Badri Patarkatsishvili campaigned for presidency in Georgia, proposing a confederation with a weak central government and close ties with Russia.

Observers from OSCE, PACE, and EP found the election to be mostly consistent with democratic standards, despite significant challenges and pervasive violations.

Saakashvili's victory also reassured international investors of Georgia's stable investment climate, although increased social spending may lead to short-term inflation. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe urged opposition politicians to address electoral irregularities through constitutional procedures.
