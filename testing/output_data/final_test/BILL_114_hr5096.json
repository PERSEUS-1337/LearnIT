    "content": "The Act is named the \"Technical Education Creates High-Paying Careers Act of 2016\" or the \"TECH Careers Act.\" It amends the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to establish the American Technical Training Grant Program. The American Technical Training Grant Program, established under the TECH Careers Act, authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to eligible entities for job training programs that help economically disadvantaged students pursue high-skill, high-wage, or high-demand occupations. Eligible entities include institutions offering career and technical education programs that can be completed in 2 years or less. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary requires applications for grants under the American Technical Training Grant Program to be submitted in a specified manner and containing necessary information. Priority for grants is given to entities serving economically disadvantaged individuals, offering training in high-demand sectors, showing potential for high employment rates post-training, and meeting additional criteria set by the Secretary. Partnerships are required and verified before grants are awarded. The Secretary verifies that eligible entities have partnerships with a local workforce development board, an employer in a high-demand industry, an industry organization, and an institution of higher education offering a baccalaureate degree with an articulation agreement. Separate entities are not required to meet partnership requirements. An eligible entity partnering with various organizations like nonprofit organizations, community-based organizations, economic development agencies, schools, and educational agencies is not required to partner with separate entities for each partnership. Grant funds received must be used for specific purposes outlined in the program. The grant funds must be used to establish, redesign, or expand a job training program leading to industry-recognized credentials or certifications, training participants for in-demand industries, addressing basic skills needs, and providing academic credit for prior learning. The grant funds can be used to support job training programs by developing curriculum, conducting evaluations, and providing work-based learning opportunities. Additionally, the program must offer student support services and be accessible to nontraditional students through alternative scheduling. The grant funds can be used to support job training programs by developing curriculum, engaging employers, purchasing supplies, supporting faculty development, providing tuition assistance, childcare, transportation, and other permissible activities for program participants. The grant amount for an eligible entity shall not exceed $5,000,000 for a fiscal year. The Secretary considers smaller grants for initial start-up and larger grants for expansion of existing job training programs. The job training program's effectiveness is measured by graduation rates, job placement rates, and wages earned by graduates. Grants are awarded for a maximum of 3 years, with a possible 2-year extension based on performance indicators. An eligible entity must provide annual data to the Secretary on their job training program, including the number of participants, core performance indicators, median earnings of program completers, and participant placement rates. The job training program must provide data on participant completion and employment with qualifying employers. Data must be disaggregated by various factors such as race, gender, disability status, and English proficiency. The job training program must provide data on participant completion and employment with qualifying employers, including individuals from underrepresented groups and military-connected students. The data collected should be aggregated and published for public access, with a small percentage of funds reserved for data collection and dissemination. The Secretary reserves a small percentage of grant funds for data collection and reporting. Additionally, funds are reserved for awards to entities in rural, tribal, or outlying areas, as well as historically black colleges and universities. The eligible entities receiving grants must secure a matching amount from non-Federal sources for job training programs. The non-Federal contribution can be in cash or in-kind from State, local government, or private sources. Eligible entities receiving grants must use Federal funds to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds for job training programs. $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2017, with additional funding for subsequent years. \"SEC. 222.
