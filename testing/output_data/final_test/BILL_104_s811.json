    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Desalination Act of 1996\" and includes definitions. The \"Water Desalination Act of 1996\" defines key terms such as desalination, saline water, United States, and usable water. Desalination refers to the removal of elements from saline water for beneficial use. Saline water includes sea water, brackish water, and chemically impaired water. The United States encompasses states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and territories. Usable water is high-quality water suitable for various uses. The term \"Secretary\" in the Water Desalination Act of 1996 refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF RESEARCH AND STUDIES. The Secretary is authorized to award grants and contracts for research on converting saline water into usable water. Research topics include investigating desalination processes, cost efficiency, optimal designs, and economic efficiency. The Secretary is authorized to award grants and contracts for research on desalination processes, including increasing economic efficiency, developing pilot systems, studying byproduct recovery, salinity modeling, and toxicity analysis. The Secretary is authorized to recommend desalination projects to Congress within three years of this Act's enactment. Projects must include reports on feasibility, environmental impacts, and may involve engaging personnel, firms, laboratories, and educational institutions for research and studies. The Secretary must ensure that at least three different technologies are evaluated and demonstrated for desalination purposes under this Act. SEC. 4. DESALINATION DEMONSTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary shall administer a program for water desalination and related activities, including designing desalination plants, studying byproduct marketing, and conducting economic surveys on production costs. Federal participation in desalination activities through cooperative agreements with non-Federal entities for the development of water production technologies. SEC. 5. AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION: All information from studies funded under this Act is public. \n\nSEC. 6. TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE: The Secretary can accept help from States and agencies for desalination work.\n\nSEC. 7. COST SHARING. SEC. 7. COST SHARING: The Federal share of project costs under this Act is limited to 50%, with exceptions for feasibility. Operation and maintenance costs are non-Federal responsibilities. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 per year for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 for section 3, with up to $1,000,000 for research grants to institutions of higher education. $25,000,000 for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 for section 4. Consultation required. SEC. 9. CONSULTATION.\n\nThe Secretary must consult with other Federal agencies, including the Secretary of the Army, experienced in desalination research or operations. This Act's authorization does not prevent other agencies from conducting their own desalination programs."
