    "content": "The report discusses state and local restrictions on employing unauthorized aliens following the Supreme Court's decision in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. Whiting. The decision arose from a challenge to the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), which authorized the suspension or termination of licenses for businesses hiring unauthorized aliens and required the use of E-Verify. Preemption, based on the Supremacy Clause, was a key issue raised by business, labor, and civil rights organizations. One essential aspect of the federal government structure is that states can be precluded from taking actions within their authority if federal law is thwarted. Congress may preempt state or local action in three ways: express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption. The Supreme Court's decision in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. Whiting found that LAWA was not preempted by federal immigration law, potentially allowing for more state and local restrictions on employing unauthorized aliens. Several lower court decisions post-Whiting suggest that state and local E-Verify measures must align with federal law to avoid preemption. Criminalizing work by unauthorized aliens was preempted in Arizona v. United States. This report does not cover state and local enforcement of federal immigration law or measures restricting unauthorized aliens from housing, work, or public benefits. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established federal regulation of immigration and naturalization, but did not initially address employment of unauthorized aliens. Some states later enacted laws prohibiting the employment of non-lawful residents. The Supreme Court's 1976 decision in De Canas v. Bica addressed the constitutionality of a California law prohibiting the employment of unauthorized aliens. The Court ruled that such a measure was within the state's police power and not preempted by federal immigration law. In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) made it illegal to hire unauthorized aliens in the United States. Employers must verify eligibility to work through I-9 forms and present specified identification documents. Compliance with these requirements is necessary to avoid penalties. The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) prohibits the unlawful employment of aliens in the United States. Employers must verify eligibility through I-9 forms and specified identification documents to avoid penalties. Violations may result in civil and/or criminal penalties under federal law. The \"savings clause\" in IRCA potentially saves state and local \"licensing and similar laws\" from preemption, but implied preemption remains a possibility. Congress later expanded IRCA's employment verification regime. Congress expanded upon IRCA's employment verification regime with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which led to the development of the E-Verify program. Participation in the pilot programs is generally voluntary, but entities that opt-in and confirm employee eligibility establish a presumption of compliance with IRCA. Despite these efforts, concerns about unauthorized alien employment persist, especially at the state level. Beginning in 2006, states and localities enacted measures to deter unauthorized aliens by restricting access to work, housing, and benefits. Some required employers to use E-Verify. Federal courts had differing views on whether these measures were preempted by federal immigration law before the Supreme Court's decision in Whiting. Some federal courts found state and local measures requiring employers to use E-Verify were not preempted by federal immigration law, leading to differences among courts of appeals. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Whiting to address these discrepancies. In Chicanos por la Causa v. Napolitano, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that the Legal Arizona Workers Act was preempted by federal immigration law. The court ruled that the Act's provisions for suspending and terminating licenses of employers hiring unauthorized aliens were valid based on the plain meaning of \"license\" and the legislative history of IRCA. This decision influenced the Supreme Court's ruling in Whiting. The Ninth Circuit upheld LAWA's licensing provisions, stating they were not preempted by federal law. They also found that LAWA's E-Verify requirements were not preempted by IIRIRA. The Tenth Circuit also ruled in favor of E-Verify requirements in a separate case. However, other courts have found state and local measures preempted by federal immigration law. In Lozano v. City of Hazleton, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found that a city ordinance with licensing provisions and an E-Verify requirement like those in LAWA was preempted by federal immigration law. The Third Circuit determined that the provisions conflicted with IRCA by disrupting the balance Congress had established between deterring employment of unauthorized aliens, minimizing burdens on employers, and protecting individuals from discrimination. The ordinance was deemed to prioritize deterring unauthorized alien employment, undermining this balance. The Third Circuit found that a city ordinance similar to LAWA was preempted by federal immigration law as it undermined the balance established by Congress. The ordinance conflicted with IRCA by prioritizing deterring unauthorized alien employment over other congressional objectives. In Whiting, the Supreme Court upheld LAWA's licensing provisions and E-Verify requirements in a 5-3 decision. The Supreme Court upheld LAWA's licensing provisions and E-Verify requirements in a 5-3 decision, with Chief Justice Roberts emphasizing the plain wording of IRCA's savings clause and Arizona statute. Three Justices dissented, arguing for express preemption of LAWA's licensing provisions and implied preemption of its E-Verify requirements. Justice Kagan recused herself from the case. The Supreme Court upheld LAWA's licensing provisions under IRCA, stating that it governs only the suspension or termination of licenses. The Court rejected arguments against LAWA being a licensing law, citing its definition of \"license\" and the need to interpret IRCA's savings clause broadly. The Court also mentioned that even if LAWA wasn't a \"licensing law,\" IRCA's savings clause covers \"similar laws.\" Arguments based on IRCA's legislative history were deemed unpersuasive. The Court upheld LAWA's licensing provisions under IRCA, stating that no limit is discernible in the statutory text. Congress's authoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history. The Court found that IRCA specifically preserved states' authority to impose sanctions through licensing laws on persons who employ unauthorized aliens. Arizona's system closely tracks IRCA's provisions and does not conflict with federal law. The Court upheld LAWA's licensing provisions under IRCA, citing that it closely tracks IRCA's provisions and does not conflict with federal law. LAWA adopts IRCA's definition of \"unauthorized alien\" and prohibits state investigators from independently determining aliens' work authorization. The Court also referenced 8 U.S.C. \u00a71373(c) as evidence that Congress did not intend for the federal system to be exclusive. Additionally, the Court rejected arguments that LAWA upsets the balance Congress sought to strike with IRCA, stating that regulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not a dominant federal concern. The Court upheld LAWA's licensing provisions under IRCA, stating that penalties for violations are not a \"business death penalty\" but typical of a licensing regime. Congress intended to balance state and federal interests, not just deter unauthorized immigration. LAWA's E-Verify requirements were found not to be preempted by federal law. The Court upheld LAWA's E-Verify requirements, stating that they are not preempted by federal law as they do not conflict with federal law. The Court found that Arizona's mandatory use of E-Verify is consistent with federal law, as the Secretary of Homeland Security is only prohibited from requiring its use, not anyone else. The Court also noted that the Federal Government has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of E-Verify. The Court upheld LAWA's E-Verify requirements, stating they are not preempted by federal law. Three Justices dissented, arguing that LAWA should be found to be expressly preempted. Justice Breyer objected to the majority's characterization of LAWA as a \"licensing law\" falling within IRCA's savings clause. Justice Breyer criticized the majority's reliance on the plain meaning of \"license\" in interpreting Congress's intent regarding LAWA's E-Verify requirements. He argued that the statutory context, not dictionary definitions, should be used. Breyer also warned that the majority's opinion could hinder Congress's objectives by allowing states to turn permission-related laws into employment-related licensing laws. The dissenting Justices believed that LAWA's requirements were preempted because they made mandatory what federal law intended to be voluntary, obstructing Congress's goals. Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's interpretation of LAWA's licensing provisions. Breyer argued that states should not be allowed to make the E-Verify program mandatory, while Sotomayor believed that IRCA expressly preempts state laws determining employer violations. Both Justices felt that Congress intended for federal law to uniformly regulate employment of unauthorized aliens, preempting states from independently adjudicating employer compliance. The dissenting Justices disagreed with the majority's interpretation of LAWA's E-Verify requirement, arguing that federal law limits the use of I-9 forms and does not allow states to access information on aliens' work authorization. They believed that LAWA's requirement goes against Congress' decision to make participation in E-Verify voluntary, and that it directly regulates the relationship between the federal government and private parties. They also highlighted the federal government's unique interest in managing the E-Verify database. The U.S. government has a federal interest in managing the E-Verify database, and Congress chose not to create a mandatory program due to costs. The Supreme Court's decision in Whiting may allow for more state and local restrictions on unauthorized alien employment. However, state and local E-Verify measures must align with federal law to avoid being preempted. For example, a Louisiana state statute requiring E-Verify for all employees was struck down for preempting federal rules. The federal government manages the E-Verify database, and Congress did not create a mandatory program due to costs. The Supreme Court's decision in Whiting may allow for more state and local restrictions on unauthorized alien employment. State and local E-Verify measures must align with federal law to avoid being preempted. Calls have been made for Congress to preempt state and local licensing measures that differ significantly from federal law. Legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses to preempt state and local E-Verify requirements and measures that prohibit employers from verifying new hires or current employees through E-Verify. This legislation aims to establish that federal laws do not preempt state or local measures imposing sanctions on those who employ unauthorized aliens, potentially shaping the extent of state and local restrictions on employing unauthorized aliens."
