    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that coastal and estuarine areas are vital habitats for commercial fish, shellfish, coastal birds, and natural plant communities. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 recognizes the national importance of these areas and establishes a partnership for protecting reserves and managing growth. The National Estuarine Research Reserve system relies on protecting designated areas for long-term preservation and research. The need for protecting and conserving coastal and estuarine resources is driven by intense development pressures in the coastal watershed. Acquiring interests in property from willing sellers is a cost-effective way to permanently protect undeveloped coastal lands. Permanent protection of lands in the coastal zone is essential for maintaining and enhancing coastal and estuarine areas for the benefit of the United States. Conserving coastal and estuarine lands is crucial for protecting water quality, public beach access, wildlife habitat, and fisheries. Federal, State, and NGO land acquisition projects have significantly contributed to the health of coastal systems. Enhanced protection can be achieved through coordinated watershed-based strategies at various levels of government. Preserving these lands also supports the economic and natural resources of coastal communities, including well-managed forests with ecological, recreational, historical, and aesthetic value. Establishment of Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program to protect important coastal and estuarine areas threatened by development. The program will be administered by the National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program to protect coastal and estuarine areas. Grants will be provided to coastal States or National Estuarine Research Reserves for property acquisition to further coastal zone management plans or watershed protection plans. Grants will be allocated through a competitive grant process. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program will provide grants to States for property acquisition to protect coastal and estuarine areas. States must consult with relevant entities to identify conservation needs, evaluate impacts on working waterfront needs, and identify values to be protected. The applicant must identify values to be protected, management activities planned, and how they may affect the identified values. Awards are based on demonstrated need for protection and ability to leverage funds. The governor or designated lead agency must ensure consistency with the State's approved coastal zone plan. Priority is given to lands with significant ecological value that can be effectively managed and protected. The Secretary will consult with other agencies and entities in developing guidelines. States and National Estuarine Research Reserves may allocate grants for land acquisition in cooperation with local governments, nongovernmental entities, and Federal agencies. The Secretary will develop measures to ensure property is acquired only from willing sellers and performance measures to evaluate the program's effectiveness. Grants under the program require matching non-Federal funds, with a maximum federal share of 75 percent. The program funded by grants requires a maximum of 75 percent federal funds, with the possibility of a waiver for underserved communities. Other federal funds can be used to cover the remaining project costs. The non-Federal cost share for a project can include the value of land or a conservation easement acquired within 3 years prior to the project application. The appraised value of the land at project closing will be considered the non-Federal cost share. The value of land held by a nongovernmental organization can be used for conservation purposes if held in perpetuity by a qualified conservation organization. Costs for land acquisition, management planning, remediation, restoration, and enhancement can be used as non-Federal match if identified in the plan and incurred within the grant period. At least 15 percent of funds under the program must be reserved for acquisitions benefiting National Estuarine Research Reserve sites. The program aims to acquire property for National Estuarine Research Reserves, with a limit of 5% of funds for administrative costs. The grant recipient must ensure the property is held in perpetuity and managed appropriately. The Secretary must report expenditures annually to Congress. The program acquires property for National Estuarine Research Reserves, with limits on administrative costs. The property must be managed in line with program purposes and not converted for other uses. If sold, funds must be returned to the Secretary for redistribution. Definitions include \"coastal State\" and \"conservation easement.\" The Act authorizes the acquisition of property for National Estuarine Research Reserves, with restrictions on administrative costs. Property rights must align with the Act's goals, except for those expressly reserved by the grantor. The term \"interest in property\" includes a conservation easement. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013."
