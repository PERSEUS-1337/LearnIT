    "content": "Section 651 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to authorize alternative dispute resolution in all district courts. The chapter defines alternative dispute resolution as any process involving a neutral third party to resolve issues, excluding adjudication. Each US district court must allow alternative dispute resolution in civil actions through local rules, with arbitration subject to specific authorization. District courts must establish their own programs to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution methods. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in US district courts. Existing programs will be evaluated and improved, with designated personnel overseeing the implementation and administration of these programs. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 authorizes attorneys to serve as neutrals and arbitrators in the court's alternative dispute resolution program. It also allows the Federal Judicial Center and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to support district courts in establishing and enhancing these programs. SEC. 4. JURISDICTION. Section 652 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: \"Sec. 652. Jurisdiction\" Each district court must require litigants in civil cases to consider alternative dispute resolution processes, such as mediation and arbitration. This requirement can be waived for certain actions with the parties' consent. Each district court may exempt specific cases from considering alternative dispute resolution. The Attorney General's authority to conduct litigation is not affected by this section. Confidentiality provisions for alternative dispute resolution processes are pending adoption. Each district court must ensure confidentiality in alternative dispute resolution processes by adopting local rules to prohibit disclosure of confidential communications. SEC. 5. MEDIATORS AND NEUTRAL EVALUATORS. Section 653 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: \"Sec. 653. Neutrals\" Each district court using alternative dispute resolution processes must have a panel of neutrals available for parties, with their own selection procedures. Neutrals should be qualified and trained, including magistrate judges, professional neutrals, and individuals trained in ADR processes. Each district court must issue rules for disqualifying neutrals until rules are adopted under chapter 131 of this title. This includes disqualification under section 455 of this title, other applicable law, and professional responsibility standards. SEC. 6. ACTIONS REFERRED TO ARBITRATION. Section 654 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: \"Sec. 654. Arbitration\" Section 654 of title 28, United States Code allows for the referral of civil actions to arbitration by district courts with the consent of the parties, except in cases involving alleged violations of constitutional rights, jurisdiction under section 1343, or claims for money damages exceeding $150,000. Safeguards are in place until specific rules are established. The district court must establish procedures to ensure freely obtained consent for arbitration in civil actions, with no prejudice for refusal to participate. Damages are presumed to be under $150,000 unless certified otherwise. This does not affect existing arbitration programs under title IX of the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act. SEC. 7. ARBITRATORS. Section 655 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: \"Sec. 655. Arbitrators\" Arbitrators appointed under section 654 have the power to conduct hearings, administer oaths, make awards, and must meet certification standards including taking an oath and being subject to disqualification rules. Immunity is granted to all arbitrators in alternative dispute resolution programs under this chapter. Arbitrators in alternative dispute resolution programs have quasi-judicial functions and are granted immunities and protections. SEC. 8 amends Section 656 of title 28, United States Code, regarding subpoenas for arbitration hearings. SEC. 9 amends Section 657 of title 28, United States Code, concerning arbitration awards and judgments. An arbitration award made under this chapter must be filed with the district court promptly after the hearing. The award becomes a court judgment if no trial de novo is requested. The judgment is final and not subject to appeal. The court can seal the contents of the arbitration award. The arbitration award made under this chapter must be promptly filed with the district court. If no trial de novo is requested within 30 days, the award becomes a final court judgment. The court cannot admit any evidence of the arbitration proceedings during a trial de novo. In an arbitration proceeding, details about the award or conduct cannot be disclosed unless the evidence is admissible in court under the Federal Rules of Evidence or the parties have agreed otherwise. SEC. 10. COMPENSATION OF ARBITRATORS AND NEUTRALS. The district court establishes compensation for arbitrators and neutrals under approved regulations. Transportation expenses may be reimbursed. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
