    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that police are not legally obligated to protect individual citizens, only the public in general, as shown in court cases like Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith also acknowledged this. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith informed Florida legislators that police only responded to 200,000 out of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County authorities. The United States Department of Justice found that in 1989, there were 168,881 violent crimes where police did not respond within 1 hour. Currently, there are approximately 150,000 police officers on duty at any given time. Additionally, over 2,400,000 people in the United States use firearms to defend themselves against criminals each year. This equates to more than 6,500 people a day using guns for self-defense, showing the frequency of citizens needing to protect themselves. Each year, firearms are used 60 times more often for self-defense than to take lives. Of the 2,400,000 self-defense cases, over 192,000 are by women defending against sexual abuse. 92 percent of the time, citizens merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off attackers. Less than 8 percent result in killing or wounding the attacker. Law-abiding citizens are often prosecuted for using firearms in self-defense. For example, in 1986, Don Bennett of Oak Park, Illinois, faced legal action for defending himself. In 1986, Don Bennett of Oak Park, Illinois, was shot at by 2 men who stole $1,200 in cash and jewelry from his service station. Bennett was arrested for violating the handgun ban. Ronald Biggs of Goldsboro, North Carolina, was arrested for shooting an intruder in 1990 after being assaulted by four men in his home. Don Campbell of Port Huron, Michigan, was arrested and charged after shooting a criminal assailant in 1991. The prosecutor planned to use the assailant to testify against Campbell for using a firearm, but dropped the charges due to community pressure. Courts grant immunity to police officers using firearms, and law-abiding citizens should not be sued for using firearms in self-defense. Felons should not be sued by the violent felons they defended themselves against. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed by law, allowing individuals to use firearms in specific situations such as self-defense against imminent threats or during the commission of a violent felony. The term \"firearm\" includes shotguns and rifles as defined by law. The right to possess firearms for self-defense is protected by law, including shotguns, rifles, and handguns. Violations of this right can be legally challenged in court for damages and injunctive relief, with the possibility of receiving attorney's fees. There is a 5-year statute of limitations for bringing such actions. After a 5-year period from the discovery of the violation, legal action can be taken to challenge violations of the right to possess firearms for self-defense."
