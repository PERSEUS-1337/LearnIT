    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fairness to All Fallen Vietnam War Service Members Act of 2002\". The Congress authorized the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to construct a memorial honoring those who served in the Vietnam war by inscribing the names of fallen or missing Armed Forces members on a memorial wall. The Fund relied on the Department of Defense to compile the list of names for inclusion. The Memorial Fund established procedures for correcting mistakes in inscribing names on the memorial wall. The Department of Defense determines eligibility requirements for veterans to have their names inscribed, including dying in Vietnam between 1955-1960 or in a combat zone after 1961. Public Law 106-214 authorizes the placement of a plaque at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor veterans who died as a direct result of their service in the Vietnam war but are not eligible for inscription on the memorial wall. The plaque at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial honors veterans who died as a direct result of their service in the Vietnam war but are not eligible for inscription on the memorial wall. Names like those of the 74 servicemembers who died aboard the USS Frank E. Evans on June 3, 1969, are examples of those not eligible. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a study to identify veterans who died as a result of military operations in southeast Asia after November 1, 1955, but are not eligible for inscription on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The study will also evaluate revising eligibility requirements for the memorial wall and creating alternative recognition for these veterans. A report must be submitted to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress based on a study conducted to identify veterans not eligible for inscription on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The report will include reasons for ineligibility, alternative eligibility requirements, alternative means of recognition, and conclusions/recommendations on feasibility and equitability of alternatives. When preparing the report, the Secretary of Defense will consult with various entities including the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of the Interior, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc., the American Battle Monuments Commission, the Vietnam Women's Memorial, Inc., and the National Capital Planning Commission."
