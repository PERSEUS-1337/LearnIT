    "content": "The 116th Congress is considering changes to U.S. mineral policy that could impact revenue streams, industries, and states. Mineral mining in the U.S. had a value added of $60.6 billion in 2018, contributing 0.3% to total U.S. GDP. The value-added contribution of minerals mined on federal lands is unknown due to incomplete data recording by the Bureau of Land Management. The U.S. Department of the Interior estimates that coal and solid minerals mined on federal lands supported $13.9 billion in value added, $24.2 billion in economic output, and 81,700 jobs in FY2018. This report introduces the framework for mining on federal lands, including topics such as mineral production data availability, federal mineral royalties, land withdrawals, and critical minerals. The statutory framework for mining on federal lands consists of mineral laws and land regulations. The statutory framework for mining on federal lands combines mineral laws, land laws, and laws impacting mining directly or indirectly. It is presented in four subsections: \"Laws Establishing Mineral Categories,\" \"Land Laws Applicable to Mining,\" \"Laws That Apply to Mining on Federal and Non-Federal Lands,\" and \"Selected Federal Laws That May Impact Mining on Federal Lands.\" This framework generally categorizes minerals into locatable, leasable, and salable categories for mining on federal lands. The General Mining Law of 1872 categorizes minerals on federal lands into locatable (hardrock), leasable, and salable categories. Leasable minerals require lease and royalty payments, while salable minerals only require payment for the quantity purchased. Locatable minerals are high-value minerals like gold, copper, lead, gypsum, and gemstones. If a locatable mineral is on acquired land, it becomes a leasable mineral. Leasable minerals, defined by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, include coal, phosphate, potassium, and sodium. Mining these minerals on federal land involves lease payments and production royalties. Salable minerals, as per the Materials Act of 1947, are low-value materials like sand, gravel, and pumice sold at fair market value from community pits on federal lands. Salable minerals from federal lands are sold at fair market value from community pits or under formal arrangements. Some entities can obtain salable minerals for free, excluding those in valuable deposits. The United States' land area has grown through purchases, cessions, and acquisitions, leading to changes in federal land acreage. Federal land management agencies include the BLM, FWS, and National Park Service. The BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS are federal land management agencies. BLM manages 244.4 million acres of surface lands and 708.5 million acres of federal mineral estate. Mining regulations vary based on surface and subsurface ownership. Mining is allowed in national forests managed by the Forest Service and BLM. New mining claims are not allowed in national parks. Regulations for mining on acquired lands may differ from other federal lands. Regulations for mining on acquired lands may differ from other federal lands, depending on the mineral. The Department of Energy manages and leases about 25,000 acres of federal land withdrawn for mining uranium. Mineral production data availability varies based on the type of federal land. The Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA) guides DOI and BLM in managing federal lands, emphasizing multiple use and sustained yield principles. Public lands are to remain in federal ownership unless disposal is deemed necessary by the DOI. Under the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) prepares resource management plans for public lands, incorporating input from stakeholders. The BLM coordinates with surface management agencies for mining operations not under its jurisdiction. The DOI has the authority to withdraw lands from mineral entry. Acquired lands, obtained through purchase, donation, or eminent domain, may have different regulations for mineral leasing. Millions of acres have been acquired by the federal government, with minerals on these lands considered leasable under the Mineral Leasing Act. The Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, passed in 1947, allows minerals on acquired lands to be leasable. The Stock Raising Homestead Act of 1916 created split estate lands, where surface rights were owned by settlers and subsurface rights by the federal government. No new split estate lands have been created since 1976. Mining on split estate lands requires notification and compensation to the surface owner for any damage. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act created MSHA to enforce safety rules for all U.S. mines. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established OSMRE to oversee coal mining operations and ensure environmental protection and land restoration. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) ensures land restoration after mining and pursues reclamation of abandoned coal mines. SMCRA requires a reclamation bond for coal mining permits. Other laws like NEPA, CWA, CAA, ESA, and NHPA may also apply to mining on federal lands. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) guides the process of mining on federal lands by identifying the surface and subsurface management agencies involved. These agencies determine if the targeted mining area is available for exploration and mining, ensuring it is still under federal control and not designated for other purposes like national parks or military bases. The managing agency also provides information on mineral leasing requirements for acquired lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the subsurface management agency for mining on federal lands, with additional regulations for mining on Indian territories. The BLM's responsibilities include resource evaluation, drilling permits, mining plans, inspections, and enforcement. The process to open a new mine on federal lands depends on the type of mineral to be mined. The process of mining on federal lands depends on the type of mineral to be mined. If the mineral is locatable and on open federal lands, exploration can begin without a permit if there is no surface disturbance. Staking a claim is required to indicate the boundaries of the mineral area. The person exploring is responsible for ensuring the area is open for claiming and has no prior claims. On public land open to mineral entry, locatable minerals can be claimed through lode or placer claims. Lode claims are for minerals in place, while placer claims are for moved minerals. Claim sizes are limited, and reclamation costs must be approved by the BLM for mining operations on federal lands. The mine operator must submit an estimate of reclamation costs to the BLM for approval and provide a financial guarantee equal to that amount. The guarantee is held until operations cease and the site is reclaimed. Claimants must pay a location fee and an annual maintenance fee. Claim holders may need to file annual documentation. Mining claims meeting certain conditions can be patented under the General Mining Law, but moratoria have been placed on the patent process since 1994. Exploration on split-estate lands requires following detailed processes. If the mineral is leasable, exploration requires a permit. Exploration for valuable mineral deposits on acquired lands requires a prospecting permit to identify deposits and an exploration license for additional information. The BLM may issue preference right leases or competitive lease sales for valuable mineral deposits. Leases for leasable minerals may have minimum royalties and require payment of rent and royalties. Exploration for coal on federal lands requires specific regulations and statutes. It begins with a designation of suitable land, followed by obtaining an exploration license, bond, and compliance with federal obligations and regulations. The BLM publishes a notice inviting parties to express interest in coal exploration. The BLM invites interested parties to explore for coal on federal lands through a competitive leasing process. Only U.S. citizens, associations, corporations, and public bodies can obtain coal leases through sealed bids. The lease is awarded to the highest bid meeting fair market value requirements. Coal leases on federal lands are limited to 75,000 acres per state or 150,000 acres in the U.S. Annual rental payment is $3 per acre, with royalties required for coal mining. Surface mined coal has a 12.5% royalty, while underground mining has an 8% royalty. A lease bond to the BLM is also necessary. Salable minerals removal requires a sales contract from the local BLM office, with free use permits available to certain entities. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees the process for opening new mineral deposits on federal lands, including common use areas for immediate mineral removal. Legislation in the 116th Congress addresses policy concerns related to mining on federal lands, with bills introduced in the House or Senate. The BLM currently collects mineral production data for leasable and salable minerals on federal lands, but not for locatable minerals. Concerns have been raised about the lack of authority to collect information on hardrock minerals produced on federal land. The USGS data is limited in determining hardrock mineral production on federal lands. The DOI reports estimates of hardrock mineral production on federal lands, which can impact various policy areas such as royalties and reclamation bonds for locatable minerals. This lack of production data hinders analysis of policy changes and assessment of reclamation bond adequacy. The DOI is tasked with coordinating the publication of a list of critical minerals, with one criterion being net import reliance. It is unclear how locatable mineral production on federal lands is factored into this calculation. Congress could address this by requiring the collection of mineral production data from federal lands. H.R. 2579, the Hardrock Leasing and Reclamation Act of 2019, would mandate mining operations on federal lands to report production volumes and values, making the data public. Locatable minerals are not subject to federal royalties, unlike leasable minerals. Some states assess royalties on locatable minerals mined on federal lands, prompting Congress to consider establishing a royalty policy for these minerals. The debate revolves around whether royalties should be imposed to compensate for the removal of public assets for private gain, or if royalty-free access should be maintained to support mining activity and economic benefits. Setting mineral royalties too high could hinder mining operations and impact national priorities. Congress also needs to address the complexities of different types of royalties and their effects on mining activities. The curr_chunk discusses different types of royalties, including unit-based, ad valorem, and profit-based royalties, and the complexities involved in setting royalty rates for different minerals. It also mentions the consideration of H.R. 2579, the Hardrock Leasing and Reclamation Act of 2019, which aims to close federal lands to new mining claims. The bill aims to close federal lands to new mining claims under the General Mining Law of 1872, establish a federal royalty of 12.5%, and create a Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund for reclamation of abandoned mines and environmental conservation activities. It also requires data collection on mine production and royalties paid, as well as regular inspection of all hardrock mines on federal lands. Federal lands can be closed to mining through withdrawal, which limits activities under general land laws to maintain public values or reserve land for specific purposes. A withdrawal does not always close land to mining and may not restrict other land uses. Withdrawals can be done through legislation, executive order, or agency action for a specified period. The DOI and involved agencies may allow existing mining claims to continue or offer other federal land in exchange. Federal land withdrawals can close land to mining, including NPS lands. The mining industry advocates for limited withdrawals to maintain access to public lands for mining operations. Advocates for specific land withdrawals prioritize proposed uses over potential mining interests. An example of a withdrawal affecting mining on federal lands occurred in 2012. In 2012, the Secretary of the Interior withdrew one million acres of federal land near the Grand Canyon National Park from new mineral development for 20 years, impacting active uranium mining operations. H.R. 1373 passed the House to permanently withdraw this area. The Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) is currently withdrawn until 2021, with the Department of the Air Force requesting an extension and expansion of the withdrawal by 300,000 acres. The State of Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources has produced a map of existing and proposed expansion areas, including affected active mining claims. H.R. 5606 and S. 3145 would expand and renew withdrawn federal land. Twin Metals Minnesota (TMM) planned a mine in the Superior National Forest, which was withdrawn from mineral entry in 1930 but reopened in 1950. TMM holds leases issued in 1966, renewed twice, with no mineral production. In 2016, DOI canceled the leases, but in 2017, they were renewed. H.R. 5598 is involved in this matter. H.R. 5598 would withdraw federal lands in the Superior National Forest, including those covered by Twin Metals Minnesota (TMM) leases. Critical minerals are essential for economic and national security, with various lists existing, but their definition is subjective. The United States has limited known locations of critical minerals that could be economically produced and lacks refining capabilities. This results in vulnerable dependencies on imported critical minerals and products containing them. The limitations of using net import reliance to define critical minerals are not fully defined. Some known critical mineral deposits, such as the Idaho Cobalt Operation and Twin Metals Minnesota mining project, are on federal lands. The USGS Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI) aims to identify critical mineral resources, particularly rare-earth elements, with many focus areas in the western region likely on federal lands. The Earth MRI program aims to identify critical mineral resources, focusing on the western region and federal lands. Policy options to address concerns related to critical minerals include expanding mineral production on federal and non-federal lands and creating mapping and mineral exploration programs like Earth MRI to increase access to secure quantities of critical minerals. Policy options for addressing concerns related to critical minerals include stockpiling additional minerals at the National Defense Stockpile, supporting a domestic supply chain based on recycling, and securing more access to critical minerals. Maintaining substantial supplies could be costly and complex, limiting the effectiveness of stockpiling. The National Defense Stockpile is not to be used for economic purposes, and much demand for critical minerals comes from private consumption. Supporting a domestic supply chain for critical minerals through recycling consumer products could involve funding research to reduce recycling costs. Other support measures could include tariffs or quotas on imported critical minerals to make domestic sources more cost competitive. Congress is currently considering bills related to critical minerals, including the \"American Energy Innovation Act of 2020\" which incorporates language from various energy and mineral bills. The bill includes provisions from S. 1317 and S. 1052, directing the USGS to publish information on domestic critical mineral resources, establish a research program in the DOE to improve supply chain efficiencies and promote recycling for critical minerals. It repeals the National Critical Materials Act of 1984 and authorizes $50 million per year for 10 years for these activities. H.R. 4410 and S. 1052 focus on rare-earth minerals and thorium. H.R. 4410 establishes a federal cooperative and corporation for processing and selling rare-earth minerals. S. 1052 directs the DOE to develop technologies for extracting rare-earth elements from coal, with an annual funding of $23 million for eight years. H.R. 2531 authorizes high-priority infrastructure projects for critical minerals, aiming to expedite permit issuance. H.R. 3405 seeks to remove uranium from the list of critical minerals. H.R. 3567 directs the Under Secretary of... H.R. 3567 directs the Under Secretary of Defense to establish guidance for acquiring rare-earth materials from non-adversarial countries and dispose of three million pounds of tungsten. S. 3356 requires DOE grants for battery recycling projects and programs, with $10 million authorized for one year. The bill authorizes $10 million for the existing Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Prize competition at the DOE and $30 million per year for five years."
