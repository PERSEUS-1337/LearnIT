    "content": "In recent years, Congress has focused on promoting U.S. industry competitiveness through legislative proposals related to intellectual property laws. H.R. 2466 and S. 1770 in the 113th Congress aimed to address trade secret misappropriation through private causes of action. These bills targeted individuals located outside the U.S. who cause harm to American interests. However, as of the report's publication, neither bill had been passed. Trade secrets are defined as valuable, confidential information. Trade secrets refer to valuable, confidential information such as formulae, manufacturing techniques, and customer lists. Protection is mainly governed by state laws, allowing for injunctions and damages in cases of misappropriation. The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 criminalizes trade secret theft. While trade secrets incentivize innovation by allowing firms to benefit from their inventions, they also raise concerns about suppressing innovation and impacting employee mobility. The report provides an overview of trade secrets, discussing their role in U.S. innovation policy, sources of trade secret law, federal legislation, the relationship between patent law and trade secret law, and congressional issues. Businesses use proprietary information for a competitive advantage. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of proprietary information in providing a competitive advantage, including high-tech and low-tech information such as customer lists and marketing strategies. It also mentions the value of \"negative know-how\" in avoiding failed techniques. As the U.S. economy shifts towards knowledge-based industries, firms' competitiveness relies more on their intangible assets and know-how. The importance of intangible assets, particularly trade secrets, has significantly increased in the U.S. economy over the past half-century. The value of intangible assets in the S&P 500 companies has risen from 16.8% in 1975 to 79.7% in 2005. This shift is attributed to advancements in computer technology, cell phones, and the Internet, making it more challenging for firms to protect their proprietary information. The transition to the Information Age has made it harder for firms to keep their proprietary information confidential. Trade secret theft now involves downloading data from computers or taking photos of documents with cell phones. Foreign firms and governments are increasingly engaging in industrial espionage against U.S. companies. The United States is a prime target for foreign economic collection and industrial espionage due to its technological leadership. Trade secret law protects against the misappropriation of non-public information. Trade secrets are considered a crucial intellectual property right, with a need for a balanced approach to provide strong protection. Trade secret law provides strong protection for proprietary commercial information, allowing firms to benefit from their investments in developing information without sharing it with others. This law incentivizes innovation and encourages firms to invest in human capital. Firms can easily establish trade secrets through self-help measures, without formal government involvement like patents. Additionally, trade secret law upholds standards of commercial ethics and morality. Trade secret law upholds commercial ethics by discouraging certain competitive behaviors that breach confidentiality. It may promote innovation but also requires firms to conceal their developments, balancing the need for information protection with healthy industrial competition. Trade secret law requires firms to protect valuable information, leading to expenses for maintaining secrecy. This can limit employee mobility and hinder competition in the market. Trade secret law aims to balance the advantages and disadvantages of trade secrets, with concerns raised about limiting individual freedom and weakening employee bargaining power. The definition of a trade secret is broadly understood as secret, commercially valuable information related to various business functions. Trade secret subject matter includes major business functions like production, marketing, finance, and management. Examples include customer lists, manufacturing processes, and pricing information. A trade secret is confidential information protected through agreements and security measures. Its status as a trade secret is determined by a jury based on various factors. The determination of whether something is a trade secret is a question for a jury to decide. Factors considered include the extent of knowledge outside the company, measures taken to protect the information, its value, development efforts, and ease of acquisition by others. Trade secrets are protected from misappropriation, which can occur through improper means like theft or disclosure. Trade secrets can be misappropriated through breaches of confidence or improper acquisition. Misappropriation can lead to court injunctions and damages. Discovering a trade secret independently is not a violation of trade secret law. Reverse engineering is an acceptable method for acquiring another firm's trade secret. Trade secret protection can extend indefinitely as long as the information is not publicly known, provides economic benefit, and efforts are made to maintain secrecy. If a trade secret is disclosed, its protected status is lost. However, disclosures to third parties for specific reasons do not waive protection if reasonable measures were taken to maintain secrecy. The discipline of trade secrets involves requiring non-disclosure agreements before sharing confidential information. State courts established trade secret laws, with the American Law Institute publishing influential definitions in 1939. Trade secrets were not addressed in the Second Restatement of Torts in 1978. The ALI did not address trade secrets in the Second Restatement of Torts in 1978. Instead, they addressed this gap in the 1993 Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, which covers trade secrets in sections 39\u201345. The NCCUSL issued the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) in 1979, which has been enacted in 47 states and the District of Columbia. The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) has been enacted in 47 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. Massachusetts, North Carolina, and New York have not enacted the UTSA but provide protection for trade secrets through other means. State-by-state variations in the UTSA have led to differing opinions on the significance of these modifications. Trade secrets have traditionally been governed by state law, with the Trade Secrets Act being the most significant federal legislation prior to 1996. The Trade Secrets Act of 1948 prohibits federal government employees and contractors from disclosing confidential government information, including trade secrets, with penalties of removal from office or employment, and fines/imprisonment. The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 criminalizes economic espionage and theft of trade secrets to address growing concerns over economic espionage against U.S. firms. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) prohibits theft of trade secrets with intent to benefit a foreign entity, imposing fines and imprisonment. Penalties for economic espionage can reach $500,000 for individuals and 15 years in prison, or $10 million for corporations. Theft of trade secrets carries fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment up to 10 years for individuals, and up to $5 million for organizations. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) imposes fines of up to $5 million on organizations and allows for criminal forfeiture of property. Critics like Attorney R. Mark Halligan and experts Susan W. Brenner and Anthony C. Crescenzi question the effectiveness of the EEA due to the low number of prosecutions, citing reasons such as case complexity, Department of Justice's selective approach, diplomatic concerns, and potential trade secret exposure during litigation. Crescenzi concludes that systemic factors erode the EEA's effectiveness against economic espionage. Trade secrets and patents are key components of the U.S. intellectual property system, with inventors choosing between maintaining trade secrets, seeking patents, or allowing technology to enter the public domain. The patent system interacts closely with trade secret law, where inventors can apply for a patent through the USPTO. The USPTO examiner evaluates patent applications to determine if they meet legal requirements and substantive standards. An invention must fall within patentable subject matter categories and provide the best mode of practicing it. A patentable invention must be useful, novel, and nonobvious. If granted, the patent owner has the right to exclude others from using the invention in the United States. When deciding between trade secret and patent protection, inventors must consider factors such as the ability to keep the technology secret, costs associated with patents, and the limited territorial rights of a U.S. patent. Inventors may face delays in obtaining patents in foreign countries, with USPTO examiner review times increasing over the years. This backlog may push innovators in fast-moving industries towards trade secret protection, which can potentially last indefinitely compared to patents that expire after 20 years. However, trade secrets are at risk of being lost through reverse engineering or independent discovery by competitors. When inventors choose between patent protection and trade secret protection, they face the risk of losing trade secrets through reverse engineering or independent discovery by competitors. Obtaining a patent on an invention leads to the publication of the patent by the USPTO, which destroys the trade secret status of any previously confidential information. Additionally, pending patent applications are published by the USPTO after 18 months, further jeopardizing trade secret protection. Trade secret protection relies on confidentiality, while patents require public disclosure. Some argue that trade secrets encourage innovation in areas not covered by patents. Mark Lemley suggests that trade secrets provide incentives where patents do not. Trade secret law incentivizes innovation in areas not covered by patents, such as customer lists and business plans. Without trade secret protection, firms may need more measures to prevent disclosure. Congress introduced the \"first inventor defense\" in 1999 and the \"prior commercial user defense\" in 2011, modifying the relationship between trade secrets and patents. The AIA expanded the prior commercial user defense to include any type of invention, not just business method patents. This defense recognizes the relationship between trade secrets and patents, allowing inventors to protect valuable information that may not be patentable. Inventors may choose trade secret protection over patenting due to ignorance of the patent system or the belief that they can keep their invention secret longer. However, patent law penalizes secret commercial use before filing a patent application, as it aims to maintain the integrity of the 20-year patent term. Before filing a patent application, an inventor may choose trade secret protection to delay patent expiration. However, patent law penalizes secret commercial use before filing. If an earlier inventor uses an invention secretly, a later inventor obtaining a patent could lead to liability for patent infringement. The law favors the patent holder over the trade secret holder in such cases. Inventor A develops a new manufacturing process and keeps it as a trade secret. Later, Inventor B independently develops the same process and files a patent application. The American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 provides some defense for earlier users of patented business methods. The 1998 Federal Circuit opinion in State Street Bank and Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group recognized that business methods could be patented, potentially exposing those who kept business methods as trade secrets to patent infringement liability. Even with the American Inventors Protection Act, earlier trade secret use would not prevent someone from obtaining a patent and potentially suing for infringement. The AIA expanded the prior commercial user defense to allow any entity related to the person who performed the acts necessary for the defense to assert it. This defense is now available for any type of patented invention, not just business method patents. Additionally, universities are exempt from the prior commercial user defense under the new legislation. Several options are available for Congress regarding trade secrets, including the adoption of a federal trade secret law to promote uniformity throughout the United States. Trade secrets are currently governed by state law, unlike trademarks, copyrights, and patents which are primarily governed by federal statutes. The current state-based system for trade secrets is causing significant problems due to differences in laws between states. A Federal Trade Secrets Act (FTSA) is proposed to establish uniformity in trade secret legislation. This move is necessary to comply with international agreements such as NAFTA and the TRIPS Agreement, which require specific levels of trade secret protection. Some states may not comply with international trade secret protection standards modeled after the UTSA, potentially violating NAFTA and the TRIPS Agreement. However, U.S. law shortcomings have not been challenged under these agreements yet. Federalizing trade secret law is debated, with concerns about additional burdens on the federal judiciary and federalism issues. Some argue for federalizing trade secret law to address concerns about state compliance with international standards. One proposal is to amend the Economic Espionage Act to allow for a federal cause of action for trade secret misappropriation. H.R. 2466, the Private Right of Action Against Trade Secrets Act of 2013, aims to provide individuals with the ability to seek compensatory damages and injunctive relief for trade secret violations. H.R. 2466 and S. 1770 propose reforms for trade secret law, with a focus on compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Federalization of trade secret law is not the main goal, as it would still primarily be governed by state law. Congress should also consider the impact of patent reform on trade secrets. Trade secrets and patents work together to protect innovation in the US. Legislative changes affecting patents may impact reliance on trade secrets. Trade secrets are crucial in the US intellectual property system, especially in a knowledge-based global economy. Congressional influence on trade secrets is currently indirect. Congressional influence over the U.S. trade secret system is currently indirect through legislative actions like the Economic Espionage Act and patent law amendments. Further intervention in the system is a matter for Congress to decide."
