    "content": "Coal has been the primary fuel for thermal energy since the Industrial Revolution, shifting from heat to steam engines and then to power electric motors. In the US, coal was mainly used for electric power generation in the 20th century, with bituminous and subbituminous coal dominating. Anthracite has the highest carbon content and heat value among coal types. Heating value: Anthracite coal has the highest carbon content (86% to 98%) and a heat value of about 15,000 BTUs per pound. Bituminous coal, the most abundant in the US, has a carbon content of 45% to 86% and a heat value between 10,500 to 15,500 BTUs. Subbituminous coal, found in western states, has a carbon content of 35% to 45% and a heat value of 8,300 to 13,000 BTUs. Lignite, with the lowest carbon content (25% to 35%), has high moisture and ash content and the lowest heat value. Coal has been the dominant fuel for electricity generation in the United States, with a history of wide availability and low cost. It accounted for almost 42% of power generation in 2011. Coal's low price and high energy content enabled the construction of large power plants that took advantage of economies of scale. In these plants, coal is burned to produce heat for generating steam, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity. The U.S. coal-powered generation fleet in 2011 consisted of 1,387 units with a capacity of 318 GW, representing 30% of total U.S. generating capacity. Electric utilities and independent power producers are the main entities involved in electricity production, consuming almost 995 million tons of coal annually from 2002 to 2011. The capital costs of power plant construction vary based on type and size, with fuel costs being a significant factor in electricity generation. The cost of fuel is a major factor in electricity production for power plants that have recovered their construction costs. Transportation costs for coal are significant, with rail being the most common mode of transit. Coal-burning power plants receive 72% of their coal by rail. Electric power plants receive about 72% of their coal by rail, with transportation costs accounting for a significant portion of total delivered costs. These costs can be as high as 59% for coal shipments from the Powder River Basin. U.S. coal transportation costs have led many utilities in New England to switch to natural gas or import coal from overseas. Coal consumption for electricity generation has been dominant but is slowing down, with a decrease starting around 2008, while natural gas use is increasing. Natural gas use for electric power production is rising due to increased supplies from unconventional shale gas development. Prices have been volatile but fell significantly after 2008-2009. Horizontal drilling and fracking have boosted shale gas production. This has caused natural gas prices for electricity production to drop, while coal costs continue to rise. The drop in natural gas prices has led to a shift from coal to gas-burning facilities for electricity production. This switch involves moving from base load coal generation to underutilized intermediate load natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) capacity in the United States. Fuel cost is a key factor in the decision to switch, with natural gas being more cost-effective than coal. The shift from coal to natural gas for electricity production is driven by the drop in natural gas prices. Natural gas is now more cost-effective than coal due to rising coal prices. This change is reflected in the increased use of higher efficiency natural gas-fired power plants, leading to a decrease in coal's share of total U.S electricity generation. The use of natural gas for electricity generation has increased, surpassing coal in April 2012. While coal is projected to still have the largest share in the electricity generation mix, its share is expected to decline as more generation comes from natural gas and renewable technologies. Coal's role as the primary source of electricity generation in the U.S. has decreased in recent years. The future electricity generation mix is influenced by projected fuel prices and economic growth. The price of natural gas, coal's competitor, has dropped due to increased domestic production. However, uncertainty exists regarding the size of the U.S. shale gas resource base and the cost of production, impacting future natural gas prices. The uncertainty surrounding shale gas wells' production rates, decline rates, and ultimate recovery could impact natural gas prices. The development of shale gas resources is changing the outlook for natural gas supplies, with oil recovery from wet shale plays currently driving development. Expectations of lower and less volatile prices from increased supplies are encouraging greater use of natural gas. The expectation of lower, less volatile natural gas prices from increased supplies is driving greater use of natural gas for power generation and industrial purposes. The industry faces uncertainties in accommodating the demands of the power generation sector, as power plants rely on just-in-time natural gas delivery due to limited storage capabilities. Further development of the interstate pipeline system may be necessary to ensure new natural gas supplies reach markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission notes that increased demand for natural gas may require better coordination between electricity and natural gas industries. Power plants are retired when they reach the end of their useful life, with older coal-fired plants being less efficient than newer ones. Upgrades are done to keep plants operational, but less efficient ones may be retired or shifted to less demanding schedules. The cost of building a power plant is recovered over its depreciable life, with operations and maintenance expenses becoming significant. The depreciable life of older power plants is a key factor in determining their continuing costs, with operations and maintenance expenses, particularly fuel costs, being significant. The decision to mothball or close less efficient coal power plants is influenced by expectations of lower natural gas prices. Upgrading older plants to meet new regulatory requirements can be costly, leading many to face retirement decisions. Congressional directives to reduce environmental impacts of fossil fuel use have led to evolving regulatory requirements in the last decade. The evolving environmental regulatory requirements in the last decade have focused on finalizing regulations that could lead to the retirement of coal-burning power plants, which are major sources of air pollution in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, coal-fired power plants have not been subject to stringent requirements, with emissions and control equipment varying based on factors like location, construction date, and fuel type. Compliance strategies may involve utilizing multiple CAA programs to control emissions. The Clean Air Act (CAA) programs are being used to control emissions, creating a complex compliance strategy for utilities and regulators. Power companies have pushed back against regulations due to the high costs of implementing controls, but the EPA argues that the societal benefits of reduced illnesses outweigh these costs. Some new EPA rules will be implemented at the federal level, while others will be at the state level. The EPA is implementing various rules to reduce emissions, including the Utility MACT rule for mercury and other pollutants. New standards for greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed for new power plants, but regulations for existing plants are pending. The electric power industry is concerned about unrealistic timeframes for compliance with these regulations. The electric power industry is facing pending environmental regulations with unrealistic compliance timeframes, causing concerns about reliability. The industry refers to this situation as the \"train wreck\" scenario. However, environmental groups and some in the industry believe these concerns are exaggerated. In 2011, the North American Reliability Corporation analyzed the potential effects of EPA regulations on accelerating the retirement of fossil-fired units. NERC and DOE have estimated that between 35 GW and 70 GW of generating capacity could potentially be retired due to proposed EPA rules and new environmental regulations. Concerns have been raised about the impact on bulk power system reliability, with the Department of Energy highlighting potential retirements of coal-fired capacity. Between 35 GW and 70 GW of coal-fired capacity is expected to be retired by 2016, accounting for approximately 8.5% of U.S. coal-fired capacity. Various factors such as compliance costs with EPA regulations, aging power plants, modest electricity demand growth, and the availability of natural gas plants contribute to these retirement decisions. Some coal plants are closing due to low natural gas prices and transmission constraints. The implications of coal-fired electric power plant retirements will likely play out on a regional basis as EPA's rules face challenges and modifications. Power generation in the US varies by local resources, infrastructure, and cost. The Eastern and Midwest regions are more coal-dependent than the Northeast or West. Regional transmission organizations are studying the impact of EPA rules on reliability and retrofitting power plants for compliance. The Midwest ISO (MISO) conducted a study on the implications of EPA regulations and lower natural gas prices on coal-fired power plants. The study identified potential retirements due to proposed EPA rules and low natural gas prices, estimating between 3 GW and 13 GW of coal capacity retirements. MISO itself may incur costs of $32 billion to $33 billion for EPA compliance retrofit costs, new capacity charges, and transmission system upgrades. MISO does not own or build power plants. State utility commissions control new power plant construction. Integrated resource planning methods are used to address system needs. State public utility commissions or RTO markets decide on new generating capacity for reliability. RTO markets use price signals or forward capacity markets to incentivize new generation. The existing U.S. NGCC generation fleet has underutilized capacity, with the potential to displace one-third of U.S. coal generation. This shift could be achieved by maximizing the operation of natural gas combined cycle plants, which currently operate at only 41% of their design capacity. Transmission constraints may limit this transition, but there is sufficient surplus NGCC capacity to reduce CO2 emissions significantly. According to the EIA, coal is expected to remain a key part of U.S. electricity generation past 2030. Electric utilities value power generation diversity to avoid price and supply risks. New power plant technologies will be affected by proposed EPA rules limiting GHG emissions. The proposed rule would cap emissions from new plants at 1,000 pounds of CO2 per MWh, while current NGCC plants emit 800 pounds per MWh and coal plants emit 1,800 pounds per MWh. The proposed GHG rule would exempt new coal plants under construction within a year and not apply to existing plants. Only new coal plants with CCS technology are likely to meet the regulations, adding 30% to costs. No new conventional coal plants are expected after 2012, with 2 GW of coal capacity with CCS expected by 2017. New advanced NGCC plants in 2017 cost $63 per MWh, while advanced coal plants cost $111 per MWh, and advanced coal with CCS costs $139 per MWh. New coal generation may not be competitive based on cost estimates alone. New coal generation, even without CCS, may not be competitive with new NGCC based on cost estimates alone. Most renewable technologies offer limited opportunities to replace coal generation, with wind and solar resources located far from population centers. Without breakthroughs in technology efficiency or energy storage, renewable generation is expected to be limited to 16% by 2035. Dispatchable technologies that can vary output to follow demand are more valuable to the system. Hybrid generation projects combining renewable electricity and natural gas-fired power could make wind and solar power more dispatchable. Nuclear power may replace coal for base load generation, but the future of new nuclear units is uncertain. Building new nuclear reactors to maintain a 20% share of total generation would be necessary. The cost of building new nuclear power units may be a barrier to reaching the goal of maintaining a 20% share of total generation. Concerns raised by the nuclear incident at Fukushima also contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the future of new nuclear units. Additionally, the industrial sector's share of U.S. coal demand has declined significantly since 1949, largely due to reduced coal use for coke production. Since 1949, the industrial sector's coal consumption has shifted towards electric power production, accounting for over 90% of U.S. coal demand. Coal is used in various industrial applications such as steel making, cement production, and process heating. It is also utilized in alumina refineries, chemical production, pharmaceuticals, and paper manufacturing. Coal and its by-products are found in numerous products like soap, aspirin, solvents, plastics, and specialty items. The Energy Information Administration categorizes industrial coal consumption into Coke Plants, Combined Heat and Power. The future of coal power generation in the United States is uncertain due to market prices and environmental regulations. Congress may need to decide on the level of coal generation for power production, considering the expected shift to natural gas. The domestic market for coal power generation may be affected by overseas markets and national energy policy. Congress may also need to consider an \"all-of-the above\" energy strategy. The electric utility industry values fuel diversity to avoid vulnerability to price and supply volatility. Market economics show an \"inverse relationship\" between coal and natural gas for power generation. New advanced NGCC plants are cheaper than advanced coal plants, raising concerns over coal's future as a viable fuel option. The electric utility industry values fuel diversity to avoid vulnerability to price and supply volatility. Market economics show an \"inverse relationship\" between coal and natural gas for power generation. New technologies and proposed GHG emissions limits raise concerns over coal's future as a viable fuel choice. It is uncertain if research and development will lead to new technologies capable of reducing the gap."
