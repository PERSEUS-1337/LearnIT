President Roosevelt approved the development of an atomic bomb in 1942, leading to the establishment of the Manhattan Engineer District. Research and design were conducted at Los Alamos, with uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge and plutonium production facilities at Hanford. Roosevelt gave final approval for the construction of a nuclear bomb in December 1942. The Manhattan Project, initiated in 1942, aimed to develop a nuclear bomb using plutonium as fuel. President Truman authorized the use of the bomb against Japan in August 1945, leading to Japan's surrender. The project cost $2.2 billion and officially ended in 1946 with the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission. General Leslie Groves managed the project and discouraged Congress from asking questions about it. The Manhattan Project, initiated in 1942, aimed to develop a nuclear bomb using plutonium as fuel. President Truman authorized the use of the bomb against Japan in August 1945, leading to Japan's surrender. General Leslie Groves managed the project and discouraged Congress from asking questions. In February 1944, War Department officials received a \"blank check\" for the project from Congressional leadership. The Apollo program, FY1960 to FY1973, encompassed 17 missions, including six lunar landings. NASA was created in response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1958 and began operation in 1959. The goals of the Apollo program were to land Americans on the Moon and establish preeminence in space. The Apollo program, from FY1960 to FY1973, aimed to achieve preeminence in space for the United States by landing Americans on the Moon and developing capabilities to work in the lunar environment. The program included 17 missions, with six lunar landings using a three-part spacecraft launched by Saturn rockets. Apollo 11 successfully landed Americans on the Moon in July 1969, with the last lunar landing in December 1972. The total cost of the Apollo program was $19.4 billion ($97.9 billion in 2008 dollars), with peak funding of $4.5 billion in FY1966. The Apollo program from FY1960-FY1973 cost $19.4 billion ($97.9 billion in 2008 dollars), with the Saturn V rockets being the most expensive component. The Arab oil embargo of 1973 led to rising fuel prices and a shift in energy policy. Congress subsumed the Atomic Energy Commission into the Energy Research and Development in response to the crisis. In 1974, the Energy Reorganization Act combined various energy programs into the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 merged ERDA with other energy offices to form the Department of Energy (DOE). The Iranian Revolution in 1979 triggered an energy crisis, leading to high oil prices and inflation. Funding for DOE's energy R&D programs decreased in the 1980s, and energy technology demonstration projects were impacted. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) funded energy technology demonstration projects in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but faced challenges and ended in 1986. Despite rising oil prices from 2004 to 2008, funding for energy technology R&D has not increased as it did during the energy crisis of the late 1970s to early 1980s. The appropriations process for FY2009 and FY2010 is still ongoing. Comparisons are made with the Manhattan project and Apollo program. Comparing the funding histories of the Manhattan project and Apollo program to DOE energy technology R&D programs can provide insights for Congress in shaping energy R&D policy. Criteria for comparison include funding, threat perception, goal clarity, and technology customer. Annual average DOE energy technology R&D funding from 1974-2008 was $3 billion, while the Manhattan project and Apollo program had annual average funding of $4 billion each. The Manhattan project and Apollo program had annual average funding of $4 billion each, while the DOE energy technology R&D program at its peak (1975-1980) was $7 billion. The percentage of federal spending devoted to DOE energy technology R&D was half that of the Manhattan project and one-fifth that of the Apollo program. The GDP spent on DOE energy technology R&D in the peak funding year was one-fourth that spent on either the Manhattan project or the Apollo program. Although cumulative funding for the DOE energy technology R&D program is greater, the annual funding for the historical programs was higher. The Manhattan project and Apollo program were funded efforts in response to perceived threats during World War II and the Cold War with the USSR. Both projects saw rapid increases in funding followed by declines. Public support for these initiatives was strong, driven by concerns over national security. President Jimmy Carter highlighted the energy crisis as a significant challenge for the U.S., comparing it to the moral equivalent of war. The threat addressed by investing in energy technology R&D is primarily economic, with climate change being a long-term concern related to energy consumption. Clarity and consensus on program goals are crucial for successful initiatives. The Manhattan Project and Apollo program had clear, singular goals. In contrast, energy technology R&D aims for clean, affordable, and reliable energy with diverse resources, commercial viability, and environmental protection. The energy R&D program aims to be commercially viable and meet environmental goals by reducing the impact of energy-related activities. The marketability of developed technologies will determine the program's success, with the private sector as the ultimate customer. Concerns exist about government picking winners and losers in technology development. Some experts argue that government intervention is crucial for private sector deployment of clean energy technologies. Without government support, private sector R&D may not achieve public goals. Comparisons to the Manhattan Project and Apollo program highlight the need for increased DOE energy technology R&D funding to match historical levels. The need for increased DOE energy technology R&D funding to match historical levels is emphasized, with comparisons to the Manhattan Project and Apollo program. Funding would need to increase significantly in terms of federal outlays and as a percentage of GDP to reach peak levels. Unlike the singular goals of the Manhattan Project and Apollo program, energy technology R&D faces multiple, sometimes conflicting goals in response to issues like insecure oil sources and high prices. The Manhattan Project and Apollo program focused on technologies for governmental use with little concern for environmental impact, while energy technology R&D aims for commercial viability and environmental protection. The New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence bill seeks to convene a summit to review progress in this area. The New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence bill, introduced on January 14, 2009, requires the President to convene a summit to review progress and funding needed for developing alternative technology vehicles, energy efficient buildings, large-scale solar power plants, biofuels, and carbon capture systems for coal-burning power plants. The bill aims to reduce operating costs by more than 15% with carbon capture and storage, ensure minimal carbon dioxide escape over 5,000 years, remediate radioactive waste, develop sustainable nuclear fusion, and establish a commission for energy independence. The bill aims to achieve 50% energy independence within 10 years and 100% energy independence within 20 years, assessing the impact of foreign energy dependence on national security. A proposed amendment to replace the text of H.R. 2454 with this bill failed in the House 172-256."
