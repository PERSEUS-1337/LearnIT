    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act\" or the \"SPEECH Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of freedom of speech and press, as outlined in the first amendment. There are concerns about individuals hindering these rights by filing defamation lawsuits in foreign jurisdictions with less free-speech protections, impacting the public's access to information. Foreign defamation lawsuits in some jurisdictions suppress free speech rights and inhibit written speech out of fear. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has noted that restrictive libel laws in certain countries discourage critical media reporting, affecting scholars and journalists globally due to the internet and international media distribution. Foreign defamation lawsuits in various countries hinder free speech rights and impede written expression due to fear. Governments and courts worldwide have not effectively stopped libel lawsuits against U.S. individuals, leading to foreign libel judgments that conflict with U.S. first amendment protections. SEC. 3. RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN DEFAMATION JUDGMENTS. Amends Part VI of title 28, United States Code by adding CHAPTER 181--FOREIGN JUDGMENTS. In this chapter, definitions are provided for key terms related to defamation, including what constitutes defamation, domestic court, foreign court, and foreign judgment. \"Sec. 4102. Recognition of foreign defamation judgments. Defines 'State' as various entities within the United States and 'United States person' as citizens, lawful residents, and businesses based in the U.S.\" \"Sec. 4102. Recognition of foreign defamation judgments. Domestic courts in the United States must ensure that foreign defamation judgments provide the same level of protection for freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\" Foreign court's adjudication did not offer the same protection for freedom of speech and press as the US Constitution. The burden of proving the application of defamation laws in a foreign judgment lies with the party seeking recognition or enforcement. The domestic court will not recognize a foreign judgment for defamation unless the foreign court's exercise of personal jurisdiction aligns with US Constitution's due process requirements. The burden of proof lies with the party seeking enforcement of the foreign judgment. The domestic court will not enforce a foreign judgment for defamation against an interactive computer service provider unless the judgment aligns with section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. The burden of proof lies with the party seeking recognition of the foreign judgment. The section discusses that appearing in a foreign court for a foreign judgment does not waive the right to oppose recognition or enforcement under section 230. It clarifies that this section only applies to foreign judgments for defamation and does not affect the enforceability of other foreign judgments. The section allows for the removal of defamation cases to the district court of the United States based on the citizenship of the parties involved. It also discusses the right of a United States person to bring an action in district court against a foreign judgment related to speech published by that person. The section allows for nationwide service of process in district court for actions against foreign judgments that are deemed unconstitutional or unenforceable under specific sections. The burden of proof lies with the party challenging the enforceability of the foreign judgment. The section discusses attorneys' fees in actions to enforce foreign judgments for defamation in domestic courts. It also states that a foreign judgment for defamation constitutes a case of actual controversy for pleading a cause of action for a declaratory judgment. The table of chapters for part VI of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding section 2201(a) regarding attorneys' fees in actions to enforce foreign judgments for defamation in domestic courts. The table of chapters for part VI of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include section 2201(a) on attorneys' fees in actions to enforce foreign judgments for defamation in domestic courts."
