These payments are typically established during divorce, separation, or when the custodial parent applies for TANF benefits. The Child Support Enforcement program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, funded by the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various territories. It handles 50%-60% of child support cases, with the rest managed privately or through mutual agreements. Families receiving TANF, foster care payments, or Medicaid automatically qualify for CSE services. Non-TANF families must apply and may be charged an annual user fee of up to $25. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program charges an annual user fee of up to $25. Child support collected for non-TANF families goes to the family through the state disbursement unit. CSE agencies collected $28.6 billion in child support payments in FY2015, with 20% collected on past-due child support and 61% of its caseload. Paternity was established or acknowledged for 96% of children without legally identified fathers in FY2015. Total CSE expenditures in FY2015 amounted to $5.7 billion. The CSE program collected $28.6 billion in child support payments in FY2015, with $5.26 collected for each $1 spent. Table 1 provides data on total collections, expenditures, caseload numbers, and program elements. Services include parent location, paternity establishment, child support orders, payment collection, distribution, and medical support enforcement. The program also covers Access and Visitation Grants and the Responsible Fatherhood Program. The CSE program utilizes the State Parent Locator Service (SPLS) to locate noncustodial parents when information provided by the custodial parent is insufficient. The SPLS includes the State Child Support Case Registry and the State Directory of New Hires, which contain records of child support cases and employment information, respectively. The State Parent Locator Service (SPLS) gathers employee and employer information for the directory within 20 days of hiring. It can also utilize the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) for various purposes related to child support enforcement and custody. The FPLS helps identify overpayments, fraud, and assess benefits using data from the Social Security Administration. The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) plays a crucial role in the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program by accessing data from various federal agencies and directories to aid in locating noncustodial parents. Automation is essential for cross-checking records and complying with federal law requirements for automated comparisons of Social Security numbers. The state and federal directories are compared for new hires and CSE cases in the Child Support Case Registry. Establishing paternity is necessary for child support orders, with procedures required for all children under 18. TANF applicants must cooperate in paternity establishment or face penalties. If an individual is uncooperative and doesn't qualify for exceptions, the state can reduce or eliminate TANF benefits. Federal requirements for paternity establishment include establishing paternity for 90% of cases, a simple process for paternity determination, voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, and legal validity of signed paternity acknowledgments. No further legal action is needed to confirm paternity once acknowledged. A child support order is a legal document that obligates a noncustodial parent to provide financial support for his or her children. It is usually established at the time of divorce or when an unmarried couple dissolves their relationship, or when a TANF case is initiated. The order is established by a state/county CSE agency or through the state courts using state-established guidelines. Child support guidelines aim to protect the child's best interests by ensuring financial support from both parents. States determine child support amounts based on the noncustodial parent's income or both parents' incomes, considering factors like the child's age, presence of a stepparent, disability, and siblings. States use three types of guidelines to calculate child support awards: \"Income shares\" based on combined incomes. Child support guidelines vary by state and can be based on different models such as \"Income shares,\" \"Percentage of income,\" and \"Melson-Delaware.\" These guidelines aim to ensure that child support orders are realistic and based on the actual ability of noncustodial parents to pay. It is important to review and modify child support orders as circumstances change to prevent inadequate or inequitable support. Federal law requires states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF family cases. The federal law requires states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF family cases every three years. For non-TANF cases, either parent can request a review every three years, with a demonstration of substantial changes in circumstances. Child support modifications must follow state guidelines, and it is crucial for parents to seek modifications promptly in cases of job loss or incarceration to avoid falling behind on payments. The court cannot retroactively reduce arrearages. The CSE program enforces child support payments through various methods, including income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, filing liens, seizing assets, and suspending licenses or passports. The court cannot retroactively reduce arrearages owed by noncustodial parents. Child support arrearages can lead to consequences such as suspension of licenses and passports, as well as civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures. Federal law mandates states to enforce child support orders across state lines and internationally. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to enhance child support collections in cases involving parents in different countries. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act ensures compliance with international child support enforcement treaties, updates state laws to incorporate amendments, improves access to the FPLS for foreign countries and tribal governments, and allows federal income tax refund offset program for CSE requests from foreign reciprocating and treaty countries. The CSE program is funded by both state and federal dollars through five funding streams. The CSE program is funded by state and federal dollars through various funding streams. States operate the program using their own funds, with the federal government reimbursing 66% of allowable expenditures. This funding is considered mandatory and is appropriated annually. States also collect child support to reimburse themselves and the federal government for TANF cash payments. The CSE program is funded by state and federal dollars through various funding streams. States receive an incentive payment from the federal government to operate effective programs. Families receiving TANF, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services free of charge. Other families may be charged an annual user fee not exceeding $25 if child support enforcement efforts are successful. States can recover costs from custodial or noncustodial parents, or use state funds. Fees and costs from non-TANF cases must be deducted from administrative costs before federal reimbursement. States must have a centralized automated State Collection and Disbursement Unit (SDU) for efficient child support payment processing. SDUs help with income withholding by providing a single location for employers to send payments. The State Collection and Disbursement Unit (SDU) is responsible for generating child support orders, maintaining payment records, and providing parents with payment status. It must use automated technology and can be operated by the state CSE agency, multiple state agencies, or a contractor. Alternatively, a linked system of local disbursement units can be established with approval from the Secretary of HHS. This system should be cost-effective and efficient for employers to send payments. The State Collection and Disbursement Unit (SDU) is responsible for processing child support payments efficiently. Federal law requires employers to remit income withheld within seven business days after payday. SDU then sends payments to custodial parents within two business days. Distribution rules determine the order of payment for multiple child support claims. TANF families must assign their child support rights to the state to reimburse for TANF cash benefits. The state retains child support collected while TANF is received, but may pass through some state share to families. Federal law waives government's share of passed-through child support, up to $100 per month for one child or $200 per month for two or more children. Based on September 2016 data, some states have a CSE pass-through and disregard policy for child support collections, while others do not. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before being reimbursed, following a \"family-first\" policy. Noncustodial parent's visitation rights are commonly referred to as child access or voluntary parenting time arrangements under state family laws. State laws typically treat child support and visitation as separate issues, with the federal government historically agreeing that only child support falls under the CSE program. However, recognizing the importance of noncustodial parent involvement, policymakers are increasingly promoting efforts to address both child support and visitation together. This is to encourage visitation and improve outcomes for children. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 allocated $10 million annually for access and visitation programs to promote better relations between custodial and noncustodial parents. Eligible activities include mediation, counseling, parenting plans, visitation enforcement, and guidelines development. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act emphasized the importance of establishing parenting time arrangements with strong family violence safeguards. The federal government supports the establishment of parenting time arrangements with family violence safeguards and encourages noncustodial parents' involvement through responsible fatherhood programs. These programs aim to promote financial and personal responsibility, increase fathers' participation in their children's lives, and help parents strengthen their parenting skills. Some programs also discourage young men from becoming fathers until they are ready for the responsibility. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 included funding for a Healthy Marriage Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood grants program, providing up to $75 million annually for responsible fatherhood grants. This funding has been continued through appropriations acts, with the most recent funding provided through continuing resolutions set to expire in April 2017. Responsible fatherhood programs typically include parenting education and training in responsible decision-making. Fatherhood programs offer parenting education, training in decision-making and conflict resolution, coping with stress, mediation services, problem-solving skills, peer support, and job training opportunities. Grantees include states, territories, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and public/nonprofit community groups."
