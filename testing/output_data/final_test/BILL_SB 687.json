    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature in California has implemented various policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable energy sources and fuels. This includes laws such as the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program, the low carbon fuel standard, and strategies to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. Using natural gas in California contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, while wildfires and organic waste are major sources of black carbon and methane emissions. Capturing and utilizing methane gas from renewable sources can greatly reduce emissions from fossil fuels, organic waste, wildfires, and petroleum-based fertilizers. Replacing just 10% of California's fossil fuel gas supply with renewable gas could cut greenhouse gas emissions by millions of metric tons annually, providing low carbon transportation fuels and flexible electricity generation options. Renewable gas in California offers environmental benefits by reducing air and water pollution from fossil fuels, especially in disadvantaged communities. It also provides economic advantages such as job creation, energy security, and revenue for various sectors. Establishing a renewable gas standard will help diversify and decarbonize the state's gas supply for electricity, transportation, heating, and industrial purposes. A renewable gas standard in California will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors, increase in-state gas supplies, create jobs, and enhance energy security. It will also help meet waste diversion requirements by using organic waste to produce renewable gas. Biogas is gas generated from organic waste through various technologies. Sources include agricultural waste, forest waste, landfill gas, wastewater treatment gas, and diverted organic waste processed to enhance recyclable material recovery and minimize emissions. \"Eligible feedstock refers to organic waste or sustainably produced organic material and electricity from renewable energy resources meeting California's standards. Gas seller is a gas corporation or authorized entity selling natural gas under restructuring regulations.\" The \"renewable gas standard\" mandates gas sellers to provide renewable gas, generated from organic waste or other renewable sources, to retail customers in California. This includes biogas and synthetic natural gas from eligible feedstock. The state board must adopt a carbon-based renewable gas standard by June 30, 2017, requiring gas sellers to provide specified percentages of renewable gas to retail customers in California. Gas sellers must procure a minimum quantity of renewable gas to ensure that at least 1 percent of gas supplied to customers is renewable gas by December 31, 2019. The state board mandates increasing percentages of renewable gas in gas supplied to retail end-use customers in California over specific compliance periods: 3% by 2022, 5% by 2024, and 10% by 2029. The state board requires gas sellers to ensure that at least 10% of gas supplied to retail customers in California is renewable gas. Renewable gas must meet specific conditions to count towards meeting procurement requirements. The state board mandates that renewable gas injected into common carrier pipelines in California must result in environmental benefits such as reducing air pollutants or pollutants affecting state waters. The state board mandates the alleviation of local nuisances in California associated with odor emissions. Gas sellers must comply with renewable gas standard procurement requirements. The Public Utilities Commission will identify gas corporations providing gas service to end-use customers in California. The state board mandates the alleviation of local nuisances in California associated with odor emissions and requires gas sellers to comply with renewable gas standard procurement requirements. They also maintain a list of eligible renewable gas providers and adopt a flexible compliance mechanism, such as tradable renewable gas credits, to increase market flexibility and reduce costs of compliance. Tradable renewable gas credits are based on the carbon intensity of the renewable gas and allow for credit banking and borrowing. The state board collaborates with the Public Utilities Commission to develop regulations for the renewable gas standard for gas corporations. They also work with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to create an investment plan using funds from various programs to reduce costs of implementing the standard. The state board may waive enforcement of the renewable gas standard if the gas seller faces uncontrollable delays or insufficient supply of renewable gas resources. Factors considered include prudent risk management, development of renewable gas resources, and procurement above minimum levels to account for delays. To comply with the renewable gas standard, gas sellers must take reasonable measures to obtain tradable renewable gas credits. The state board, in consultation with the Public Utilities Commission, will set a limitation for each gas seller on expenditures for renewable gas to prevent disproportionate impacts on commodity rates. Gas sellers may refrain from procuring quantities exceeding the limitation if costs exceed projected expenses for meeting renewable gas standard requirements. The state board may waive compliance requirements but will establish additional reporting requirements for gas sellers to demonstrate efforts to meet future procurement requirements. Waiver of enforcement is contingent on gas sellers showing reasonable actions taken to achieve full compliance. The state board will issue an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and reductions for different biogas types and end uses by January 1, 2017. The commission will provide an assessment of renewable gas to the State Air Resources Board and Legislature by January 1, 2018. The assessment to be submitted to the Legislature will include opportunities for colocating renewable gas production with existing vehicle fleets, using renewable gas at energy production sites, and cost-effective interconnection to gas pipelines. Recommendations to reduce pipeline interconnection costs for renewable gas projects in California will also be provided."
