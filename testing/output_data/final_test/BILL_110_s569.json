The \"Vaccines for the Future Act of 2007\" provides definitions for key terms including AIDS, appropriate congressional committees, developing country, HIV/AIDS, and GAVI Alliance. The \"Vaccines for the Future Act of 2007\" defines key terms such as GAVI Alliance, neglected diseases (including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases), and the World Bank. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that immunization is a cost-effective public health intervention with significant life-saving impacts globally. Vaccines have successfully eradicated diseases like smallpox and polio, reduced childhood mortality from diseases like measles and tetanus, and prevent sickness and death from diseases like influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis. However, there is a lack of vaccines for diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, which collectively cause over 5 million deaths annually, primarily in the developing world. Other neglected diseases, such as pneumococcal disease, lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, and onchocerciasis, have severe health consequences including anemia, blindness, malnutrition, and impaired growth. These diseases also result in lost productivity in developing countries costing billions of dollars. Infants, children, and adolescents are most affected by AIDS, malaria, and other neglected diseases, with nearly 11 million children under age 5 dying each year in developing countries. Vaccines targeting children could prevent over 2.5 million illnesses and deaths. The devastating impact of neglected diseases in developing countries threatens political and economic stability, posing a threat to US economic and security interests. Only a small portion of global health research funding is allocated to diseases specific to developing countries, despite their significant impact. Developing countries receive minimal research and development focus, with only 10% targeting diseases affecting 90% of the world's population. Creating economic incentives to increase private sector research on neglected diseases is crucial for developing vaccines. An international group of experts has developed a framework for an advance market commitment pilot program for pneumococcal vaccines, which cause pneumonia and meningitis and kill 1,600,000 people annually. A pilot program aims to develop pneumococcal vaccines to prevent deaths, with 5 countries and the Gates Foundation pledging $1.5 billion. This initiative could save 5.4 million children by 2030. Sense of Congress on support for neglected diseases. The sense of Congress is to encourage support for the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise and work with various organizations to ensure countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS have national vaccine plans. Additionally, Congress supports the agreements made at the 2005 Group of 8 Summit to increase direct support. The 2005 Summit at Gleneagles, Scotland aimed to increase investment and create market incentives for the development of vaccines, microbicides, and drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected diseases. The United States should support the development of vaccines for infants, children, and adolescents to avoid delays in availability and continue supporting the work of the GAVI Alliance and the Global Fund for Children's Vaccines. The United States should collaborate internationally to overcome obstacles in developing vaccines for neglected diseases, contribute to the Advance Market Commitment for pneumococcal vaccines, and ensure affordable distribution to the developing world. SEC. 5. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. Public-private partnerships in global health, involving governments, private sector entities, and NGOs, are crucial in combating neglected diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. These collaborations enhance healthcare delivery in developing nations and expedite research for vaccines and medical technologies to combat infectious diseases. The partnerships leverage the strengths of each sector and pool resources for maximum impact. Public-private partnerships like the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, PATH's Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and the Global TB Drug Facility are crucial in developing vaccines for neglected diseases by providing technical assistance and support for clinical trials. Sustaining and building public-private partnerships are crucial for finding a cure for neglected diseases. Congress believes that promoting these partnerships is essential for creating incentives for developing vaccines and medical technologies for developing countries. The US government should increase investment in research and development to address obstacles in developing these technologies. The US government should implement a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the development of vaccines for neglected diseases. The President must establish a strategy to speed up the development of vaccines and microbicides for neglected diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. This strategy includes expanding partnerships, creating economic incentives, addressing intellectual property issues, and supporting clinical trials in developing countries. The President must establish a strategy to accelerate the development of vaccines and microbicides for neglected diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. This strategy includes expanding partnerships, creating economic incentives, addressing intellectual property issues, supporting clinical trials in developing countries, addressing regulatory approval, and expanding the purchase and delivery of existing vaccines. A report outlining the strategy and implementation steps must be submitted to congressional committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 7. ADVANCE MARKET COMMITMENTS. The purpose of this section is to improve global health by creating a competitive market for future vaccines through advance market commitments. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to negotiate with various entities to establish advance market commitments for purchasing vaccines and microbicides to combat neglected diseases. A report on the status of these negotiations must be submitted to congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury will collaborate with entities to establish an international framework for advance market commitments for vaccines. This framework includes legally binding contracts, transparent competition rules, safety requirements for vaccines, dispute settlement mechanisms, and contract flexibility. Authorization of Appropriations for the advance market commitment pilot program for pneumococcal vaccines includes funding for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 with no fiscal year limitation."
