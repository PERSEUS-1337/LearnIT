    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Native American Contracting and Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project Act.\" It defines terms like \"Federal lands,\" \"Indian tribe,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act's purpose is outlined in Section 3. The Act titled \"Native American Contracting and Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project Act\" aims to expand Native employment and income through contracting opportunities with the Federal Government, promote innovative management strategies on Federal lands with Native expertise, accommodate access to Indian sacred lands, and prevent damage to Indian sacred lands. The Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended to include a new section for a Native American Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project. The Native American Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project allows the Secretary of the Interior to contract with Indian tribes for surveys, analyses, and protection of lands with cultural significance. Eligible tribes can participate for two fiscal years after enactment. The Native American Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project requires tribes to request participation, demonstrate financial stability, and show dependency on the conservation unit. Selected tribes must complete a planning phase before entering into a management contract. The planning phase for a conservation unit management contract involves legal and budgetary research, as well as internal tribal planning and organizational preparation. Upon completion of the planning phase, the Secretary will negotiate and enter into a contract with the Indian tribe or tribal organization for the administration of programs related to archeological, anthropological, and cultural surveys and analyses. The Secretary shall initiate and conclude negotiations within 90 days after the completion of the planning phase by the Indian tribe or tribal organization for activities related to lands of cultural significance. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act provisions apply to contracts and agreements requested under this Act. Contracts entered into under this Act may include benefits, terms, and conditions from agreements under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Provisions from the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act will have the same effect in this Act. Additional terms can be mutually agreed upon. Contracts under this Act require a single-agency audit report as per title 31, US Code. Career Federal employees transferred to an Indian tribe will not lose their jobs and may be supervised by the tribe. Priority placement will be given for available positions within their agency. The Secretary shall provide Indian tribes or tribal organizations with funds for requested programs under contracts negotiated pursuant to the Act, with advance payments in annual or semiannual installments. Participating tribes must complete planning within one year of selection and can start implementing contracts thereafter. Contracts under this Act can last for 5 consecutive fiscal years, starting from when the tribe first entered into the contract. The Secretary must report to Congress on the costs and benefits of the project, and planning grants of $100,000 are available to tribes upon application. The Act allows for planning grants of $100,000 to Indian tribes or tribal organizations participating in the project to plan for contracting programs and services. Each tribe can only receive one grant, and appropriations are authorized for two fiscal years following the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. TRIBAL PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING AND RESERVATION DEVELOPMENT. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) focusing on fostering Tribal Procurement Contracting and Reservation Development. The Secretary of the Interior must contract with an Indian tribe for services or deliverables that would otherwise be procured from a private sector entity, if requested by the tribe. This applies unless the tribe requests to contract those services themselves. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) focusing on fostering Tribal Procurement Contracting and Reservation Development. The tribe must provide assurances that the principal beneficiary of contracted services remains the intended tribe, with rights and privileges under the Act. If the beneficiary tribe seeks to contract services provided by the contracting tribe, they must give 180 days' notice."
