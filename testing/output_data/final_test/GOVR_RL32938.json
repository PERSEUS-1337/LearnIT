    "content": "The typical local election official in the United States is a white woman between 50 and 60 years old, with a high school education, working full-time in election administration for about 10 years, earning under $50,000 per year. She belongs to a state-level professional organization but not a national one. The demographic profile of local election officials (LEOs) is diverse, with about one-quarter being men, 5% belonging to minority groups, 40% being college graduates, and 8% having graduate degrees. LEOs range in age from 24 to 89 years old and have served from 1 to 50 years. Salaries vary from under $10,000 to over $120,000, and about one-third belong to professional organizations. This demographic profile is unusual for a professional group and likely reflects the characteristics of LEOs in general. The demographic profile of local election officials (LEOs) is diverse, with about one-quarter being men, 5% belonging to minority groups, and 40% being college graduates. The characteristics of LEOs differ from other local government employees, with men comprising a higher proportion of local government general and administrative managers. The causes of these differences are not apparent, and potential policy implications of LEO demographics are discussed in the report. Voting systems in the United States have been increasingly computerized over the past 20 years. The use of computer-assisted voting systems, especially optical scan and direct recording electronic (DRE) systems, has significantly increased over the past 20 years. In 1980, less than one-quarter of jurisdictions used computer-assisted systems, with under 5% using optical scan and DRE systems. By 2004, over 75% of jurisdictions used computer-assisted systems, with more than half using optical scan. The use of optical scan systems increased seven-fold from 1990 to 2004, reaching over 45% usage, while DRE use doubled from 10% to 20% between 2000 and 2004. The use of punch cards, lever machines, and hand-counted paper ballots has declined, with usage falling by more than half from 1990 to 2004. The major alternative voting systems in use are optical scan and DRE. About half of jurisdictions with optical scan systems use precinct count. The distinction between central-count and precinct-count systems is important for optical scan systems, as only the precinct-count version allows for detection of improperly marked ballots before casting. HAVA promotes the use of these systems. Most local election officials (LEOs) are highly satisfied with their current voting systems, with over 85% reporting high satisfaction. The most highly rated systems are precinct-count optical scan and DREs, which align well with the goals of HAVA. These systems outperformed lever machines, hand-counted paper systems, and central-count optical scan systems. Most local election officials (LEOs) are satisfied with their current voting systems, with DREs rated highest and central-count optical scan rated lowest. LEOs identified areas for improvement, with accuracy, reliability, security, and ease of use being top priorities. Current systems scored lowest in preventing voter errors, ease of use for persons with disabilities, and machine error. Two features rated higher in the current voting system were speed in vote counting and cost of acquisition. Characteristics rated lowest for both current and desired systems were impact on different socioeconomic groups and alternative-language capability. DRE users rated their systems higher for prevention of voter error, ease of use by disabled persons, and multiple-language use compared to users of other systems. The average length of time jurisdictions reported using their current voting systems varied widely, with some using them for over 200 years. About one in six jurisdictions acquired a new voting system since 2000. One in six jurisdictions have acquired new voting systems since 2000, with half choosing DREs and the rest opting for optical-scan systems. 40% of respondents plan to replace their current voting system within the next five years, with 85% of recently acquired or planned systems assisting voters in preventing errors. LEOs tend to choose new voting systems similar to their current ones. The survey results suggest that jurisdictions replacing voting systems tend to choose systems similar to their current ones. Lever machine users are more likely to switch to DREs than optical scan systems. Punch card users prefer optical scan over DREs and precinct-count over central-count systems. LEOs using hand-counted paper systems show a preference for optical scan systems. LEOs tend to be satisfied with the systems they use, but have reservations about other systems. Punch cards, lever machines, and hand-counted paper ballots received negative ratings. DREs and optical scan systems received positive ratings, with precinct-count optical scan rated the highest. DRE users rated their systems higher than non-DRE users in various performance categories. Users and nonusers of DREs have differing attitudes towards the use of voter-verifiable paper audit trails (VVPAT). Most DRE users do not support VVPAT due to concerns about voter privacy, printer reliability, and cost, while nonusers are in favor of implementing VVPAT in their voting systems. Most DRE users do not support VVPAT due to concerns about voter privacy, printer reliability, and cost. Even supporters are only willing to spend $300 or less for the feature. Both DRE and optical scan users believe their voting system software is not vulnerable to attacks and trust current certification procedures. Nonusers are less confident in security and certification processes. Security and certification concerns differ between DRE and optical scan voting systems. DRE users are more worried about system vulnerability, especially with DREs. HAVA requirements and funding have influenced the adoption of new voting systems by Local Election Jurisdictions (LEOs). About half of Local Election Jurisdictions (LEOs) reported receiving federal funding for acquiring voting systems since 2000, with HAVA and state requirements being key factors in their decisions. Approximately 40% of LEOs plan to acquire new systems within the next five years, with most intending to replace all voting machines in their jurisdiction. HAVA accessibility requirements are driving some LEOs to acquire one new system per precinct. Most LEOs feel knowledgeable about HAVA, which has significant impacts on local jurisdictions. Most local election officials are familiar with HAVA provisions, with only 10% reporting a lack of familiarity. They generally support HAVA provisions, although there are concerns about the slow distribution of federal funds and increased operating costs. Support is linked to ease of implementation. Support for HAVA provisions is associated with ease of implementation. The two provisions with the highest support, facilitating participation for military or overseas voters and providing information for voters, were also rated as the easiest to implement. Disability access received higher support than the identification requirement for first-time voters, despite being perceived as the most difficult to implement. Some argue that the disability requirement is unnecessary for jurisdictions with small populations. The federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was created under HAVA, with most LEOs seeing it as an advantage. There were debates on whether the EAC should be permanent or temporary. Provisional voting was seen as a disadvantage by 35% of respondents and an advantage by 48%. LEOs had mixed opinions on provisional voting under HAVA, with 35% considering it a disadvantage and 48% an advantage. The responses were polarized, with some viewing it as a strong advantage and others as a strong disadvantage. The reasons for this polarized response were unclear. The impact of HAVA on elections varied among LEOs, with only 12% seeing no improvement and 7% seeing major improvement. Younger, tech-savvy officials tended to support HAVA, while those wary of federal involvement were less supportive. College-educated LEOs were also less supportive, with suggestions for improvement focusing on federal funding, registration, and voter identification. The survey results showed mixed views on the influence of voting system vendors on the selection of voting systems by local jurisdictions. While some argue vendors have undue influence, others believe such concerns are unwarranted. LEOs trust and have confidence in vendors but do not see them as especially influential in decisions about voting systems. Most jurisdictions using computer-assisted voting have interacted with their voting-system vendors within the last four years. More than 90% of LEOs trust their voting system vendors and find their goods and services to be of high quality. However, some believe vendors may prioritize profit over security. LEOs do not see vendors as highly influential in decisions about acquiring new voting systems. State election officials are the most relied upon source of information for LEOs regarding voting systems. LEOs trust voting system vendors, but do not find them highly influential in decision-making. State officials are the most relied upon source of information for LEOs. Vendors are rated lower in influence compared to state, local, and federal officials, as well as voters and advocates for the disabled. LEOs trust voting system vendors but do not consider them highly influential. Most LEOs believe local elected officials should have more influence, while some think state officials should. Concerns exist about oversight of vendors by the federal government and states, with varying opinions on the level of oversight by local governments. Care is needed in drawing inferences from the survey results to ensure representativeness of LEOs as a whole. Steps were taken in the study to ensure the sample of local election officials (LEOs) was representative, with a limit of 150 officials surveyed from each state to prevent regional overrepresentation. The sample design and characteristics of the responses suggest that the results are representative of LEOs as a whole. The survey of local election officials raised cautions about interpreting their responses, particularly regarding vendor influence and the potential disparity between beliefs and reality. Additionally, caution was advised in using survey results to inform policy decisions. The survey results may have policy implications for various government levels, including federal, state, and local. It is important to use the results to identify areas needing improved communication and understanding rather than blindly shaping policy based on them. The dedication and experience of local election officials were positively highlighted in the survey. Some survey results suggest areas of potential professional improvement for local election officials, such as in education and professional involvement at the national level. Efforts could be made to ensure diversity among election officials to reflect the workforce or voting population. Congress could address this by facilitating educational programs and promoting professional certification. The survey revealed mixed opinions on the security of DRE voting systems, with users being confident in them and non-users supporting the addition of a voter-verified paper audit trail. The results suggest the need for better education on the reliability and security of DRE systems. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) is making progress towards its policy goals. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) is making progress towards achieving its policy goals, with general support from election officials and the adoption of new voting systems to reduce voter errors. Concerns remain about the ongoing costs of HAVA implementation, which Congress may need to address. The close relationship between election officials and voting system vendors is unlikely to change, but HAVA's standards and certification processes are now codified. The influence of the federal government in decisions about new voting systems may increase due to HAVA standards and certification processes. State elected officials' influence is unlikely to decline, given their responsibilities in election administration. Research is needed to gather opinions from local election officials and assess the appropriate federal role in implementing HAVA goals. One suggestion from local election officials is to adjust requirements for smaller jurisdictions. Adjusting requirements for smaller jurisdictions may be necessary, but specific information on how needs vary with size was not covered in the survey. It is important to understand how the duties of Local Election Officials (LEOs) differ based on jurisdiction size and characteristics. Additionally, the survey only provided a snapshot of LEO characteristics and perceptions, suggesting the need for periodic surveys to identify trends and explore new questions and issues."
