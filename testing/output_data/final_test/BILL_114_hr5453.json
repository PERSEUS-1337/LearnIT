    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bureau Advisory Opinion Act of 2016\" and pertains to advisory opinions. The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 is amended to include a provision for advisory opinions on the conformance of specific conduct with Federal consumer financial law. The Director will establish procedures and consult with relevant agencies and stakeholders to provide written opinions in response to inquiries. The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 now allows for advisory opinions on the compliance of conduct with Federal consumer financial law. Requests for opinions must be specific to proposed or prospective conduct by a covered person and can be submitted to the Director. Inquiries can be withdrawn before an opinion is issued. The Director must issue an opinion within 90 days of receiving a request regarding whether the described conduct would violate Federal consumer financial law, deny the request if permissible, or explain why issuing an opinion is not feasible. The Director may grant a single extension of up to 90 days if more time is needed to issue an opinion. The Director will not issue an opinion if the request is too general, hypothetical, or concerns someone other than the covered person. The Director may grant a single extension of up to 90 days for issuing an opinion. An advisory opinion issued under this paragraph can be amended or revoked at any time. Opinions rendered pursuant to this paragraph shall be publicly disclosed. Opinions rendered under this paragraph will be made public in the Bureau's record 90 days after the advice is received, with redactions for personal or confidential information unless consented to. The Bureau will also report to Congress alongside the semi-annual report. Under section 1016(b), information on advisory opinion requests, subjects, denials, and response times must be submitted. Reliance on unamended opinions is allowed, and no liability under Federal consumer financial law applies. Confidentiality is maintained for documents received by the Bureau. The Bureau will keep material received in connection with inquiries confidential and exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Small businesses will be assisted in preparing inquiries to the maximum extent practicable. The Director will charge a fee for each inquiry made under this paragraph to cover the costs. The definition of \"small business\" is based on the Small Business Act. The Director will publish a description of the fee system in the Federal Register and seek public comments for 60 days. A final description of the fee system will be published and implemented within 30 days after the public comment period."
