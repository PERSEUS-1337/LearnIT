    "content": "In future conflicts involving cyberwarfare, the distinction between military and civilian targets may blur, with civilian computer systems becoming vulnerable to attacks. Cybercrime and cyberattack services from criminal organizations pose a growing threat to national security and the economy. New cybercrime tools could allow attackers to remain unidentified while directing cyberattacks. Many experts warn of the increasing threat of cybercrime and cyberattacks on government and civilian critical infrastructure systems. The report explores possible connections between cybercriminals and terrorist groups aiming to harm the U.S. economy and national security. Trends in cybercrime, including identity theft and malicious Internet websites, are linked to conventional terrorist activities. Congress may need to further investigate these issues. Terrorist groups are using computers and the Internet for spreading terrorism through recruitment, fundraising, and training. Cybercriminals have been convicted of using stolen credit card information to finance terrorist activities. Congress may need to explore the impact of coordinated cyber attacks on the U.S. economy and military, as well as the challenges in determining a response strategy. Terrorist groups and cybercriminals may collaborate to use stolen credit card information for financing terrorist activities. This partnership could lead to extremists gaining access to cybercriminals' network tools to disrupt computer systems or steal personal data through cyberattacks. The report focuses on cyberattacks, which use malicious code to disrupt processing, change logic, or steal data from computers. As technology evolves, the lines between these methods may blur, posing a new type of threat. The discussed methods of cyberattacks are chosen based on the targeted technology asset and the effects they can produce. Conventional kinetic weapons can physically disrupt computer equipment, while electromagnetic energy like EMP can create electronic attacks. Malicious code can be used for cyberattacks directed at processing code, instruction logic, or data. Cyberattacks can disrupt data or logic by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer software or security practices. Labeling attacks as cybercrime or cyberterrorism is challenging due to identifying the attacker's intent or political motivations. Definitions for cyberterrorism vary, but it often involves the use of malicious code and other factors beyond just a cyberattack. Various definitions exist for the term \"cyberterrorism\", with experts defining it as politically motivated hacking operations intended to cause harm, unlawful attacks against computers and networks to intimidate or coerce, and physical attacks on critical infrastructures. Cyberterrorism involves politically motivated hacking operations, unlawful attacks against computers, and physical attacks on critical infrastructures. Cybercrime is enabled by computers and can involve theft of intellectual property, patent violations, or attacks to disrupt processing. The primary difference between cybercrime and cyberterrorism lies in the intent of the attacker. Botnets are a major tool for cybercrime, allowing malicious users to disrupt computer systems by renting botnet services. These networks consist of infected computers controlled remotely to carry out various malicious activities like blocking Internet traffic, harvesting information, and distributing malware. Botnet designers, known as \"botmasters\", can make large sums of money by marketing their technical services. For example, hacker Jeanson Ancheta made over $100,000 by infecting 400,000 PCs with malicious adware code and renting out his \"botnet herd\" for spam and virus distribution. In 2006, Ancheta was sentenced to five years in prison for his activities. Botnet code can be installed on users' PCs through various methods, such as clicking on spam messages or visiting infected websites. Firewalls and antivirus software may not detect all malicious downloads, and some bot software can disable security measures. Once infected, the malware establishes a connection to a remote \"botmaster\" for commands and may steal personal data. The Shadowserver Foundation monitors command and control servers on the Internet to track bot networks. From November 2006 to May 2007, 1,400 active servers controlled over 3 million infected drones. Symantec detected 6 million bot-infected computers in the second half of 2006. Botnet owners rent networks for fraud and extortion, with botnets becoming a popular tool for cybercrime. Newer methods for distributing \"bot\" software are evolving, making it harder for law enforcement to identify botmasters. Authors of botnet software are using modern, open-source techniques for development, collaborating with multiple authors and creating reusable code modules. This collaboration among hackers mirrors professional code development techniques used for commercial software, making future botnets more robust and reliable. This is expected to increase the demand for malware services in the future. In the near future, security experts predict that attackers may use new, more sophisticated botnet architectures that are decentralized and harder to detect and trace. One emerging architecture uses peer-to-peer protocol, making it resistant to countermeasures. This design may provide anonymity to the controller, making it nearly impossible to shut down the botnet as a whole. In 2007, Estonia faced a cyberattack after moving a war memorial, leading to riots and DDOS attacks on government websites. The attacks caused websites to shut down repeatedly for hours. The cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 caused repeated shutdowns of websites for hours, flooding computers and servers. NATO and the United States sent experts to help recover and analyze the attacks. This event highlights the blurred boundaries between crime, warfare, and terrorism in the digital age. The cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 blurred the boundaries between crime, warfare, and terrorism. Identifying the attacker accurately is a challenge, as it is unclear if the attack was sponsored by a nation, carried out independently, or orchestrated by a group to cause damage and instill fear. The uncertainty of the attacker affects decisions on retaliation, with initial blame placed on the Russian government. Observers suggest collusion between the Russian government and cybercriminals, renting out botnets for attacks. The cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 were not a concerted attack but rather spontaneous anger from separate attackers. The sources of the attack were worldwide, and the DDOS attack code was shared in Russian chat rooms. It remains unclear if the attacks were sanctioned by the Russian government or carried out by a criminal botnet. Analysts found no evidence of Russian government involvement in the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007. A local man was convicted for bringing down a government website during the attack, but he is the only person convicted so far. The incident is seen as a potential model for future cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism. Cybercrime is often conducted through the Internet or by unauthorized data removal on portable storage devices. Perpetrators are typically skilled individuals seeking recognition, but there is a growing trend towards profit-driven cyberattacks through collaboration between criminals and technical experts. Motives of cybercriminal groups may differ from their customers, who may lack technical skills. Law enforcement struggles to keep up with advancing technologies, facing challenges in coordination among different countries and conflicting national policies, giving cybercriminals an advantage. Cybercriminals take advantage of national policies on cybercrime, operating from locations with lenient penalties. They use sophisticated tools available for sale or rent on the Internet, with organized underground businesses offering disruptive software and services. High-end groups recruit talented software engineers and adopt standard IT business practices to develop efficient cybercrime code. Studies show organized crime actively recruits college students. Cybercriminals recruit college engineering graduates and technical experts to enhance their skills in cybercrime. They use sophisticated techniques to silently steal information without detection, targeting mobile devices for future attacks. Malicious code like viruses and Trojan Horses are used to take over and control infected computers. Malicious code can infect a computer through email attachments or innocent-looking website links. In 2005, users visiting MySpace and YouTube without security patches may have had their PCs infected by clicking on a banner ad. Microsoft Security Team removed 10 million pieces of malicious software from 4 million computers in the first half of 2006. Google found 4.5 million suspicious web pages, with over 1 million launching downloads of malicious software. Researchers at Finjan Inc. found that over 1 million web pages launched downloads of malicious software in the first quarter of 2007. Two-thirds of these programs were \"bot\" software that collected banking transaction data and sent it to temporary email accounts. The malware is mostly hosted on servers in countries like the U.S. and U.K., where e-crime law enforcement policies are less developed. Attacks using code obfuscation techniques are increasing, making them hard to detect with traditional antivirus methods. Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in embedding malicious code within legitimate content, making it difficult for traditional antivirus products to detect. Finjan found that 90% of websites containing malware were hosted on servers in the U.S. or U.K., debunking the myth that malicious code is primarily hosted in countries with less developed e-crime laws. Botnets assist cybercriminals in identity theft, costing American businesses and consumers $50 billion annually. Users are often tricked into clicking on malicious links in emails or websites. When visiting websites, clicking on malicious titles can exploit web browser vulnerabilities to install software that gathers personal information from users. This stolen data is used to create false identity documents, enabling identity theft involving thousands of victims. Inadequate computer security practices within organizations also contribute to this problem. In 2005, over 40 million credit card numbers of U.S. consumers were hacked, leading to fraudulent charges. UFJ bank in Japan also reported fraud related to stolen MasterCard information. In 2006, personal information of 1,500 NNSA employees was stolen in a network intrusion, discovered a year later. Stolen credit card numbers and bank account information are traded online. Stolen credit card numbers and bank account information are traded online in a structured arrangement involving buyers, sellers, and service industries. Prices for such information have decreased over the years, with a stolen credit card number selling for as low as $1 in 2007. Data security laws have been enacted in 35 states to protect against identity theft. Existing federal and state laws may need to be harmonized to provide more uniform protection for restricted data. Cyber espionage involves unauthorized probing and copying of data files, and those using hacking techniques for political or economic motives may be considered cybercriminals. Industrial cyber espionage is now seen as part of global economic competition, and monitoring potential adversary countries' computerized functions is essential for national defense. Technology has outpaced policy in labeling actions in cyberspace. Adversary countries are essential for national defense as they attempt to hack into US government and company computer systems. Cyber espionage has transformed counterintelligence by reducing reliance on traditional spying. The Internet provides low-cost opportunities for espionage. The US was accused of industrial espionage using the Echelon electronic spy network. Echelon was established during the Cold War. Echelon, an electronic monitoring system established during the Cold War, is operated by European-Union member Britain with listening posts in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It is a global spy system capable of intercepting wireless phone calls, emails, and fax messages worldwide. Information gathered on Echelon may have aided the US in outbidding the European Airbus Consortium in selling aircraft to Saudi Arabia in 1994. France expelled American diplomats in 1995 due to suspected industrial espionage activities linked to Echelon, although the US denied involvement in such activities. Former CIA director justifies industrial espionage by US based on bribery by European companies. European parliament officials express outrage but acknowledge bribery in sales. Warning about criminals selling malicious code tools for cyber espionage and the risk to US national security. Industry official calls for stronger government agency computer security practices to prevent cyber espionage. In 2003, a series of cyberattacks known as \"Titan Rain\" targeted DOD systems and contractors, suspected to originate from China. The attacks copied sensitive data files, including information subject to U.S. export-control laws. In 2006, a cyberattack on the U.S. Naval War College led to the campus being disconnected from the Internet. In Newport, Rhode Island, officials disconnected the campus from the Internet due to a cyberattack. The Global Information Grid, the main network for the U.S. military, faces over three million daily scans by potential intruders. Majority of cyber attacks against DOD and U.S. civilian agency systems are suspected to originate in China, primarily for cyber espionage. Security experts warn that malicious actors are targeting U.S. federal agencies and industries through cyber espionage, with over 237 million security attacks reported globally in the first half of 2005. Government agencies were the primary targets, followed by manufacturing, financial services, and healthcare sectors. In the first half of 2005, government agencies and industries in the United States, New Zealand, and China were targeted in cyber attacks. Security analysts believe reported incidents are only a fraction of the total attacks. Terrorist groups may have links to cyber criminals, allowing them to expand internationally using criminal resources. The 2005 U.K. subway and bus bombings, as well as attempted car bombings in 2007, show evidence of terrorist activity in countries with large communication networks. Terrorists with links to cyber criminals are active in countries with advanced communication networks and IT workforce. London police suspect terrorists obtained explosives for the 2005 U.K. bombings from criminal groups in Eastern Europe. Recent trials in the U.K. revealed connections between Islamic terrorist groups and cybercrime, with individuals using stolen credit card information to purchase items for fellow jihadists. The trio used stolen credit cards to make fraudulent charges totaling over $3.5 million. They also registered over 180 Internet web domains using stolen credit cards and laundered money through online gambling websites. Cybercriminals have alliances with drug traffickers to support terrorist groups, with drug traffickers using encryption for Internet messaging and hiring computer specialists to evade law enforcement and launder money. Regions with major narcotics markets like Western Europe and North America have advanced technology infrastructure that supports transnational trafficking by criminal and terrorist groups. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency reported in 2003 that many foreign terrorist organizations were involved in drug trafficking. A 2002 report from the Library of Congress highlighted the increasing involvement of Islamic terrorist groups in drug trafficking, with evidence of cooperation between different terrorist groups in drug and arms trafficking. DEA officials argue that the war on drugs and terrorism are interconnected. The State Department officials indicated that terrorist groups may use drug trafficking to finance their activities and weaken their enemies. The poppy crop in Afghanistan supplies most of the world's heroin, supporting a $3.1 billion drug trade. Money from drug trafficking in Afghanistan funds terrorist and insurgent groups. U.S. intelligence reports in 2007 warned of a revitalized al Qaeda in Afghanistan with the capability to strike Western countries. Drug traffickers hire computer specialists to use technology for their operations. Terrorist organizations use their financial resources to hire computer specialists from former Soviet Union and Indian subcontinent to utilize technologies for encrypted communication and international operations. Some specialists may be unaware of their employers' motives, while others join due to limited legitimate job opportunities in their region. The connection between hackers and terrorists is hard to confirm, with exclusive hacker groups developing and sharing advanced skills. Exclusive hacker groups operate in secrecy, sharing sophisticated tools with each other. Some groups have political or profit motives, selling computer services and information on vulnerabilities in a black market. For example, lists of infected computers for bot networks can be purchased online for $150 to $500. Prices for information about computer vulnerabilities range from $1,000 to $5,000, with purchasers including organized crime groups, foreign governments, and spam companies. Advanced cyberattacks may require 2 to 10 years of preparation, similar to the planning seen in physical terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda. The Center for the Study of Terrorism and Irregular Warfare at the Naval Postgraduate School reported in 1999 that severe cyberattacks in industrialized nations may be used by terrorist groups to supplement traditional physical attacks. Some believe Al Qaeda prioritizes attacks causing human casualties over cyberattacks. Post-industrial societies are seen as more likely targets for cyberterrorism compared to developing regions with limited technology access. Al Qaeda has improved organizational secrecy through technology, using the Internet extensively for planning operations. Members have utilized Internet-based communication services and chat software for coordination. Ramzi Yousef, an engineer, planned to use sophisticated electronics for bombing attacks on U.S. airliners. Al Qaeda has improved organizational secrecy through technology, using the Internet extensively for planning operations. Ramzi Yousef planned to use sophisticated electronics for bombing attacks on U.S. airliners. Tighter physical security measures in the United States may lead terrorist groups to consider cyberattacks as a way to lower the risk of detection. However, some security observers believe that cyberattacks may not have the same immediate impact as conventional bombings. Researchers at Idaho National Laboratories conducted an experiment called the \"Aurora Generator Test\" in March 2007. The \"Aurora Generator Test\" conducted at Idaho National Laboratories demonstrated a simulated cyberattack on a power network, showing a power generator turbine overheating and shutting down after receiving malicious commands. The experiment highlighted vulnerabilities that have since been fixed but raised concerns about other power generators with similar cyber vulnerabilities. In a separate event, the U.S. Naval War College hosted a war game called \"Digital Pearl Harbor\" to simulate state-sponsored cyberwarfare attacks on critical infrastructure systems. Experts simulated state-sponsored cyberwarfare attacks on critical infrastructure systems, identifying the Internet and financial computer systems as the most vulnerable. Attempts to cripple the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure were deemed unsuccessful due to built-in redundancy. While a \"Digital Pearl Harbor\" in the U.S. was considered unlikely, a major vulnerability in switching equipment software was discovered in 2002, posing a global threat to Internet routers and network telecommunications equipment. A major vulnerability in switching equipment software was discovered in 2002, posing a global threat to Internet routers and network telecommunications equipment. Network and equipment vendors rushed to fix the problem to prevent exploitation by hackers. U.S. government officials kept information about the vulnerability quiet until repairs were made. The security flaw could have caused serious problems like disrupting telephone networks and aircraft control systems. Experts warn that a coordinated cyberattack could amplify the effects of a conventional terrorist attack. Some experts warn of the damaging effects of cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, while others believe the systems are resilient. Possible offensive tactics include using cyberattacks to open floodgates, control traffic lights, or scramble banking systems. China's military journals speculate that cyberattacks could disable American financial markets, but China is also dependent on these markets and may suffer more from disruptions. Cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure could have severe consequences, especially for the financial sector. While nation states may face constraints in using cyberattacks, non-state actors like Al Qaeda could find it a useful tool. SCADA systems monitor and regulate operations in critical industries, operating remotely and unmanned. SCADA systems, often unmanned and accessed remotely, are now connected to corporate networks or the Internet for efficiency. Experts warn that these systems, using vulnerable COTS software, are attractive targets for cyberattacks due to inadequate protection. Organizations operating SCADA systems may overlook their unique security needs, leaving them persistently vulnerable to attacks. The \"Slammer\" Internet worm corrupted computer control systems at the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Ohio in 2003 due to multiple connections to the Internet bypassing the control room firewall. SCADA systems and critical infrastructure are considered resilient to cyberterrorism attacks. SCADA systems and critical infrastructure are resilient to cyberterrorism attacks, as system failures are often regional and technical experts can quickly restore functions. Cyberterrorists would need to attack multiple targets simultaneously for long periods to create noticeable effects on national security. Unpredictable interactions between computer systems remain a concern. For more information on SCADA systems, refer to CRS Report RL31534. The concern lies in the unpredictable interactions between computer systems operating different U.S. infrastructures, with potential cascading effects on national security. For instance, the \"Blaster\" worm disrupting Internet computers in 2003 may have contributed to the Eastern U.S. power blackout by slowing communication links. The Department of Defense (DOD) utilizes Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products in core administrative functions and combat systems. While COTS products offer innovation and cost-effectiveness, they lack security. DOD deploys additional protective measures to enhance security, but viruses infiltrated military systems in 2004. In 2004, viruses infiltrated two top-secret computer systems at the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, compromising computers lacking basic antivirus software protection. Hackers constantly find new ways to breach computer security, exploiting vulnerabilities to create botnets of compromised computers. Zero-day exploits can compromise thousands of computers, even those with updated software. Hackers exploit new vulnerabilities to launch attacks before security patches are available. These vulnerabilities are now being sold at online auctions to the highest bidder. Computer security vulnerabilities are being sold to the highest bidder, increasing their value on the black market. Data can easily be copied and taken outside using portable storage devices like flash drives. High-density memory stick technology allows applications to run entirely from the flash drive, potentially enabling the copying and storage of an entire PC's contents. Employees with access to sensitive information systems can introduce threats through malicious code inserted into software being developed locally or under offshore contracting arrangements. In January 2003, subcontractors at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation were arrested for using false identification to access restricted military technology. Vulnerabilities in software and computer systems create entry points for cyberattacks due to poor security practices, inadequate training, and technical errors. Insufficient resources for security staffing also contribute to these issues. Home PC users often lack training in securing their networks effectively. PC users often lack training in securing home networks. Vendors of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf software are criticized for releasing products with errors that create vulnerabilities. The software industry has made efforts to design more secure products, with Microsoft creating a Security Response Center. However, vulnerabilities in software are expected to persist despite security improvements. Despite efforts to improve software security, vulnerabilities will persist in future software due to increasing complexity. Software vendors release fixes, but important security patches may not be installed promptly due to time constraints or low priority. System maintenance is ongoing as new vulnerabilities are introduced with software complexity. Security patches may disrupt computers, requiring additional time for adjustment. Testing on a separate network may be necessary to avoid disruptions before distribution for installation. Despite efforts to improve software security, vulnerabilities will persist in future software due to increasing complexity. Testing on a separate isolated network before distribution is crucial to avoid delays in installing security patches, which may leave networks open to cyberattacks. There is no widespread evidence of cybercriminals targeting U.S. civilian critical infrastructure control systems. In 2006, a government analyst mentioned criminal extortion schemes exploiting control system vulnerabilities for economic gain. Malicious software for scanning control system vulnerabilities was available online for cybercriminals. Idaho National Laboratory studies technology risks in infrastructure control systems, revealing many are connected to the Internet or corporate systems. Many infrastructure SCADA systems connected to the Internet are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to lack of security measures. Analysts predict cybercriminals exploiting these vulnerabilities in critical control systems. New automated attack methods surpass current tracking capabilities. The SQL Slammer worm, also known as \"Sapphire,\" spread rapidly on January 25, 2003, infecting over 90% of vulnerable computers worldwide within 10 minutes. It caused network outages, leading to canceled flights and ATM failures. The use of automated tools for cybercrime had a significant impact on CERT/CC, prompting them to abandon their annual report on cyber intrusions in 2004. CERT/CC stopped publishing their annual tracking report on security incidents in 2004 due to the escalation of network attacks facilitated by new automated cyberattack tools. The organization found that traditional methods for counting incidents were no longer meaningful in assessing the scope and impact of attacks against Internet-connected systems. The FBI estimates that all types of computer crime have increased as a result. The FBI estimates that computer crime in the U.S. costs industry about $400 billion, with a 50 percent increase in computer crime reported in Britain from 2005 to 2006. TJX incurred a $12 million charge in 2008 due to a security breach involving the theft of 45 million credit and debit card numbers. The breach may eventually cost $4.5 billion, with only five percent of cybercriminals ever being arrested or convicted due to the anonymity of web activity. Cybercrime incidents are often unreported due to the difficulty in tracing perpetrators and the fear of negative publicity. Law enforcement emphasizes the importance of partnerships between different sectors to combat cybercrime. The FBI collaborates with the Computer Security Institute to conduct surveys on security practices. The CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey is a widely-used source of information on computer crime frequency and costs. The 2006 survey reported an average financial loss of $167,713 due to security breaches, a decrease from the previous year. However, some question the survey's validity as it is limited to CSI members, potentially skewing the results. The survey also highlights that many companies are still not fully disclosing security incidents. The lack of statistically valid survey results on the financial costs of computer crime and the growing use of botnets and malicious code suggest an increase in unreported and undetected cybercrime. Commercial enterprises are hesitant to report attacks due to liability concerns, leading to an estimated 80% of computer security incidents remaining unreported. Law enforcement struggles to trace cybercriminal profits, highlighting the challenges in combating cybercrime. Online payment services like PayPal and E-Gold facilitate cybercriminals in laundering profits and exploiting law enforcement loopholes. Despite fines like the $7.5 million penalty imposed on Intermix Media for spyware distribution, some adware and spyware vendors still make millions annually. The complex financial structures backing cybercrimes make it challenging for law enforcement to track. Transnational cybercriminal groups like Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits operate globally, collaborating to hack systems, steal credit card data, and sell it. Organized crime is recruiting teenagers to engage in cybercrime activities, targeting top students from leading academic institutions to acquire the skills needed for high-tech crimes. The McAfee security organization's \"Virtual Criminology Report\" highlights the structured network of cybercriminals worldwide, who hack into systems, steal credit card information, and sell identities. The report suggests that traditional forms of criminal organization may not transition well to online crime due to the lack of personal contact and formalities required. Cybercrime in cyberspace offers individuals more freedom and flexibility compared to physical world activities. Cybercrime may not fit traditional organized crime structures due to less personal contact and formalities required. Online criminal activity may emphasize lateral relationships and networks over hierarchies, with a \"swarming\" model where individuals come together temporarily for specific tasks. This could make law enforcement's job more difficult if cybercriminals become transient groups rather than permanent ones. The federal government has implemented measures to enhance computer security and promote stronger security practices in the private sector to reduce infrastructure vulnerabilities. This includes the enactment of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) in 2002 and the publication of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) plays a role in coordinating information security standards and guidelines to improve overall cybersecurity. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) oversees a Cyber Security Tracking, Analysis and Response Center (CSTARC) for analyzing cyberspace threats, issuing alerts, improving information sharing, responding to incidents, and aiding in recovery efforts. A new Cyber Warning and Information Network (CWIN) operates in 50 locations as an early warning system for cyberattacks, designed to be reliable and independent of the Internet or public switched network (PSN). The NCSD also created the National Cyber Alert System (NCAS) in January 2004 for coordinated national cybersecurity distribution. The National Cyber Alert System (NCAS) is a coordinated national cybersecurity system managed by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to distribute information on emerging vulnerabilities and cyberthreats. The Convention on Cybercrime, adopted in 2001, is the first international treaty to address criminal acts over the internet, requiring participating countries to update and harmonize their laws. The Convention on Cybercrime requires countries to update laws against cyber activities like hacking, fraud, and child pornography. The United States did not sign a protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism online due to concerns about constitutional issues. The Department of Justice cited First Amendment concerns as the reason for not signing the additional protocol. The United States signed the additional protocol of the Convention on Cybercrime in 2006, despite concerns about privacy and civil liberties. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution of ratification for the Convention, with no new implementing legislation required. Legal analysts believe that U.S. negotiators successfully removed objectionable provisions, aligning the Convention with existing U.S. laws. The Department of Defense officials acknowledge the threat of cyber attacks, which could be more damaging than physical attacks. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 required the Department of Homeland Security to protect the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. Despite numerous reports highlighting the urgent need to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, there is a lack of national urgency to close the gap between cybersecurity and the threat of disruptive technology. Despite the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), experts argue that cybersecurity remains a low priority at some federal agencies. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2007 that cybersecurity risks have increased for infrastructure control systems due to interconnections with the Internet and lack of a coordinated strategy to improve computer security across federal agencies and the private sector. Some observers argue that remote systems controlling critical infrastructure may be easier targets for cybercrime as businesses strengthen security for headquarters. Decision-makers may not see cybercrime as a high-probability threat, despite past reports urging urgent action. Future possibilities are discounted, reducing the perceived need for present-day action, and the costs of inaction are not felt by current decision-makers. The costs of current inaction are not felt by decision-makers. IT vendors, researchers, and purchasers must prioritize cybersecurity. Policy issues include increasing awareness of evolving threats, measuring cybercrime effects, determining responses to cyberattacks, and improving software security. Congress should consider harmonizing federal and state laws on data breach notifications and security obligations for businesses. Al Qaeda members are increasingly using hacker tools, raising concerns about potential cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Extremists could leverage cybercrime botnets to amplify their attacks. Botnets can be used by extremists to amplify the effects of terrorist attacks. The rise of computer-literate individuals in terrorist groups may lead to an increase in cyberterrorism. The effectiveness of cyberattacks is difficult to measure accurately, which hinders government and legal authorities in assessing their policies and enforcement actions. The need for more statistically reliable analysis of trends in computer security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks to accurately assess the costs and benefits for improving national cybersecurity is highlighted. Congress may need to encourage security experts to find better ways to collect data and identify the initiators of cyberattacks, especially in the event of terrorist groups using cybercrime botnets for attacks. The U.S. response to cyberattacks from third-party countries like China must be carefully considered to avoid retaliating against the wrong entity. The potential consequences of using cyberweapons and the risk of encouraging other extremists or rogue nations to launch cyberattacks against the U.S. are key concerns. Additionally, questions arise about the attribution of cyberespionage actions and the potential for terrorist groups to replicate and use U.S. military cyberattack programs against allies or civilian systems. The U.S. faces challenges in responding to cyberattacks from countries like China, with concerns about attribution and potential consequences of using cyberweapons. Questions arise about the vulnerability of U.S. military systems to cyberattacks and the need for more secure commercial software. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace may need clearer incentives for achieving security objectives. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace faces challenges in responding to cyberattacks, with concerns about the certification process for software procurement. Industry observers worry about the impact on innovation and competitiveness. Should regulation be imposed to ensure best security practices, or rely on voluntary action? Former cybersecurity advisers have differing views on the matter. Cybersecurity advisers Howard Schmidt and Richard Clarke have differing views on improving cybersecurity. Schmidt believes market forces should drive technology evolution, while Clarke criticizes the IT industry for not doing enough. Some experts suggest that better training for system administrators could enhance computer security for critical infrastructure. The debate continues on whether software vendors should be mandated to create more secure products through better design and testing procedures. Ultimately, national security against cybercrime requires a strong commitment. Improving cybersecurity requires a strong commitment from government and the private sector to follow best practices. Existing reports highlight the threat of cybercrime and recommend management practices for better security. A 2004 survey revealed that most home PC users lack adequate protection against hackers and are confused about security measures. The challenge lies in providing computer security training to all users to keep them informed about evolving threats and encourage proper security procedures. Collaboration between federal, local governments, and the private sector is essential for enhancing computer security. Effective cybersecurity requires sharing relevant information about threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits between federal government, local governments, and the private sector. The challenge lies in obtaining specific information from the government on classified threats and from private industry on successful intrusions. Coordination of security policies and international law is crucial to protect against cyberattacks. The pursuit of hackers for cybercrime protection involves cooperation with other nations, which can be complex due to conflicting legal policies or political ideologies. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime aims to combat cybercrime through harmonizing laws and boosting international cooperation, but effectiveness may be limited without participation from countries where cybercriminals operate freely. H.R. 1525 proposes penalties for unauthorized computer access and cybercrimes. H.R. 1684 establishes an Office of Cybersecurity and Communications within the Department of Homeland Security to protect against cyber threats and terrorist attacks. The curr_chunk discusses activities related to identifying threats to critical information infrastructure, conducting risk assessments for terrorism, developing plans for cyber attack response, defining cyber incidents of national significance, and promoting cybersecurity awareness. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 11, 2007. The New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act proposes the establishment of the Grid Modernization Commission to facilitate the adoption of Smart Grid standards and technologies. The bill was passed in the House on August 4, 2007. The Smart Grid Facilitation Act of 2007 aims to modernize the Nation's electricity transmission and distribution system with digital technology to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. The bill aims to assess progress in modernizing the electric system, including cybersecurity for extended grid systems. It was referred to the House subcommittee on Energy and Environment on August 24, 2007."
