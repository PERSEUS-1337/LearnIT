The Act \"Plug-in Hybrid Opportunity Act of 2007\" introduces a new plug-in battery module conversion credit under section 30B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit applies to qualified plug-in battery modules. The credit for qualified plug-in battery modules is 35% of the module cost, not exceeding $4,000. A qualified plug-in battery module is one acquired for personal use, with the original use starting with the taxpayer. The credit for qualified plug-in battery modules is 35% of the module cost, not exceeding $4,000, for personal use by the taxpayer.

The plug-in battery module must have a capacity of at least 2.5 kilowatt hours, be rechargeable from a 120-volt power source, and meet safety standards when installed in a qualified hybrid vehicle. The text chunk discusses the requirements for a plug-in battery module to be eligible for a nationwide distribution program. It must meet specific capacity and safety standards, be tested in a qualified hybrid vehicle, and certified by the manufacturer.
