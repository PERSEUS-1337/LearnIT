The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 1999\" prohibits the use of surpluses for any other purpose until legislation is passed to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 1999\" prohibits the use of baseline budget surpluses until specific conditions are met. Baseline budget surpluses are defined as the sum of on- and off-budget surpluses in the most recent Congressional Budget Office projections. The baseline budget projection includes current year levels of outlays, receipts, and surplus or deficit for both on-budget and off-budget items. It also considers discretionary limits for certain programs. The baseline budget surpluses are used if legislation affecting revenues or direct spending does not offset any net reductions or increases in the current year or over 5 or 10-year estimating periods. This applies to appropriations bills as well. The term 'social security solvency certification' refers to a certification by the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds that the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are in actuarial balance for a 75-year period.

Amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 require a supermajority for certain provisions. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.
