The electric power system was incapacitated, and officials estimated that it could take up to six months to restore electricity to the 3.5 million residents. Puerto Rico's power infrastructure was already in poor condition before the hurricane due to underinvestment and maintenance issues with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) is facing challenges with its maintenance practices and lack of transparency in decision-making. Rebuilding the electricity system in Puerto Rico is a topic of discussion, especially with the new hurricane season underway. Congress is monitoring the recovery efforts following the 2017 hurricanes that devastated the power infrastructure. The electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico was severely damaged by hurricanes, leading to struggles in providing electricity. Congress is interested in how Puerto Rico rebuilds its system to be reliable and resilient. FEMA coordinated power restoration efforts with portable generators and the USACE overseeing transmission system repairs. PREPA focused on restoring the distribution system and service connections. The USACE and PREPA have been working on restoring the electric distribution system in Puerto Rico, with contractors assisting in repairs. While almost 99% of PREPA's customers have had their electricity restored, over 16,000 customers in rural areas are still without power. The power restoration mission is considered incomplete, with efforts focused on patching up the system. FEMA will leave over 700 portable generators on the island. PREPA, the largest electricity supplier in Puerto Rico, is a public utility owned by the Commonwealth. PREPA, the largest electricity supplier in Puerto Rico, is eligible for federal assistance from FEMA for the repair and restoration of public facilities. USACE supports DHS in emergency response, providing support in public works and engineering as needed. These activities are funded through the Disaster Relief Fund. USACE led grid repair efforts in Puerto Rico after being tasked by FEMA to coordinate with PREPA, DOE, and FEMA. The Unified Command Group was formed to oversee the restoration of power to pre-storm customers. PREPA's Palo Seco plant in San Juan is not operating at full capacity. FEMA installed two. FEMA installed mobile generators in San Juan and Yabucoa to stabilize power generation in Puerto Rico. USACE personnel are assisting with the operation and maintenance of the generators. Congress passed three supplemental appropriations bills in response to 2017 disasters, with funding for electric grid restoration in Puerto Rico not specified. The Trump Administration requested $15.3 billion in funding for disaster relief, including $2 billion for improved electrical power systems in areas affected by Hurricane Maria. Additional funding requests were made, with the House passing a bill for $18.67 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. The House passed H.R. 2266 with a $18.67 billion amendment for the Disaster Relief Fund, allowing funding transfers to FEMA and DHS. The bill became law as P.L. 115-72, authorizing $36.5 billion in funding. Up to $150 million is available for loans for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The Trump Administration requested additional disaster relief funding on November 17, 2017. The Senate passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) which included over $84 billion in disaster assistance funding. President Trump signed the bill into law, authorizing $84.3 billion in funding, with FEMA receiving an additional $23.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. $150 million was transferred to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program for costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. FEMA allocated approximately $3.2 billion for electric power restoration activities in Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Funds from various disaster supplemental appropriations are being used, with discussions ongoing about potential changes in allocation. FEMA also left behind three large mobile power generation units to support Puerto Rico's fragile electric system. After FEMA's power restoration efforts in Puerto Rico, three large mobile power generation units were left behind, charged to Disaster Declaration 4339. Additionally, peaking generation units were also left to support power demands on the grid. USACE's mission ended on May 18, 2018, with 99% of customers having power restored. Some personnel remain to maintain temporary generators. Structural issues with distribution poles and transmission towers may require replacement as focus shifts to rebuilding efforts. The federal government and Commonwealth shift focus from power restoration to rebuilding Puerto Rico's grid to U.S. code standards. FEMA confirms that power restoration was completed as emergency work using materials designed to strengthen the system, including replacing rusted and toppled towers. Approximately $2 billion in CDBG funds were made available to enhance or improve electric power systems damaged by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. DOE reports that five national laboratories have collaboratively built a model of Puerto Rico's electricity system to guide the rebuilding process, including testing microgrid placement, underground power lines, and siting renewable energy projects for resilience against extreme weather events. The DOE issued a report in June 2018 with recommendations to enhance Puerto Rico's electric grid, prioritizing investments in transmission, distribution, new generation, energy storage, microgrids, and strategic power reserves. Smart Grid technologies would be incorporated for improved efficiency and to allow for more varied energy choices. The potential deployment of a Smart Grid in Puerto Rico would depend on evaluating benefits and costs, including considerations for cyber and physical security. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $28 billion for HUD, with $2 billion available for enhanced electrical power systems. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $28 billion for HUD, with $2 billion available for enhanced electrical power systems. Puerto Rico's Governor proposed privatizing PREPA's assets to stabilize the electric system and lower electricity prices through public-private partnerships. FEMA, DOE, and the Governor of Puerto Rico are required to report on a 12- and 24-month economic and disaster recovery plan for electric power systems and grid restoration. The privatization effort in Puerto Rico aims to stabilize the electric system and lower electricity prices through public-private partnerships. Previous privatization attempts resulted in deteriorated service quality and increased consumer prices. Recovery efforts have focused on restoring power to customers, but there are concerns about the lack of adherence to basic quality standards. Puerto Rico is working to adopt maintenance guidelines for electric systems, recommended by the DOE and the Rural Utilities Service. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is involved in the restoration of infrastructure in Puerto Rico to current electrical standards. Recommendations by the DOE include implementing mutual assistance agreements for electric reliability. FERC has authority to oversee the reliability of the bulk-power system. Reliability standards were added to the bulk-power system under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to ensure reliable operation and prevent failures. FERC-approved standards cover various programs, but do not apply to U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. No legislation has been proposed to change this. Authorities will likely focus on rebuilding Puerto Rico's electricity systems after power restoration efforts are completed. Puerto Rico's electricity transmission and distribution systems, built to U.S. industry standards, are more likely to withstand extreme weather events. DOE suggests enforcing vegetation trimming and clearance requirements to reduce weather-related power outages. System reliability and resilience are related but differ in scope and regulatory requirements. Authorities in Puerto Rico are urged by DOE to define system resilience. Authorities in Puerto Rico are encouraged by DOE to define system resilience for the power grid, which may involve modernizing power generation, incorporating microgrids, and hardening infrastructure. Enhancing resilience would require improvements beyond rebuilding to withstand extreme weather events. There are no commonly used metrics for measuring grid resilience, and it is not mandated by federal law. The 2016 report from DOE's national laboratories highlighted the importance of a resilient power system in adapting to changing conditions and recovering from disruptions. It identified various risks such as weather events, catastrophic hurricanes, and challenges in managing threats despite the current capabilities of electric power systems. The report also emphasized the need to address potential threats from climate change, energy security, transitions in generation sources, and modernizing the energy grid. The study identified key risks to resilience in the U.S. electricity system, including HILF threats from natural hazards or attacks, combined threats, and vulnerabilities in distribution networks. Recommendations were provided to enhance resilience in the face of these challenges. The study identified key risks to resilience in the U.S. electricity system, including HILF threats from natural hazards or attacks, combined threats, and vulnerabilities in distribution networks. Recommendations were provided to enhance resilience, such as building a greater understanding of HILF events, scenario-based planning, developing resilience metrics, increasing risk assessment capacity, and instituting policies for streamlined decision-making and communication. Puerto Rico's electric power systems need to incorporate resilience into reliability planning due to the potential consequences of long-term power failures. The reliance on fossil fuels like coal and diesel raises cost, reliability, and health issues. Before the 2017 hurricane season, coal and diesel fuel accounted for 64% of power generation, with diesel fuel powering almost 50% of electricity. The use of expensive imported fuels highlights the need for a more sustainable and resilient energy strategy. Puerto Rico's reliance on diesel fuel for almost 50% of electricity has led to high prices of about 24 cents per Kilowatt-hour for residential customers, compared to 13 cents on the U.S. mainland. PREPA's financial struggles post-Hurricane Maria were exacerbated by the inability to pay for fuel. Emissions from diesel and gasoline generators have been linked to rising asthma rates. The Renewable Portfolio Standard mandates 20% of retail sales from green energy by 2035. The Renewable Portfolio Standard aims for 20% of retail sales from green energy by 2035 in Puerto Rico. Legislation in 2014 established the Puerto Rico Energy Commission to ensure RPS goals are met. Increasing renewable electric generation and energy storage could lower costs, but reliable electricity would require flexible power generation. Natural gas generation is considered a cleaner option to diesel. The Jones Act restrictions on importing liquefied natural gas to Puerto Rico may hinder the use of natural gas as a cleaner-burning option. A bill introduced in the 115th Congress aims to exempt Puerto Rico from the Jones Act, which requires vessels transporting merchandise between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports to be built in the U.S. and mostly crewed by U.S. citizens. The \"Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands Equitable Rebuild Act of 2017\" and 2018 aim to provide disaster-recovery assistance, infrastructure support, and promote energy efficiency and renewable energy in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The bills would exempt vessels transporting merchandise between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports from Jones Act requirements and allocate funds for rebuilding electric grids and promoting energy sustainability. The bill in January 2018 aimed to provide disaster-recovery assistance and support to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in various sectors including infrastructure, health care, agriculture, education, economic development, and environmental remediation. It included provisions for rebuilding electric grids, promoting energy efficiency, and renewable energy through grant programs. Funds were allocated for FEMA's Public Assistance program and Mission Assignments for specific tasks."
