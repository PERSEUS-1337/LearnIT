Ineffective police, corrupt prosecutors, and a disorganized prison system have hindered anticrime efforts. Recent spikes in violence have overwhelmed Mexico's justice system, with low conviction rates for arrests. U.S. assistance through the M\u00e9rida Initiative has focused on supporting Mexico's security crisis fueled by drug demand and illicit flows of weapons and money. The U.S. assistance under the M\u00e9rida Initiative is increasingly focused on supporting Mexico's efforts to reform its justice sector institutions to reduce corruption and impunity. Policy analysts believe that without a functioning judicial system to prosecute and punish crime, law enforcement efforts against criminal groups will be limited. Progress in judicial reform has been made in many states but is stalled at the federal level. The U.S. government is providing significant support for these efforts, but without political will and investment from the new administration, Mexico may not meet the 2016 deadline for implementing reforms. The U.S. Congress may consider supporting Mexico's judicial reforms, which aim to address corruption and impunity in the justice system. Mexico's traditional criminal justice system has roots in a period of one-party rule, with a weak judiciary and limited implementation of constitutional guarantees. Some argue that without due process and an independent judiciary, the reforms may falter. The traditional criminal justice system in Mexico is criticized for lack of due process guarantees and independence in the judiciary. Prosecutors have wide discretion in gathering evidence, often relying on potentially coerced confessions or unverified eyewitness identifications. Despite a high conviction rate, only a small portion of crimes are reported, investigated, and prosecuted, indicating a lack of serious addressing of the country's crimes. The Mexican criminal justice system is criticized for being opaque, inefficient, and corrupt. Police and public prosecutors are often seen as engaging in corruption. The system struggles with long case backlogs, high pre-trial detention rates, and low conviction rates for serious crimes. Only a small percentage of cases are resolved at the state level. Mexico extradited criminals to the US during the Felipe Calder\u00f3n Administration, but major drug trafficking leaders were not convicted by the Attorney General's Office. The Mexican criminal justice system, criticized for being corrupt and inefficient, struggles with long case backlogs, high pre-trial detention rates, and low conviction rates. The Attorney General's Office has failed to convict major drug trafficking leaders and politicians accused of collaborating with organized crime. Overcrowded prisons, exacerbated by increasing arrests, are in need of reform, with 40% of inmates awaiting trials and prisons at 23% over-capacity as of July 2011. The Mexican criminal justice system faces challenges such as corruption, inefficiency, and low conviction rates. Crime victimization surveys indicate a lack of faith in the justice system, with only 13% of crimes being reported in 2012. Judicial reform efforts began in the 1990s to address issues like lack of due process and access to legal counsel, especially for the poor. Some communities have formed armed \"self-defense\" groups due to weak police and judicial systems, raising concerns. The judicial reform movement in Mexico gained momentum in the early 2000s, particularly in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Chihuahua, and Oaxaca states. The U.S. Agency for International Development provided technical assistance to these states. Federal judicial reforms were proposed in 2004 under the PAN Administration of Vicente Fox but were not passed. However, they raised awareness of the flaws in Mexico's criminal justice system. The reforms were eventually enacted in March 2008 with broad support under President Calder\u00f3n's administration. The 2008 judicial reforms in Mexico, effective June 18, aimed to replace trial procedures with an adversarial public trial system by 2016. This change promotes transparency, participation, and impartiality in the judicial system, including oral arguments and alternative dispute resolution methods. Mexico's transition to the New Criminal Justice System (NCJS) requires structural, cultural, and systemic changes in law enforcement and judicial institutions. The reforms aim to create a more balanced power dynamic between prosecutors and defense attorneys, with a focus on reducing discretionary power. Adapting the NCJS in states with indigenous populations will be crucial, and the process could take decades to fully implement. The NCJS reforms in Mexico aim to balance power between prosecutors and defense attorneys, with judges playing a more active role in trial proceedings. Police will have a greater role in investigations under prosecutor guidance, and convictions can no longer be based solely on confessions. Pre-trial detention will be limited to violent crimes. The NCJS reforms in Mexico aim to limit pre-trial detention to violent crimes and create new judgeships for each stage of criminal proceedings to strengthen judicial impartiality. Judges will have distinct roles in the process, including a due process judge, sentencing judge, and sentencing implementation judge. Alternative methods of resolving cases, such as plea agreements and restorative justice, will also be implemented. The NCJS reforms in Mexico focus on alternative methods of resolving cases, including plea bargaining and compensation agreements. Hearings and trials are to be conducted in public, with decisions rendered based on evidence presented at a public trial. Victim rights are enhanced, giving victims procedural rights and requiring restitution for alternative justice to be pursued. Mexico's 2008 constitutional reforms prioritize efficiency in the justice system, protect victim rights, and introduce measures to combat organized crime, including wiretapping and asset forfeiture. The reforms also emphasize defendant rights, such as the presumption of innocence, access to public defenders, and alternative sentencing for rehabilitation. Article 16 of Mexico's Constitution defines organized crime as a group of three or more individuals aiming to commit crimes repeatedly. Suspects can be detained for 40 days without legal counsel, extendable to 80 days, leading to abuses. Prosecutors can use evidence from witnesses without presenting it in court, creating unequal treatment for those involved in organized crime. Analysts predict slow progress in judicial reform in Mexico due to capacity constraints and entrenched interests. Concerns arise over government focus on modernizing police rather than strengthening the justice system. Questions raised about feasibility of revamping judicial system while cracking down on organized crime. Judicial reform efforts at federal level remain stalled after almost five years. Former President Calder\u00f3n did not propose significant changes. Reform efforts at the federal level in Mexico have been stalled, with former President Calder\u00f3n delaying the proposal of a new federal criminal procedure code until 2011. Funding for the PGR and SETEC lagged behind other agencies, hindering implementation of reforms. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has pledged to advance judicial reforms by introducing legislation for a new unified penal code. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto aims to establish a new unified penal code and code of criminal procedure at the federal level in Mexico, following the Pact for Mexico agreement. He plans to introduce legislation during the first legislative session of 2013 and increase funding for SETEC to support the transition to the new system. The Mexican Congress is also working on legislation to restrict preventive detention for organized crime cases. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto aims to establish a new unified penal code and code of criminal procedure at the federal level in Mexico, following the Pact for Mexico agreement. Legislation is being introduced to restrict preventive detention for organized crime cases. Reforms have progressed in many Mexican states, with 22 out of 32 states enacting new criminal procedure codes by December 2012. Nayarit and the Federal District are the only entities without a reform bill in their legislatures as of October 2012. According to Professor Matthew Ingram, 12 states have started implementing the new judicial system by December 2012, with most states following Chihuahua's lead. Chihuahua is seen as a model state for its swift implementation of criminal procedure code reforms. Despite some delays in other states like Durango and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Chihuahua completed its transition to the new system in about two and a half years. The new judicial system has been implemented in several states, with positive effects on key indicators such as reduced pre-trial detention rates and increased efficiency in resolving criminal cases. States like Chihuahua, Oaxaca, and Zacatecas have shown significant improvements under the new system. The new judicial system in reform states has reduced case resolution time significantly compared to non-reform states. Alternative Dispute Resolution settlements are successful, freeing up courts for serious crimes. Public defenders have a more prominent role, and judges are present at trials, unlike in non-reform states where victims report judges' absence at initial hearings. The implementation of judicial reforms at the state level in Mexico has faced challenges due to a lack of federal guidance and communication with the public. Some justice operators oppose the reforms, fearing a loss of power. Limited federal funds have hindered the construction of new courts and infrastructure. The implementation of judicial reforms in Mexico has faced challenges at the state level, including reluctance from some governors to invest in new court systems and concerns about being perceived as too lenient on crime. Some state legislatures have even rolled back aspects of the reform. Operational challenges have also been observed in states that have adopted the new system. The court systems in some states are overwhelmed due to a reluctance to use plea bargaining and alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Weak police and prosecutorial capacity, along with institutions not working together, have led to low conviction rates. Courts struggle to handle serious crimes, with Chihuahua processing only a few hundred homicide cases annually. The prosecution rate for homicide has declined in recent years. Surveys show a need for more public awareness and outreach to justice sector operators on the reasons for the reforms. The general public expressed concerns about the effects of reforms on violence and criminality, with justice sector officials divided on their effectiveness. Public focus was more on protecting victims' rights and ensuring punishment for guilty criminals rather than on the rights of the accused. A survey showed low faith in the criminal justice system and lack of awareness about the 2008 judicial reforms in Chihuahua and Morelos. In Chihuahua and Morelos, where the new justice system has been implemented, there is still a lack of awareness among respondents. Despite this, 80% believe the new system will function better than the old one. However, there is a perception that the new system favors the accused over victims, with concerns about impartial treatment and slower processes. Access to the justice system and professionalism of officials are also highlighted as areas needing improvement. A majority of justice sector operators support the 2008 judicial reforms, with concerns about pressure from foreign entities. While 70% believe the reforms will reduce corruption, opinions are divided on their impact on criminality. The importance of oral trials and alternative dispute resolution is widely recognized. Mexico's federal structure complicates its transition to an accusatorial system, but some see federalism as an advantage for judicial reform. With middle-income status, Mexico can scale up U.S.-funded efforts if it prioritizes reform. USAID has increased support for judicial reform in Mexico since the late 1990s. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a bilateral security effort, received $1.9 billion from FY2008-FY2012 for judicial reform in Mexico. The strategy now focuses on disrupting criminal groups, institutionalizing the rule of law, building a modern border, and strengthening communities. Funding for judicial reform in Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative has increased significantly, with $590.5 million out of $1.9 billion going towards supporting security forces. However, it is challenging to determine the exact amount allocated for judicial reform. Deliveries for judicial reform support totaled $146.2 million as of November 2012, excluding an additional $104 million administered by USAID. Congressional appropriators have emphasized the importance of U.S. agencies supporting judicial reform as part of broader justice sector reform efforts in Mexico. Justice sector reform efforts in Mexico have been a priority for congressional appropriators, with funding earmarked for transitioning to an accusatory system. Congress has increased funding for rule of law programs and conditioned assistance on enforcing prohibitions against evidence obtained through torture. U.S. programming is now focused on supporting Mexico's transition to an oral, accusatorial justice system and addressing institutional weaknesses in its justice sector institutions. U.S. assistance in Mexico focuses on helping the government adopt legislative frameworks, providing training for justice sector operators, building support in civil society, addressing institutional problems, improving analytic capacity, expanding access to justice, and victims' assistance. Future assistance may target changing incentive structures, policies, and cultures within institutions to enhance the effectiveness of reforms. The U.S. rule of law programs in Mexico are implemented by the State Department, DOJ, and USAID. INL leads funding for law enforcement and anti-corruption efforts, while DOJ and USAID focus on justice reform. Training and equipment support have expanded to state-level academies in Chihuahua, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Puebla, and Sonora. State Department funding enhances forensic capacities. The State Department, DOJ, and USAID are involved in rule of law programs in Mexico. DOJ administers $46 million in funding for training and equipment to enhance forensic capacities and support justice reform. Project Diamante trained prosecutors, investigators, and forensic experts to work together. In August 2012, Project Diamante trained 7,700 PGR prosecutors, investigators, and forensic experts to work together in the inquisitorial system and prepare for the transition to an accusatorial system. Over 200 instructors were also established. Recently, the DOJ initiated a training program in Puerto Rico for Mexican federal judges to educate them on the benefits of the accusatory system. The future of DOJ programming in Mexico may hinge on Mexico's Attorney General Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam. The future of DOJ programming in Mexico may depend on Mexico's Attorney General Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam embracing the Diamante model. Some states are interested in replicating DOJ training at the state level for federal officials. USAID has focused on supporting justice reform at the state level and strengthening SETEC and ProV\u00edctima. They have been supporting code reform, judicial exchanges, alternative dispute resolution, and training justice sector operators in five Mexican states since 2004. USAID has been supporting justice reform efforts in five Mexican states since 2004, with a focus on training and mentoring law enforcement and attorney generals. They have allocated roughly $104 million in FY2008-FY2012 M\u00e9rida assistance to support comprehensive judicial reform programs in seven states. Additionally, USAID has provided assistance with legislation drafting and policy changes in four other states, as well as support to the American Bar Association to update curriculums and professional standards in Mexican law schools and bar associations. The goal is to strike a balance between demonstrating the merits of the new criminal justice system in key states and helping Mexico reach its 2016 implementation targets. USAID is expanding its programs into 20 states in Mexico to provide assistance for judicial reform. The success of these reforms depends on the Mexican government and society prioritizing them. U.S. assistance will be influenced by Mexico's commitment to judicial reform. During his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State John Kerry pledged to protect U.S. assistance for judicial reform in Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. If Mexico fails to prioritize judicial reforms, Congress may reconsider funding for such programs. Congressional funding and oversight of judicial reform in Mexico could continue for several years if reforms progress. Congress may question how funding for judicial reform aligns with President Obama's FY2014 budget request for Mexico. The new criminal justice system in Mexico is being evaluated for its effectiveness in convicting DTO leaders and corrupt politicians. Congress may need to balance funding decisions to ensure flexibility while retaining control over spending. They may also consider how assistance for judicial reform is divided between federal and state level efforts. Additionally, Congress may examine how U.S. agencies are managing the implementation of reforms. The State Department used INCLE funding to promote the award-winning documentary film, Presumed Guilty, which helped galvanize support for reforms in Mexico. Congress is closely monitoring human rights conditions and the implementation of the new criminal justice system in Mexico. They may also consider expanding support for culture of lawfulness programs to educate Mexican society on upholding the rule of law. Some urge Congress to make future aid conditions more specific, such as requiring Mexico to videotape confessions to prevent torture. Others prefer stricter enforcement of current conditions. Congress may also assess the allocation of assistance to key actors in the criminal justice system. At the federal level, questions arise about the coordination of U.S. assistance between different entities like the Federal Police and penitentiary system. Congressional scrutiny of U.S. programs in Mexico may increase as foreign aid budgets tighten. Past criticisms have led to adjustments in indicators and the establishment of a Metrics Office in Mexico City by USAID and the State Department. The Department is establishing a Metrics Office in Mexico City to develop indicators for ROL programs. The results may be useful for congressional appropriators overseeing current programs and considering future support for judicial reform in Mexico. Policy experts recommend hastening implementation of judicial reforms enacted in 2008 to make the system more transparent, efficient, and impartial. Implementation has lagged at the federal level and faced challenges in states. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government and state governments in Mexico are facing challenges in advancing judicial reform. Congress is closely monitoring their actions as they consider future support for Mexico's justice sector programs."
