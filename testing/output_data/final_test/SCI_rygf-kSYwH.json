    "content": "This paper introduces bsuite, a collection of experiments for studying reinforcement learning agents. The goal is to provide clear, informative problems that capture key issues in learning algorithms and to analyze agent behavior. The library is open source, written in Python, and includes examples with OpenAI Baselines and Dopamine. The aim is to facilitate reproducible research in RL and improve learning algorithms. The reinforcement learning (RL) problem involves an agent maximizing cumulative reward by interacting with an environment. Unlike other control branches, the environment dynamics are not fully known but can be learned through experience. An efficient RL agent must address challenges of generalization, exploration, and long-term consequences. The goal is to incorporate more experiments from the research community and periodically review bsuite. The promise of reinforcement learning lies in agents that can solve a wide range of important problems, potentially achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Recent interest in artificial intelligence has been fueled by innovations in image recognition and advancements in RL systems, from mastering Atari games to competing with professional players at DOTA. The next great challenges for reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence include understanding the scalability of algorithms, performance in different environments, and key issues in designing a general intelligence system. While RL agents have shown success in mastering games like Go, their performance in tasks like driving a car or managing a power plant is uncertain. Enhancing our understanding is crucial for further advancements in the field. Continuing to enhance our understanding of reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for tackling important problems. The success of RL algorithms is built upon theoretical foundations like gradient descent and temporal difference learning. Good theory provides insight and a path for general improvements. Theory often lags behind practice, especially in challenging problems like deep RL with nonlinear function approximation. Practical progress should not be avoided while waiting for full theoretical understanding. The development of algorithms and theory should progress together, enriching each other with insights. The evolution of neural network research, or deep learning, illustrates how theory and practice can develop together. Key ideas for deep learning have been around for years before the modern deep learning explosion. Techniques with complex and non-convex loss functions were outside the scope of developed learning theory, leading to a 'neural network winter'. Convex methods dominated until deep learning methods demonstrated their capabilities in benchmark problems, particularly in image recognition. In this paper, the Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning (bsuite) is introduced as a collection of experiments to highlight agent scalability. These experiments aim to bridge theory and practice by addressing fundamental issues like 'exploration' and 'memory' in a testable manner. The development of measurable and falsifiable hypotheses is emphasized for the advancement of theory in deep reinforcement learning. The bsuite is a collection of experiments that aim to address key challenges in reinforcement learning. It serves as a tool to develop measurable hypotheses and drive progress in the field. The experiments are continuously reviewed by a committee to ensure their quality and relevance. The Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning, known as bsuite, offers diagnostic experiments to gain insight into agent behavior. Similar to the MNIST dataset for image recognition, bsuite aims to provide targeted experiments for developing key RL capabilities. This approach is inspired by the Mixed Integer Programming Library (MIPLIB) in the field of mixed integer programming, where algorithmic advances often surpass theoretical analysis. The bsuite project aims to provide targeted experiments for reinforcement learning research, similar to how MIPLIB serves as a benchmark for algorithmic advances in mixed integer programming. The project includes canonical implementations of experiments, reference implementations of RL algorithms, and facilitates reproducible research in the field. The Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning (bsuite) offers reinforcement learning algorithms, example usage with 'OpenAI Gym', launch scripts for Google cloud, a ready-made Jupyter notebook with analyses, and an automated L A T E X appendix. It aims to provide value to the RL research community by highlighting bottlenecks in algorithms and revealing properties outside current analytical techniques, separate from large-scale engineering challenges. The Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning (bsuite) aids in conducting clear and unified experiments in RL research, addressing reproducibility issues. It aligns with the history of RL benchmarks, such as 'CartPole' and 'MountainCar', which have been crucial in algorithm development and testing. Diagnostic environments like 'RiverSwim' have also been instrumental in studying specific learning algorithm capabilities. The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and other projects have driven progress in deep RL by providing complex benchmark problems in various domains like Atari 2600 games, continuous control, model-based RL, and 3D games. These environments require the integration of core agent capabilities and serve as successors to simpler benchmarks like 'CartPole' and 'MountainCar'. The Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning (bsuite) offers a new approach to benchmarking in RL, focusing on specific agent evaluation methodologies, isolating core capabilities with 'unit tests', emphasizing scalability over final performance, and varying complexity smoothly. This contrasts with existing benchmarks like ALE, which integrate general learning ability and increase complexity over time. The Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning (bsuite) experiments focus on varying complexity smoothly and emphasize ease of use and compatibility with RL agents. Experiments consist of environments, interaction regimes, and analysis procedures with a 'score' for agent comparison. The Jupyter notebook provides detailed analysis for each experiment. The bsuite experiments focus on measuring behavioural aspects of RL agents to easily compare results across different algorithms. Each experiment targets a key issue in RL and embodies five key qualities: targeted, simple, clear, reliable, and fast. Internal aspects of agents are not part of the standard analysis. The bsuite experiments aim to address key issues in RL by simplifying research, challenging agents, providing insights on scalability, and enabling fast iteration. Future improvements will focus on enhancing the Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning by replacing experiments with better variants and expanding the scope of issues considered. Detailed reviews of specific experiments like 'memory length' and 'deep sea' showcase the value of bsuite as a tool for investigating core RL. Full experiment descriptions are available on github.com/anon/bsuite. The bsuite experiments simplify research in RL and compare baseline algorithms like DQN, A2C, and Bootstrapped DQN. The open-source effort includes full code for these agents. Memory is crucial for learning systems, but defining it rigorously can be challenging. Different types of memory are handled by distinct brain regions. In the context of memory and learning systems, bsuite conducts simple behavioral experiments to test an agent's ability to remember sequential steps in a T-maze environment. The experiment, called memory length, assesses how many steps an agent can remember a single bit. The environment is parameterized by a length N, with each episode lasting N steps. The reward is based on the agent's action in the final step. The bsuite experiment evaluates agent performance on memory length tasks with sizes N = 1 to 100, measuring regret after 10k episodes. The summary 'score' indicates the percentage of runs with regret less than 75% of a random policy. Memory length tests an agent's ability to use memory over multiple timesteps, providing a high-level comparison of performance. Actor-critic with a recurrent neural network outperforms feedforward models in Figure 2a. The actor-critic with a recurrent neural network outperforms feedforward models in memory tasks, showing superior performance for N \u2264 30 and random behavior for N > 30. The RNN agent was trained with backprop-through-time with length 30, showcasing its scaling properties. The bsuite experiment provides empirical evidence of the expected scaling properties in theory for reinforcement learning tasks. The literature emphasizes the importance of deep exploration for efficient learning in reinforcement learning tasks. Behavioral experiments in bsuite highlight the necessity of efficient exploration strategies. The deep sea problem is implemented as an N \u00d7 N grid with one-hot encoding for state, where the agent descends one row per timestep from the top left corner. The deep sea problem involves an N x N grid where the agent descends one row per timestep. Each episode terminates after N steps when the agent reaches the bottom row. There is a random mapping between actions and transitions, with a small cost for moving right and a reward for moving left. The challenge lies in exploration due to the gradient of small rewards leading away from the optimal policy and the low probability of reaching the rewarding state with random actions. The experiment runs the agent on grid sizes N = 10 to 50 and measures the average regret compared to the optimal policy after 10k episodes. The summary score provides a quick way to compare agent performance in the Deep Sea bsuite experiment. It helps to evaluate the scaling properties of algorithms and compare A2C, DQN, and Bootstrapped DQN. Bootstrapped DQN performs well due to its efficient exploration capabilities. The section describes the use of bsuite in research and development of RL algorithms, presenting high-level research and engineering use cases. Examples of specific investigations using bsuite are provided in Appendixes C, D, and E, with full details and tutorials available at github.com/anon/bsuite. A bsuite experiment involves a set of environments and episodes of interaction, with automatic logging handled by bsuite when loading the environment. Running experiments with bsuite involves interacting with environments that automatically log data for analysis in a Jupyter notebook. Users can easily generate plots and analyze agent behavior by providing the path to the logged data. The notebook includes detailed descriptions, summary scores, and in-depth analysis of each experiment, with a 'radar plot' providing a snapshot of agent behavior. Replicating benchmark experiments in RL is simplified with bsuite, making it ideal for developing algorithms to tackle fundamental issues in reinforcement learning. The problems addressed by bsuite experiments are often solvable without complex neural architectures. The bsuite experiments highlight key challenges in RL and offer more than just a leaderboard ranking. They serve as a diagnostic tool for algorithm development, helping researchers test hypotheses and improve agent performance. Running experiments on bsuite can help researchers quickly diagnose key issues with their RL agents, such as identifying problems with credit assignment over long horizons. This can lead to faster and more informed agent development, similar to using a suite of tests in software development. Additionally, bsuite makes it easier to share results and engage with the research community.

The bsuite project aims to investigate core capabilities of reinforcement learning agents through carefully-designed experiments. It provides a snapshot of agent performance on bsuite2019, with implementations taken from bsuite/baselines. The report includes a brief summary of agents run on bsuite2019. The bsuite project investigates reinforcement learning agents through experiments. Agents run on bsuite2019 include random, DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and actor critic RNN. Experiment scores are aggregated and analyzed. Random performs poorly, DQN excels in basic tasks but struggles in memory and exploration. More details can be found in the Colaboratory notebook. The bsuite project aims to study reinforcement learning agents through experiments. It includes random, DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and actor critic RNN agents. Bootstrapped DQN outperforms DQN in exploration, while actor critic RNN excels in memory tasks. The bsuite project provides clear, informative benchmarks to evaluate learning algorithms efficiently. The report provides a snapshot of agent performance on bsuite2019, using different instantiations of the DQN agent with various optimizers. Each experiment tunes a learning rate to optimize performance on 'basic' tasks. The experiments output summary scores in [0, 1], which are aggregated according to key experiment types. Both RMSProp and Adam outperform SGD in all categories, with Adam slightly edging out RMSprop in most cases. SGD struggles on tasks requiring generalization and scale due to its non-adaptive nature. The differences are most noticeable in cartpole domains, suggesting the need for more efficient neural network optimization. The bsuite experiments investigate core capabilities of reinforcement learning. The bsuite project focuses on experiments to test reinforcement learning agents' core capabilities. This report presents agent performance on bsuite2019 using Bootstrapped DQN with varying ensemble sizes. Experiment results are summarized with scores ranging from 0 to 1. Increasing ensemble size improves bsuite performance, but diminishing returns are observed. Ensemble 30 does not outperform size 10. Results deviate from theoretical bounds but align with previous empirical findings. Exploration tasks benefit the most from larger ensembles, solving 'deep sea' tasks reliably. However, even large ensembles struggle with every cartpole swingup instance due to potential instability issues. Using Double DQN can help combat value overestimation issues in learning curves, as suggested by van Hasselt et al. (2016)."
