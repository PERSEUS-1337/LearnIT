The Act also addresses funding for the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program. The Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program allocates funds based on risk, considering threats, vulnerabilities, consequences, and previous attacks. High-threat areas are determined by the presence of critical infrastructure like skyscrapers. The Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program allocates funds based on risk, considering threats, vulnerabilities, consequences, and previous attacks. Critical infrastructure includes skyscrapers, large commercial buildings, transportation assets, commuting populations, national monuments, nuclear power plants, seaports, chemical facilities, military facilities, Federal facilities, dams, and nonnuclear electric power plants. The Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program allocates funds based on risk, considering threats to critical infrastructure such as skyscrapers, transportation assets, national monuments, and more. The allocation process includes evaluating threats to national monuments and icons, as well as factors like population, law enforcement activity, and tourism in high-threat areas. The Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program allows funds to be used for preventing terrorist activities and other necessary measures, without the need for peer review. The Secretary must report grant allocations to high-threat areas to Congress before finalizing them. Members of Congress representing high-threat areas must provide a report on proposed fund allocation, including analysis of critical infrastructure used for the allocation. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on the determination and evaluation of high-threat areas, including threats, vulnerabilities, consequences, and previous terrorist attacks."
