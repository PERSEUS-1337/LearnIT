    "title": "AB 557",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. A nonprofit corporation in California may face administrative dissolution if its corporate powers are suspended or forfeited by the Franchise Tax Board for 48 continuous months. The corporation must be notified before the dissolution process begins. The Franchise Tax Board notifies nonprofit corporations or foreign corporations meeting certain requirements before administrative dissolution or surrender. If the corporation's address is not valid, notice from the Franchise Tax Board is sufficient. The Board also provides the Secretary of State and the Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts with relevant information. The Secretary of State provides 60 days' notice of pending administrative dissolution or surrender on its website, including instructions for objections. Nonprofit or foreign corporations can submit a written objection to the Franchise Tax Board, who will notify the Secretary of State. If no written objection is received within 60 days, the nonprofit or foreign corporation will be administratively dissolved or surrendered as per the Secretary of State's certificate. If a nonprofit corporation or foreign corporation submits a written objection to administrative dissolution or surrender within 60 days, they have an additional 90 days to settle taxes, penalties, file a Statement of Information. If conditions are met, the dissolution or surrender will be canceled; if not, it will proceed after 90 days. Upon administrative dissolution or surrender, a nonprofit or foreign corporation's liabilities for taxes, interest, and penalties will be abated. The Franchise Tax Board may extend the 90-day period once. Any actions to collect the abated liability will be terminated, and any erroneously received amounts may be refunded. Upon administrative dissolution or surrender, a nonprofit or foreign corporation's liabilities for taxes, interest, and penalties will be abated. The liability to creditors, directors, or related persons is not discharged. The Attorney General's ability to enforce liabilities is not affected. Section 6610.5 of the Corporations Code allows for a certificate of dissolution to be filed by a majority of directors or incorporators if a corporation has not issued any memberships within 24 months of incorporating, and has no debts or liabilities except as specified. The corporation can file a certificate of dissolution if it meets certain criteria, including satisfying tax liabilities, filing a final franchise tax return, stating it was created in error, and distributing remaining assets as required by law. Upon meeting specific criteria, a corporation can file a certificate of dissolution, including returning payments for memberships if issued, notifying relevant authorities, and ceasing all powers, rights, and privileges upon filing. Section 8610.5 allows for the dissolution of a corporation without issued memberships by a majority of directors or incorporators within 24 months of incorporation. Liability to creditors and directors' responsibilities remain even after dissolution. The Attorney General can still enforce liabilities as per the law. The corporation must ensure that it has no debts or liabilities, except as specified. The tax liability should be settled or assumed by another entity. A final franchise tax return must be filed, and if the corporation was created in error, it should be dissolved. The corporation can be dissolved if it was created in error, its assets have been distributed as required by law, a majority of directors or incorporators authorized the dissolution, no memberships have been issued, and any payments for memberships have been returned. Upon filing a certificate of dissolution, a corporation shall cease to exist, and its liabilities to creditors and directors are not discharged. The Attorney General retains the ability to enforce liabilities as provided by law. Section 9680.5 of the Corporations Code allows for the dissolution of a corporation without memberships by a majority of directors or incorporators signing a certificate stating the corporation has no debts, except as specified. Upon filing this certificate, the corporation ceases to exist, and liabilities to creditors and directors remain enforceable by the Attorney General. The corporation can be dissolved without memberships by a majority of directors or incorporators signing a certificate stating no debts exist. The certificate must include provisions such as tax liability satisfaction, filing a final franchise tax return, error in corporation creation, and distribution of remaining assets as required by law. Upon a majority decision by directors or incorporators, a certificate of dissolution must be signed and filed with the Secretary of State. The corporation's dissolution is confirmed, and its powers, rights, and privileges cease. The dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not discharge its liability to creditors or the liability of directors. The Attorney General can still enforce liabilities. The Franchise Tax Board can abate unpaid taxes for years when the corporation was not doing business. A qualified nonprofit corporation, as defined in the Corporations Code, must meet specific conditions to maintain its tax-exempt status, including previous compliance with tax authorities or non-business operations in the state. The qualified corporation must prove cessation of business operations when requesting abatement for unpaid qualified taxes, interest, and penalties. The abatement is contingent on the corporation dissolving within 12 months of filing the request. If the qualified corporation does not dissolve within 12 months of requesting abatement or resumes business operations, the abatement of taxes, interest, and penalties will be canceled. The Franchise Tax Board will establish necessary rules to implement this section. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution. The costs incurred by local agencies or school districts will be due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
