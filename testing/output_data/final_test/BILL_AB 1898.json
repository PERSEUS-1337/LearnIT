    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12804.9 of the Vehicle Code is amended to include a comprehensive examination for applicants, covering knowledge of highway operation laws, safe overtaking and passing, English comprehension of traffic signs, and understanding of traffic signals and control devices. An applicant must demonstrate their ability to operate a motor vehicle under supervision of an examining officer to obtain a driver's license. The driving test may be waived for applicants with a valid out-of-state license if no issues are found in their driving record. The examining officer may also request proof of financial responsibility for the vehicle before the demonstration. The examining officer may refuse to examine an applicant who cannot provide proof of financial responsibility for the vehicle, unless not required by this code. The applicant's mental and physical fitness to operate a motor vehicle is tested, including hearing and eyesight, to determine if they meet the requirements for a driver's license. Before issuing or renewing a class A or class B driver's license, or a class C driver's license with a commercial endorsement, the applicant must have a valid medical examination report from a licensed health care professional within the last two years. The health care professional must be qualified to perform the required medical examination for motor carrier drivers as mandated by the United States Department of Transportation. The report for driver's license renewal must be on an approved form by the Department of Transportation, considering standards required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The department may accept a federal waiver of physical qualification standards for driver's licenses if accompanied by a nonqualifying medical examination report. A physical defect that is compensated for to ensure safe driving ability will not prevent license issuance. Applicants must undergo an examination appropriate to the type of vehicle they wish to drive. Class A includes vehicles such as those towing over 10,000 pounds, multiple vehicles being towed, trailer buses, and all vehicles under Class B and C. Class B includes single vehicles over 26,000 pounds, single vehicles with three or more axles, buses over 26,000 pounds (excluding trailer buses), and farm labor vehicles. Class C includes vehicles like two-axle vehicles under 26,000 pounds, house cars under 40 feet in length, and three-axle vehicles under 6,000 pounds gross weight. A person driving a vehicle may not tow another vehicle in violation of Section 21715. A two-axle vehicle weighing 4,000 pounds or more unladen can tow a fifth-wheel travel trailer between 10,000 and 15,000 pounds without compensation, after passing a specialized written examination. This endorsement can be added to a class C license. Additionally, a vehicle or combination of vehicles weighing 26,000 pounds or less can be operated if specific conditions are met. The Class C license includes vehicles operated by farmers, used for agricultural operations, not for hire, and excludes motorcycles. Class M1 allows operation of two-wheel motorcycles and motor-driven cycles with endorsement on Class A, B, or C licenses. Class M2 includes motorized bicycles, mopeds, bicycles with attached motors, and motorized scooters. Authorization to operate Class M2 vehicles can be added to a Class A, B, or C license through an examination, except for motorized scooters. Holders of a Class M1 license can operate Class M2 vehicles without further testing. A driver's license is not valid for operating commercial motor vehicles or vehicles requiring a driver certificate unless a valid medical certificate is on file with the department. Otherwise, the license is only valid for operating non-commercial class C vehicles and non-commercial class M1 or M2 vehicles with the appropriate endorsement. A license or driver certificate issued before Chapter 7 (Section 15200) remains valid for specified vehicles until expiration or suspension. A valid medical certificate is required for renewal or replacement of a commercial vehicle license. The department may accept a certificate of driving skill or competence in place of a driving test for certain license applications, if the applicant meets other examination requirements. The certificate must be issued by an employer or law enforcement agency for the specific type of vehicle being applied for. (g) The department may accept a certificate of completion from a novice motorcyclist training program approved by the commissioner instead of a driving test for class M1 or M2 license applications, if all other examination requirements are met. The program's written and driving tests must be approved by the department. \n(h) A person with a valid California driver's license can operate a short-term rental motorized bicycle without a special examination or a class M2 endorsement, for rentals lasting 48 hours or less. (i) Individuals under 21 must complete a motorcycle safety training program to get a class M1 or M2 license. (j) Vanpool drivers need a class C license and a medical exam proof for a class B license. They must also have a signed statement confirming no recent convictions for reckless driving, drunk driving, or hit-and-run offenses."
