    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Outer Continental Shelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005\". It pertains to revenue sharing from the outer continental shelf. Section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1356a) is amended to redefine the term 'producing State' to include any State that begins production on a leased tract after the enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005, regardless of leasing moratoriums. Section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to redefine the term 'producing State' to include any State that begins production on a leased tract after the enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005. This involves striking subparagraph (C) in paragraph (9) and subparagraph (E) in subsection (b)(4). Establishment of seaward lateral boundaries for coastal states. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to require the Secretary to delineate lateral boundaries for coastal states within 180 days of the enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005. This is crucial for determining leasing activities, attributing revenues, and calculating payments to producing States and coastal political subdivisions. The Secretary must delineate lateral boundaries between coastal States on the Outer Continental Shelf in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This does not impact any rights or titles to Federal submerged land on the outer Continental Shelf. Option to petition for leasing within certain areas on the Outer Continental Shelf. Section 12 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include leasing within specific areas of coastal states, including California, Oregon, Washington, the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Straits of Florida. The Secretary is restricted from offering offshore leasing in certain areas, including marine sanctuaries and affected areas until June 30, 2012. Resource assessments will be conducted once seaward lateral boundaries are delineated. The Secretary can delineate seaward lateral boundaries, and a Governor can request a resource assessment for areas within those boundaries for oil and gas leasing, gas-only leasing, or other energy sources, including renewable energy, with legislative consent. The Secretary must act on the petition within 90 days. The Secretary must approve a petition unless it poses a risk to the environment. If the Secretary fails to act, the petition is considered approved, and a resource assessment will be conducted promptly. After a petition is approved, the Secretary must complete a resource assessment for the area and submit it to the State. The Governor of a State may then request the Secretary to make available land within the seaward lateral boundaries of the State for leasing. The Secretary must approve a petition for offshore leasing activities within 20 miles of the State's coastline, unless there is a risk of harm to the environment. The Secretary's failure to approve or deny a petition results in automatic approval, allowing for oil and gas leasing in the area. States will share in offshore production revenues without needing further appropriation. States will not be required to comply with certain sections of the law to share in offshore production revenues, with at least 25 percent of revenues to be used for specified purposes. This subsection does not impact rights related to specific areas. The subsection exempts states from certain law requirements for sharing offshore production revenues related to existing leases. SEC. 5. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of the Interior will issue regulations to implement the Act, including procedures for gas-only leases under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Gas-only leases will not be available in states without affected areas, and \"natural gas\" will be defined as unmixed natural gas or any mixture of natural or artificial gas. The Secretary of the Interior will issue regulations to implement the Act, including procedures for gas-only leases under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Gas-only leases will not be available in states without affected areas, and \"natural gas\" will be defined as unmixed natural gas or any mixture of natural or artificial gas, including compressed or liquefied petroleum gas and condensate recovered from natural gas."
