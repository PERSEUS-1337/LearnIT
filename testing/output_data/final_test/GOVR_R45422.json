    "content": "The United States has been a key player in global efforts to combat hunger and improve food security since the passage of the Food for Peace Act in 1954. The Food for Peace program aimed to provide food to undernourished populations abroad, reduce U.S. surplus grains, and expand markets for U.S. food commodities. Over time, the focus has shifted towards emergency response and supporting agriculture markets in recipient countries. In 2018, the U.S. provided food assistance to those affected by flooding in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, food assistance targeted flood victims and refugees from neighboring countries like South Sudan. U.S. food assistance programs have evolved from in-kind aid to include cash-based assistance. Feed the Future initiative aligns non-emergency food assistance with agricultural and global health programs. U.S. law mandates international food assistance primarily through in-kind aid. This report provides an overview of U.S. international food assistance programs, including authorizing legislation, historical funding trends, and common program features and requirements. It also discusses issues for congressional consideration and recent legislative proposals. The report focuses on international food assistance programs that currently receive funding from Congress. The FFPA authorizes traditional food assistance programs funded by Congress through periodic farm bills. These programs include FFP Title II, FFP Title V, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, and Food for Progress. The Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) was permanently authorized as part of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Global Food Security Act of 2016. These programs fall under the jurisdiction of various congressional committees. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implement international food assistance programs. USDA procures commodities for all food assistance programs, regardless of which agency implements the program. Key participants in delivering international food assistance include NGOs, IOs, and the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a government-owned financial institution overseen by USDA that procures commodities and finances domestic and international programs to support U.S. agriculture. The U.S. government provides food assistance through in-kind contributions and cash-based assistance, including monetization and direct cash transfers or food vouchers to beneficiaries. Under local and regional procurement (LRP), NGOs or IOs purchase food in the country or region where it is to be distributed to beneficiaries rather than in the United States. The Obama Administration created Feed the Future (FTF) in 2010 to improve U.S. international food security efforts by uniting all food-security related programs under common goals and evaluation criteria. FTF focuses on long-term food security and coordinates non-emergency food assistance activities such as McGovern-Dole, Food for Progress, Farmer-to-Farmer, and non-emergency assistance provided under FFP Title II. Non-emergency food assistance programs under FTF also collaborate with global health and agricultural development programs and submit data to joint evaluations. Under FFP Title II, the federal government donates U.S.-sourced commodities to NGOs or IOs for distribution to beneficiaries or monetization for development projects. Title II funds are primarily used for emergency assistance, with 76% allocated to emergencies in FY2017. USAID administers FFP Title II, NGOs and IOs apply to implement projects, and USDA procures commodities for shipment. The Farmer-to-Farmer program, established in 1985, receives discretionary funding tied to Food for Peace programs. Minimum funding levels have been periodically updated in farm bills, with the 2014 bill authorizing a minimum of $15 million or 0.6% of funds appropriated. Congress provided $15 million per year from FY2014 to FY2017 for the program, which works with USAID to arrange commodity shipments by ocean freight in accordance with agricultural cargo preference laws. The Farmer-to-Farmer program, funded at $15 million per year from FY2014 to FY2017 by Congress, is administered by USAID. It arranges short-term volunteer placements in developing countries for technical assistance to farmers. Volunteers are U.S. citizens from farming, agribusiness, universities, and nonprofits, selected by eligible NGOs based on needs. The program does not provide food assistance but is part of the suite of programs authorized by the FFPA. The McGovern-Dole program, established in the 2002 farm bill, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and education for children through school meals. It also provides assistance to pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children. The program encourages countries to establish national school feeding programs and prioritizes countries based on income, literacy, and malnutrition rates. In recent years, it has been authorized to use LRP in addition to in-kind aid. In recent years, the McGovern-Dole program has been authorized to use LRP in addition to in-kind aid. Congress authorized funds for LRP activities within existing projects, with up to $10 million allocated in FY2018. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) was established in 1998 to supplement FFP Title II when emergency food needs in developing countries cannot be met solely by FFP Title II funds. The USDA administers the BEHT, which holds U.S. commodities or funds that can be released to address food emergencies. Congress reimburses the CCC for released commodities through FFPA or direct appropriations. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) was established in 1998 to supplement Food for Progress (FFP) Title II when emergency food needs in developing countries cannot be met solely by FFP Title II funds. BEHT holds funds that were used in FY2014 to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities for FFP Title II projects in South Sudan. Under the Food for Progress program, USDA donates U.S. agricultural commodities to partner organizations for development projects focusing on improving agricultural productivity. In FY2017, USDA funded seven Food for Progress projects in nine countries, relying entirely on CCC financing. The program must provide a minimum of 400,000 mt of commodities annually, but actual totals have been lower in recent years. Statute limits the program to pay no more than $40 million annually for freight costs. EFSP is a cash-based program administered by USAID to provide disaster assistance in conflict zones like Syria. Congress permanently authorized EFSP in 2016 and funds it through the International Disaster Assistance account. U.S. international food assistance programs, including the Food for Peace Title II program and cash-based Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP), have seen fluctuations in outlays over the past decade. Outlays increased in response to global crises like the food price crisis of 2007-2008, conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. EFSP assistance has grown from 10% to 30% of total international food assistance between FY2010 and FY2016, while the share of Title II assistance decreased from 75% to 57%. Common features and requirements of these programs include agricultural cargo preference restrictions and commodity sourcing requirements. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 and the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 mandate that at least 50% of U.S. agricultural commodities provided under food aid programs must ship via U.S.-flag vessels. This requirement, known as agricultural cargo preference (ACP), aims to support U.S. commercial shipping. Under agricultural cargo preference (ACP), qualifying U.S.-flag ships must be privately owned and have a crew of at least 75% U.S. citizens. ACP applies to all in-kind aid provided under international food aid programs, but not to cash-based assistance. The requirement for agricultural commodities distributed under food assistance programs to be produced in the United States has some exceptions. The requirement for agricultural commodities distributed under food assistance programs to be produced in the United States has exceptions. Food assistance provided under the LRP program, EFSP, and other food assistance authorized in the FAA are exempt. FFPA Section 202(e) allows a portion of FFP Title II funds to be used for storage, transportation, and administrative costs, including cash-based assistance. Foreign governments, NGOs, or IOs receiving U.S. commodities must publicize that they are provided through the friendship of the American people. The International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1977 amended the FFPA to prohibit the use of U.S. commodities for international food assistance in recipient countries lacking adequate storage facilities or where distribution would hinder domestic agricultural production. Cooperating organizations must conduct a \"Bellmon analysis\" to assess storage capabilities. The amendment to the FFPA assesses recipient countries' storage facilities and potential interference with their agricultural economy. An amendment to the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for activities that could compete with U.S. agricultural products. Exceptions include food security, research benefiting U.S. producers, and activities in countries recovering from conflict or crisis. FFP Title II assistance has additional specific requirements. The United States primarily provides international food aid through in-kind commodities, supporting American jobs and companies. However, other major donor countries have shifted to cash-based assistance. U.S. use of cash-based aid has increased recently, particularly under EFSP and to support LRP in the McGovern-Dole program. In-kind aid also promotes goodwill through the visibility of U.S. labeled food products. Proponents argue that in-kind food aid with U.S. labels fosters goodwill and is suitable when local food availability is limited. In 2012, during a drought in Africa, USAID provided in-kind aid, allowing farmers to focus on crops. Prepositioning food in warehouses shortens delivery time frames by one to two months compared to standard methods. Critics note that in-kind aid takes longer to reach recipients than cash-based assistance. In-kind aid delivery can be slower than cash-based assistance, with additional costs for prepositioning and limited supply of commodities. In some cases, in-kind aid may not provide adequate nutrition, leading to micronutrient deficiencies. There are challenges with quality control in the food aid supply chain, including instances of contamination. Critics argue that specialized, nutrient-dense food products are costly and difficult to direct to intended recipients. Critics argue that in-kind aid can be challenging to deliver in areas with geographic and security obstacles, leading to theft of food aid near conflict zones. Cash-based assistance is necessary for feeding dispersed Syrian refugees and preventing market disruptions. Cash-based assistance, including direct cash transfers, food vouchers, and LRP, offers quicker response times than in-kind aid, especially in emergencies. It is also cost-effective, with potential savings varying based on destination and commodity prices. Research shows that LRP can arrive 14-16 weeks sooner than in-kind aid, and GAO reports that LRP costs 25% less on average. Additionally, cash-based assistance can better meet local dietary preferences and support local agricultural markets and producers. According to USAID, cash-based assistance is suitable for situations where people are spread out, mobile, or face security concerns. Cost differences between LRP and in-kind aid vary based on the commodity, with LRP being less costly for bulk cereals and beans but more expensive for processed foods. However, using LRP in food-deficit regions could lead to price spikes or limited food access due to local unavailability and infrastructure limitations. Critics argue that lack of reliable suppliers and poor infrastructure can hinder the efficiency of LRP. Critics of cash-based assistance raise concerns about fraud, theft, and inadequate risk assessments in EFSP projects. They also argue that local foods may not provide sufficient nutrition for highly vulnerable populations. Providing fortified or specialized in-kind foods may be preferable in cases of acute malnutrition. Cash-based assistance could potentially undermine the coalition advocating for food aid funding. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 mandates that 50-75% of U.S. food aid commodities must ship on U.S.-flag vessels to sustain a U.S.-flag merchant marine. Maintaining a U.S.-flag fleet through cargo preference is cost-effective and aims to provide sealift capability in wartime and protect U.S. ocean commerce. Maintaining a U.S.-flag fleet and supply of U.S. mariners through cargo preference is cost-effective and critical for financial viability. While there are enough mariners for initial activation, sustained activation beyond 180 days is challenging due to higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag vessels. The higher costs for U.S.-flag vessels compared to foreign-flag vessels are attributed to better working conditions and higher wages. This leads to increased shipping costs, potentially reducing food aid volume and aid recipients. USAID officials stated that a $40 million increase in shipping costs results in one million fewer recipients receiving food aid annually. Opponents of ACP question its contributions to U.S. sealift capacity, citing increased costs and delays in food aid transportation on vessels not designed for bulk cargo. Concerns were raised about the appearance and health of food transported on vessels typically used for oil or fuel. Critics argue that ACP benefits foreign shipping companies over U.S. ones, with studies showing that most ACP vessels do not meet military criteria. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the American Cargo Preference (ACP) program increased the cost of shipping food aid by 23% from 2011 to 2014, totaling $107 million. The Department of Defense's sealift capacity contributions from ACP were uncertain, as the reserve fleet was not activated during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) had not fully assessed the availability of U.S. mariners for a prolonged activation. In 2018, GAO analyzed a report on mariner availability, which highlighted a shortage for sustained operations with data limitations causing uncertainty. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress proposed changes to U.S. international food assistance programs during the 115th Congress. The Administration suggested reorganizing funding, eliminating the McGovern-Dole program and FFP Title II. Members of Congress proposed changes in various bills, including the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act of 2017 and the Food for Peace Modernization Act. The Trump Administration proposed changes to international food assistance programs, including reallocating funding and eliminating the McGovern-Dole program and FFP Title II. Congress did not enact these proposals but instead increased funding for various programs. In the FY2019 budget request, the Administration repeated its proposals to eliminate McGovern-Dole and FFP Title II funding and consolidate all food assistance through the IDA subaccount, which would result in a 17% decrease in funding from FY2018 levels. The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 5961 in May 2018, decreasing FFP funding by $100 million and maintaining McGovern-Dole funding at FY2018 levels. The Senate approved H.R. 6147 in August 2018, maintaining FFP funding and increasing McGovern-Dole funding by $2.6 million. President Trump signed a continuing resolution (P.L. 115-245) in September 2018, funding agriculture programs until December 7, 2018. Both the House and Senate passed farm bills in June 2018, making changes to U.S. international food assistance programs. The bills would amend FFP Title II by removing the requirement to monetize 15% of non-emergency commodities and increase the minimum annual funding allocation to $365 million. They would also include outlays for food security activities and Farmer-to-Farmer programs. The bills would amend the McGovern-Dole program to coincide assistance with the school year and authorize USDA to provide locally and regionally procured foods. Up to 10% of funds could be used for this purpose. The Senate bill proposes amendments to the McGovern-Dole and Food for Progress programs, allowing for 10% of funds to be used for locally and regionally procured foods. It also designates the Secretary of Agriculture as having program authority and allows for direct funding of food security projects in recipient countries. Reporting requirements would be amended to allow USAID and USDA to submit annual reports jointly or separately. The House bill extends the labeling requirement to food procured outside the United States. The House bill extends labeling requirements for food procured outside the United States, while the Senate bill proposes a new initiative for International Food Security Technical Assistance with $1 million in annual funding. President Trump signed the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act of 2017 into law in October 2018. The Security Reauthorization Act of 2017 reauthorizes the Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS) through 2023 with annual appropriations of $2.8 billion for EFSP and $1.0 billion for the Department of State and USAID. The Food for Peace Modernization Act introduced in 2018 aims to change FFPA requirements by reducing the share of aid that must be U.S. commodities from 100% to 25% and allowing up to 15% of food aid to be monetized. The bills S. 2551 and H.R. 5276 propose changes to international food assistance activities, including adding more committees to receive reports and emphasizing promoting agricultural-led growth in developing countries. S. 2551 is with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and H.R. 5276 is with the House Agriculture Committee."
