    "content": "Privacy of customers of broadband internet access service and other telecommunications services is addressed in this section. Privacy of customers of broadband internet access service and other telecommunications services is addressed in this section by amending Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 to include definitions for terms like 'broadband Internet access service' and 'customer.' The term 'customer proprietary information' includes identifiable network information, personally identifiable information, and communication content. 'Opt-in approval' is a method for carriers to obtain customer consent for using or disclosing their information. The term 'sensitive customer proprietary information' includes financial, health, children's information, Social Security numbers, geolocation data, communication content, call details, web browsing history, and application usage history. The Commission determines sensitive proprietary information for telecommunications services, including broadband Internet access and VoIP. Regulations will protect customer privacy by requiring carriers to notify customers about the collection and use of their information. Telecommunications carriers must notify customers about the collection, use, and sharing of customer proprietary information, including types of entities it is shared with. This notification must be provided at the point of sale and updated for any material changes to the privacy policy. The new regulations require telecommunications carriers to obtain opt-in approval from customers for using and sharing sensitive customer information, protect de-identified information, prohibit refusal of service based on consent to use customer information for commercial purposes, and implement strong privacy measures. The Federal Communications Commission must require telecommunications carriers to develop data security practices and notify customers of security breaches within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. Regulations must be promulgated under section 222(h)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure compliance."
