The Secretary shall make a $100,000 payment from the Fund to individuals with HIV or AIDS who meet certain conditions, including those who were exposed to contaminated blood or tissues in the US between July 1, 1982, and December 31, 1987, or are spouses of affected individuals. The individual can receive a $100,000 payment from the Fund if they meet certain conditions, including being the lawful spouse of someone with HIV, acquiring the infection through perinatal transmission, and submitting medical documentation of HIV infection to the Secretary.

If an individual eligible for payment under section 102(a) dies before filing a petition, a survivor may file on their behalf.
