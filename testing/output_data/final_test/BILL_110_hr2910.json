Since 2003, over 1.3 million Armed Forces members served in Iraq or Afghanistan. Veterans sacrifice their lives, families, and education to serve. In 2005, 500,000 veterans claimed education benefits. Many Armed Forces members rely on financial aid and Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college. The 6 percent interest rate cap on debts for active duty members is not applied to Federal student loans. Returning deployed members are forced to start repaying private student loans soon after returning. Members of the Armed Forces transitioning from combat to education face challenges, including bureaucracy when reenrolling. Colleges are not required to accommodate active duty students, leading to difficulties with tuition reimbursement and reenrollment requirements. Symptoms of PTSD and other injuries may take up to a year to manifest, highlighting the need for support for returning service members. Members of the Armed Forces transitioning from combat to education face challenges with reenrollment and tuition reimbursement. This Act aims to provide a 13-month transition period for them to reenroll in education programs and begin repaying student loans, with a 6 percent interest rate cap.
