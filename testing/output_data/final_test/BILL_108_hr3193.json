    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia Personal Protection Act\" and includes Congressional findings. Congress finds that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals to keep and bear arms, including law-abiding citizens in the District of Columbia who are deprived of firearms commonly used for sporting and self-defense.
