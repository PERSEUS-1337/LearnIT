    "content": "Recent congressional interest in U.S. energy policy has focused on securing more economical and reliable petroleum resources, including Canadian oil sands. Canadian oil sands make up 54% of Canada's crude oil production and are expected to increase to 4.8 mbd by 2030. Infrastructure is in place to transport the resource to the United States, but concerns about environmental impacts remain. The environmental impacts of Canadian oil sands include increased water and natural gas use, disturbance of mined land, effects on wildlife and water quality, trans-boundary air pollution, and emissions of greenhouse gases during extraction and processing. Studies show that GHG emissions per unit of energy produced from Canadian oil sands are higher than other crudes imported to the United States. Stakeholders and policymakers are concerned that the increased use of emission-intensive resources in the U.S. could have negative consequences for energy and environmental policy globally. The U.S. Department of State commissioned a contractor to analyze GHG emissions associated with the Keystone XL pipeline project in comparison to other crudes. The analysis was presented in the 2011 Final Environmental Impact Statement as a \"matter of policy.\" The initial permit for the project was denied. The Keystone XL Project's initial permit was denied due to insufficient time for a thorough review. A new permit application was filed in 2012, leading to a revised Final EIS in 2014, which assessed GHG emissions and market analysis, yielding similar findings to the 2011 EIS. The 2014 Final EIS for the Keystone XL Project reiterated findings from the 2011 EIS, stating that Canadian oil sands crudes are more GHG-intensive than other heavy crudes. Approval or denial of the project is unlikely to impact oil sands extraction rates or demand for heavy crude in the US. Critics argue that lack of transport infrastructure and price discounts are already affecting oil sands production and could further deter investment in the region. The report provides a summary of life-cycle emissions assessments of Canadian oil sands crudes and compares them with other global reference crudes and fossil fuel resources. It discusses the methodology, results of selected assessments, and tools for policymakers to analyze the potential impacts of U.S. energy policy choices on the environment. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate environmental impacts of products, such as GHG emissions from hydrocarbon resources. LCAs track carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions, expressing them as CO2e per unit of fuel. This helps assess emissions intensity at different stages of the fuel's life cycle. Life-cycle assessments (LCAs) evaluate GHG emissions intensity of fuel stages, comparing different types or production methods. LCAs use boundaries like \"cradle-to-grave\" or \"Well-to-Wheels\" for petroleum fuels. Assessments cover extraction, refining, distribution, and combustion phases. Different LCAs establish specific boundaries like Well-to-Tank (WTT) or Well-to-Refinery Gate (WTR) for emissions evaluation. Final combustion phase inclusion provides a complete picture of petroleum's GHG impact. The final combustion phase is crucial in assessing petroleum's impact on GHG emissions, contributing up to 70%-80% of WTW emissions. Different LCAs can highlight emission differences at specific stages and experiment with boundary assumptions. Factors influencing LCA results include resource composition, extraction process, design factors, and input data assumptions. The complex life cycle of hydrocarbon fuels requires careful consideration of variables and uncertainties in data. Oil sands are unconventional petroleum deposits containing bitumen, a dense form of petroleum. LCAs often do not assess raw bitumen due to its solid nature, instead, it is diluted or converted into synthetic crude oil to produce oil sands-derived crude. Different types of crude-like products can be generated from bitumen, each with varying properties compared to conventional light crude. Different types of crude-like products can be generated from bitumen, including Upgraded Bitumen (SCO) and Diluted Bitumen (Dilbit). SCO is produced through an upgrading process that converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fractions, while Dilbit is bitumen mixed with diluents to create a more easily transportable product. Refineries may need modifications to process Dilbit, shifting GHG emissions downstream. Increased processing in refineries shifts GHG emissions downstream, potentially intensifying the downstream GHG emission impact of dilbit in relation to SCO or other crudes. Synbit, a combination of bitumen and SCO, results in a product resembling conventional crude oil. Refining emissions from synbit occur both upstream and downstream. Two methods for extracting bitumen from Canadian oil sands are mining and extraction processes. Mining oil sands deposits less than 75 meters deep involves strip-mining methods, accounting for over 50% of current production. Higher GHG emissions may result from increased land use changes. In situ methods are used for deeper deposits, involving steam injection to extract bitumen. In situ methods involve injecting steam into oil sands reservoirs to decrease bitumen viscosity for extraction. This process is more GHG-intensive due to energy requirements. The industry is expected to shift towards increased in situ extraction for deep reserves. Study design factors influence GHG comparison structures and parameters in each study. Input assumptions can impact life-cycle results at each stage of the assessment for Canadian oil sands crudes. Studies often use simplified assumptions to model GHG emissions due to limited data availability and the complexity of practices used in extraction, processing, refining, and transportation. Key input assumptions include parameters such as overall purpose, time frame, life-cycle boundaries, units and metrics, GHG global-warming potential, treatment of co-products, secondary emission flows, power co-generation, and flaring, venting, and fugitive emissions. The report examines life-cycle GHG emissions data for Canadian oil sands crudes, including key input assumptions such as extraction processes, refining processes, petroleum coke production, and energy efficiencies. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are emitted during various stages of oil sands production. Studies have attempted to assess these emissions, with the U.S. Department of State and ICF International LLC analyzing life-cycle assessments in the Keystone XL Project's August 2011 Final Environmental report. The firm ICF International LLC selected studies for the Keystone XL Project based on criteria like evaluating Canadian oil sands crudes' GHG emissions impacts. The studies were used in the 2011 and 2014 Final Environmental Impact Statements. The data and results from specific studies were considered robust for inclusion in both reports. The 2014 Final EIS for the Keystone XL Project mentioned additional studies on GHG emissions from Canadian oil sands, but the focus remained on data from specific studies like AERI/Jacobs 2009 and NETL 2008/2009. The studies AERI/TIAX 2009, NETL 2008, and NETL 2009, along with the DOS/ICF meta-analysis, show that comparisons of GHG life-cycle emissions for fuels from different sources vary based on boundaries and input parameters. Well-to-Wheels GHG emissions for Canadian oil sands crudes range from 101-120 gCO2e/MJ LHV gasoline. Additionally, the weighted average GHG emissions for transportation fuels in the US in 2005 was 91 gCO2e/MJ LHV gasoline. Canadian oil sands crudes emit 17% more GHGs on a life-cycle basis than the weighted average of transportation fuels in the US. Discounting the final consumption phase, they emit 80% more GHGs on a Well-to-Tank basis. Individual estimates for different crude types and production processes can be found in Figure 2 and Table 2. Several life-cycle GHG emissions assessments have been published since the release of the 2011 Final EIS, including studies by Jacobs 2012, IHS CERA 2012, Brandt 2011, and Bergerson 2012. IHS CERA 2012 found that transportation fuels produced from oil sands crudes result in average WTW GHG emissions that are 14% higher than the average crude refined in the United States. Variability among the estimates is due to differing design and input assumptions. Studies by Jacobs 2012 and Bergerson 2012 show that transportation fuels from oil sands have WTW GHG emissions 5%-23% higher than US refined crude. Bergerson 2012 notes variability in emissions due to technology differences, with surface mining dilbit having the lowest emissions at 88 g CO2eq/MJ and in situ SCO the highest at 120 g CO2eq/MJ. Oil sands' heavier and more viscous nature contributes to higher emissions compared to conventional crude oil. Oil sands are heavier and more viscous than lighter crude oil types, requiring more energy-intensive activities to extract. They are chemically deficient in hydrogen and have higher carbon, sulfur, and heavy metal content, necessitating more processing to yield consumable fuels. Canadian oil sands crudes are generally more GHG-intensive than crudes they displace in U.S. refineries, with varying reported increases. Design and input assumptions significantly impact results, including the choice of functional units for GHG emissions normalization. GHG emissions are often normalized as CO2-equivalents, but the units used vary widely. Some studies evaluate emissions based on specific fuel products or averaged barrels of refined product. Different units of measurement include volume (e.g., millions of barrels) or energy produced (e.g., British Thermal Units or megajoules). This choice affects how results are presented and makes comparisons challenging across studies. GHG emissions vary based on extraction process, with in situ methods assumed to be more GHG-intensive than mining. Estimates show an average increase of 7-9% in WTW GHG emissions for in situ extraction. The amount of steam injected during in situ processes varies, affecting energy consumption and GHG emissions. The SOR values in SAGD operations in Canadian oil sands vary from 2.5 to 7.26, with an industry average of 3. GHG emissions during production are sensitive to SOR, with a 0.5 increase corresponding to a 10 kgCO2e increase per barrel of bitumen. Bitumen requires upgrading before refining, involving removal of impurities and viscosity reduction. The process of upgrading bitumen involves catalytic purification, hydrogenation, and coking to produce synthetic crude oil (SCO) and various co-products. These co-products include water, sand, waste, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, distillate, and petroleum coke, some of which contain carbon and other potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources. Comprehensive accounting of GHG emissions from all co-products is necessary for a full life-cycle assessment. Treatment of Petroleum Coke is a key factor in assessing the greenhouse gas emissions of oil sands crudes. Roughly 5%-10% of crude ends up as coke, with heavier crudes producing more. Combusting coke can increase emissions by 14%-50% compared to lighter crudes. If coke is not accounted for in the life cycle assessment, potential emissions may be overlooked. The main concern for modeling coke production is ensuring consistency between upgrader and refinery processes. Petroleum coke at the upgrader is consumed, stored, or sold as fuel, while refinery coke is used for electricity generation or allocated outside the life cycle assessment. Inconsistent methodologies hinder comparisons, with U.S. refinery coke often exported for coal combustion or steel production. Overseas transportation and emissions are typically not included in studies. Cogeneration facilities in oil sands extraction use steam and electricity to achieve higher energy efficiencies, with excess electricity generated being exported back into the grid. The inclusion of cogeneration credits in life cycle assessments can significantly impact greenhouse gas emissions. Assumptions about cogeneration vary in studies of Canadian oil sands, affecting the offset of electricity sources like coal-fired generation. Applying credits from oil sands facilities to offset coal-fired electricity generation could reduce WTW GHG emissions to within the range of conventional crudes. Upgrading and refinery emissions for SCO delivered to a refinery may result in lower energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to dilbit or other crudes. Accounting for reduced emissions from SCO at the refinery has a modest effect on WTW GHG emissions. Diluents are used to lower the viscosity of raw bitumen for transportation via pipeline. Diluting bitumen with lighter hydrocarbons for transport is common in the industry, affecting emission estimates. The process results in lower GHG emissions per barrel of dilbit compared to raw bitumen. However, refining diluted bitumen is more energy-intensive and yields less premium products. The extent to which this difference is accounted for in studies is unclear. The extent to which yield is accounted for in various studies on crude production of SAGD dilbit is unclear. Some studies show higher refinery emissions for dilbit compared to other crudes, without specifying the reasons for the increase. Upstream GHG emissions for natural gas fuel and electricity generation used in the production of oil sands crudes can be significant, accounting for roughly 4%-5% of the total WTW GHG emissions for average Canadian oil sands crudes. Including upstream fuel and electricity GHG emissions would add 3% to WTW GHG emissions per barrel of refined product. Flaring, venting, and fugitive emissions from oil sands production can contribute up to 4% of total WTW GHG emissions. Methane emissions from fugitive leaks and tailings ponds may contribute up to 1-9% of total GHG emissions. Some studies include these emissions, while others exclude methane released from tailings ponds. IHS CERA 2010 excludes methane emissions from tailings ponds but notes uncertainty in quantifying them. Other studies do not specify. None of the existing studies include GHG impacts from infrastructure/construction. Charpentier 2009 suggests investigating and including these emissions in future studies. Local and indirect land-use change emissions from oil sands mining operations may be significant, depending on reclamation activities. Yeh 2010 estimates surface mining of oil sands results in emissions. Yeh 2010 estimates that surface mining of oil sands results in a 0.9%-2.5% increase in WTW emissions compared to the baseline. Different types of lands displaced have varying impacts, with peatland removal having the largest impact and certain in situ facilities having the least impact. Recent studies are starting to assess land-use change GHG emissions. Studies compare GHG emissions from Canadian oil sands against other crude oils imported into the US. GHG emissions from gasoline produced from Canadian oil sands are 17% higher than those from gasoline derived from other transportation fuels in the US in 2005. Well-to-Tank emissions are 80% higher than the average in 2005. Compared to selected imports, emissions from Canadian oil sands are 19%, 12%, and 18% higher than Middle Eastern Sour, Mexican Maya, and Venezuelan crudes. The Well-to-Tank GHG emissions from Canadian oil sands are significantly higher than those from Middle Eastern Sour, Mexican Maya, and Venezuelan Conventional crudes. Well-to-Wheels GHG emissions from gasoline produced from Canadian oil sands are comparable to heavier crudes like Venezuelan Bachaquero and lighter crudes produced from operations that flare associated gas. Individual estimates show Canadian oil sands crudes are 9% to 19% more GHG-intensive than Middle Eastern Sour and 5% to 13% more GHG-intensive than Mexican crudes. The comparison shows that Canadian oil sands are more GHG-intensive than Middle Eastern Sour, Mexican Maya, and various Venezuelan crudes. Assessments of global crude resources face uncertainties due to varying resource quality and production methods. The choice of reference crudes studied can impact the results of comparisons between Canadian oil sands and other global crudes. Some studies suggest that GHG emissions intensities of Canadian oil sands crudes should be measured against a global average or all crudes consumed in a specific marketplace. Others argue they should be compared to crudes they may displace in production. Ratios are used to describe the flow from a well due to the complex nature of crude oil production systems and resource reservoirs. Studies often use ratios to describe the fraction of flow from a well that is oil, water, and gas, simplifying the relationship between energy use and GHG emissions. Assumptions about venting, flaring, and transportation can impact GHG emissions intensities. Uncertainty in measuring GHG emissions intensities is high, with few studies fully considering associated uncertainty. Most studies lack transparency in methodologies, assumptions, and data sources, hindering meaningful comparisons of results for oil sands crudes. Data on Canadian oil sands are more robust than some global resources but less than others. Statistical bounds are often not provided in calculations, potentially impacting overlaps with other results. The comparison of life-cycle GHG emissions intensities of Canadian oil sands crudes with other unconventional petroleum products, natural gas, and coal shows variability due to different study designs and input assumptions. Different end uses for fuel products make a full comparison of emissions impacts challenging. Life-cycle assessment is a key methodology for analyzing and comparing GHG emissions and climate change impacts. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology used to analyze and compare GHG emissions and climate change impacts of hydrocarbon resources. LCAs have uncertainties due to the complex life cycle of fuels, making direct comparisons challenging. Instead of generating comparative rankings, LCAs can highlight \"hot spots\" in emissions, directing policymakers' attention to areas with the greatest challenges in GHG emissions control. Table 3 summarizes GHG emissions impacts of Canadian oil sands production stages and offers mitigation strategies from industry, academia, and stakeholders."
