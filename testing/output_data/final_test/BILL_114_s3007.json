The Open Skies Treaty refers to the treaty done at Helsinki on March 24, 1992, and entered into force on January 1, 2002. The National Security Act of 1947 defines terms related to observation aircraft, observation flight, and sensor based on the Open Skies Treaty. SEC. 3. CERTIFICATION OF NEW SENSORS. The National Security Act of 1947 defines terms related to observation aircraft, observation flight, and sensor based on the Open Skies Treaty. Funds cannot be used to aid in certifying new sensors for Russian observation flights unless the President submits a certification that the sensor capabilities comply with treaty limits. The Open Skies Treaty imposes capabilities on sensors used for observation flights. Mitigation measures are in place to prevent misuse of information obtained from the new sensor. Covered state parties have been briefed on concerns regarding upgraded sensors. The Open Skies Treaty requires approval for upgraded sensors used in observation flights, with measures in place to prevent misuse of information. The Russian Federation must comply with treaty obligations, including allowing observation flights over specified regions. The President has the authority to waive requirements under certain circumstances. The President can certify or approve new sensors for Russian observation flights under the Open Skies Treaty if it is in the national security interest of the United States. The certification must include reasons for approval and the expected date for Russian compliance with treaty obligations. The United States Government must provide a detailed description of efforts to bring Russia into compliance with the Open Skies Treaty in each certification submitted, which can include a classified annex."
