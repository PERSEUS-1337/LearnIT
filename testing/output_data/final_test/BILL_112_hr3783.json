    "content": "The \"Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012\" acknowledges the US interests in the Western Hemisphere and Iran's efforts to build diplomatic and economic ties with Latin American countries to counter international sanctions and oppose Western influence. Additionally, the Act highlights the Department of State's concerns about Hezbollah, supported by Iran, being a highly capable terrorist group with significant resources. The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force has a long history of supporting Hezbollah with guidance, funding, weapons, and operatives stationed in foreign embassies and institutions to build relationships, including in Latin America. The Department of the Treasury placed sanctions on the IRGC and its Qods Force in 2007 for their support of terrorism. The IRGC and its Qods Force have been involved in terrorist attacks, including the 1994 AMIA Jewish Community Center attack in Buenos Aires. Iranian intelligence agents have been linked to Hezbollah activities in Latin America, with Iran increasing its diplomatic missions in the region. Iran has built cultural centers and embassies in Latin America to support Hezbollah and other proxies. Hezbollah and Iranian proxies in Latin America engage in illicit activities such as drug trafficking, arms trafficking, money laundering, and providing support to terrorists. Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela support Iran in evading sanctions and expanding economic ties. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found that almost half of foreign terrorist organizations operate in the region. In October 2011, two men were charged by the United States for conspiracy to murder a foreign official using explosives in an act of terrorism. One of the men, Manssor Arbabsiar, traveled to Mexico to hire someone in the narcotics business to carry out the assassination of the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in the United States. Despite only engaging with a DEA informant posing as a drug cartel associate, Arbabsiar believed he was working with a Mexican drug trafficking organization. In February 2011, the Department of the Treasury shut down the Lebanese Canadian Bank, leading to the indictment of Ayman Joumaa in December 2011 for drug trafficking and money laundering.
