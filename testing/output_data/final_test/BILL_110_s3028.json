    "content": "The \"Senior Year Community Service Act\" aims to promote community service among US youth by connecting high school seniors to service opportunities through a pilot program under the National and Community Service Act of 1990. The Senior Year Community Service Act defines terms like \"community service opportunity\" and \"graduation rate\" and establishes a national pilot program to match high school seniors with community service opportunities through grants to local educational agencies. The Corporation considers the number and percentage of seniors matched to community service for grant amounts. Not less than 6 grants will be made for 2-year periods. Local educational agencies must submit an application to be eligible for a grant. The local educational agency must demonstrate its ability to implement a local program through the national pilot program, show commitment from leaders in various sectors, leverage additional funds, match seniors with service opportunities, and set goals with a community-based organization for service. The organization must establish goals for the service provided by participating high school seniors. Grant funds are to be used to establish partnerships with community-based organizations, offer community service opportunities for seniors, provide a service coordinator for schools, and inform junior students about community service. The Corporation supports local educational agencies in the national pilot program by providing templates for junior students, assisting in finding community service opportunities for seniors, and helping with necessary paperwork for eligibility. The Corporation supports local educational agencies in the national pilot program by providing templates for junior students, assisting in finding community service opportunities for seniors, and helping with necessary paperwork for eligibility. Seniors participating in the program are eligible for national service educational awards if they meet specific requirements. An independent agency will evaluate the program's impact on student achievement. The evaluation of the program compares participating secondary school seniors to non-participating seniors in terms of academic achievement and graduation rates. The evaluation of the program includes measuring graduation rates, student attendance, enrollment in higher education, and other academic factors deemed necessary by the Corporation. It also assesses whether the goals set by the local educational agency were achieved. Additionally, it builds on the effectiveness of the senior year community service pilot program. The national pilot program aims to improve student achievement by including as many secondary school seniors as possible, in collaboration with the local educational agency. SEC. 4. EDUCATIONAL AWARDS. Amendment to the National and Community Service Act of 1990 includes adding a new position for service participants and reserving approved positions for VISTA volunteers and community service participants. The Corporation must ensure that individuals selected by a local educational agency as participants under section 198E receive the national service educational award if they meet eligibility requirements. Funds for approved national service positions will be deducted from appropriated funds. Adjustments to program rules are authorized by the Corporation. The Corporation can make adjustments to program rules if appropriations are insufficient to provide maximum national service educational awards for eligible participants. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Section 501(a)(2) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 is amended to include a Senior year community service pilot program for fiscal years 2009 through 2011, providing financial assistance under section 198E. National service positions for senior year community service participants are authorized to receive national service educational awards for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
