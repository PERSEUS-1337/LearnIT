    "content": "The Act is named the \"Commission on the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade Act\" and prohibits the importation of slaves into the United States. Congress found that President Thomas Jefferson signed the 1808 Transatlantic Slave Trade Act, making it illegal to import slaves for sale or labor. The United States Constitution also prohibits the international slave trade. The 1808 Transatlantic Slave Trade Act went into effect on January 1, 1808, banning the international slave trade. The Act of 1820 made it unlawful for any US citizen to engage in the slave trade. The transatlantic slave trade involved kidnapping, purchasing, and exporting Africans to European colonies. During the Middle Passage of the transatlantic slave trade, millions of enslaved Africans were chained together and transported in overcrowded ships to the Americas. Enslaved Africans resisted their captivity through various means, including hunger strikes, suicide, and shipboard revolts. Scholars estimate that at least 10,000,000 Africans were forcibly transported during this horrific journey. The Middle Passage of the transatlantic slave trade saw millions of Africans survive the journey to be sold into slavery.
