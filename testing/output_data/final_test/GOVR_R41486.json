Research on transgenic strains is ongoing for 35 fish species globally, as well as mollusks, crustaceans, plants, and marine microorganisms. Fish are being modified for food production, pharmaceuticals, water contamination testing, and other purposes, regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA provisions. Some critics are calling for more transparency in the FDA's drug approval process and more authority for environmental and wildlife agencies. One genetically modified fish, Glofish\u2122, fluoresces after genetic alteration with a sea anemone gene. It is legal to be sold in all states except California. Another company has created a fast-growing Atlantic salmon by inserting genetic material from Chinook salmon and ocean pout. AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. is developing genetically modified Atlantic salmon that grows twice as fast as non-GM salmon. They are seeking FDA approval for human consumption. Other GM fish examples include those producing blood-clotting factor and disease-resistant catfish. FDA consults with wildlife agencies to assess environmental impacts of engineered plants and animals. Critics question FDA's ability to identify and prevent ecological damage from transgenic fish. Concerns include the escape of GM organisms from aquaculture facilities and potential breeding with wild populations, leading to the spread of undesirable genes. The ecological risks of stocking GM shellfish in the wild have not been thoroughly examined. GM fish could disrupt the ecology by competing with native fish for resources and potentially harming wild fish through increased competition or predation. Critics fear the spread of undesirable genes and the eventual demise of modified populations. Transgenic fish, if modified to withstand wider environmental conditions, could harm wild fish through competition or predation. Critics fear their potential to become invasive species, like non-GM Atlantic salmon that have escaped and outnumbered wild Pacific salmon. It is uncertain if GM fish could survive in the wild in large enough numbers to cause permanent damage. GM fish could potentially harm wild populations if food supplies are low. Biotechnology proponents argue that escaped GM fish would struggle to survive in the wild. Safeguards like requiring only sterile GM fish for approval exist, with triploid females considered the best method for sterility. Critics question the effectiveness of using all-female triploid fish to ensure nonbreeding populations of GM fish due to batch-to-batch variations and uncertainty of its success for all species. Escaped triploid fish with sufficient sex hormone levels could potentially mate with wild individuals, impacting reproductive success. Other sterilization methods are being studied to increase options, but critics argue that the risks to native fish populations may outweigh the benefits of GM fish technology. The National Research Council report on Bioconfinement of Genetically Engineered Organisms recommends individual bioconfinement plans for each species to reduce ecological risk. Bioconfinement redundancy is crucial for control, especially when not combined with physical confinement. Growing GM marine fish in isolated onshore tanks can lower the risk of escape into the wild. Genetic modification techniques offer advantages over traditional breeding methods, allowing for faster and more specific trait selection in fewer generations. Genetic modification techniques enable precise trait selection in fewer generations, creating faster-growing fish with improved traits like increased nutritional content. This could boost fish farming productivity, reduce feed waste, and address food security concerns. GM shellfish and finfish with enhanced disease resistance could decrease antibiotic use. Cold-resistant fish could expand aquaculture into new environments. Biotechnology advancements in aquaculture include genetically modifying fish for human drug production and creating shellfish with reduced allergenicity. Proponents argue that this could lead to benefits such as lower costs, improved environmental impact, and enhanced food safety. Consumer acceptance of genetically modified products remains uncertain. Consumer acceptance of genetically modified fish remains uncertain due to ethical and environmental concerns. Campaigns by environmental and consumer groups urge businesses to pledge not to sell GM fish products, even if approved by the FDA. The commercial fishing industry has educated the public to differentiate between wild and farmed fish, but a publicized escape of GM fish could impact public acceptance. Groups are advocating for genetically engineered products to be labeled, while industry groups oppose this measure. The labeling of genetically engineered products is a point of contention, with industry groups fearing consumer misconceptions about safety. A National Research Council study notes a low to moderate food safety risk from GM seafood due to potential allergen introduction. FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates transgenic animals for human consumption under the same authority as new animal drugs. GM fish must meet safety standards like conventionally bred fish under the FFDCA and FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. FDA has the authority to remove adulterated products under Section 402(a)(1) of the FFDCA. The FDA has the power to remove or sanction foods posing a risk to public health under the adulteration provisions of the FFDCA. AquaBounty Technologies provided FDA with data for GM AquAdvantage salmon approval. Debate focuses on allowing GM animals and labeling requirements. The decision on labeling is separate from the approval process. If the new animal drug meets standards, the Commissioner will approve it. If the new animal drug meets the approval standard, the FDA will issue an order approving the application for AquAdvantage salmon. Issues related to misbranding based on labeling are separate and being considered simultaneously. The salmon, all sterile females, will be grown in isolated contained facilities in Panama and shipped to the United States for retail sale. Approval could take two to three years, with public hearings already held by the FDA. The FDA held public hearings on AquAdvantage salmon in September 2010. Critics questioned the lengthy FDA review process and called for an environmental impact statement. Environmental groups filed a petition urging FDA to delay approval until an EIS is completed. The FDA announced the availability of a draft environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact for AquaBounty's GM fish. Concerns have been raised in Canada over the potential effects of producing these fish. If significant new information arises from public comments, FDA may require a full Environmental Impact Statement before approving AquaBounty's application. If FDA approves AquaBounty's application for GM fish, it can withdraw approval if significant concerns arise. Some states have laws regulating GM fish, such as bans on release in state waters and labeling requirements. Federal laws addressing GM fish are lacking, but bills have been introduced in Congress to require labeling or prevent approval for human consumption. The House passed H.R. 2112 to prohibit FDA from approving genetically engineered salmon in FY2012, but the Senate removed this provision. S. 1717 aimed to ban the sale of genetically altered salmon. The Senate held a hearing on the environmental risks of genetically engineered fish. A defeated amendment proposed FDA approval of genetically engineered fish only with NOAA concurrence. No further action was taken by the 112th Congress on these bills."
