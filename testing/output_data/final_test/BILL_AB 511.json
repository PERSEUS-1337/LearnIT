    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3212 of the Labor Code is repealed and replaced with a new section 3212 that defines \"injury\" to include hernias for members of specified law enforcement and public safety departments. The new section 3212 of the Labor Code includes provisions for specific law enforcement and public safety departments, such as active firefighting members, warden service members, regular salaried peace officers, and full-time peace officers as defined in the Penal Code. Approval is required from the governing body of the contracting public agency, city or county charter, or collective bargaining agreement for implementation. Members of specific law enforcement and public safety departments, including firefighters, forestry department members, and wildlife warden service members, are covered for pneumonia and heart issues that develop during their service. Members of specific law enforcement and public safety departments, including custody assistants, correctional officers, security officers, and peace officers, are eligible for compensation for hernia, heart trouble, or pneumonia as per workers' compensation laws. Workers in law enforcement and public safety departments are entitled to compensation for hernia, heart trouble, or pneumonia under workers' compensation laws. The presumption that these conditions arise from work can be disputed with evidence, but if not contested, the appeals board must rule accordingly. The presumption can apply for up to 60 months after termination of service, with a period of three calendar months for each full year of service. Prior existing diseases cannot be attributed to the development of these conditions. Section 3212.1 of the Labor Code applies to active firefighting members in various fire departments, including volunteers and paid members. It does not apply to clerical personnel in law enforcement. Active firefighting members covered under Section 3212.1 of the Labor Code include county forestry or firefighting departments, fire departments serving Department of Defense or NASA installations, and part-time or full-time peace officers primarily engaged in law enforcement activities. Fire and rescue services coordinators with specific job classifications are included in the ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body of a public agency, city or county charter, or collective bargaining agreement. This includes custody assistants, correctional officers, security officers, security assistants, and certain peace officers. The compensation for cancer under this division includes full hospital, surgical, medical treatment, disability indemnity, and death benefits. The presumption of work-related cancer can be disputed with evidence of the primary site and lack of link to exposure. The presumption extends for a period after termination of service based on years worked, up to a maximum of 120 months. The William Dallas Jones Cancer Presumption Act of 2010 applies to claims for benefits filed on or after January 1, 1997, including denied claims being appealed. Section 3212.5 of the Labor Code is repealed and a new section is added. Section 3212.5 of the Labor Code now includes heart trouble and pneumonia as compensable injuries for certain full-time employees, such as peace officers and investigators in a district attorney's office. Upon approval of an ordinance or resolution by the governing body of a public agency, a custody assistant, correctional officer, security officer, or peace officer may be employed under specific conditions outlined in a city or county charter or a collective bargaining agreement. The presumption of compensability for heart trouble or pneumonia arising in the course of employment is extended to those with five years of service, with a maximum of 60 months after termination. Any such conditions shall not be attributed to pre-existing diseases. Section 3212.6 of the Labor Code is repealed and replaced with a new provision that includes tuberculosis as an injury for certain individuals such as peace officers and investigators, with full compensation benefits. (C) A prison or jail guard, correctional officer, custody assistant, security officer, or security assistant employed by a public agency, or a peace officer not described in Chapter 4.5 of the Penal Code, if employed full-time.\n(D) Upon approval by the governing body of the contracting public agency, or as outlined in a city or county charter or collective bargaining agreement, certain public agency employees are eligible for benefits.\n(E) Fire department members employed on a regular, fully paid basis are also covered. (F) An active firefighting member of the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection or a county forestry department, whose duties include firefighting and first aid response services, is presumed to have tuberculosis arising out of and in the course of employment. This presumption can be disputed with evidence, but if not, the appeals board must find in accordance with it. The presumption extends for a period of three calendar months for each full year of service, not exceeding 60 months after termination of service. Section 3212.85 of the Labor Code is repealed and replaced with a new provision. A public entity can require applicants for firefighting positions to be tested for tuberculosis. The section does not apply to clerical staff or those not directly involved in law enforcement, firefighting, or emergency response services. The compensation awarded for injury under this section includes hospital, surgical, medical treatment, disability indemnity, and death benefits for specified individuals, such as peace officers, fire department members, and certain public agency employees. The presumption of work-related injury applies to cases involving biochemical substances as defined in the Penal Code. This presumption can be challenged with evidence, but if not disputed, the appeals board must rule in favor of the presumption. The presumption can extend up to 60 months after termination of service, based on the length of service. Section 3212.9 of the Labor Code is repealed and replaced with a new definition of \"injury\" that includes meningitis for specified members of fire departments, with full compensation benefits provided. The curr_chunk describes the eligibility criteria for peace officers, inspectors, investigators, and members of fire departments to receive full compensation benefits for specified injuries. This eligibility is contingent upon employment on a regular, full-time salary and approval from the governing body of the contracting public agency. The eligibility criteria for peace officers, inspectors, investigators, and members of fire departments to receive full compensation benefits for specified injuries include being employed full-time by a public agency. Meningitis is presumed to be work-related and the presumption can be disputed with evidence. Persons whose main duties are clerical or not directly related to law enforcement, custody, firefighting, such as stenographers and receptionists, are exempt from this section."
