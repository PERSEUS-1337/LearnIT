    "content": "The \"FHA Refinance Program Termination Act\" rescinds funding for the FHA Refinance Program under the Making Home Affordable initiative. Unexpended balances are canceled and retained in the Treasury to reduce the Federal Government's debt. The Act terminates the FHA Refinance Program. The FHA Refinance Program Termination Act voids a Mortgagee Letter and prohibits new mortgage insurance by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Existing funds under the program will still be governed by the previous Mortgagee Letter and applicable laws. The FHA Refinance Program Termination Act prohibits new mortgage insurance under the program, except for existing commitments. A study will be conducted to assess the program's usage and impact on covered homeowners. The FHA Refinance Program Termination Act will be evaluated through a study to determine its impact on covered homeowners, including members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and Gold Star lapel pin recipients. A report with best practices for the FHA Refinance Program will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Gold Star lapel pin recipients under section 1126 of title 10, United States Code include widows, parents, and next of kin of Armed Forces members who died in a qualifying manner. Additionally, eligible individuals are service-connected members and veterans with injuries, as well as their survivors and dependents. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must publish a statement on their website informing borrowers that the FHA Short Refinance Program has been terminated. Borrowers in need of mortgage assistance should contact their Member of Congress for help in negotiating a loan modification. The Clerk's name is Karen L. Haas."
