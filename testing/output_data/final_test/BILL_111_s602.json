    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Firefighter Fatality Reduction Act of 2009\". Congress finds that each year in the United States, over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty, with tens of thousands more injured. The Federal Government has a vested interest in protecting firefighter health and safety to effectively respond to disasters. Adequate training, equipment, staffing, procedures, and fitness can reduce firefighter fatalities. The fire services, along with government and private-sector partners, have developed national voluntary standards. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health works with standards-making bodies to develop national voluntary consensus standards for safe fire department operations and firefighting capabilities. These standards are widely respected in the fire service to ensure firefighter health and safety. Non-compliance with these standards has been identified as a contributing factor in many firefighter deaths. A comprehensive assessment of fire department adherence to these standards would aid policymakers in enhancing public safety and reducing avoidable firefighter fatalities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"national voluntary consensus standards\" as the most recent standards for firefighter safety, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \"Task Force\" as the Task Force to Enhance Firefighter Safety. The Secretary, in consultation with the Task Force, will conduct a survey of all fire departments in the US to determine compliance with national voluntary consensus standards within 120 days of this Act. The survey will assess compliance rates for paid, volunteer, and combination fire departments in various community sizes and states. The Secretary, with the Task Force, will survey all US fire departments within 120 days to assess compliance with national standards. A report to Congress, due within 2 years, will summarize findings and detail compliance with standards. Establishment of Task Force to enhance firefighter safety. The Secretary will establish a task force called the \"Task Force to Enhance Firefighter Safety\" within 60 days of the Act's enactment. Task Force members will include representatives from national firefighter organizations, standards-setting bodies, and other relevant individuals appointed by the Secretary. The Task Force, established by the Secretary, may include representatives from other federal departments and agencies interested in the fire service. The Secretary determines the number, terms of service, and pay of Task Force members, with a maximum term of 2 years. The Task Force's responsibilities include conducting surveys with the Secretary and developing plans to improve firefighter safety through compliance with national standards. The Task Force, established by the Secretary, is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the extent of compliance with national voluntary consensus standards among fire departments. They also consider ways to promote compliance with these standards by the Federal Government, States, and local governments. Within 6 months of submitting a required report, the Task Force must provide Congress and the Secretary with findings, recommendations, and a plan for improving firefighter safety through compliance with national standards."
