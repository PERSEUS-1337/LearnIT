It is not a measure of indebtedness but an accounting of assets. By the end of 2012, U.S. residents had $21 trillion in overseas assets, while foreigners owned $25 trillion in U.S. assets. The U.S. net international investment position was approximately $4.1 trillion in the negative, with foreign investors acquiring assets in the United States at their own risk. These investments include financial assets like stocks, bonds, government securities, and direct investments in businesses and real estate, with their value changing annually due to purchases and sales. The U.S. net international investment position of approximately $4.1 trillion in the negative is influenced by changes in asset values due to purchases, sales, appreciation, depreciation, and market fluctuations. The increase in U.S. private assets owned abroad in 2011-2012 was driven by a revaluation of corporate stocks and private investments, while foreign investment in U.S. assets also rose with an upward revaluation of assets owned by foreigners in the United States. The Department of Commerce provides estimates of the nation's international investment position, with updates released annually in July. Direct investment is valued at historical cost, while other accounts are estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis based on market prices. The Department of Commerce provides estimates of the nation's international investment position, with updates released annually in July. Direct investment is valued at historical cost, while other accounts are estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis based on market prices. The BEA estimates investments, gold, loans, currencies, and bank deposits based on face values or market prices, without deflating for price changes. Alternative estimates of direct investment are also provided based on current cost, market value, and historical cost to account for the challenges in valuing direct investments. The Department of Commerce estimates the U.S. international investment position using three different accounting methods: historical cost, current cost, and market value. Direct investments are initially valued at historical cost, but this value can become outdated. The current cost approach estimates the value of capital equipment and land at their current replacement cost. The Department of Commerce uses three accounting methods to estimate the U.S. international investment position: historical cost, current cost, and market value. Direct investments are valued at replacement cost under the current cost method. Market value estimates of direct investment show fluctuations based on stock market prices. The market value of U.S. direct investment abroad fell sharply in 2008 due to the economic recession and financial crisis. However, it rose by 38% in 2009. Foreign direct investment in the United States also fell in 2008 but rose by 22% in 2009. The value of U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign corporate stocks owned by U.S. investors increased significantly from 2008 to 2009. In 2010, both U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the United States saw further growth. By 2012, U.S. direct investment abroad continued to rise in value. During 2012, foreign direct investment in the United States increased by 5.9% in historical cost terms, 6.2% in current cost terms, and 11.8% in market value terms. U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the United States have generally moved in tandem, except in 2005 when U.S. direct investment abroad dropped sharply due to tax provisions. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided one-time tax provisions for U.S. direct investment outflows. Foreign investment in U.S. assets has exceeded U.S. investment abroad, leading to a negative net U.S. international investment position. This historical trend dates back to the nation's development as a major economic superpower, with foreign investment supporting capital projects like railroad and canal construction. The United States became a net creditor after World War I, but turned into a net debtor by the 1980s due to large foreign investments. By 2012, U.S. assets abroad were $21.0 trillion, while foreign-owned assets in the U.S. were $25.1 trillion, resulting in a negative net international investment position of nearly $4.1 trillion. The net investment debt position of the United States worsened by $150 billion in 2012, reaching nearly negative $4.1 trillion, equivalent to about 28% of the GDP. This increase was mainly due to a rise in financial derivatives and upward price revisions in foreign-owned assets. Foreign investment in the U.S. continues to grow as foreigners acquire more U.S. assets, divided into official and private investments. Foreign investments in the U.S. are divided into official and private categories. Concerns have been raised about foreign governments investing in U.S. Treasury securities and businesses. Official asset holdings in 2012 were valued at $5.7 trillion, with acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities being a significant component. Foreign governments use these acquisitions to influence the dollar's exchange rate. Foreign currency holdings make up a small portion of total foreign investment in the U.S., with private assets primarily consisting of direct investments in businesses, real estate, and government securities. Foreign-owned private assets in the U.S. were valued at $15.8 trillion in 2012, comprising about 60% of total foreign-owned assets. The composition of U.S. assets abroad differs from foreign-owned assets in the U.S., with U.S. Treasury securities being highly sought after by foreign investors. Foreign official assets in the U.S. exceed U.S. official assets abroad. The United States has more official assets domestically than abroad. Foreign investors are attracted to U.S. government securities during economic crises. The U.S. is the largest foreign direct investor and recipient of direct investment globally. Foreign investors also invest in U.S. corporate stocks and bonds. The decline in the value of U.S. corporate stocks after 2000 slowed foreign purchases of these assets. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar reduced the value of American-owned stock holdings abroad. International investment includes private bank claims and impacts both the U.S. economy and is affected by it. Foreign markets offer U.S. investors opportunities for high returns, often repatriated back to the United States. U.S. direct investment abroad stimulates exports and benefits the economy by providing capital, technology, and expertise to developing countries. Foreign capital inflows help keep U.S. interest rates lower and drive the inflows and outflows of capital. The United States attracts capital from other countries due to the high demand for capital relative to domestic sources. The United States attracts foreign capital inflows, benefiting from a surplus of saving over investment globally. This surplus allows for low-interest funds to be available, accommodating the growing current account deficits. Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, there was a decline in the U.S. saving rate and an increase in domestic investment. The nation's current account deficit was supported by foreign capital inflows, with post-crisis increases in the U.S. saving rate and business investment. In 2015, U.S. saving as a percent of GDP increased by 1.6% compared to the 2010-2015 period, while business investment increased at a slower rate of 1.1% of GDP. This led to an increase in saving as a share of GDP. Compared to the 2006-2010 period, U.S. saving increased by 4.6% of GDP, while investment increased by 2.1%. This indicates an increase in U.S. saving over investment in 2015. These changes were accompanied by a worldwide increase in both saving and investment. In 2015, saving increased slightly more than investment as a share of global GDP, leading to an excess of saving worldwide. Among advanced economies, saving increased while investment remained steady relative to the 2010-2015 period. In the Eurozone, saving increased by 1.0% of GDP, while investment declined by 0.8%. Japan saw an increase in saving relative to GDP in 2015, the largest among major economies. In 2015, among emerging developing economies, saving fell by 1.0% relative to GDP, while investment was flat due to slowing global trade and lower commodity prices. Developing economies in Asia experienced a decrease in saving and investment as a share of GDP, reflecting the global economic slowdown. In the Middle East, saving decreased by 12.7% of GDP in 2015 due to lower energy prices and slower global trade. Capital inflows also allowed the United States to finance. In 2015, capital inflows allowed the United States to finance its trade deficit by exchanging goods for U.S. assets. However, this put upward pressure on the dollar, affecting exports. Foreign investment in the U.S. economy also drains off some income earned on foreign-owned assets. Observers are concerned about the long-term impact of the U.S. being a net international investment debtor. In 2015, the United States had a net surplus of $278 billion in income receipts from investments abroad. However, as foreign investment in the U.S. economy continues to exceed U.S. investment abroad, it is expected that U.S. payments on foreign-owned assets will eventually exceed U.S. receipts, leading to a net outflow of income payments. This could negatively impact the national economy by reducing U.S. national income as funds are channeled abroad to foreign investors. The United States had a net surplus of $278 billion in income receipts from investments abroad in 2015. The U.S. earned $265 billion more on its direct investment assets abroad than foreigners earned on their investments in the U.S. Foreign-owned firms in the U.S. historically had lower rates of return compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time, possibly due to age effects. The U.S. net surplus of income receipts from investments abroad in 2015 was $278 billion. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms are outperforming U.S. counterparts. The U.S. paid $89 billion to foreign holders of portfolio investments, but received $125 billion in royalties. Despite concerns about the U.S. net international investment position, Congress has been reluctant to intervene. Members of Congress have been hesitant to interfere in investment processes, both inward and outward. The U.S. net investment position turning more negative could lead to a drain on the economy as income payments exceed receipts, potentially sending income abroad to foreign creditors. Concerns also arise from the increasing role of foreign investment in bridging the domestic gap. Foreign investment plays a growing role in the economy by bridging the gap between domestic sources and credit demands. Capital inflows into direct investment, corporate stocks, and bonds are used to bolster investments in plant and equipment, improving productivity and aiding in long-term economic growth. Additionally, foreign investment in U.S. Treasury securities helps finance the government's budget deficits, easing demands on domestic credit markets and freeing up capital for firms and consumer consumption. One concern among policymakers is the rising foreign government investment in U.S. businesses, real estate, and portfolio assets, fueled by sovereign wealth funds holding over $2.5 trillion in U.S. currency. This type of investment is seen as different and warrants greater scrutiny, as it goes against traditional U.S. policies encouraging foreign governments to move away from owning businesses. Foreign government investments in U.S. assets have raised concerns about potential interference in market activities. However, there is no evidence that such ownership has impacted asset management differently from private foreign entities. To address these concerns, Congress passed the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, increasing oversight over acquisitions by foreign governments. A sudden withdrawal of foreign capital could potentially trigger a financial crisis, prompting congressional involvement. A coordinated withdrawal of foreign investors from the economy could lead to a financial crisis, involving Congress due to its fiscal and supervisory roles. The impact of foreign investors curtailing purchases of U.S. securities could complicate efforts to finance budget deficits without affecting interest rates and domestic investment. The 2008-2009 financial crisis showed that foreign investors still view dollar-denominated assets as safe-haven investments during uncertain times. During uncertain times, foreign investors still consider dollar-denominated assets as safe-haven investments."
