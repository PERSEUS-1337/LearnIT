The lands were to be sold in parcels of 160 acres at $2.50 per acre to encourage settlement, but the railroad violated the terms by selling larger tracts at higher prices. In 1908, the United States sued the railroad company for these violations. In 1915, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Oregon & California Railroad violated the grant terms, leading to the Chamberlain-Ferris Act of 1916 revesting unsold lands to the federal government. The Oregon & California Railroad Lands Act of 1937 directed the Department of the Interior to manage the lands for timber production, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability, with revenue sharing for counties. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages the O&C lands, which include approximately 472,000 acres of controverted lands managed by the Forest Service and 75,000 acres of the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) lands. The Forest Service claimed jurisdiction over the controverted lands, which were unselected and unpatented odd-numbered sections within the indemnity limits of the railroad. Congress resolved the issue in 1954 by affirming the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest Service. The O&C lands, managed by BLM, include the revested O&C lands, reconveyed CBWR lands, and Forest Service O&C lands. Federal payments are made to Oregon counties for tax-exempt federal lands. Major issues related to O&C lands management are analyzed. The O&C lands, primarily Douglas fir forests, were classified as timberlands under the O&C Act of 1937 for sustained timber production. The annual allowable sale quantity (ASQ) peaked at 1.2 billion board feet in 1972, but harvest levels declined in the 1990s. Since 2000, BLM has offered an annual timber sale program. Since 2000, BLM has offered an annual average of approximately 180 million board feet for harvest, including 239 million board feet in FY2014. The O&C Act also provided for protecting watersheds, regulating stream flow, contributing to economic stability, and providing recreational opportunities. Some interpret the O&C Act as prioritizing timber production over other values. Congress established a \"No Net Loss\" policy for BLM lands in western Oregon in 1998. The O&C Act requires BLM to maintain consistent acres of O&C and CBWR land every 10 years, as well as stable acres available for timber harvest. The O&C lands are part of the Northwest Forest Plan, covering 24 million acres of public land in the Pacific Northwest. The NWFP was created in the 1990s to address issues related to the northern spotted owl and designates different land allocations within the plan area. The NWFP designates land allocations with specific management prescriptions and mitigation requirements. Late-successional reserves protect old-growth characteristics, with restricted timber harvests. Riparian reserve areas also have harvest restrictions. Matrix and adaptive management areas allow harvests. Mitigation measures include \"survey and manage\" for rare species and an aquatic conservation strategy. The NWFP's annual timber target for western Oregon is around 203 million board feet. The NWFP manages the O&C lands with an annual timber target of 203 million board feet. Litigation has affected the management, with BLM required to update resource management plans. The BLM's previous effort to update the RMPs for the O&C lands was unsuccessful, with courts invalidating the 2008 WOPR. The agency plans to release draft RMPs for public comment in 2015. The WOPR aimed to increase timber harvests but faced legal challenges for not consulting under the ESA. In 2009, the DOI withdrew the WOPR, and in 2012, a federal court vacated it. In 2012, a federal court vacated the WOPR, leading to the BLM managing western Oregon districts under the 1994 NWFP. BLM did not evaluate O&C lands as Wilderness Study Areas, but Congress designated wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers within the O&C lands. Counties lost tax revenue when the lands returned to federal ownership in 1916. The 1916 Chamberlain-Ferris Act (CFA) allocated funds for county compensation for unpaid railroad taxes, to be reimbursed from timber sales revenue from O&C lands. Congress anticipated sufficient revenue for reimbursement and additional funds after federal reimbursement. The 1926 Stanfield Act authorized tax equivalency payments to counties for the period of 1916-1926, changing the priority for revenue allocation to first pay the counties. Initial revenues from O&C timber sales were insufficient to make payments to the state or counties, with the federal government still awaiting reimbursement for tax equivalency payments. The 1926 Stanfield Act authorized tax equivalency payments to counties for the period of 1916-1926, changing the priority for revenue allocation to first pay the counties. By 1936, tax equivalency payments to the counties had only been made through 1933, and the U.S. Treasury was still owed approximately $8.4 million for those payments. Congress considered tax equivalency payments or revenue-sharing payments for the O&C counties. The Oregon congressional delegation and the Association of O&C Counties supported tax equivalency payments, while the DOI supported revenue-sharing. Congress settled on a revenue-sharing system to avoid deficits from previous payments. The O&C Act allocated 50% of revenue to counties, 25% to the U.S. Treasury for accrued taxes, and 25% for administration. In 1951, final payment for historic accrued taxes on O&C lands was made. From 1952, O&C counties received 75% of receipts. In 1953, 25% of total receipts were directed back to federal government for land management. Congress began direct appropriation for O&C land management in 1981. Payments were split 50-50 between counties and federal government. Counties could use payments for any purpose. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, administered by the DOI, compensates local governments for lost tax revenue on federal lands. It covers 94% of federal land and uses a complex formula based on acreage and population for payment calculations. Exceptions include military and Department of Energy lands. In the 1990s, Congress revisited federal payments to O&C counties due to declining timber harvests from federal lands. Some attribute the decline to environmental litigation, while others point to forest management and economic factors. Congress enacted the Safety Net payment scheme in 1993 to provide compensation, known as \"owl payments,\" at 85% of previous levels. The \"owl payments\" for O&C lands and other BLM and national forest system lands in Washington, Oregon, and California were replaced by the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS) in 2000. SRS allowed O&C counties to choose payments based on historic receipts instead of 50% of current receipts, with temporary transition payments until FY2013. The program expired in early 2014, with FY2014 payments returning to 50% of receipts unless Congress acts to extend, modify, or replace SRS. In FY2013, BLM estimated O&C counties would receive significantly lower revenue sharing payments of $5.5 million-$8 million, an 85% reduction compared to previous years' SRS payments. In February 2013, BLM distributed 90% of the FY2012 SRS payment ($36 million) to the O&C counties, withholding 10% due to sequestration. The sequestered amount was $2.0 million, less than the amount withheld, resulting in an additional SRS payment of $38.0 million to the O&C counties in May 2013. Legislative issues surrounding O&C management include who should manage the lands, applicability of NWFP and federal environmental laws, sustained yield calculation, allowable sale quantity definition, and county compensation. FY2014 payments are expected to be lower unless Congress changes the law. Options for reauthorizing SRS for FY2015 or other legislative proposals remain for the 114th Congress to consider. The SRS and county payment programs cover compensation basis, funding source, interaction with other programs, and program duration. Concerns arise if new spending increases the deficit without offsets. The issue of federal ownership and management of O&C lands is debated. O&C counties face declining receipts from timber sales since the late 1980s. Despite some increase, receipts remain far below 1989 levels. Reverting to 1989 harvest levels is not feasible under NWFP management. Returning to 1989 harvest levels is not feasible under NWFP management due to economic realities. Congress has considered various legislative proposals for O&C lands, including transferring ownership to private entities or altering management of federal lands. The 113th Congress discussed two O&C legislative proposals, while the 114th Congress may continue these discussions. The 113th Congress considered two O&C legislative proposals, with one bill introduced in January 2015. H.R. 1526 would transfer management authority of O&C lands to a panel appointed by the governor of Oregon, while S. 1784 would retain management authority within the BLM with different management prescriptions based on conservation or forestry emphasis. The House passed H.R. 1526, the Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act, which proposed transferring management authority of O&C lands to an O&C Trust guided by a seven-member advisory board appointed by the governor of Oregon. The trust would have fiduciary responsibilities for the benefit of O&C counties and manage the lands based on a revised definition of sustained-yield, with half on a long-term rotation and the rest on a rotation determined by the board. The federal government would retain ownership of the lands. The proposed O&C Trust would have retained government ownership of the lands, allowing PILT payments to continue. Actions on the trust lands would be exempt from federal reviews under NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. State laws would govern management, with forest stands older than 125 years transferred to the Forest Service. Management of the trust would be deemed compliant with ESA for the northern spotted owl, but other ESA species in Oregon may still require mitigation measures. The bill proposed the creation of the O&C Trust to manage lands in Oregon, with mitigation measures for ESA species like the marbled murrelet and salmon populations. It would limit judicial review to O&C counties, designate new wilderness areas and wild and scenic river sections, and distribute revenue to counties for expenses. Over seven years, $72.8 million would be paid to the federal government, with revenue also going towards conservation and reserve funds. The bill aimed to generate revenue from timber production to support these initiatives. The bill did not address potential timber market reactions to increased supply or prioritize revenue distribution. Title V of H.R. 1526 proposed a one-time SRS payment in February 2015, with O&C counties receiving $27 million less than in FY2010. The Oregon and California Land Grant Act of 2013 would have amended the O&C Act of 1937 to allocate O&C lands for forestry emphasis. The bill proposed allocating O&C lands into forestry and conservation emphasis areas, managed under ecological forestry principles. It aimed to add 700,000 acres to the existing 2.8 million acres through transfers. Forestry emphasis areas would be divided into moist and dry forests with specific management plans, including harvesting 4-6% of moist areas every five years using a variable retention regime. The bill proposed managing O&C lands under ecological forestry principles, with specific plans for moist and dry forests. It aimed to add 700,000 acres through transfers and required one-third of trees to remain standing in clusters. Management would focus on improving fire resiliency by reducing stand density, with priority given to hazardous fuel reduction projects near developed areas. Private citizens could conduct forest management projects within 100 feet of their property. BLM would produce planning documents every five years for vegetation management and environmental reviews under NEPA for dry forestry emphasis areas. The bill proposed managing O&C lands under ecological forestry principles, with specific plans for moist and dry forests. It aimed to add 700,000 acres through transfers and required one-third of trees to remain standing in clusters. BLM would produce planning documents every five years for vegetation management and environmental reviews under NEPA for dry forestry emphasis areas. The environmental reviews would analyze the potential effects of five years of forest management activities, including timber sales, in large-scale and long-term assessments. BLM would not be required to conduct project-level NEPA reviews except in unusual circumstances. Title II of S. 1784 proposed changes in revenue distribution, allocating funds to the U.S. Treasury, BLM for administrative costs, and O&C counties. Both H.R. 1526 and S. 1784 aimed to address O&C lands management, NWFP applicability, federal environmental laws, and county compensation, with differing approaches. Both bills included restrictions on old growth. Both H.R. 1526 and S. 1784 aimed to address O&C lands management, with differing approaches. H.R. 1526 proposed divesting federal authority to state control, while S. 1784 would retain federal authority with specific management prescriptions. Both bills included restrictions on old growth harvests and aimed to streamline environmental analysis procedures. The Oregon and California Land Grant Act of 2015, S. 132, aimed to establish dependable revenue for the 18 O&C counties by altering timber sale revenue distribution. Comparisons of the bill's impacts on county compensation highlighted the variability introduced by assumptions about harvest volumes, revenues, and management costs. Factors beyond federal control, such as market behavior, affect timber volume projections and revenue collection. Assumptions about compliance feasibility and costs with proposed timelines are also crucial. The Land Grant Act of 2015, S. 132, introduced by Senator Wyden on January 8, 2015, is similar to S. 1784 from the 113th Congress."
