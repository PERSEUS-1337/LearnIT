    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates campaign contributions in federal elections by defining contributions as money or anything of value given to influence an election. Contributions are different from expenditures, which involve spending money directly for election advocacy. FECA sets limits on individual contributions to candidates and requires disclosure. In the 2015-2016 election cycle, individuals could contribute up to $2,700 per election to a candidate. The law also prohibits contributions made in someone else's name. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits contributions made in someone else's name to prevent circumventing contribution limits. The law also prohibits corporations from reimbursing employees for campaign contributions. The Supreme Court upholds reasonable limits on contributions to prevent quid pro quo corruption. Federal campaign finance law, under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), includes bans on contributions from corporations, labor unions, and federal government contractors to federal candidates. While the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010 allowed corporate funding of independent expenditures, the ban on corporate contributions to candidates and parties remains. Additionally, \"pay-to-play\" prohibitions prevent federal candidates from accepting or soliciting contributions from government contractors to avoid conflicts of interest. Pay-to-play laws restrict officials from conditioning government contracts on political support. The ban on contractor contributions applies to federal contractors, partnerships, individuals, and sole proprietors. Spouses and employees of federal contractors can make contributions from personal funds. The ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors was upheld by a unanimous en banc U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2015. The court ruled that the ban serves important government interests by preventing corruption and protecting against quid pro quo relationships. The ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2015. The court ruled that the ban serves important government interests by preventing corruption and protecting against quid pro quo relationships. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to the ruling in January 2016. Pay-to-play corruption involves businesses making campaign contributions to secure government contracts or benefits. The prevalence of pay-to-play corruption is more common at the state and local level due to a complicit political culture. Federal contractors are prohibited from making campaign contributions, reducing corruption instances at the federal level. The federal level has strict regulations to prevent corruption in contracting, including banning campaign contributions from federal contractors since 1940. Federal regulations emphasize competitive vendor selection and aim to protect the procurement process from political influences. Additionally, candidates are prohibited from accepting contributions from foreign nationals under FECA. Foreign nationals, except lawful permanent residents, are prohibited from making contributions to U.S. elections. FEC guidance states that foreign corporations cannot finance contributions or participate in PAC operations. The Supreme Court affirmed the prohibition on foreign nationals making campaign contributions in 2012, citing the compelling interest in limiting foreign citizen participation in American democratic self-government to prevent foreign influence. Candidate campaign committees must register with the FEC and disclose contributions over $200. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of disclosure requirements. The Court has upheld disclosure requirements as related to safeguarding the electoral process by promoting transparency. Communication coordinated with a candidate may be treated as a contribution subject to regulation. The line between coordinated communications and independent expenditures is based on Supreme Court precedent, which allows unlimited independent expenditures without coordination. The FEC regulations establish criteria for determining coordination between a candidate and the source of expenditure, allowing for unlimited independent expenditures by individuals, political parties, PACs, Super PACs, corporations, and labor unions. The regulations include \"content\" and \"conduct\" standards to define coordinated communications with candidates. The FEC regulations set criteria for coordination between candidates and expenditure sources, allowing independent expenditures. Content and conduct standards define coordinated communications with candidates, including electioneering communications and interactions with candidates or parties. FECA also prohibits the conversion of campaign funds for personal use. The law prohibits the conversion of campaign funds for personal use, including expenses like home mortgage, clothing purchases, and entertainment not associated with the campaign. Violations involving $25,000 or more per year can result in criminal penalties under Title 18 of the United States Code. Violations of the law involving $25,000 or more per calendar year can lead to fines, imprisonment for up to five years, or both under Title 18 of the United States Code. For amounts between $2,000 and $25,000, penalties include fines, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. Knowing and willful violations of contribution prohibitions can result in specific penalties. Violators may face imprisonment for up to two years for amounts over $10,000 but less than $25,000, and up to five years for amounts over $25,000. The U.S. Department of Justice typically handles criminal prosecutions, but the FEC can also refer violations for prosecution. The FEC may refer violations of campaign finance laws involving over $2,000 to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. This includes violations of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act. Additionally, federal political corruption provisions restrict the use of campaign contributions to influence official acts by elected officials. Political corruption laws aim to prevent bribery, illegal gratuities, extortion, and honest services fraud. These laws penalize both the giver and receiver of unlawful contributions. Bribery involves accepting something of value in exchange for official acts, illegal gratuities involve receiving a gift because of an official act, and extortion involves demanding a contribution for an official act. The federal bribery statute prohibits public officials from receiving private benefits in exchange for actions taken in their official capacity. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonnell regarding what constitutes an official act by an elected official has broad implications in this area of law. Campaign contributions to federal candidates could be considered bribes if they involve a corrupt agreement for influencing official acts. Key issues include determining if the individual is a public official, the presence of a quid pro quo agreement, and what actions qualify as official acts. The federal prohibition on bribes applies broadly to public officials, including Members of Congress, officers, employees, and individuals selected for public office. Unlike other criminal provisions, this prohibition requires a specific intent to commit the prohibited act. The federal prohibition on bribes requires a specific intent to commit a \"corrupt\" act, often involving a quid pro quo agreement. Bribery is considered a blatant form of public corruption, requiring an agreement in advance, although it does not need to be explicitly stated. Identification of a quid pro quo or corrupt agreement in campaign contributions depends on specific transaction details. Evidence of an agreement linking official acts to contributions is necessary. Contributions made to create a favorable relationship without an agreement are not considered bribes. Simply donating to a campaign and receiving a favorable act later does not prove quid pro quo. However, if a public official indicates support for legislation in exchange for a campaign contribution, it constitutes influence. Campaign contributions to a candidate or official can be considered bribes if there is evidence of a corrupt agreement or quid pro quo arrangement. Without such an agreement, contributions given in support or appreciation for official positions are not considered bribes. Contributions imply a relationship where the donor expects the candidate to act in their interests. Campaign contributions to candidates for public office are linked to expectations of reciprocity, where donors anticipate favorable representation of their interests. Unlike bribes, lawful contributions do not create overriding obligations. The bribery statute requires a thing of value to be received in exchange for influencing an official act, broadly defined as any decision or action on governmental matters by a public official in their official capacity. In the context of campaign contributions, official acts by a government official involve actions on governmental matters, including recommending policies or intervening on behalf of a private party. Such acts may be performed in a legislative or representational capacity, and can influence decisions or actions on official governmental matters. Contributors making contributions for access or meetings with public officials may raise questions about bribery statutes. The Department of Justice clarified that access in exchange for contributions is not considered an \"official act\" for bribery prosecution. In United States v. Carpenter, granting or denying access to present views to a legislator was not deemed an official act. In United States v. Sawyer, the court ruled that simply desiring access to a legislator does not constitute intent to improperly influence official duties. Offering special access to generous contributors is seen as a common practice in political fundraising, described as an \"access\" payment. Granting or denying access based on contributions should not be criminalized as it is considered unavoidable in our campaign funding system. The Supreme Court has stated that granting or denying access to elected officials based on campaign contributions should not be criminalized, as it is considered unavoidable in our campaign funding system. While this may offend Americans' sense of equal representation and fairness, it has not been deemed as corrupt behavior involving an official act. In McDonnell v. United States, the Supreme Court clarified the scope of federal public corruption laws, overturning the conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell for trading official favors for personal gifts. The Court defined a more limited enforcement scope than federal law enforcement authorities had argued for. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell for trading official favors for personal gifts. The Court ruled that arranging meetings and hosting events for a constituent did not meet the threshold of an official act under the bribery statute unless there was evidence of prohibited corrupt activity. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell for trading official favors for personal gifts. The Court ruled that \"official acts\" must relate to formal exercises of governmental power and involve a decision or action by a public official. Federal law also prohibits illegal gratuities, penalizing public officials who seek or accept something of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed. The bribery statute prohibits offering or giving illegal gratuities to public officials, regulating behavior of both donors and recipients. Illegal gratuities differ from bribery as they do not require corrupt intent or evidence of a quid pro quo. A thing of value can be received as a \"thank you\" even after the official act is performed. The distinction between bribery and illegal gratuities lies in the intent behind the act. Bribery requires a quid pro quo, where something of value is exchanged for an official act, while illegal gratuities only require the act to be done \"for or because of\" the gratuity. The intent element is crucial in determining whether a donation constitutes a bribe or an illegal gratuity. The intent behind illegal gratuities is crucial, as it involves receiving a payment for a specific official act, without the need for a quid pro quo. The recipient must have knowledge that they are being rewarded for a particular act, distinguishing it from a mere gift or lawful campaign contribution. The intent behind illegal gratuities involves receiving payment for a specific official act with guilty knowledge, as defined by the Supreme Court. While there is a lower standard of intent for illegal gratuities, lawful campaign contributions given for official acts are generally not considered illegal gratuities. Improper campaign contributions are scrutinized under campaign finance laws. Federal candidates must have a campaign committee for contributions, which cannot be used for personal gain. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia clarified that campaign contributions directed to a lawfully conducted campaign committee or other entity are not prohibited. However, if contributions are used to financially benefit a public official personally, it may be considered a violation of campaign finance laws. In the United States v. Brewster case, campaign contributions used for personal expenses of a public official were considered illegal gratuities. The court found that monies given as campaign contributions were used by a sham committee as the Senator's \"alter ego\" for personal expenses. This was separate from bribery and illegal gratuities, and related to the Hobbs Act. The Hobbs Act prohibits interference with commerce through extortion, distinct from bribery and illegal gratuities. Extortion involves public officials using their position to demand contributions, defined as obtaining property through wrongful use of force or fear. Federal courts view extortion and bribery as closely related offenses with parallel intent requirements. Elected officials demanding payments from private citizens, like campaign contributions, even if made to third parties, may constitute extortion. The Hobbs Act prohibits interference with commerce through extortion, where public officials misuse their position to demand contributions. Elected officials requesting payments, even to third parties like campaign committees, may be considered extortion if there is evidence of wrongful use of their official position. The Supreme Court has clarified that genuine campaign contributions do not violate the law unless there is a specific quid pro quo, similar to bribery. Simply linking official acts and campaign contributions in time does not constitute extortion under the law. The Supreme Court clarified that genuine campaign contributions do not violate the law unless there is a specific quid pro quo, similar to bribery. Simply linking official acts and campaign contributions in time does not constitute extortion under the law. The Court found that a request for a voluntary campaign contribution would only violate the statute if it is made in exchange for an explicit promise by the official to perform or not perform an official act, where the official asserts that their conduct will be controlled by the promise. Serving constituents and supporting beneficial legislation is part of a legislator's everyday business, while campaigns must be financed through constant solicitation of money on behalf of candidates. The Supreme Court clarified that linking official acts and campaign contributions in time does not constitute extortion under the law. Legislators supporting beneficial legislation for constituents and soliciting campaign contributions are unavoidable due to private financing of election campaigns. The Supreme Court clarified that campaign contributions made with the hope of favorable treatment in the future do not constitute extortion under the law. Understanding the terms of a bargain to exchange official action for money goes beyond mere anticipation and falls under the Hobbs Act's prohibition. This understanding can be inferred from both direct and circumstantial evidence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld extortion convictions of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich under the Hobbs Act, stating that a quid pro quo does not have to be explicitly demanded. Non-verbal understandings can also amount to extortion, and corruption in the political process is prohibited under federal wire and mail fraud statutes. The federal wire and mail fraud statutes prohibit schemes to defraud using wire communications or the mail. In 1988, Congress amended the law to include the \"intangible right of honest services\" in the definition of fraud. This provision, known as honest services fraud, was initially unclear but could apply to public officials engaging in activities that deprive the public of unbiased services. In 2010, the Supreme Court clarified the application of the honest services fraud provision, narrowing its scope to schemes involving bribery or kickbacks. Recent court cases have further clarified that the government does not need to prove an explicit quid pro quo bribery scheme, but can infer intent from the evidence. In 2016, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the link between bribery and honest services fraud in the case of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell. The Court used the bribery statute to determine if acts by a public official should be considered \"official acts.\""
