Recognition of the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity is acknowledged by the United States, allowing the Native Hawaiian people to organize and adopt governing documents. The process for recognition involves submitting these documents to the Secretary within 90 days of their adoption. The Secretary certifies that the organic governing documents of the Native Hawaiian governing entity establish citizenship criteria, were adopted by majority vote, provide for governmental authorities, allow negotiations with governments and entities, and prevent certain actions like sale or lease.

Civil rights protection and compliance with federal requirements are also ensured. The Secretary must certify State of Hawaii's support for the recognition of the Native Hawaiian governing entity by the United States within 90 days of receiving their organic governing documents. Resubmission is required in case of noncompliance. If the Secretary finds that the organic governing documents of the Native Hawaiian entity do not meet criteria or are inconsistent with federal law, they must be resubmitted with justifications for the findings. The Native Hawaiian governing entity must amend and resubmit their organic governing documents to comply with federal law and address specific criteria if requested by the Secretary. Upon the election of officers of the Native Hawaiian governing entity and the Secretary's certifications, the United States extends Federal recognition to the entity if no action is taken within 90 days of document submission. The United States extends Federal recognition to the Native Hawaiian governing entity as the representative body of the Native Hawaiian people. Authorization of appropriations is granted for activities in this Act. Federal authority delegation and negotiations are reaffirmed. SEC. 8 reaffirms the delegation of federal authority to Hawaii for the indigenous people and authorizes negotiations for the transfer of lands and resources to the Native Hawaiian governing entity.

SEC. 9 states that the Native Hawaiian governing entity is not authorized to conduct gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It also clarifies that eligibility for programs and services provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs is not extended to those not otherwise eligible. SEC. 10 ensures that if any section of the Act is deemed invalid, the remaining sections will still be in effect."
