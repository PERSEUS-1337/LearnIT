    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Higher Education Opportunity Through Pell Grant Expansion Act\". The Senate acknowledges the importance of higher education opportunities. The Senate finds that Federal Pell Grants are need-based, used by 5.3 million undergraduates, with over 90% coming from families earning less than $40,000. The maximum grant amount has decreased in real terms, covering only 23% of the total cost of public college. It is the Senate's sense that eligible undergraduates should receive the maximum grant amount. The amendment aims to establish the maximum Federal Pell Grant amount, with sufficient funds appropriated to award eligible students the maximum grant. The amendment aims to establish the maximum Federal Pell Grant amount. The amendment authorizes an additional $2 billion for Federal Pell Grants for the fiscal year 2006. The maximum Federal Pell Grant amount is set at $5,100 for the academic year 2005-2006. The Secretary will adjust the contribution amount for each student every 2 academic years starting from 2006-2007 based on the Consumer Price Index. SEC. 4. ALLOWANCE FOR STATE AND OTHER TAXES. The updates to the allowance for State and other taxes in the Federal Needs Analysis Methodology for the award year 2005-2006 will not increase a student's expected family contribution under part F of the Higher Education Act of 1965. SEC. 5. TERMINATION OF EXCESSIVE ALLOWANCES. Section 438(b)(2)(B) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to exclude certain loans from the subparagraph, including those made or purchased after the enactment of the Higher Education Opportunity Through Pell Grant Expansion Act, loans that did not qualify for special allowance payments before the enactment date, and loans made or purchased before the enactment date. The amendment excludes certain loans from Section 438(b)(2)(B) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, including those made or purchased before the enactment of the Higher Education Opportunity Through Pell Grant Expansion Act, if certain conditions are met. SEC. 6. WINDFALL PROFIT OFFSET. Amends Section 438 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require eligible lenders to pay a windfall profit offset to the Treasury if they do not receive special allowance payments, based on interest received from borrowers on loans made under this part."
