    "content": "During the 115th Congress, committees held hearings on opioid-related topics and members introduced over 150 bills related to opioids. President Trump signed the SUPPORT Act into law on October 24, 2018, to address overprescribing and abuse of opioids in the United States. The SUPPORT Act, signed into law in 2018, aims to address the opioid crisis in the United States by increasing access to buprenorphine. In 2017, an estimated 11.4 million individuals aged 12 or older in the U.S. used heroin or misused prescription pain relievers, with 2 million meeting criteria for an opioid use disorder. Only a minority of those with a substance use disorder receive specialty treatment, with 21.1% of those with any opioid use disorder receiving specialty substance use treatment in 2016. This CRS report focuses on the effectiveness and demand for buprenorphine as a treatment for opioid use disorder. The report focuses on the effectiveness of buprenorphine as a treatment for opioid use disorder in adults, based on a systematic review of research. The methodology for the review is detailed in the Appendix. The effectiveness of buprenorphine varies due to different formulations available. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms without producing euphoria. Its effectiveness varies based on different formulations and comparisons to other treatments, with considerations for safety risks and individual circumstances. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist approved by the FDA in 1981, has lower abuse potential and overdose risk compared to methadone. It was later approved for opioid use disorder treatment as Subutex\u00ae and Suboxone\u00ae, the latter combining buprenorphine with naloxone to reduce abuse risk. FDA has since approved various forms of buprenorphine for opioid use disorders. Research has shown buprenorphine to be effective for treating opioid dependence, with higher doses of 16mg or more being most effective. Flexible dosing is the current standard of care for buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine is effective for treating opioid dependence with flexible dosing. It is equally effective as methadone but has less abuse potential and overdose risk. Abrupt discontinuation leads to milder withdrawal symptoms. Treatment retention rates may be lower compared to methadone. Retention in substance abuse treatment is crucial for achieving abstinence from drug use. Research suggests that higher doses of buprenorphine and longer tapering periods increase retention rates. This also leads to greater abstinence from opioids and successful treatment completion. Studies suggest that methadone may be more effective in retaining participants in treatment compared to buprenorphine. This could be due to buprenorphine being a partial opioid agonist, resulting in less satisfaction and slower dose adjustments. Buprenorphine may not retain individuals as well due to lingering withdrawal symptoms and easier discontinuation without withdrawal effects. However, it carries a risk for addiction and overdose. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, has lower abuse potential compared to full agonists like heroin or methadone. Overdoses from buprenorphine alone are rare, with most occurring when combined with other drugs. Combining buprenorphine with naloxone discourages misuse via injection, reducing abuse and overdose rates. Preliminary evidence suggests buprenorphine may be a safer treatment option than methadone. Research comparing buprenorphine and methadone suggests buprenorphine is safer, with lower abuse potential and fewer fatalities. Patients on buprenorphine had fewer ambulatory care visits, indicating better health and safety outcomes. Methadone is associated with higher mortality potential in the initial treatment weeks. Buprenorphine also shows lower rates of opioid overdose compared to methadone. Comparison of buprenorphine and methadone for opioid addiction treatment in the United States shows differences in successful outcomes based on the type of opioid abused. Buprenorphine appears more effective for individuals primarily abusing prescription pain medication, while heroin users have less positive outcomes. The transition from prescription opioids to heroin may impact the effectiveness of buprenorphine treatment. The rise in opioid misuse has led to a significant increase in opioid-related deaths and hospital admissions. Despite the need for effective treatments, many individuals do not receive the necessary care. Buprenorphine is one of the medications used to treat opioid addiction, but its effectiveness may vary based on the type of opioid abused. The transition from prescription opioids to heroin can impact the success of buprenorphine treatment. The misuse of opioid pain medications is prevalent, with an estimated 11.4 million people aged 12 and older misusing opioids in 2017. The financial costs of this epidemic are substantial, with estimates reaching $504 billion in 2015. Buprenorphine is regulated differently for opioid use disorder than for pain management. Buprenorphine is regulated differently for opioid use disorder than for pain management, with limits on who can prescribe it and how it can be accessed. It can be used within a federally certified opioid treatment program or outside with a waiver. When used within a program, buprenorphine is administered on-site, requiring frequent visits. A patient can receive buprenorphine at an OTP with daily visits, or through a practitioner with a DATA waiver. Buprenorphine is the only medication that meets the conditions for the waiver. Practitioners must notify the HHS Secretary to qualify for the waiver. The Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary must be notified by practitioners intending to use buprenorphine for treating opioid use disorders. They must certify as qualifying practitioners, refer patients for counseling, and comply with patient limits. The patient limit starts at 30 individuals and can increase to 100 after one year or immediately with additional credentials. The SUPPORT Act removed temporary authority for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to obtain DATA waivers, expanding the definition of \"qualifying other practitioners.\" The SUPPORT Act removed temporary authority for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to obtain DATA waivers, expanding the definition of \"qualifying other practitioners\" to include clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. Qualifying nurse practitioners and physician assistants may obtain waivers permanently, while other practitioners are authorized to obtain DATA waivers until October 1, 2023. Congress imposed restrictions on opioid substitution therapy with buprenorphine, including patient limits, despite its favorable safety profile compared to methadone. The CSA was amended to allow qualifying physicians to treat opioid addiction with buprenorphine, with a patient limit of 30 individuals. In 2006, the patient limit could be increased to 100 after one year for DATA-waived physicians. Legislation expanded eligibility for DATA waivers to other clinicians. HHS proposed raising the patient limit to 200 in 2016 to increase patient capacity while ensuring quality of care and minimizing diversion. HHS set the new DATA waiver patient limit at 275, a conservative estimate based on survey data. The SUPPORT Act allows practitioners to increase the patient limit to 275 after one year of maintaining a waiver. Additional credentialing or operating in a qualified practice setting can allow immediate treatment of up to 100 patients under the amended CSA. Since 2003, efforts to address the opioid epidemic have led to increased treatment availability. The number of facilities offering buprenorphine treatment has risen significantly, with a notable increase in both OTPs and non-OTPs providing this service. The proportion of facilities offering buprenorphine treatment has nearly doubled from 2007 to 2017. The availability of buprenorphine treatment has significantly increased from 14% in 2007 to 29% in 2017. The number of facilities offering buprenorphine has also risen, with a notable increase in providers. The proportion of clients receiving buprenorphine at substance use facilities has grown from less than 1% in 2007 to 8% in 2017. The number of DATA-waived providers has also increased, with a significant rise in physicians with patient limits. The availability of buprenorphine treatment has increased significantly, with a rise in DATA-waived providers and facilities offering buprenorphine. As of December 1, 2018, over 40,000 providers had a 30-patient limit, over 11,000 had a 100-patient limit, and over 4,500 had a 275-patient limit. This capacity allows for almost 3.6 million patients to be treated with buprenorphine, but access to treatment has not kept pace with the rising rates of opioid addiction in the United States. In 2012, there was a significant gap between the number of people with opioid dependence and the treatment capacity for methadone and buprenorphine in the U.S. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia had higher rates of opioid abuse than available buprenorphine treatment. Admissions for prescription opioid abuse in substance abuse treatment facilities increased fourfold from 2002 to 2014. In 2015, only 18.3% of individuals needing treatment for illicit drug problems, including prescription opioids, received it. In 2016, 21.1% of those with opioid use disorder received specialty treatment. A study in Massachusetts found that less than one-third of individuals hospitalized for a nonfatal opioid overdose received medication-assisted treatment in the following year. Despite an increase in DATA-waivers for buprenorphine treatment, providers are not treating to capacity. Geography plays a role in the treatment gap, with the location of services being more crucial than treatment capacity. Factors affecting the treatment gap include health insurance coverage, reimbursement, transportation, stigma, awareness, and motivation for recovery. The cost of buprenorphine varies depending on various factors, with estimates ranging from $115 to $5,980 per year. Research suggests buprenorphine may be cheaper than other medication-assisted treatments. Studies comparing the costs of buprenorphine and methadone treatments have shown that buprenorphine may be cheaper, with estimates suggesting costs could be up to 49% lower. A study at a Veterans Affairs medical center found that the average cost of six months of buprenorphine treatment was $11,597, compared to $14,921 for methadone. Indirect costs were also higher for the methadone group, with more ambulatory care visits. Preliminary studies on a subdermal formulation of buprenorphine approved in 2016 indicate lower total costs compared to other forms of treatment. The cost effectiveness of buprenorphine compared to methadone is still uncertain and requires further research. Medicare reimbursement for prescription drugs varies depending on the setting and administration method. Studies have shown that buprenorphine treatment costs may be lower than methadone, but findings may not be representative across all medical centers or settings. Medicare Part D covers FDA-approved drugs available by prescription for medically accepted indications not covered under Parts A or B. Buprenorphine can be administered in an OTP or outside with a DATA waiver. Medicare does not reimburse OTPs for buprenorphine. Part B covers long-acting forms of buprenorphine if administered by a physician for opioid use disorder management. Since January 1, 2018, Medicare Part B provides payment for insertion, removal, and removal with reinsertion of buprenorphine subdermal implants. Part B does not cover self-administered drugs used during a provider visit. Medicare Part D plans must cover buprenorphine and other self-administered drugs used in MAT for opioid use disorder, either on their formularies or through a coverage exception request. Part D plans also must provide a transition supply of drugs for new enrollees already in treatment for opioid use disorder. Medicare Part D plans must cover buprenorphine and other self-administered drugs used in MAT for opioid use disorder, with low enrollee cost-sharing expected. Medicaid programs in all 48 states surveyed cover buprenorphine, with some states imposing limits such as prior authorization requirements. Buprenorphine is covered by state Medicaid programs, but coverage may vary based on specific forms or conditions. Some states require beneficiaries to enroll in MAT therapy or counseling before receiving buprenorphine. Despite the rise in opioid abuse, buprenorphine is considered an effective treatment for opioid dependence, although many individuals in need of treatment do not receive it. Despite the rise in opioid abuse and overdose deaths, many individuals in need of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder do not receive it due to carefully regulated prescribing practices. Efforts have been made by Congress and the executive branch to increase access to buprenorphine treatment while balancing potential risks. Policymakers continue to grapple with the opioid crisis, waiting for new data to assess the impact of current efforts. Maintaining quality standards for buprenorphine providers while ensuring access may prove challenging. The CRS report conducted a systematic review in August 2017 on buprenorphine's effectiveness in treating opioid dependence compared to other interventions. Systematic reviews compile relevant empirical evidence using explicit methods to provide better estimations of performance and generalizability. The aim was to assess buprenorphine's efficacy in outpatient community settings in the United States. The CRS report conducted a systematic review in August 2017 on buprenorphine's effectiveness in treating opioid dependence in outpatient community settings in the United States. The review focused on primary and secondary analyses of studies published in the past five years, excluding those on efficacy, inpatient settings, withdrawal, or outside the US. PubMed, PyscINFO, and CINAHL were used to identify relevant articles. The CRS report summarized 16 articles on buprenorphine's effectiveness in treating opioid dependence in outpatient community settings in the US. Table A-2 provides details on participants, study design, aims, and conclusions of each article."
