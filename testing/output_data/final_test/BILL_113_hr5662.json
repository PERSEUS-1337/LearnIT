The \"CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act of 2014\" expands the denial of deduction for excessive employee remuneration under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a publicly held corporation fails to meet the pay fairness requirement, no deduction is allowed for applicable employee remuneration exceeding $1,000,000. The \"CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act of 2014\" expands the denial of deduction for excessive employee remuneration under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The term 'employee' includes officers, directors, and former employees of the taxpayer. The pay fairness requirement is met if the average compensation paid to all applicable United States employees exceeds the inflation-adjusted average from the previous year. The \"CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act of 2014\" expands the denial of deduction for excessive employee remuneration under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The term 'employee' includes officers, directors, and former employees of the taxpayer. The pay fairness requirement is met if the average compensation paid to all applicable United States employees exceeds the inflation-adjusted average from the previous year. Applicable United States employees are those whose services are mainly within the U.S. and whose compensation does not exceed a certain amount. The inflation and productivity growth adjusted average of compensation for any taxable year is determined by multiplying the average compensation paid to all applicable United States employees by the sum of the cost-of-living adjustment and productivity adjustment for the year. The cost-of-living adjustment for a taxable year is determined based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. Additionally, the productivity adjustment for the taxable year is calculated as the average annual increase in the business productivity index. The business productivity index, adjusted for depreciation, is used to calculate the productivity adjustment for the taxable year. Compensation includes the employee's wages subject to the tax under section 3101(b). The Secretary may prescribe regulations necessary for this paragraph, including adjustments to pay fairness requirements to prevent avoidance and account for workforce changes. The definition of covered employees under section 162(m) of the Code is modified to include the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the taxpayer at any time during the taxable year. This modification accounts for workforce changes such as mergers, spinoffs, or changes in the composition of the taxpayer's workforce. The definition of covered employees under section 162(m) of the Code is modified to include individuals described in subparagraph (A) and employees who were covered in preceding taxable years after December 31, 2014. Additionally, a technical amendment changes the number of highest paid employees from 4 to 3. Employee remuneration paid to beneficiaries is also addressed in the amendment. The amendment to section 162(m) of the Code expands the definition of covered employees to include individuals described in subparagraph (A) and employees covered in preceding taxable years after December 31, 2014. It also addresses employee remuneration paid to beneficiaries, including after the death of the covered employee. Additionally, publicly held corporations are now defined as any corporation that is an issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014 for corporations with registered securities under section 12 or required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
