    "content": "The \"Consumer Drone Safety Act\" requires safety requirements for operating consumer drones. The Administrator must publish a final rule within 18 months containing safety requirements for operating consumer drones for hobby or recreational use. The rule will include a maximum altitude for flight and restrictions on flights in certain circumstances or areas to prevent unsafe interactions with manned aircraft. The final rule for operating consumer drones for hobby or recreational use will include restrictions on flights in certain circumstances or areas to prevent unsafe interactions with manned aircraft, such as within an unsafe distance from airports or in the flight path of a manned aircraft. Other limitations may include flights near urban areas, residential areas, infrastructure, amusement parks, or public areas with spectators, as well as weather or time of day restrictions to minimize collision risks. Additionally, the Administrator may impose any other necessary requirements to ensure the safety of the national airspace system and persons and property on the ground. Safety requirements for manufacturers of consumer drones are outlined in Section 3. The Administrator must publish safety requirements for consumer drones within 18 months of this Act. Requirements include altitude limitations, prevention of unauthorized operation near airports, collision avoidance systems, and safety measures in case of lost communication with the operator. The safety requirements for consumer drones include autonomous landing, detectability to pilots and air traffic controllers, prevention of tampering, educational materials for consumers, and any other requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator. The final rule required by subsection (a) will include safety requirements for consumer drones, such as autonomous landing and detectability to pilots. Consumer drones distributed before the rule's publication must be modified by the manufacturer to meet these requirements, with the Administrator having the authority to authorize operation for drones that cannot be fully updated. Notification provisions will also be included in the final rule. The final rule required by subsection (a) will include safety requirements for consumer drones, with provisions for publicizing modifications and notifying owners. The Administrator may exempt certain drones from requirements if compliance is technologically infeasible or cost-prohibitive, and if it does not pose a hazard to airspace users or national security. The Administrator establishes safety requirements for consumer drones in the national airspace system and may exempt certain drones if compliance is technologically infeasible or cost-prohibitive. Safety determination is required for the operation of consumer drones in the national airspace system. No person can operate a consumer drone in the national airspace system without specific authority from the Federal Aviation Administration, which requires a safety determination to ensure no endangerment to the airspace system or individuals. The Administrator's authority is not terminated by any specific provision. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATIONS OF AGENCY AUTHORITY. The Administrator has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Act or regulations, similar to penalties for violations of other related laws. This does not limit the Administrator's enforcement actions for any violations. Beginning 120 days after the enactment of this Act, FAA Advisory Circular 91-57 will no longer authorize the operation of non-compliant consumer drones for recreational purposes. The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection can enforce import restrictions on consumer drones. This Act does not limit the Administrator's authority to regulate drone operations. The Act limits the Administrator's authority to regulate consumer drones and enforce actions against those endangering national airspace safety. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The term \"automatic stabilization system\" is defined as a system that can maintain stable flight without operator control input, coordinating elements of the propulsion system or flight control surfaces of an aircraft. The term \"civil\" in relation to an unmanned aircraft system means it is not a public aircraft. A \"consumer drone\" refers to a civil unmanned aircraft equipped with an automatic stabilization system or capable of providing video. A \"consumer drone\" is a civil unmanned aircraft capable of providing a video signal for operation beyond the visual line of sight, weighing 55 pounds or less, or certified under FAA regulations. This term also includes kits of component parts that would constitute a consumer drone when assembled for commercial distribution. A \"nationwide community-based organization\" is a membership-based association representing the aeromodeling community in the US. It provides safety guidelines for aeromodeling operations, collaborates with educational institutions and government entities, and advocates for its members. Protected airspace includes various types of airspace. The curr_chunk discusses different types of airspace, including special use airspace and other airspace determined by the Administrator. It also defines \"specific authority\" as various permits or authorizations issued by the FAA for operating consumer drones in the national airspace system. The curr_chunk explains the regulations for operating consumer drones in the national airspace system, referencing FAA guidelines and definitions for unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 is amended to include the definition of a nationwide community-based organization as defined in the Consumer Drone Safety Act."
