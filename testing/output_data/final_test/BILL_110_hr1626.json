    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Family Health Care Accessibility Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that Community Health Centers provide primary and preventive health care services to over 15,000,000 low-income families, with nearly 70 percent of patients living below the poverty line. The number of uninsured patients at CHCs is increasing, while the number of physicians available to treat them is decreasing. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports high vacancy rates for family physicians, internists, OB-GYNs, and psychiatrists at CHCs. Physicians hired by CHCs are covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act for medical liability costs, but volunteers are not. Limited resources hinder CHCs from meeting the needs of the uninsured and underinsured, with physicians willing to volunteer but deterred by the cost of medical liability insurance. Extending Federal Tort Claims Act coverage to volunteers could help address this issue. Extending Federal Tort Claims Act coverage to volunteer physicians at CHCs would increase patient access and reduce costs. SEC. 3.
