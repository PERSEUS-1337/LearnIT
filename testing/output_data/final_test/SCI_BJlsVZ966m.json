    "content": "The proposed framework for entity and event extraction is based on generative adversarial imitation learning using a GAN. Discriminators are used to estimate rewards by comparing labels from ground-truth and the extractor. Experiments show that this framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in event extraction, which focuses on extracting structured information from unstructured texts. The current research has shown promising results in extracting related text documents and incorporating rich features from multiple categories using neural network frameworks. Despite challenges, such as different interpretations of words like \"death\" in legal contexts, supervised models aim to mimic the probability distribution seen in the training set. Supervised models in text classification struggle with wrong and confusing labels, leading to errors in prediction. Many approaches focus on boosting correct labels but fail to adequately address incorrect labels. Models trained to pursue correct labels become vulnerable to mistakes in ambiguous instances where wrong labels are not suppressed. Exploring information from wrong labels is crucial to improving model robustness. In this paper, a dynamic mechanism called inverse reinforcement learning is proposed to assess correct and wrong labels in entity and event extraction. Discriminators from generative adversarial networks are used to estimate reward values, ensuring the highest reward for ground-truth labels. The framework applies reinforcement learning to event extraction tasks, aiming to deviate the extractor from wrong labels by expanding the margins between rewards for ground-truth and wrong labels. The proposed framework utilizes inverse reinforcement learning with GAN to improve performance in event extraction tasks by extracting entities, event triggers, and determining argument roles. The framework follows the ACE schema to detect entities, event triggers, and event arguments from unstructured text. The framework utilizes inverse reinforcement learning with GAN to improve event extraction tasks by labeling entities, event triggers, and argument roles in text. The extractor is trained to follow ground truth labels and receives rewards based on its performance. The framework utilizes inverse reinforcement learning with GAN to improve event extraction tasks by labeling entities, event triggers, and argument roles in text. The reward estimator is trained based on the difference between ground truth labels and extractor's labels. The penalty is strengthened for repeated mistakes, and the extractor improves by pursuing maximized rewards through Q-Learning. The extractor uses Q-Learning to identify entities and event triggers, while policy gradient determines relations between them. GANs estimate rewards during training to optimize the joint model. Entity and trigger detection is seen as a sequence labeling problem with long-term dependencies, making reinforcement learning suitable. The extractor explores natural language sentences, observing the environment and previous actions to make labeling decisions. The extractor uses Q-Learning and policy gradient for entity and event trigger identification, with GANs estimating rewards. It explores sentences, considering environment and previous actions for labeling decisions. The current state is determined by information and previous action, leading to a new state. Q-tables are generated to determine current actions, with an RNN-based framework using LSTM. BIO tagging like \"B-Meet\" is used in the pipeline. In this work, Q-learning is used to optimize sequence labeling for entity and event triggers. Rewards are fixed for correct/wrong labels, and a discount factor is applied. The Q-value is updated using the Bellman Equation to approximate an optimal model. The Q-value is updated using the Bellman Equation to approximate an optimal model. The extractor determines entities and triggers, then pairs them to determine their roles in events triggered by each other. Context embeddings of triggers and argument candidates are observed to optimize parameters in the neural network. The extractor optimizes neural network parameters by observing context embeddings of triggers and argument candidates, determining their roles in events triggered by each other. It includes representations of entity and event types to determine available argument role labels. The extractor optimizes neural network parameters to determine argument role labels in events triggered by context embeddings of triggers and argument candidates. It utilizes a reward system and a Policy Gradient algorithm to improve argument role labeling performance. The parameters are updated by minimizing a loss function, encouraging correct label predictions. In argument role labeling, the reward system encourages correct label predictions by increasing the probability of the correct action and decreasing the probability of the wrong action. Different choices of RL algorithms are used in sequence labeling tasks due to the high variance of future rewards. Q-learning is preferred as it only requires rewards on current actions, making it easier to constrain. In argument role labeling, the reward system encourages correct label predictions by increasing the probability of the correct action and decreasing the probability of the wrong action. Q-learning is preferred as it only requires rewards on current actions, making it easier to constrain. The policy gradient approach performs correctly with negative rewards for wrong actions and positive for correct ones. However, the one-step property impacts Q-learning as a small positive reward on the current correct label may make the updated Q-value smaller than those of wrong ones. The reward values in the examples are fixed, typically with c1 > c2, making the RL-based approach similar to classification approaches with cross-entropy in terms of \"treating wrong labels equally.\" Recent RL approaches on relation extraction adopt a fixed setting of reward values. In relation extraction using RL approaches, fixed reward values are set for entity and relation detection phases, requiring additional tuning when switching datasets. Errors in event extraction tasks should be evaluated case by case, with the extractor expected to output more correct labels as epochs progress. However, repeated mistakes or being stuck in difficult cases can hinder progress. In event extraction tasks, errors can hinder progress and are punishable by death. A mechanism is needed to assess challenges and correct them with rewards. The training approach involves an agent imitating an expert, with rewards issued for correct labels. Inverse Reinforcement Learning estimates rewards in a scenario of adversary between ground truth and extractor, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning fits such adversarial nature. In GAIL framework, the agent A replaces the generator in GAN, committing labels to the discriminator D which serves as a reward estimator. Rewards are issued for correct labels from the expert E or identical ones from the agent, while lower rewards are given for wrong labels. The output of D and rewards are equivalent, ensuring optimal performance in sequence and argument role labeling tasks. In the role labeling task, the input for the \"real data\" channel consists of representations from all elements mentioned in Equation 6, while the input for the \"generator\" channel includes representations from the extractor. There are 34 discriminators in the framework, each with 2 fully-connected layers and a sigmoid output. The output probabilities from the discriminator are transformed using linear transformation. The GAN structure in sequence labeling scenario is illustrated in Figure 5. In the GAN framework for role labeling, real data is replaced by feature/state representation and ground-truth labels, while generator data consists of features and extractor's attempt labels. The discriminator acts as a reward estimator, with a linear transform extending its output range. Parameters are optimized in the neural network to minimize loss function, with features, extractor labels, and ground-truth collected during training. In the GAN framework for role labeling, the discriminators use extractor labels and ground-truth to update and train the extractor. The margin of rewards between correct and wrong labels expands as the discriminators are optimized, leading to more discriminative Q-values and P(a|s) in sequence and argument role labeling tasks. Figure 5 illustrates how GAN is utilized for reward estimation. In training, the extractor selects labels based on Q-values rankings and GANs issue rewards to update Q-tables and policy probabilities. A hard margin is imposed to ensure correct actions receive positive rewards and wrong ones negative. The extractor explores all possible labels using a -greedy strategy before committing to a label, updating neural networks with richer information. After exploring all labels with a -greedy strategy, the extractor commits to ground-truth labels and receives expert rewards to update parameters. This approach combines supervised models with RL loss functions to encourage correct labels and penalize wrong ones, improving model efficiency. Performance evaluation is done on ACE2005 documents, excluding informal ones, with specific training, validation, and test splits. The evaluation criteria for entity, trigger, and argument correctness align with previous work. ELMo embeddings are used with Bi-LSTMs, treated as context embeddings. GAIL-ELMo and GAIL-W2V settings are compared to analyze ELMo's contribution. Token surface embeddings are utilized for representing tokens in the input sentence. The curr_chunk discusses the use of various types of embeddings in a token-level Bi-LSTM network, including token surface embeddings, character-based embeddings, POS embeddings, and pre-trained embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated and fed into the network to enrich token information and prevent over-fitting. The use of dropout strategy and \"UNK\" masks is implemented to prevent over-fitting in the training phase of the neural network. Parameters such as discount factor, exploration threshold, hidden layer sizes, LSTM cell memory sizes, and dropout rate are set to optimize the performance of the model. Optimization is done using SGD with Momentum and varying learning rates for different tasks. For sequence labeling tasks, parameters such as learning rate decay, token embeddings dimensions, and pre-trained Word2Vec model are set. An RL framework with fixed rewards is implemented for entity extraction tasks. The performance of entity extraction is compared with state-of-the-art approaches like JointIE, JointEntityEvent BID23, Tree-LSTM, and KBLSTM BID24. The proposed method outperforms others, especially in recall performance. Our proposed approach for sequence labeling tasks issues strong penalties to avoid mistakes and considers rewards for later tokens, significantly enhancing prediction performance. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches like dbRNN BID17, our framework demonstrates better performance in event extraction with system-predicted entities as argument candidates. Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in event extraction, except for a lower F1 score on argument identification compared to BID17. While BID17 uses Stanford CoreNLP for noun phrase detection, our approach utilizes system-predicted entities for argument candidates, resulting in better performance in argument role labeling. Additionally, our framework can incorporate ground-truth entity annotations for argument candidates, showing superior performance compared to JointIE-GT and other approaches. Our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in event extraction, particularly in argument role labeling by incorporating ground-truth entities. This approach shows better performance without the need for further tuning, unlike other approaches that consolidate argument role labels with the same names from different event types. Our approach in argument role labeling outperforms existing methods by incorporating ground-truth entities, achieving a F1 score of 61.6. However, concerns arise regarding the appropriateness of consolidating argument roles across different event types due to the diverse definitions of roles like Agent in various events. The statistical results show that dynamic rewards outperform fixed rewards in the ACE schema. Fixed rewards resemble classification methods with cross-entropy loss, treating errors equally and not incorporating much information, leading to performance similar to earlier approaches. Dynamic rewards provide clearer distinctions between correct and wrong labels, improving performance in ambiguous instances. The statistical results demonstrate that dynamic rewards are more effective than fixed rewards in the ACE schema. The rewards for incorrect Die labels are -5.74, while correct Execute labels gain 6.53. Flatter rewards are given for simpler cases, such as 2.74 for End-Position, -1.33 for None, or -1.67 for Meet. Non-ELMo settings already outperform state-of-the-art, confirming the advantage of the GAIL framework. Despite a slight drop in performance with fixed rewards, ELMo is considered a good replacement for a combination of word, character, and PoS embeddings. However, ELMo requires a large amount of GPU memory and has a slow training procedure. Losses in scores are mainly due to missed trigger words and arguments, such as the missed \"pow-wow\" trigger for Meet. The curr_chunk discusses errors in annotation, specifically regarding the classification of entities in sentences. An example is given where the entity \"bombers\" is mistakenly classified as the Attacker argument instead of the Instrument in an Attack event. This error is attributed to biased annotation in the training data. The proposed framework is claimed to be effective against ambiguous errors despite such cases. The curr_chunk discusses a framework for event extraction that addresses ambiguous errors by directly assessing mistakes and exploring difficulty levels in labels. It also includes argument role labeling, unlike a cited approach using GAN. RL-based methods, such as relation extraction, have been applied to information extraction tasks, with some frameworks applying RL to entity relation detection with predefined rewards. Techniques like imitation learning aim to map states to expert actions. The curr_chunk discusses an end-to-end entity and event extraction framework based on inverse reinforcement learning. It highlights the benefits of dynamic reward values estimated from discriminators in GAN and recent embedding work in experiments. The approach differs from imitation learning by estimating rewards first and applying them to RL. The future plan includes releasing source code and visualizing reward values for interpretation by researchers. The future work involves visualizing reward values and exploring advanced approaches like BERT BID6 and joint models to address challenges in the current framework."
