    "content": "In neuroscience and life sciences, data generation is seen as a hierarchy of dynamic systems. In-vivo calcium imaging data is driven by electro-chemical kinetics, with trajectories around manifolds determining the frequency of calcium transients. A recent study used variational auto-encoders to learn the dynamic structure of reaching behavior from spiking data. Extending this approach with a ladder method, researchers inferred the spiking events driving calcium transients and the deeper latent dynamic system, showing strong performance on a synthetic dataset. Two-photon calcium imaging allows observation of hundreds of neurons' activity. Pandarinath et al. (2018) developed LFADS, a technique using deep, recurrent, variational auto-encoders to identify non-linear, dynamic latent variables in motor cortex activity. LFADS can decode reaching behavior with high fidelity but is designed for spiking data, not two-photon calcium imaging data. The proposed method extends LFADS to accommodate calcium activity using a variational ladder autoencoder with recurrent neural networks, unifying two recent applications of variational autoencoders in neuroscience. The VLAE approach is chosen for inferring spike counts from calcium imaging data, learning disentangled hierarchical features. The dynamic system underlying calcium event frequency is similar to LFADS, modeled with Gaussian distributions for initial conditions and external inputs. A GRU models the dynamic system, with low dimensional factors used to reconstruct the Poisson process intensity function and generate spike counts. The spike counts are inferred by sampling from Gaussian distributions and projecting through an affine transformation and non-linearity. A simple model of calcium dynamics is assumed, with parameters measured from data. Variational posterior distributions are modelled as Gaussian distributions parameterized by bidirectional GRUs. The VLAEs model uses bidirectional GRUs to concatenate E and C 2 at each time step with s t\u22121 and f t\u22121. The cost function is similar to LFADS, with parameters optimized using ADAM. The likelihood function is modelled as a Gaussian distribution, and s t is treated as an approximate Poisson process. The model was tested on synthetic data with Lorenz dynamics embedded in calcium fluorescence transients. Performance was measured by uncovering Lorenz dynamics, reconstructing calcium transient rates, and reconstructing spike counts contributing to the fluorescence signal. The model was compared against a ground-truth where spike counts are known. The model was compared against ground-truth spike counts, tested on synthetic data with Lorenz dynamics in calcium fluorescence transients. It provides a close fit to fluorescence traces, intensity functions, and Lorenz dynamics, capturing spike-timing with smoothed spike trains. Our model outperforms other approaches in reconstructing fluorescence traces and almost matches LFADS in reconstructing Lorenz dynamics. While it doesn't perform as well as OASIS in reconstructing spike trains, constraining spikes by latent dynamics may help mitigate errors. The deconvolution algorithm performs better at reconstructing spike trains in synthetic datasets than in real datasets. There are no known dual recordings of population 2-photon calcium imaging with ground-truth electrophysiology to validate this. The relationship between calcium dynamics and somatic spiking is non-linear, making it uncertain how useful it is to reproduce unseen spike trains in calcium fluorescence activity."
