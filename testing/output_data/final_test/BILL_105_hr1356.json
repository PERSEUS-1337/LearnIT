    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN COVERED BENEFICIARIES IN FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM.\" is about the inclusion of specific beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The text chunk discusses the inclusion of covered beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, allowing them to enroll in health benefits plans comparable to those authorized for medical and dental care. The Secretary of Defense and other administering Secretaries will enter into an agreement with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to implement this provision. Eligible covered beneficiaries include current and former members of the program. Covered beneficiaries, including members of the uniformed services and their dependents, who do not have access to comparable health and dental care benefits under CHAMPUS or TRICARE Standard, are eligible to enroll in the TRICARE program. This provision ensures access to hospital insurance benefits under specific circumstances. Covered beneficiaries, including members of the uniformed services and their dependents, are entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. They are not required to satisfy eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of title 5 for enrollment in a health benefits plan of the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. Contributions for enrollment in a plan of the Federal Employee Health Benefits program are made as if the beneficiary were an employee of the Federal Government. The administering Secretary is responsible for Government contributions for enrolled covered beneficiaries. Covered beneficiaries enrolled in a health benefits plan must contribute as if they were Federal employees under chapter 89 of title 5. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management manages their participation and maintains separate risk pools until it is determined that their inclusion will not harm Federal employees and annuitants. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management must report annually to Congress on the provision of health and dental care services to covered beneficiaries enrolled in health benefits plans. The report includes the number of beneficiaries participating in Federal Employee Health Benefits program plans, their utilization of services, and comparisons to all covered beneficiaries receiving care through the uniformed services. The annual report to Congress includes information on the utilization of health and dental care services by covered beneficiaries, the costs to beneficiaries and the government for care under health benefits plans, and a comparison of costs with alternative health care options. The annual report to Congress includes details on health care utilization and costs for covered beneficiaries, as well as comparisons with alternative health care options. Additionally, the Secretaries have authority to determine eligible beneficiaries for health benefits plans under section 1079b of title 10. The amendment to Section 8906 of title 5, United States Code, includes changes to subsections (b) and (g) regarding Government contributions for individuals enrolling in health plans under section 8905(d) of this title. The amendment adds a new paragraph stating that the Government contribution for beneficiaries enrolling under section 8905(d) of title 5 shall be paid as provided in section 1079b(c) of title 10. SEC. 2. IMPROVED BENEFITS UNDER CHAMPUS AND TRICARE STANDARD. This section amends Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code to ensure that the health and dental care benefits provided under CHAMPUS and TRICARE Standard are comparable to the highest level of benefits in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Provider reimbursement rates will also be aligned with the highest level of benefits in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 1072 of title 10, United States Code is amended to include definitions for 'TRICARE program' and 'TRICARE Standard' under the managed health care program established by the Secretary of Defense. This aligns with the improved benefits and provider reimbursement rates under CHAMPUS and TRICARE Standard to match the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. The TRICARE program, under CHAMPUS, offers health care benefits that cover services provided by non-government health care providers outside the network. The Federal Employee Health Benefits program is defined as the program under chapter 89 of title 5. The Secretary of Defense will implement health benefits options under title 10, United States Code by November 1, 1997. A clerical amendment will be made to include new sections in the table of sections."
