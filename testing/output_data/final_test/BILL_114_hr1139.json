The \"Detergent Poisoning And Child Safety Act of 2015\" defines terms like Commission, consumer product, detergent packet, liquid detergent packet, and special packaging. Safety standards are required under this Act. The Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 requires safety standards for liquid detergent packets to protect children under 5 years old from exposure to harm. This includes special packaging and design/color standards to make the packets less attractive and reduce the risk of exposure. The Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 mandates safety standards for liquid detergent packets to protect young children from harm. This includes reducing risks of ingestion, aspiration, and ocular contact, addressing packet composition for less severe consequences, and requiring warning labels to inform consumers of potential injury and death risks. The Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 requires safety standards for liquid detergent packets to prevent harm to children. This includes addressing ingestion, aspiration, and ocular contact risks, specifying packet composition for less severe consequences, and mandating warning labels to alert consumers of potential injury and death risks. Additionally, rules for safety standards must be treated as consumer product safety standards and follow specific rulemaking procedures. The Commission may exempt liquid detergent packets from safety standards if a voluntary standard protecting children is in place within a year of the Act's enactment, developed by ASTM International Subcommittee F15.71 or its successor. The Commission will publish determinations in the Federal Register. If a voluntary standard meets conditions, it will be treated as a consumer product safety standard. If a voluntary standard is revised, notice must be given. If a voluntary standard is revised by ASTM International after the Commission's determination, ASTM must notify the Commission within 60 days. The revised standard will be treated as a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act, effective 180 days after the Commission is notified. The Commission may enforce the prior version of a voluntary standard if the revised standard does not meet requirements. The Commission can promulgate rules to protect children under subsection (a)(1) at any time after making a determination. Rules promulgated under this provision are treated as consumer product safety standards. The Commission can enforce a prior version of a voluntary standard if the revised standard does not meet requirements. Rules promulgated under subsection (a)(1) are treated as consumer product safety standards. A report on risks posed by detergent packets to young children must be submitted to Congress within 4 years of the enactment of this Act. The Commission must provide a quantitative assessment of annual national pediatric exposure to detergent packets, including exposure incidents, means of exposure, clinical effects, and medical outcomes. They must also assess the effectiveness of the rules or voluntary standards in protecting young children and make recommendations for legislative or administrative action to protect them. The Commission will publish a report on pediatric exposure to detergent packets online, including incidents, effects, and outcomes. The report will also evaluate the effectiveness of current regulations in protecting young children and suggest potential legislative or administrative actions."
