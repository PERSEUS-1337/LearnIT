The \"Manufacturing Universities Act of 2014\" defines key terms like Director, institution of higher education, manufacturing industry, and United States manufacturing university. The Director is authorized to establish a Manufacturing University Program. The Director is authorized to establish a program to designate up to 25 institutions of higher education as United States manufacturing universities, with each receiving $5,000,000 annually for a 4-year period starting in 2015. In order to receive designation as a United States manufacturing university, institutions of higher education must apply to the Director with detailed information about their engineering programs. Funds provided under this program must be used to achieve specified goals and targets. The institution of higher education must provide details on their engineering programs, joint projects with manufacturing firms, and student participation in industry programs to be designated as a US manufacturing university. The institution of higher education must provide details on the percentage of students receiving engineering degrees, research funding from manufacturing firms, and recent master's degree recipients. The institution of higher education must also report on the percentage of recent master's or doctoral degree graduates who have started careers in manufacturing, including their involvement in manufacturing startups and any new businesses created by these graduates in the past 3 years. Additionally, they should detail other programs offered at the institution. The institution of higher education must report on programs related to manufacturing and entrepreneurship, and submit a plan with specific targets and goals within 4 years. The plan should focus on improving engineering programs to emphasize manufacturing engineering and increasing joint projects between manufacturing firms and the institution. The institution of higher education aims to increase student participation in for-credit internships in manufacturing firms and boost the number of U.S. citizens receiving engineering degrees. The institution of higher education plans to expand student participation in internships at manufacturing firms and increase the number of engineering degrees awarded to U.S. citizens. They will focus on various engineering disciplines, materials science, computer science, and applied mathematics. The institution will also outline how they will fund equipment and facilities for their proposal and increase industry funding for manufacturing research and development. The institution of higher education will oversee interdisciplinary programs to advance manufacturing productivity and innovation across various university departments and programs. They will designate an individual to coordinate activities related to this initiative. The universities will designate a \"Chief Manufacturing Officer\" as part of the manufacturing university plan. The manufacturing engineering program can boost local and regional economic development. Faculty in engineering and business departments will be rewarded for developing new ways to engage with manufacturing companies. The Director will establish general policies for program administration. The Director will establish general policies for program administration, including review of applications, selection criteria for institutions, review procedures, and other relevant matters. Within 2 years of receiving a designation, the Director will review the progress of institutions towards specified targets and goals. Institutions of higher education must submit annual progress reports on targets and goals to continue receiving funds. Designated institutions are ineligible for funds after a 4-year period. The Director must submit an annual report to Congress listing designated institutions of higher education and their progress towards goals. Recommendations on adapting Small Business Act programs are due within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Small Business Act can assist small businesses collaborating with US manufacturing universities. $125 million is authorized for fiscal years 2015-2018 for this purpose."
