    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Regional Energy Partnerships for Advancing Resilient Energy Systems Act\" or the \"PREPARE Act\". Congress finds that energy systems in the United States are undergoing significant change due to aging infrastructure, new technologies, increasing complexity, and growing threats. Regional energy strategies involving the participation of various stakeholders are crucial for preparing for challenges and mitigating risks. States have unique energy, environmental, and economic goals and will play a critical role in developing and implementing these strategies. The Federal Government also has a role to play in supporting long-term energy resilience. The Federal Government can establish alliances with States, convene stakeholders, facilitate regional energy strategies, and provide technical assistance for implementation as a long-term energy partner. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"cooperative agreement\" is defined as in sections 6302 and 6305 of title 31, United States Code. The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior, along with specific officials within their departments. The term \"State\" includes a State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories or possessions. SEC. 4. REGIONAL ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS. The Secretaries will provide assistance to develop energy strategies that align with national, regional, and State goals, including resilient energy systems. They may offer technical assistance to various entities to promote regional energy plans and modernization of energy systems in the United States. The Secretaries may enter into cooperative agreements with States and Indian tribes to develop and implement strategies to address energy challenges on a regional basis. These agreements aim to promote investment in energy infrastructure, workforce development, regulatory reforms, and public-private partnerships for regional energy planning and implementation. The cooperative agreements between the Secretaries, States, and Indian tribes aim to advance energy efficiency, clean energy, economic development, and energy system resiliency. They outline roles, responsibilities, and a framework for developing energy strategies and plans. The cooperative agreements between the Secretaries, States, and Indian tribes aim to advance energy efficiency, clean energy, economic development, and energy system resiliency by outlining roles, responsibilities, timeframes, metrics, governance structure, and necessary provisions. Staff with expertise in technical and regulatory issues are assigned or employed to support the cooperative agreements. The cooperative agreement requires expertise in energy systems integration, renewable energy, financing mechanisms, regulatory policy, modeling, facilitation, energy assurance, and security. Assigned individuals must report to the applicable location within 90 days and handle technical issues. Under a cooperative agreement, personnel are responsible for technical assistance, developing regional energy strategies, and building capacity for implementation. A comprehensive framework is developed to address various energy sectors and issues such as end-use efficiency, energy supply, delivery, and transportation. The curr_chunk discusses energy delivery, transportation, technical integration, institutional structures, regulatory policies, financial incentives, and market mechanisms in the context of awards for application groups and partner states under a cooperative agreement. The Secretaries provide awards under this subsection to application groups consisting of States or Indian tribes. An individual State or Indian tribe can also apply for an award if they demonstrate unique energy challenges. Six awards are given with a base amount of $20,000,000 each. The Secretaries provide awards to application groups with a base amount of $20,000,000 each. Bonus amounts are given based on the number of partner States in the group, with a maximum bonus limit. The Secretaries award application groups with a base amount of $20,000,000 each. Bonus amounts are determined based on the number of partner States, with a maximum limit of $5,000,000 per partner State. States or tribes are limited to one award. Selection criteria include existing commitments, the number of contiguous States involved, and regional diversity. The Secretaries award applications based on selection criteria including cost-share contributions, regional and State program focus on energy system resiliency, grid modernization, efficiency, and clean energy, management and oversight plan, outreach plan for stakeholders, inclusion of tribal entities, funding sustainability plans, and clarity of roles and responsibilities. The Secretaries award applications based on selection criteria including cost-share contributions, regional and State program focus on energy system resiliency, grid modernization, efficiency, and clean energy, management and oversight plan, outreach plan for stakeholders, inclusion of tribal entities, funding sustainability plans, and clarity of roles and responsibilities. Awards provided under this subsection shall be used for technical analyses, resource studies, energy system baselines, education on emerging energy issues, decision support tools, and improving communication and stakeholder participation. The funds awarded under this subsection cannot be used for capitalizing green banks, loan guarantees, building facilities, or funding capital projects. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 is authorized for this Act, with allocations for base awards, bonus awards, and administration. State Energy Offices will receive funds provided under this Act.
