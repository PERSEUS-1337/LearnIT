    "content": "The Act is titled the \"California Perchlorate Contamination Remediation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. Congress finds that there is an increased need for safe fresh water due to drought conditions and demand, perchlorate is found in water sources and food supply across the US. The Act aims to address perchlorate contamination in water sources by providing grants for remediation and research on remediation technologies. It also emphasizes the need for a national drinking water standard for perchlorate due to its potential adverse effects on thyroid metabolism and brain development in fetuses, newborns, and children. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"California water authority,\" \"Fund,\" and \"State.\" It establishes the California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund and provides grants for perchlorate remediation. The California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to provide grants for perchlorate remediation. The fund consists of appropriated amounts and interest earned on investments. The Secretary of the Treasury can transfer necessary amounts to the Administrator for grants, with a limit on administrative expenses. The California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund allows for the use of up to 0.4 percent of the fund for administrative expenses. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for investing the remaining portion in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. Investments can be made through original issue or purchase of outstanding obligations. Cleanup Grants: The Administrator will provide grants to California water authorities, not exceeding $50,000,000, for cleanup activities related to perchlorate contamination in water sources. The Federal share of cleanup activities for perchlorate contamination in California water sources shall not exceed 50 percent. Eligibility for grants excludes water authorities responsible for contamination. Priority is given to remediation of drinking water and water sources with high perchlorate levels. Priority for grants under this subsection is given to activities in regions like the Santa Clara Valley and areas within the natural watershed of the Santa Ana River affected by perchlorate contamination. The Administrator provides grants for research and development of perchlorate remediation technologies in regions affected by contamination, including Riverside, San Bernardino, San Gabriel Valley, Sacramento County, and other damaged water sources. The total grant amount does not exceed $8,000,000 for qualified non-Federal entities. The maximum grant amount for research and development of perchlorate remediation technologies is $1,000,000, with a total grant limit of $8,000,000 for qualified non-Federal entities. SEC. 5. EFFECT OF ACT: This Act does not impact existing authority or programs of Federal or State agencies.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS: Congress urges the Administrator to establish a national drinking water standard for perchlorate considering all exposure routes promptly after the Act's enactment.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS: $58,000,000 is authorized for implementing this Act, with funds available indefinitely."
