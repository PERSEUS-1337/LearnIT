    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2008\". Food allergy is a growing concern in the US, especially among students. Peanut allergy doubled among children from 1997 to 2002. A survey of elementary school nurses in 2004 found that many students had severe food allergies. In a study of fatal food-allergy induced reactions, over half of the individuals were 18 or younger. More than half (53 percent) of individuals with food allergies were aged 18 or younger. Eight foods cause 90 percent of food-allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, can be fatal and is often triggered by food allergies. Fatalities from anaphylaxis are linked to delays in administering epinephrine. In a study of food allergy-induced anaphylactic reactions in school-age children, the importance of managing life-threatening food allergies in schools is recognized by various medical associations. There are no Federal guidelines for managing these allergies in schools. Three-quarters of elementary school nurses are involved in this management. In schools, many nurses cover multiple schools and hundreds of students. Parents of students with severe food allergies face different management approaches when changing schools. Delays in treatment for food allergy reactions in schools are due to failure to follow emergency plans and administer epinephrine promptly. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"elementary school\" according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"school\" includes kindergartens, elementary schools, and secondary schools. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Education. SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF VOLUNTARY FOOD ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS MANAGEMENT POLICY. The Secretary must develop a voluntary policy for managing food allergies and anaphylaxis in schools within a year of this Act. The policy will be available to educational agencies, child care providers, and preschool programs. It includes guidelines for parents to provide documentation of a food allergy diagnosis before each school year. The nurse must support a food allergy diagnosis, identify allergens, describe prior anaphylaxis history, list prescribed medication, detail emergency procedures, list symptoms, and assess readiness for self-administration of medication. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of individual health care plans for students at risk of anaphylaxis, including substitute meals, self-administration of medication, communication strategies with emergency medical services, and strategies to reduce exposure to allergens in schools. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of educating school staff, parents, and students about life-threatening food allergies, training personnel to manage allergies, authorizing staff to administer epinephrine when necessary, and ensuring timely access to epinephrine in schools. Additionally, it addresses the inclusion of extracurricular activities in individual health care plans. The curr_chunk focuses on the collection and publication of data on administering epinephrine to students at risk for anaphylaxis, without preempting State laws on self-medication for such students. The policy and guidelines for food allergy management developed by the Secretary are voluntary and not mandatory for schools to implement. This Act does not require local educational agencies or schools to follow the policy or guidelines."
