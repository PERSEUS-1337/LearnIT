    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with President Obama's FY2016 budget request proposing $36.04 billion, an increase from the previous year. The Department of Energy would see an 8.4% increase in funding for energy programs, while the Corps would face a 13.2% reduction and the Bureau of Reclamation a 3.0% cut. The House approved its version of the FY2016 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. The House approved the FY2016 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill with $35.4 billion in total funding, slightly below the Administration's request. Funding for the Corps was increased by 19.2% above the request, while DOE received 5.1% less. The Senate reported a bill with $35.37 billion in total funding, slightly lower than the House's level, with increased funding for DOE and decreased funding for the Corps. Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) on December 18, 2015, providing $37.3 billion for energy and water programs for FY2016. President Obama opposed the House Appropriations Committee bill due to reductions in energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and objections to a prohibition on the Corps rulemaking on the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" The President's senior advisors would have recommended a veto of the House Committee bill. Several amendments were adopted by the House after recorded votes, including prohibiting DOE from enforcing light bulb efficiency standards, using a report on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for LNG exports determinations, and funding DOE's Climate Model Development and Validation program. Prohibiting funds in the bill from being used for specific water-related purposes in California, including meeting stream flow requirements and delivering water to certain rivers. Amendments offered by Representatives Tom McClintock and Doug LaMalfa were adopted. Congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by budget enforcement measures. Statutory budget enforcement is primarily through limits on discretionary spending set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. These limits are enforced through sequestration and were adjusted by the Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015. For FY2015, Energy and Water Development programs received appropriations above the request and FY2014 levels, totaling $519 million and $653 million, respectively. The appropriations were included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83), signed into law on December 16, 2014 (P.L. 113-235). The FY2016 Energy and Water Development appropriations request and congressional action have sparked significant debate. The Energy and Water Development bill sparked significant debate in FY2016. The Corps requested a $5 million increase for Clean Water Act rulemaking activities, but did not receive it. The final rule defining \"waters of the United States\" was promulgated jointly with the EPA. H.R. 2028 would have barred the Corps from making any changes to rules. The Corps was restricted from making changes to rules regarding the Clean Water Act definition of \"waters of the United States\" in the Energy and Water Development bill for FY2016. The bill did not include the restriction, which was previously proposed in the 113th Congress. Additionally, funding for DOE's energy efficient manufacturing research would have more than doubled under the Administration request, with a focus on establishing two new Clean Energy Manufacturing Institutes. The FY2016 budget request included a 42% increase in funding for DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program, totaling $2.723 billion. However, the proposed increases were largely rejected by Congress, with the enacted omnibus funding measure providing $2.073 billion. This included a 14% increase in manufacturing research and a 10% boost in vehicle technologies. Additionally, funding for the disposition of highly radioactive \"spent\" fuel from nuclear power plants would have risen by 52% in the Administration's request. The Administration's request for additional funding to develop a \"consent based\" waste management system was rejected by the House, which provided $175 million to continue the Yucca Mountain licensing process. The Senate committee did not include funding for Yucca Mountain but authorized a pilot consolidated nuclear waste surface storage facility. The omnibus funding measure provided $85 million for used nuclear fuel disposition but did not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the Senate Committee pilot storage facility. The United States' contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in France is a concern due to management, schedule, and cost issues. The U.S. is expected to pay 9.09% of the construction costs, estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. The Administration proposed $150.0 million for FY2016, with the House approving it but warning of future support depending on management reform. The Senate committee suggested eliminating ITER funding, but P.L. 114-113 provided $115 million with reporting requirements. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for maintaining U.S. nuclear bombs and missile warheads. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for maintaining U.S. nuclear warheads. The Administration requested $8.85 billion for NNSA's Weapons Activities in FY2016, a 10.7% increase over FY2015. The Administration proposed combining two counterterrorism programs and transferring them to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. P.L. 114-113 provided full funding for Weapons Activities, including the transfer of programs. The Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) has faced escalating cost estimates. DOE requested level funding of $345 million for continued construction of the controversial South Carolina project in FY2016 after Congress rejected the Administration's proposal for FY2015. A study was completed in FY2015 on a less expensive alternative plutonium disposal method at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. P.L. 114-113 provided $340 million for MFFF construction and $5 million for planning the \"dilute and dispose\" option. DOE's Office of Environmental Management received $6.22 billion for environmental cleanup and waste management at nuclear facilities. DOE received $6.22 billion for environmental cleanup and waste management at nuclear facilities in FY2016. The funding did not include $472 million for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. DOE aimed to negotiate changes in environmental compliance requirements to potentially modify cleanup milestones at some sites. Efforts to resume operations at WIPP continued, with plans to resume limited waste disposal operations in the first quarter of the calendar year. WIPP plans to resume limited waste disposal operations in the first quarter of 2016 after incidents in 2014. $300 million was allocated for WIPP in FY2016, with $82 million for recovery activities. DOE proposed a new Energy-Water Nexus activity to analyze energy and water use. The DOE proposed a new Energy-Water Nexus activity to analyze energy and water use, with funding totaling $38.4 million in FY2016. The initiative is being implemented by the Secretary of Energy's Water-Energy Tech Team. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43200 and CRS Report R43199. The FY2016 funding legislation includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted from FY2008 to FY2016. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill consists of four titles: Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and Independent Agencies. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under its civil works program funded by the bill, plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resources facilities. Funding details for various programs are available in separate CRS reports. The Corps of Engineers plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resources facilities. Congress authorizes Corps appropriations in water resources development acts, with the most recent being the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. Corps funding is a topic of debate in congressionally directed spending, with about 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive grants. The President's budget no longer includes site-specific project line items added by Congress since the 112th Congress due to earmark moratorium policies. Instead, Congress provides \"additional funding\" for select categories of Corps projects and sets limitations on the use of these funds. The Bureau of Reclamation has been responsible for constructing most large dams and water diversion structures in the West, while the Army Corps of Engineers has focused on flood control and navigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation's mission is to develop water supplies for irrigation in the West, managing hundreds of dams and reservoirs. They provide water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people, making them the largest water supplier in the western states. Reclamation also generates hydroelectric power and offers flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but faces controversy over its impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. Their budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines, with the largest account being Water and Related Resources. Congress has provided additional appropriations in recent years to address drought conditions in the West. The current moratorium on earmarks restricts congressional steering of money directly toward specific Reclamation projects. The Administration has proposed shifting oversight of the Central Utah Project from a separate office to Reclamation. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including R&D on renewable energy, nuclear power, and environmental cleanup. President Obama has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) for jobs, economic growth, and U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Despite limited support from Congress, a $150 million boost was approved for FY2016.
