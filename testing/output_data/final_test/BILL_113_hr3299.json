Additionally, individuals exposed to consumer tax return information may face criminal liability for unauthorized disclosure under the Internal Revenue Code. If the Secretary finds that an individual has a criminal background or violates disclosure rules regarding personally identifiable information, they will be permanently disqualified from further involvement in consumer assistance activities. Beginning on the date of health insurance exchange operations, no individual consumer shall be held responsible for not meeting requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for obtaining qualified health insurance coverage through an Exchange unless the Secretary can prove effective privacy protection.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services must modify existing grants to comply with this requirement."
