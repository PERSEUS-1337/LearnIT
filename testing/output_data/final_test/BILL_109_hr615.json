    "content": "The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2005\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount during a transitional period. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2005\" amends Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act to include a transitional increase amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This increase is calculated based on the excess under former law. The product is calculated by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage based on the year the individual becomes eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits ranges from 55% in 1979 to 5% in 1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the excess amount for each individual. The former law refers to the excess of an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount over the amount calculated under current regulations. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is determined based on the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under past laws. When calculating an individual's primary insurance amount, certain provisions and time periods are considered, such as excluding certain calendar years and including the 3 calendar years with the highest wages or self-employment income. When calculating an individual's primary insurance amount, certain provisions and time periods are considered, such as excluding certain calendar years and including the 3 calendar years with the highest wages or self-employment income. This paragraph applies to individuals if it results in a higher insurance amount than under a different calculation method. Individuals can elect to receive lump sum payments instead of having this paragraph affect their insurance amount by filing a written election with the Commissioner of Social Security. Upon receipt of a timely election filed by an individual, the Commissioner certifies it to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of $5,000 in 4 annual installments of $1,250 from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Upon receipt of a timely election, the Commissioner certifies it to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment in 4 annual installments of $1,250 from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. If no timely election is filed by a deceased individual's beneficiary, the Commissioner certifies all received elections to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each beneficiary. The Commissioner certifies timely elections for beneficiaries to receive $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The first payment is due by July 1, 2006, and certain rules apply for benefit calculations. The amendments made by this Act are effective, with exceptions outlined. The amendments made by this Act will be effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977. No increase in benefits will be applied before July 2006. Recomputation of benefits will reflect any increases for individuals entitled to benefits in June 2006. In December 1978, the Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to benefits in June 2006 to reflect amendments made by the Social Security Amendments of 1977."
