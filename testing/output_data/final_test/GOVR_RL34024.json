    "content": "The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan highlighted the needs of homeless veterans, who were first recognized in the 1970s and 1980s. Studies have shown that homeless veterans are overrepresented in the homeless population, with research focusing on both male and female veterans. The overrepresentation of male and female veterans in the homeless population compared to the general population is discussed, along with possible explanations. Congress has created programs to address homelessness among veterans, with funding primarily through the Department of Veterans Affairs, specifically the Veterans Health Administration and Veterans Benefits Administration. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides educational assistance, home loan guarantees, and insurance for veterans. The Department of Labor and the Department of Housing and Urban Development also have programs for homeless veterans. Issues surrounding homelessness among veterans have gained attention since the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The VA is working to end homelessness among veterans, ensure a smooth transition for returning veterans, and address the needs of women veterans. Homelessness in the United States has become more prominent in recent decades, with various causes cited for the increase in homeless individuals. The increase in homelessness is attributed to various factors such as the demolition of single room occupancy dwellings, decreased availability of affordable housing, reduced need for seasonal labor, and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals. Homelessness affects families with children, single individuals, in rural and urban areas, and can last from days to years. Researchers have categorized homelessness into three groups based on duration. Researchers have categorized homelessness into three groups based on duration: transitionally homeless individuals have one short stay in a shelter before returning to permanent housing, episodically homeless people move in and out of homelessness but not for long periods, and chronically homeless individuals are continuously homeless for a year or have at least four episodes in three years, often suffering from mental illness or substance use disorders. Homeless veterans may be more likely to be chronically homeless than nonveterans. The presence of homeless veterans contradicted the belief that military experience provides benefits for a productive life. There has been confusion over veteran eligibility for VA programs targeting homeless veterans, as defined in Title 38 of the United States Code. The definition of \"veteran\" for Title 38 benefits is someone who served in the military and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Specific length-of-service and discharge criteria may be required for VA benefits. Minimum service requirements apply to those who enlisted after September 8, 1980, with a general requirement of the full period of active duty or 24 months of continuous active duty. VA accepts honorable or general discharges. The VA accepts discharges characterized as honorable or general for benefits, while a dishonorable discharge disqualifies a veteran. Other-than-honorable discharges may require a character-of-discharge determination for eligibility. Length-of-service and character-of-discharge criteria impact veteran eligibility for VA homeless programs. In 2014, the VA imposed eligibility criteria for homeless veterans to participate in the GPD program and SSVF program, requiring qualification for VA health care. Advocacy groups raised concerns about veterans with mental health issues being excluded. The VA imposed eligibility criteria for homeless veterans in the GPD and SSVF programs in 2014, requiring VA health care qualification. Concerns were raised about excluding veterans with mental health issues. Legislation has been introduced to clarify veteran eligibility for these programs. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (P.L. 100-77) defines homeless veterans as individuals lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. This includes living in places not meant for sleeping, staying in shelters, or exiting institutions after a short stay. Individuals and families facing imminent loss of housing are considered homeless if they lack resources to stay in their current housing, have no alternative residence identified, and lack support networks for obtaining permanent housing. Unaccompanied youth and homeless families with children are considered homeless if they have experienced long-term instability and lack resources for permanent housing due to various factors like chronic disabilities or substance addiction. The McKinney-Vento definition of homeless does not apply to VA programs. Section 103(b) was added in 2009, including those fleeing domestic violence or life-threatening conditions. The VA's definition of homeless veteran only includes subsection 103(a) of McKinney-Vento. Bills in Congress aim to update the definition to include Section 103(b). The exact number of homeless veterans is unknown, but estimation methods have improved. Beginning in 2011, the VA and HUD coordinated efforts to estimate the number of homeless veterans. HUD conducts point-in-time counts and estimates the total number of people experiencing homelessness annually. Local jurisdictions conduct counts of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons, including veterans. HUD has been releasing reports on homeless individuals, including veterans, for the past seven years. These reports contain point-in-time counts and estimates of homeless veterans, with caveats and limitations in their representation. The point-in-time counts occur on one day in late January to capture the number of homeless individuals and families in various living situations, including those unsheltered, in emergency shelters, and transitional housing. Communities were not required to count unsheltered individuals until 2011, but most did so voluntarily. The point-in-time count is meant to capture all homeless individuals, not an estimate based on a sample. HUD adjusts the number for missing data on homeless veterans. An ongoing process estimates the annual number of homeless people, including veterans, through HMIS. The Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) initiative collects and stores information about homeless individuals in local jurisdictions. Estimates are based on a full year's worth of data and include individuals in emergency shelters or transitional housing. The data is aggregated from a sample of communities, adjusted for missing data, and weighted. Table 1 contains estimates of homeless veterans from 2009 through 2015 based on annual point-in-time counts and HMIS data. The best available demographic data on homeless veterans is included in the Annual Homeless Assessment Reports to Congress. The 2014 AHAR provided demographic information on homeless veterans in shelters, showing that 91.6% are men and 8.4% are women. African American veterans make up 36.2% of the homeless population, Hispanic veterans 6.9%, and non-Hispanic white veterans 52.4%. Age-wise, veterans aged 31-50 and 51-61 have the highest percentages of homelessness. The homeless veteran population is divided into different age groups, with 33.9% and 43.5% represented by specific age groups. Veterans aged 18-30 make up 9.1%, while those aged 62 and older make up 13.5%. Research on homeless veterans has been limited until the Veterans Supplement to the Annual Homeless Assessment Report was introduced. The VA's National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans is conducting research studies to gather more information. Previous studies have looked into the overrepresentation of veterans in the homeless population using data from 2009. The section discusses previous studies on the overrepresentation of veterans in the homeless population. Surveys in 1996 and 1987 provided data on homeless individuals, serving as the basis for research on homeless veterans. However, these surveys did not include veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2012, the VA conducted more recent findings on homeless veterans. The VA conducted research in 2012 using data from seven communities, including veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Five studies compared veterans to the general population and homeless population, finding that both male and female veterans were more likely to be homeless. Studies from the 1980s and 1990s also showed the presence of veterans among the homeless population. Studies from the 1980s and 1990s found that Vietnam and post-Vietnam era veterans were overrepresented in the homeless population, while World War II and Korea veterans were less likely to be homeless. Research also showed that male veterans were overrepresented, with the likelihood of homelessness being highest for veterans who enlisted after the military transitioned to an all-volunteer force in 1973. In the 1980s and 1990s, studies found that Vietnam and post-Vietnam era veterans were overrepresented in the homeless population. Male veterans, especially those who enlisted after the military transitioned to an all-volunteer force in 1973, were more likely to be homeless. In the first study, 41% of adult homeless men were veterans, with male veterans being 1.4 times more likely to be homeless than nonveterans. Veterans who served after the Vietnam War were four times more likely to be homeless. In the second study, nearly 33% of adult homeless men were veterans. Male veterans, especially those from the post-Vietnam era, have a higher likelihood of homelessness compared to nonveterans. The 1994 study showed that post-Vietnam era veterans were over three times more likely to be homeless, while younger veterans aged 20-34 in 1996 were twice as likely to be homeless. Vietnam era veterans were also 1.4 times more likely to be homeless. A 2009 study using HMIS data found that male veterans had higher rates of homelessness compared to the general population. The study found that male veterans, especially those from the post-Vietnam era, had a higher risk of homelessness compared to nonveterans. Veterans aged 45-54 who served in the early years of the AVF were at a higher risk of homelessness, with African American veterans in this age group being 1.4 times more likely to be homeless. Women veterans were also more likely to experience homelessness compared to non-veteran women. The study found that female veterans were between two and four times more likely to be homeless compared to nonveteran counterparts. Cohort data showed that all birth cohorts of female veterans, except for those aged 35-55, were more likely to be homeless than nonveterans. The VA study using 2009 HMIS data provided detailed information on the risk of homelessness among women veterans by age and race. According to a study on homelessness among women veterans, regardless of age or race, they face an increased risk of homelessness. Women veterans are 2.1 times more likely to be homeless than nonveterans. Younger women veterans, especially African American women, are more likely to be homeless than older women veterans. The reasons for this increased risk among veterans compared to nonveterans are still not well understood. The risk of homelessness among veterans is puzzling as they have better outcomes on socioeconomic measures and access to extensive benefits. Factors beyond demographics need to be identified for prevention efforts. Previous studies focused on Vietnam veterans, but recent research includes veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The VA examined risk factors for homelessness among veterans separated from service between July 1, 2005, and September 30, 2006. In a five-year period, 1.8% of veterans in the sample experienced a homeless episode. Researchers analyzed risk factors by gender and whether veterans had served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Factors related to homelessness among veterans included military pay grade, active duty service, traumatic brain injury, psychotic disorders, and substance use. Lower pay grades were associated with a higher risk of homelessness, while Reserves or National Guard service reduced the risk for OEF/OIF veterans. Traumatic brain injury increased the risk for male non-OEF/OIF veterans. The risk of homelessness for male non-OEF/OIF veterans is increased by psychotic disorders, substance use, adjustment disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder increases the risk for male and female OEF/OIF veterans. A study by NVVRS surveyed Vietnam theater veterans and era veterans to assess mental health and readjustment to civilian life, although homelessness was not specifically analyzed. The 1994 study of Vietnam era veterans evaluated 18 variables associated with homelessness, categorized into pre-military, military, readjustment, and post-military periods. Combat exposure and participation in atrocities did not directly relate to homelessness but contributed to low social support and psychiatric disorders. The study on Vietnam era veterans identified four post-military factors contributing to homelessness: psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, being unmarried, and social isolation. Pre-military factors such as exposure to abuse and traumatic experiences also played a significant role in homelessness among veterans. The study identified pre-military factors contributing to homelessness among veterans, including experiences like accidents or natural disasters, foster care placement before age 16, conduct disorder, and lack of family support prior to enlistment. The growth of homelessness among veterans has been linked to the all volunteer force (AVF) institution in 1973, with higher rates seen in the birth cohort that joined the military after the Vietnam War. Higher rates of homelessness among veterans may be linked to lowered recruitment standards during periods when military service was not highly regarded. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased the risk of homelessness among male and female veterans who served in OEF/OIF in 2005 and 2006, but not among those who did not serve in OEF/OIF. The relationship between combat-related PTSD and homelessness is still debated. PTSD is significantly related to other psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and unemployment, leading to readjustment difficulties and homelessness among veterans. Federal response to homeless veterans began in the late 1980s with programs like Health Care for Homeless Veterans and the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans was founded around the same time to address the growing issue of homelessness among veterans. The VA funds multiple programs through the VHA and VBA to serve homeless veterans, with additional programs from the DOL and HUD in collaboration with the VA. These programs provide health care, compensation, pensions, education assistance, home loan guarantees, insurance, and employment services for homeless veterans. The majority of programs serving homeless veterans are part of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which operates hospitals and outpatient clinics across the country through 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). The VHA coordinates with the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) by placing Homeless Veteran Outreach Coordinators (HVOCs) in its offices to assist homeless veterans in their benefit applications. The first federal program specifically for homeless veterans is Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV). The Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program, initially named the Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill veterans program, was established in 1987 with a $5 million allocation from Congress. It provides medical and psychiatric care to homeless veterans, regardless of mental illness, and offers outreach, treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, and referrals to supportive services. Priority is given to service-connected illnesses, but non-service-connected disabilities are also eligible. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program, established in 1987, provides medical and psychiatric care to homeless veterans, including those with non-service-connected disabilities. Currently, 132 VA sites have implemented HCHV programs, authorized through FY2016. The program does not provide housing but assists in placing veterans in residential treatment facilities for treatment. In FY2014, there were 4,061 beds available for veterans. In FY2014, the HCHV program served approximately 185,949 veterans, with 4,061 beds available for an average stay of 73 days. Domiciliary care for homeless veterans was funded by Congress in 1987 to provide rehabilitative services for those not needing hospital or nursing home care. The DCHV program, funded by Congress, operates at 45 VA medical centers with 2,367 beds. In FY2013, 7,177 veterans completed treatment with an average stay of three months, receiving medical, psychiatric, substance abuse treatment, and vocational rehabilitation. The Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) Program, authorized since the 1930s, aims to provide work opportunities for veterans with disabilities. The CWT program provides work experience and skills for veterans with disabilities to re-enter the workforce. Veterans are employed by the VA or other federal agencies, or through contracts with private companies or nonprofit organizations. Participants must be paid wages comparable to the community standards. The program aims to improve veterans' chances of living independently and reaching self-sufficiency. Additional services such as work skills training and job placement were added in 2003. The Therapeutic Transitional Housing component was added to the CWT program in 1991 under P.L. 102-54. It provides housing for participants with mental illnesses or substance use disorders who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The VA operates transitional housing facilities with supportive services for up to 12 months. In FY2012, 17,407 veterans were admitted into the CWT program, with 55% being homeless. 62% had a substance use disorder, 63% had serious mental illness, and nearly 41% were dually diagnosed. 79% had a disabling medical condition, and 97% had a psychiatric disorder or disabling medical condition. The Grant and Per Diem program was introduced in 1992. The Grant and Per Diem program, introduced in 1992, provides services and transitional housing to homeless veterans through grants to public entities or nonprofit organizations. The program was made permanent in 2001 and authorized at $250 million for FY2015 and beyond. Eligible recipients can apply for funding for either the grant or per diem part of the program. The Grant and Per Diem program offers capital grants for facility acquisition, construction, and remodeling, as well as per diem reimbursements for housing and supportive services for homeless veterans. Supportive services include outreach, health care, counseling, case management, job training, and transportation assistance. The VA Grant and Per Diem program provides job training, placement services, and transportation assistance to homeless veterans. Organizations can apply for per diem funds alone and are encouraged to use the \"transition in place\" model where veterans can take over the lease of apartments after a transition period. The program awarded grants to 31 organizations using this model. Per diem funds pay organizations a fixed rate for each occupied bed for housing and services provided to veterans. The VA Grant and Per Diem program reimburses organizations at a fixed rate for each occupied bed, not exceeding the current per diem rate. The per diem rate increases periodically, with the FY2014 rate at $43.32 per day. Grantee organizations are paid an hourly rate based on service costs or the per diem rate. The program serves as a payer of last resort, covering expenses after other funds are used. The Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans recommended revising the reimbursement system to consider service costs and geographic disparities. The VA Grant and Per Diem program reimburses organizations based on a fixed rate for each occupied bed, with the current per diem rate at $43.32 per day. The program serves as a payer of last resort, covering expenses after other funds are used. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 directed VA to study the per diem payment method and develop more effective procedures for reimbursing grantees. The VA issued a report to Congress in October 2013, recommending an alternate methodology for establishing the annual maximum per diem rate. In FY2013, over 650 Grant and Per Diem programs were funded by the VA, providing more than 15,500 beds for veterans. The average length of stay was 188 days, with a maximum stay of 24 months. 60% of discharged veterans moved to permanent housing, and 25% found employment. Congress created a program in 2001 to target funds to specific groups of veterans. The program created in 2001 targets per diem funds to specific groups of veterans, including women, women with children, frail elderly veterans, veterans with terminal illnesses, those with chronic mental illnesses, and male veterans with children. The program was most recently authorized at $5 million per year through FY2016. Additionally, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 authorized supportive services for very low-income veterans and their families. Entities eligible for funds under the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program include private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives. Priority is given to organizations assisting families transitioning from homelessness to permanent housing. Recipient organizations may offer services such as outreach, case management, rent and utility assistance, help with moving costs, and aid in applying for VA and mainstream benefits. The program was authorized at $300 million through FY2015 as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2015. The VA awarded grants totaling over $1.3 million to grantees in all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, and Guam from FY2011 to FY2016. The SSVF program served over 59,000 veterans and their family members in FY2012 and FY2013, with the majority receiving rapid rehousing assistance. Grantees were allowed to use 50% of funding for temporary financial assistance, with most going towards rental assistance. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 provided that dental care for certain homeless veterans shall be considered medically necessary if needed for employment, pain relief, or treatment. The VA provides dental care for homeless veterans to help them gain employment, relieve pain, or treat certain conditions. Veterans eligible for this care are those in specific VA programs, and the law governing Enhanced Use Leases was changed in 2012 to prioritize homeless veterans and those at risk of homelessness. This program allows the VA to make use of underutilized real property for the benefit of homeless veterans. The VA can enter into Enhanced Use Leases (EULs) with developers to improve VA property for a maximum lease term of 75 years. Prior to 2012, EULs were used for various purposes, including housing for homeless veterans. However, in 2012, Congress limited EULs to the provision of supportive housing for homeless veterans. The VA can enter into EULs for the provision of supportive housing for homeless veterans or those at risk of homelessness. Various types of qualifying housing include transitional, permanent, and single room occupancy housing, as well as congregate living, independent living, or assisted living facilities. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws. Consideration for an EUL may be \"cash at fair value,\" and the VA must report annually on consideration received. The VA had committed to using EULs to benefit homeless veterans through the BURR Initiative before the enactment of P.L. 112-154. The Building Utilization Review and Repurposing (BURR) Initiative aims to provide housing for homeless veterans by identifying underutilized VA properties. The VA has identified 34 properties suitable for transitional or permanent housing for homeless veterans through EULs. The Acquired Property Sales for Homeless Veterans program, operated by the Veterans Benefits Administration, allows the VA to dispose of properties acquired through foreclosures for the benefit of homeless veterans. The VA can sell, lease, lease with the option to buy, or donate properties to nonprofit organizations and state agencies for homeless shelters for veterans. The HUD-VA Supported Housing program provides housing to homeless veterans through Section 8 vouchers, targeting those with psychiatric or substance use disorders. Local PHAs administer the vouchers while VA medical centers offer case management and clinical services. HUD-VASH program was revived in FY2008 after a 15-year hiatus, providing Section 8 vouchers to PHAs through competitions in 1992, 1993, and 1994. VA medical centers offered case management and clinical services to homeless veterans, with the number of eligible PHAs increasing from 19 to 87 over the years. HUD did not separately track these vouchers. In 2001, Congress codified the HUD-VASH program and authorized the creation of additional vouchers for homeless veterans. Funding for these vouchers was provided in FY2008 and continued annually through FY2015, with $75 million appropriated each year. In FY2009 through FY2015, $75 million was appropriated annually for the HUD-VASH program, except for FY2011 when $50 million was allocated. The VA and HUD determine voucher allocation based on geographic need, PHA performance, and other specified factors. Data sources for distribution include HUD estimates of veteran homelessness, VA medical center data, and performance data from local authorities. HUD can waive provisions for effective program delivery. In administering the HUD-VASH program, local VA medical centers determine veteran eligibility and refer them to partnering PHAs. PHAs review applicants for income eligibility and ensure they are not subject to lifetime sex offender registration. The VA provides case management and services to participating veterans, and may contract with outside agencies for additional assistance in finding suitable housing and supportive services. The HUD-VASH program assists veterans who need more support than the VA can provide, those who do not live near a VA facility, or areas where veterans struggle to find housing. PHAs can project base vouchers for specific housing units, allowing for more efficient supportive services. HUD removed the 50% limit on project-based vouchers in 2011. HUD-VASH vouchers have been project-based in five fiscal years: FY2010, FY2011, FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015. The vouchers were awarded competitively to PHAs in various states. PHAs must adhere to funding requirements and provide tenant-based assistance if a veteran wants to move from a project-based unit. In FY2014 and FY2015, HUD awarded vouchers to PHAs in multiple states. Congress directed funds to support a program for Native American veterans who are homeless or at risk. The program allows Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to administer rental assistance. HUD released program requirements on October 21, 2015. HUD released a notice on October 21, 2015, outlining program requirements and the application process for vouchers under the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Congress allocated $10 million for a pilot program to prevent homelessness among veterans, with specific criteria for site selection. HUD, in collaboration with the VA and DOL, identified five geographic areas for the program implementation through local Continuums of Care. The pilot program to prevent homelessness among veterans was formed at the local level in five selected areas with military bases, including San Diego, CA; Killeen, TX; Watertown, NY; Tacoma, WA; and Tampa, FL. The program operates similarly to the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program. The Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, provides short to medium-term rental assistance, support services, and financial aid for veterans and their families facing housing instability. Eligibility criteria include income below 50% of the area median income, experiencing homelessness or at risk of losing housing, lack of resources or support networks, and instability. In 2013, HUD released an interim report on the Homelessness Prevention Demonstration program, serving 574 households in its first year. The program targeted younger veterans, with 50% between ages 25 and 44, and a high percentage of women veterans at 26%. 45% of households served were families with children, and 76% of adult participants were unemployed at program entry. In the first year of the program, 82% of households received homelessness prevention assistance, with 19% receiving rapid rehousing. The most common financial assistance provided was rental assistance (85% of households), followed by help with utilities (44%), security and utility deposits (38%), hotel and motel vouchers (9%), and moving costs (5%). Supportive services included outreach (18% of households), case management (98%), housing search assistance (11%), and legal aid. The Department of Labor (DOL) has a dedicated office for veterans' employment needs, offering programs like the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Veterans Workforce Investment Program. HVRP, established in 1987, received $50 million through FY2016 and has a separate program for women veterans and veterans with children. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) provides services for women veterans and veterans with children, including child care. Grantees are eligible for funding for up to three years based on performance. Services offered by HVRP grantee organizations include job search assistance, job training, and follow-up support after placement. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) offers subsidized trial employment, job training, and follow-up assistance for homeless veterans. Grantees also provide supportive services like transportation, housing assistance, and mental health or substance abuse counseling. HVRP requires at least one employee to be a veteran who has experienced homelessness. In PY 2012, 17,480 homeless veterans were served, with 65% placed in employment at an average wage of $11.22 per hour. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 established a program to provide job training and placement services to veterans leaving prison. The program was expanded in 2008 and most recently authorized through FY2016. A battlefield stand down is a process where troops are removed from danger to rest, receive medical care, and recover from battle stress. Stand Downs for Homeless Veterans are local events where various organizations provide services like food, clothing, medical care, and shelter for homeless veterans. These events also offer camaraderie among veterans. Funding for stand downs comes from donations and grants. The DOL VETS office may award up to $10,000 for stand downs to eligible organizations. Historical funding levels for programs targeting homeless veterans are shown in Table 4. Table 5 displays funding for housing through HUD-VA collaboration known as HUD-VASH. HUD has funded Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans since FY1992. VA announced a plan to end homelessness among veterans on November 3, 2009. The VA announced a plan in 2009 to end homelessness among veterans within five years, focusing on outreach, treatment, prevention, housing, employment, and community partnerships. VA obligations for homeless veterans programs increased from $376 million in FY2009 to $1.5 billion in FY2014, with healthcare obligations rising from $2.5 billion to $4.8 billion. In 2015, guidance was released on ending veteran homelessness. The HUD and VA released guidance on ending veteran homelessness, outlining five criteria for communities. Homeless veteran estimates have decreased over the years, with the most recent count in 2015 showing a reduction of over 25,000 since 2009. The number of homeless veterans has decreased over the years, with the highest unmet need shifting from long-term permanent housing to child care in recent years according to the VA's CHALENG reports. The decline in estimates of homeless veterans is attributed to the increasing focus on permanent supportive housing, which provides tailored services such as health care, counseling, and employment assistance. Previously, homeless programs for veterans mainly offered transitional housing to help them stabilize and find employment before transitioning to permanent housing. With the introduction of HUD-VASH, thousands of units of permanent supportive housing have been allocated to homeless veterans in the past seven years. Congress has allocated $575 million for the program, funding 79,000 vouchers for one year. Increased funding and VA program interventions have led to a rise in the number of veterans served in homeless programs. In FY2013, the VA reported that 14% of the more-than 260,000 veterans served in VA homeless programs were those from OIF/OEF/OND. Approximately 1.76 million OEF/OIF/OND troops have been separated from active duty and become eligible for VA health benefits since 2003. The risk of becoming homeless continues for many years after service, as seen in the experiences of Vietnam War veterans. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan experience mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Veterans from Iraq have a higher rate of seeking mental health services compared to veterans from other conflicts. The length and number of deployments in Iraq increase the risk of mental health problems. Access to VA health services is crucial for veterans' reintegration into the community. Access to VA health services is vital for veterans' reintegration into the community, especially for those experiencing mental health issues. The VA reaches out to injured veterans and those receiving treatment through the DOD to inform them about available services. A study found that a higher percentage of soldiers reported mental health concerns six months after returning from deployment. The number of women enlisted in the military has increased in recent years. The percentage of female troops in the military has increased over the years, with women veterans expected to grow in numbers. In 1990, there were 1.2 million female veterans, which increased to 1.6 million in 2000 and 1.8 million in 2010. It is predicted that there will be 1.9 million female veterans by 2020. Women veterans face challenges such as unemployment, disability, and being unmarried, which are associated with homelessness. Female veterans face challenges such as unemployment, disability, and being unmarried, which are associated with homelessness. Factors linked to homelessness include screening positive for PTSD, experiencing military sexual trauma, suffering from an anxiety disorder, and having fair or poor health. Studies have shown that female veterans report high rates of sexual assault, with a significant percentage experiencing military sexual trauma. This trauma is linked to a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with mental health conditions among women veterans. In studies of returning OEF/OIF and homeless veterans, women veterans with military sexual trauma (MST) are more likely to have depressive disorders, PTSD, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, and behaviors associated with suicide. These factors can hinder women veterans' readjustment to civilian life and increase their risk of homelessness. Women veterans make up a small but growing proportion of the homeless veteran population. According to the 2012 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, homeless women veterans represented 8% of veterans living in shelters. Programs serving homeless veterans may lack adequate facilities for female veterans, especially transitional housing for women and women with children. In FY2010, 4.5% of individuals in Grant and Per Diem programs were women, while 4.9% of veterans in the Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program were women. HUD-VASH serves the highest percentage of female veterans, with approximately 11% of veterans receiving vouchers being women. The need for assistance among younger women veterans is increasing, with a higher risk of homelessness noted among this group. Intervention during transition to civilian life could benefit young, female veterans at increased risk of homelessness. Child care is a top unmet need for homeless veterans. Legislation has been enacted to improve domiciliary care for women veterans. The Benefits Act of 2010 created an HVRP grant program for women veterans and veterans with children, offering job training, counseling, job placement, and child care services. Authorized through FY2016 at $1 million per year."
