    "content": "The Act titled \"Alaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project\" is established for the purpose of managing federal lands in Alaska. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act established new units in the National Park System and National Wildlife System in Alaska to protect habitat, wildlife, and archaeological sites. These units are important for the culture and ways of Native Alaskans and rural communities. Despite provisions in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to prioritize Native lands for conservation facilities, Native corporations for visitor services, and local residents for employment, there has been little progress in increasing job opportunities for Native Alaskans and other local residents in rural communities. Indian tribes and tribal organizations in rural Alaska have a history of contracting to operate Federal programs and provide services to residents. The demonstration project aims to design innovative management strategies for conservation units in Alaska to increase efficiency, expand Native contracting opportunities, boost local employment, and support subsistence practices, Alaska Native cultures, and wildlife preservation. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct an Alaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project for up to 5 years. The Secretary will select at least 6 Alaska Native tribes per year to participate in the Demonstration Project in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. To be eligible, tribes must request participation, show financial stability, demonstrate reliance on public land units, and submit a contracting request to the Secretary. The Secretary will prioritize selection criteria for contracting specific conservation programs with multiple eligible Indian tribes or organizations. If there are overlapping requests, the tribes must agree on who will have the ability to contract or submit a joint proposal. Upon request, the Secretary shall negotiate and enter into contracts with participating Indian tribes or tribal organizations to administer programs related to conservation units. Contracts may include technical support for advisory councils, research, and monitoring. The Secretary will negotiate contracts with Indian tribes for conservation programs, including advisory councils, research, and monitoring. Time limits for negotiations are set, and provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act apply. Contracts and agreements negotiated under this Act may include terms from the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, with the same force and effect. Additional terms can be included if mutually agreed upon and not contrary to law. Contracts under this Act may include terms from the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, with additional terms as mutually agreed upon. Contracts must provide for a single-agency audit report and ensure that Federal employees are not separated during transfers to Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Transferred employees have priority placement within their agency. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, contracts negotiated with Indian tribes or tribal organizations must ensure funding not less than what the Secretary would have provided. Advance payments in annual or semiannual installments are included, with implementation starting in the first fiscal year after selection. The Demonstration Project under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act allows Indian tribes or tribal organizations to participate in conservation system unit management. The Secretary must provide detailed reports to Congress on the costs and benefits of the project, including suggestions for improvement. The Demonstration Project under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act allows Indian tribes or tribal organizations to participate in conservation system unit management. Contracts authorized under this Act shall not include revenue producing visitor services unless an agreement is reached with the most directly affected Alaskan Native corporations. Denali National Park is exempt from this Act. The Secretary may award a planning grant of $100,000 to participating Alaska Native tribes or tribal organizations for program contracting. Authorization of $600,000 in funding for planning grants under the Act for programs, functions, services, and activities. SEC. 5. ANILCA SECTION 1307 AND 1308 IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS REPORT.

The Secretary must address laws, rules, regulations, and policies limiting Alaska Native hiring or contracting for Department activities. The report must be completed within existing appropriations. Definitions for the Act include terms like \"conservation system unit,\" \"Indian tribe,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"tribal organization.\""
