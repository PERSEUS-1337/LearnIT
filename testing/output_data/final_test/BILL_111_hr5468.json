    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bridgeport Indian Colony Land Trust, Health, and Economic Development Act of 2010\". The findings are also included in the Act. The Bridgeport Indian Colony, a federally recognized tribe in California, has a reservation near Bridgeport established in 1974. The reservation is small and insufficient for housing needs. A nearby undeveloped federal land parcel could be added to the reservation to facilitate housing and community development. The Bridgeport Indian Colony aims to expand housing, community facilities, and economic development for its members. Many tribal members are interested in returning to the reservation if housing and job opportunities are available. The transfer of a federal land parcel to the Tribe will create job opportunities for both tribal and non-Indian community members. Additionally, the Tribe has significant health needs that could be addressed with a separate Federal parcel being held in trust. The Tribe is a member of the Toiyabe Indian Health Project, which provides health care services in the area. They received a grant to build the Camp Antelope Health Clinic on Federal land in Mono County. The Toiyabe Indian Health Project closed the Camp Antelope Health Clinic in 2006, but the Tribe and the Project agreed to reopen it. Tribal members currently have to drive 90 miles to Bishop for healthcare services, so taking additional land into trust will help provide healthcare to Indians and non-Indians in the area. Federal funds invested in the clinic's development highlight the importance of maintaining the land under Federal ownership. On October 20, 2009, the Mono County Board discussed this issue. On October 20, 2009, the Mono County Board of Supervisors supported transferring land into trust under the Act. On April 20, 2010, they entered a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tribe to further support the land transfer efforts. The Mono County Board of Supervisors supported transferring land into trust under the Act. The Federal lands described in subsection (b) totaling approximately 39.36 acres are declared to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Bridgeport Indian Colony. This includes specific parcels identified on a map titled \"Bridgeport Camp Antelope Parcel\" and lots 1 and 2 of a survey plat. Lots 1 and 2 of the survey plat contain 31.86 acres."
