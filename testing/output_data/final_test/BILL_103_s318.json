    "content": "The \"Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act\" allows the Secretary to reduce or suspend royalties to promote development and production on leases. No royalty payment is due on new production as defined in the Act. The \"Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act\" allows the Secretary to reduce or suspend royalties for production from leases in specific areas until capital costs are recovered from new production. The Secretary will determine if new production from a lease would be economic within ninety days of application, considering all associated costs. The lessee can provide information before the determination, which can be made for an individual lease or unit. The Secretary will redetermine the applicability of royalty relief for new production upon request by the lessee due to significant changes in factors. The redetermination must be made within sixty days, with a possible thirty-day extension if needed. The lessee will be informed in writing of the decision and the reasons behind it. The Secretary will define 'capital costs' for royalty relief, including exploration and development costs related to new production. The term 'development' in subsections (k) and (l) of this Act includes additional development activities post-production initiation from a lease. Capital costs exclude bonus bids and are adjusted for changes in the consumer price index. 'New production' refers to production from a lease without royalties prior to the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. The Water Royalty Relief Act exempts certain oil production from royalty payments if the average price of Light Sweet crude oil exceeds $28.00 per barrel. This relief applies to production from lease development activities approved by the Secretary after the enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. In months where natural gas prices exceed $3.50 per million British thermal units, production subject to royalty relief will be subject to royalties at the lease stipulated rate. Lessee's gross proceeds from such production, less Federal royalties, will count towards capital cost recovery. The Secretary will promulgate rules and regulations to implement the Act within 180 days of enactment. The system of tract nomination for oil and gas leasing in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico will not be implemented. The Secretary will review Federal regulations and policies to reduce barriers and disincentives for oil and gas production on Federal lands, including the Outer Continental Shelf. The review will assess how policies can be modified to improve cash flow and reduce compliance costs for operations. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of current royalty rates for oil and gas on Federal lands to encourage development. A report will be submitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives within ninety days. No actions have been taken within ninety days of the enactment of this Act."
