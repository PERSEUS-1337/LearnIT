    "content": "PART J of title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to create the Rural Education Initiative Act of 2001. This part includes findings related to rural education. The National Center for Educational Statistics reports that 46 percent of public schools serve rural areas. Federal education policy does not focus on the unique needs of rural school districts. Small districts struggle to use formula grant funds effectively, and rural schools face challenges in competing for competitive grants due to lack of resources. Rural school districts struggle with hiring and retaining qualified administrators and teachers, especially in reading, science, and mathematics. Teachers in rural schools often teach multiple subjects due to limited resources and face challenges such as shrinking tax bases, high transportation costs, and limited course offerings. The Small and Rural School Program authorizes a formula grant program. Rural school districts face challenges in hiring and retaining qualified staff, especially in reading, science, and mathematics, due to limited resources and other obstacles like shrinking tax bases and high transportation costs.

The agency must notify the State of their intention to use the funding by a specified date. Eligibility criteria apply to local educational agencies. Local educational agencies can use funding for education reform if the total student attendance is less than 600 and schools are in rural areas with specific codes.

The Secretary may waive criteria for rural area designation based on certification from the local or state educational agency. \"Applicable funding\" includes funds from various titles for alternative uses. State educational agencies must disburse funding to local agencies for the same fiscal year. The section outlines that funds must supplement, not replace, other education funds.

PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can award grants to eligible local educational agencies to support education reform efforts for improving academic achievement of students.

The same assessment must be used for each year of participation in the program. State educational agencies receiving funding under section 10961(c) must determine continuing participation based on assessment results after the second year of a local educational agency's participation in the program. Based on assessment results, determine if students met requirements to continue participating in the program. Only allow agencies meeting criteria to continue participation. \"Subpart 2--Low-Income And Rural School Program authorized under SEC. 10971.\" The Secretary reserves funds for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and awards grants to State educational agencies for subgrants to local educational agencies for authorized activities.

Specially qualified agencies in nonparticipating states can receive grants if the State agency does not participate in the program. Qualified agencies in a State must apply directly to the Secretary for a grant under this subpart. The Secretary may award funds to specially qualified agencies on a competitive basis. Local educational agencies are eligible for funds if at least 20% of the children they serve are from families below the poverty line and all schools served by the agency meet this criteria. Grant funds awarded to local educational agencies or schools under this subpart must be used for educational technology, professional development, technical assistance, teacher recruitment and retention, parental involvement activities, or academic enrichment programs. The schools served by the agency must be located in a community with a Rural-Urban Continuum Code of 6, 7, 8, or 9.

The report should detail how funds were awarded and used, as well as progress towards meeting stated goals and objectives.
