The Act, known as the \"Alaska Power Administration Sale Act,\" defines key terms such as \"Eklutna assets,\" \"Eklutna Purchase Agreement,\" \"Eklutna Purchasers,\" and \"Memorandum of Agreement.\" These terms relate to the Eklutna Hydroelectric Project and its related assets, involving various entities including the Municipality of Anchorage, Chugach Electric Association, and Matanuska Electric Association. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, while \"Snettishan assets\" pertain to the Snettisham Hydroelectric Project and related assets as outlined in the Snettisham Purchase Agreement of February 10, 1989. SEC. 3. SALE OF SNETTISHAM AND EKLUTNA ASSETS. The Secretary is authorized to sell and transfer the Snettisham assets to Alaska and the Eklutna assets to the Eklutna Purchasers. Other US agencies must cooperate in the sales. Appropriations are authorized for preparing and acquiring assets for sale. SEC. 4. EXEMPTION. The Eklutna and Snettisham hydroelectric projects will remain exempt from the Federal Power Act after authorized sales. The exemption does not impact the Memorandum of Agreement. SEC. 5.

If the Eklutna Purchasers sell or transfer, the rights-of-way will remain in place. If the Eklutna Purchasers sell the hydroelectric project, the Bureau of Land Management can charge fees for rights-of-way use. The Secretary will transfer land to the Purchasers at no cost if claims are invalid. The State of Alaska can select Eklutna lands for conveyance.
