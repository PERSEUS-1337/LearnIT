It accounts for one-fifth of the EU's GDP and has a per capita income of around $44,280. Germany is a high-income country and the top exporter of goods globally. Its economic policies influence the EU and have global importance, especially for the United States. Since 1949, Germany has seen a continuous rise in living standards. Since 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany has seen a continuous rise in living standards, with GDP per person increasing by a factor of 6 since 1950. The economy is heavily dependent on exports, accounting for 47% of Germany's GDP in 2008. German firms are competitive internationally, with a highly skilled workforce. Germany has been a driving force in European integration and is known as the world champion exporter. Weak consumer demand is a consistent feature of the German economy, with 63% of exports going to other EU member states in 2008. In 2008, 63% of German exports went to other EU member states and 64% of its imports came from other EU member states. The United States is Germany's largest trading partner outside of Europe, accounting for 7.2% of German exports and 4.2% of imports. Germany is the United States' largest European trading partner, with strong foreign direct investment ties. The United States accounted for $110 billion of Germany's outward FDI, while Germany's FDI in the United States stood at $212 billion in 2008. These investments drive trade and create jobs. German companies doing business in the United States employ about 670,000 people, while U.S. companies operating in Germany employ nearly 800,000 people. The strong German economy has historically facilitated mutually profitable U.S.-German commercial ties. West Germany showed impressive economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, with export-led growth based on low wages and high-level engineering. The German economy grew strongly in the 1970s and 1980s, but since the mid-1990s, it has slowed down to an average of 1.5% GDP growth per year. Unemployment has increased, reaching 10% at times, with additional 4% in government programs. Factors contributing to this include costs of reunification, social security expenses, labor market laws, and perceived over-regulation. The 5% decline in GDP growth in 2009 raises concerns about the long-term strength of the German economy. Since the mid-1990s, Germany's economy has slowed down to 1.5% GDP growth per year, with factors like reunification costs, social security expenses, and labor market laws contributing to increased unemployment. Questions have been raised about the impact of Germany's export dependency on domestic growth, but many Germans value the country's social-market economy. Policymakers have pursued export-driven growth and social cohesion through welfare programs, which most Germans support. German political leaders prioritize social cohesion over economic growth, resisting reforms to welfare programs and labor market protections. Chancellor Angela Merkel's reelection in 2009 with the Free Democratic Party may lead to market-friendly reforms, but significant restructuring of Germany's social market economy is unlikely. Failure to enact reforms could exacerbate issues related to an aging population. Failure to enact substantial reforms could lead to increased strain on Germany's economy due to an aging population and social benefit system. This resource crunch has limited Germany's flexibility domestically and influenced its international economic policies. Germany's dwindling economic resources have made it less willing to compromise on matters of economic advantage, impacting its trade leadership in Europe and the world economy. This has also affected Germany's stance on issues relevant to U.S. interests. Germany's economic performance and reform challenges are crucial for both U.S. and European economies. The report discusses Germany's growth pattern, domestic factors affecting it, and U.S.-German economic policy differences. Failure to enact reforms may strain Germany's economy, impacting its trade leadership and stance on issues relevant to U.S. interests. In the first decades of its existence, West Germany experienced impressive economic performance with high growth rates. However, in the 1980s, Germany's economic performance began to decline, falling to an annual average increase of 2.3%. The growth rate continued to decrease since 1990, with only a few exceptions. Germany recorded an average growth rate of 1.6% in the 1990s and 0.6% between 2001 and 2005. The economy bounced back from 2006-2008 with growth averaging 2.3%, but was hit hard by the global economic downturn in late 2008 and early 2009. Germany's economy contracted by 5% in 2009 due to the global economic downturn, with high unemployment rates reaching 11.7% nationwide and 18% in the former East Germany. Despite a brief recovery from 2006-2008, the country's growth has been slower compared to the Euro-zone overall. The German economy contracted by 5% in 2009, leading to high unemployment rates. The OECD predicts a rise in unemployment to 5.1 million and an increase in the unemployment rate to 11.6% by the end of 2010. There is \"hidden\" unemployment due to government schemes and early-retirement programs. The government subsidizes short-term working benefits to save jobs, with 1.4 million employees working shorter hours. The underutilization of the German labor force and foregone production due to fewer working hours and generous social benefits hinder economic growth. Factors include high costs of integrating East Germany, welfare provisions reducing work incentives, export dependency, labor market rigidities, and barriers to domestic investment. With German reunification in 1990, West Germany achieved its national objective but faced economic challenges. The strong West German economy took over a struggling East Germany, leading to privatization efforts and infrastructure development. However, the results have been mixed, with estimates of over $2 trillion transferred from west to east since 1989. The total value of transfers from west to east since 1989 is estimated at over $2 trillion. The strong West German economy underestimated the economic burden of reunification, leading to policy mistakes like the one-to-one currency exchange rate, which quadrupled East German wage costs. The decision to extend West Germany's social welfare system to East Germany may have undermined the attractiveness of East Germany for investors, as it prevented wage rates from becoming competitive. Proponents argue that these policy moves were necessary to prevent mass migration from east to west. German reunification required large annual public transfers to the east, estimated to be roughly 3%-4% of western Germany's GDP and more than one-third of the federal budget. This has placed a heavy burden on the economy of western Germany, with only one-quarter of total transfers used for investment. The decision to extend the West German currency and social market economy to the east was seen as the best policy option to avoid mass migration from east to west. One-quarter of total transfers to the east are used for investment, with most going to public and private consumption. Budgetary transfers were financed largely by issuing bonds, doubling government debt. Total government debt as a percentage of GDP has doubled since reunification, reaching 83.8% in 2010. Debt service payments equal around 15% of federal budget expenditures, impacting Germany's fiscal policy stance. The higher debt and interest burden has reduced leeway for tax reductions. Despite higher tax rates for German firms compared to other EU countries, the eastern German economy still relies on transfers from western Germany for 45% of its expenditures. While eastern German income has nearly caught up to the west, productivity remains at 60% and some areas have less than half the per capita GDP of western Germany. Population declines of 20% are also a concern, with little indication that the eastern German economy is close to self-sustainability after nearly two decades since reunification. The German economy, based on the social-market model, aims to balance free market capitalism with social protections to ensure a stable and fair income distribution. This model was developed after World War II to prevent economic and political chaos, emphasizing market capitalism, labor protection, a large welfare state, and market regulation. The current challenge is reducing dependency on transfer payments to support western German businesses and employees in the future. German social programs in the 1920s and 1930s aimed to balance free market capitalism with social protections, expanding to include old age pension support, nursing care, health insurance, and unemployment insurance in the 1970s. Despite recent reforms, German welfare programs remain generous compared to other industrialized countries. German social programs in the 1920s and 1930s aimed to balance free market capitalism with social protections, expanding to include old age pension support, nursing care, health insurance, and unemployment insurance in the 1970s. Until 2004, unemployment compensation provided for replacement of more than 50% of a person's previous net earnings and for an unlimited period of time. An estimated 40% of Germany's adult population receive some form of state income transfer, with even higher percentages in eastern Germany. Some German programs have had an impact on incentives to work by granting assistance on condition of labor income not being earned. Some German social programs provide \"wage replacement\" incomes that can discourage people from taking jobs in the private sector if the wage is not significantly higher than the assistance provided for remaining unemployed. This could lead to higher private sector wages and increased costs for businesses due to high taxes and social security contributions. Non-wage labor costs, including social security contributions, have exceeded 40% of workers' pay for years in Germany. Economists suggest that reducing these taxes could help revive the labor market, especially for low-skilled workers. With an aging population and escalating social welfare costs, Germany's public social expenditure in GDP now exceeds 30%, potentially limiting fiscal policy options in the future. The social benefits system could also impact incentives for work and entrepreneurship, crucial for stimulating growth. Germany's strong export performance has been a constant feature of the economy since the founding of the Federal Republic. The rise in exports from 9.3% of GDP in 1950 to 33% in 1990 illustrates the growing role exports have played. Efforts to increase competitiveness and the \"export mystique\" have been key in shaping German trade policy. Since 1960, German exports have steadily increased, reaching 47% of GDP by 2008. Germany has become the world's top exporter, known for cars, machinery, and chemicals. The country's exporting success is a source of pride, showcasing German skill, quality, and reliability. The impact of this success on the overall economy is debated. Germany's exporting success has led to a debate on its impact on core economic problems such as production and employment. One view suggests that Germany has maintained its lead in exports by outsourcing labor-intensive production to low-wage countries, increasing the import content of German exports. Another view argues that Germany has stayed competitive by implementing wage deflation policies, keeping wages stagnant for almost eight years. Germany's sustained wage moderation and unit cost reduction have allowed it to increase its share of internal EU exports at the expense of its neighbors. This strategy, coupled with corporate-led changes to working conditions, has lowered labor costs for exporting firms and improved German price competitiveness. However, this wage discipline has also led to a shift in demand towards exports, resulting in sluggish consumer spending. Germany's export dependency raised concerns in 2008 and 2009 due to the global economic slowdown. The increase in the value-added tax in 2007 may have impacted consumption. To stimulate domestic economic growth, the government implemented policies and passed stimulus measures totaling EUR 71 billion for 2009 and 2010. The German government implemented stimulus measures totaling EUR 71 billion for 2009 and 2010, including a \"short-term working benefit\" and a \"cash for clunkers\" program. German economists highlight the positive effects of public expenditures on domestic demand. Some policymakers believe the export-led growth model is sustainable, despite G-20 pledges to correct current account imbalances. Germany benefits from running a current account surplus by reducing domestic consumption and increasing savings. However, some economists argue that the economy should be more balanced by encouraging domestic consumption. This would require Germans to spend and invest more at home, leading to smaller trade surpluses. It is believed that for a sustained global economic recovery, countries with trade surpluses like Germany will need to run smaller surpluses to accommodate deficits in countries like the United States. Germany's current account surpluses are driven by excess savings over investment. Gross national savings increased from 21% to 24% of GDP between 1990 and 2008, while gross fixed investment declined from 21.5% to 18.4% of GDP. Rising direct investment outflows coincide with Germany's largest surpluses, indicating domestic barriers may be hindering investment. The barriers and rigidities in Germany's labor and product markets, such as wage replacement policies and restrictions on starting new businesses, are hindering investment and contributing to excess savings going abroad. These policies limit earnings for skilled workers, make services more expensive, and deter new investments. Germany's economic challenges include low growth, high unemployment, and public finance deterioration. These issues are linked to reunification costs, welfare expenses, and reliance on exports. Demographic trends worsen the strain on the economy. Reforms proposed aim to strengthen the economy by changing social and labor policies. Reforms in Germany aim to create a more dynamic economy driven by domestic demand rather than exports. Political opposition to these reforms is significant due to the benefits the current system provides to the public. Previous reform efforts, such as Agenda 2010 in 2003 and 2004, aimed to boost growth, employment, and consolidate public finances. However, selling tough reforms to voters and vested interests has been a challenge for successive German governments. Agenda 2010 in Germany aimed to boost growth, employment, and consolidate public finances through tax reforms, labor market flexibility, and cuts in state benefits. The most controversial aspect was the Hartz IV reform, which merged unemployment and welfare benefits, reducing the period for unemployment compensation and replacing it with less generous social assistance benefits. These changes were justified by the need to reduce government expenditures and lower real wages. The Agenda 2010 reforms in Germany aimed to boost GDP growth and reduce unemployment by lowering real wages and creating new jobs. Despite their positive impact on the economy, the reforms were unpopular and led to Schr\u00f6der losing the Chancellorship. This resulted in a decline in political support for the SPD, forcing an early election in 2005 which the party lost. The SPD remained in the governing coalition as a junior party to Merkel's CDU. Merkel, leading a grand coalition government with the SPD, took a cautious approach to economic reform, passing only one significant reform - a gradual rise in the retirement age to 67. Other reforms rolled back by lengthening unemployment benefits and offering pensioners relief from rising prices. Germany is implementing reforms to benefit older workers by introducing minimum wages in certain industries and redesigning the welfare state to achieve a more balanced economy. With a declining population and an aging workforce, adjustments such as redefining benefits and increasing the retirement age may be necessary to reduce social security expenditures. These reforms aim to make German workers more competitive in the global market. Reform suggestions in Germany aim to make workers more competitive by adjusting working hours, wages, and education. Proposals include decentralized wage determination and promoting service industries to reduce dependency on exports for economic growth. Leaders believe exports are crucial for prosperity, hoping global demand will revive the economy. Some proponents of the German economic model argue against sweeping structural reform, citing the economy's resilience over decades. Germans value social welfare programs, potentially prioritizing social cohesion over GDP growth. Despite consensus on the need for reforms, politicians are hesitant to limit welfare spending during economic downturns. The German government is hesitant to limit social welfare spending during economic downturns, with little debate on revamping the welfare system or deregulating the economy. Chancellor Merkel acknowledges the challenges ahead, including higher unemployment and the need to stabilize the fragile economy. Chancellor Merkel aims to address challenges like higher unemployment by focusing on economic growth through tax cuts, continued government spending, and longer-term efforts to control spending. The government plans to extend the K \u00fcrzarbeit program and implement tax cuts worth EUR 24 billion over four years. Merkel advocates for a balance between market-led growth and social spending, following the traditional social market economy model. Germany's budgetary constraints due to weak economic growth and high social security costs limit its policymaking flexibility. This has impacted its economic and trade leadership in Europe and its alignment with U.S. interests on global economic issues. Germany has traditionally been a key ally of the United States on international trade issues, advocating for trade liberalization within the EU and globally. However, its leadership in the free trade bloc within Europe has weakened in recent years. Germany's support for trade liberalization within the EU has weakened in recent years, as seen in Chancellor Schr\u00f6der's agreement with France on agricultural liberalization parameters. This shift in stance has hindered progress in the Doha Round of trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization. Additionally, Germany is less unconditionally supportive of European integration, especially when it involves international trade pressures like labor mobility and low-wage service providers. Germany opposes further market liberalization in Europe, including granting full labor mobility to citizens of new Central and Eastern European EU member states. Labor restrictions on workers from 2004 EU joiners were extended for two more years due to concerns about labor market disturbance. Germany faced criticism for lobbying General Motors to sell a majority stake in its Opel unit to Magna International and Sberbank. The Merkel government approved loan guarantees for the takeover, leading to speculation about plant closures in Belgium, Spain, and the UK to keep German plants open. Critics, including the Belgian government, viewed Germany's actions as questionable. On November 3, 2009, GM decided to maintain its European business and pull out of the proposal to sell Opel, angering German officials. Chancellor Merkel criticized the decision, fearing job losses in Germany. GM will seek financial support from European governments to restructure Opel, but Germany is unlikely to support any deal involving significant job losses. The US and Germany have differences over responses to the global economic downturn, with the Obama Administration criticizing Germany's cautious approach. Germany has faced criticism for a cautious response to the crisis and reluctance to support European banking sector fixes. Political leaders defend their actions, urging an \"exit strategy\" from fiscal stimulus to avoid deficits and inflation. They argue that domestic spending won't address the crisis's root causes, blaming inadequate global financial market regulation. Many in Germany blame the global crisis on profligate consumption and unregulated markets in the US and UK. US policymakers argue that Germany's large current account surpluses, along with China and Japan, contributed to the crisis by funneling excess savings. They believe that if the US had not pursued accommodating monetary policies in the early 2000s, global demand would have fallen short of supply, leading to increased unemployment worldwide. In the global economy, the United States is seen as the \"consumer of last resort\" to keep the world economy growing. Reducing Germany's current account surplus is crucial for global rebalancing. German leaders are hesitant to increase domestic demand due to concerns about long-term debt and the stability of their export-oriented economy. Chancellor Merkel signed a statement at the G-20 meeting in 2009 pledging to promote balanced growth. Germany has implemented stimulus measures totaling EUR 71 billion to support economic growth and the private sector. Officials highlight the positive effects of \"automatic stabilizers\" on domestic demand. Unlike the U.S., Germany's focus is not on increasing consumption but on balanced growth. Germany's stimulus packages focus on private investment, infrastructure projects, and stabilizing exports. High household savings justify not providing tax breaks for consumption. The new Merkel government plans tax breaks for companies to reduce unemployment. Berlin also tightens financial regulation. Some U.S. policymakers feel Germany relies on the U.S. and UK for export demand. Germany plans to benefit from increased demand in the United States and UK to boost exports. Merkel's new government aims to restore growth by implementing tax cuts for businesses and the middle class. However, broader fiscal spending is unlikely due to concerns about inflation. New budget rules, including a deficit ceiling of 0.35% of GDP, will limit efforts to increase domestic demand and support global rebalancing. Under a constitutional amendment, the federal deficit cannot exceed 0.35% of GDP, and states cannot run deficits after 2020. Germany aims to be more austere than other countries. Germany has been hesitant to use economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool, questioning their effectiveness and potential for backfiring without strong multilateral support. Germany's reluctance to use economic sanctions is influenced by commercial interests and the economy's dependence on industrial exports. Critics argue that without strong multilateral support, sanctions are likely to fail as implementing countries lose leverage. Industrial lobbies play a significant role in prioritizing commercial relations in German foreign policy, particularly with regards to Russia, China, and Iran. Germany, as part of the EU-3, has been involved in efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Despite pressure to endorse stricter sanctions, Germany remains reluctant due to its important trading relationship with Iran. German exports to Iran have fluctuated, with some arguing that sanctions without Russian and Chinese support would be ineffective. Germany's largest banks have withdrawn from the Iranian market, but officials in Berlin continue to provide export credit guarantees to companies doing business with Iran. Since 2005, new export credit guarantees for companies in Iran from German officials in Berlin have decreased by over half. While some see this as Berlin increasing economic pressure on Tehran, others argue that German-Iranian trade remains strong and politicians are unlikely to further reduce commercial ties. German officials are more open to imposing economic sanctions on Iran now but question their effectiveness. Public support in Germany for military action to stop Iran's nuclear programs is low compared to the US."
