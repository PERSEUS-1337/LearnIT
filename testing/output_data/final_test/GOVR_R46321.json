    "content": "The mission of HHS is to enhance the health and well-being of Americans by providing effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. HHS is organized into 11 main agencies responsible for administering various programs and conducting research. The operating divisions, including those in the U.S. Public Health Service, have diverse missions in support of public health. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for providing health care services, advancing medical research, preventing diseases and controlling health hazards, and regulating food and drugs. The remaining HHS operating divisions focus on administering human services programs for vulnerable populations, with CMS overseeing Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The President is required to submit an annual federal budget to Congress, with proposals often requiring changes to laws governing spending levels. Discretionary spending, about one-third of the budget, is decided each fiscal year through appropriations. Congress is not obligated to adopt the President's recommendations, but the budget submission initiates the congressional budget process. The FY2021 President's budget request was submitted to Congress on February 10, 2020, reflecting enacted FY2020 funding levels with some exceptions for programs funded outside the annual appropriations process. Some FY2020 amounts are still estimates due to pending finalization. The FY2021 President's budget request submitted to Congress on February 10, 2020, reflects enacted FY2020 funding levels as estimates. HHS would spend an estimated $1.370 trillion in outlays in FY2021, $48 billion more than FY2020 and $156 billion more than FY2019. HHS has accounted for at least 20% of all federal outlays since FY1995, with OMB estimating 27% in FY2019 and projecting 28% in the future. In FY2021, HHS is projected to account for 28% of federal outlays if all proposals in the President's budget request are enacted. Mandatory spending, mainly from Medicare and Medicaid, is expected to make up 86% of HHS spending. Discretionary spending only represents about 8% of estimated HHS outlays in the President's request. HHS receives significant discretionary funding, accounting for almost 8% of all discretionary budget authority in FY2019. Mandatory spending, mainly from Medicare and Medicaid, makes up 86% of HHS spending. The HHS budget reflects funding from various resources, including annual appropriations. The HHS budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funding accounting for 8% of the total budget authority. Mandatory spending, primarily from Medicare and Medicaid, makes up 86% of HHS spending. The budget request covers the department as a whole, with funding divided across three appropriations bills. Some mandatory programs, like Medicaid, require annual appropriations despite being controlled by the authorizing statute. The HHS budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funding accounting for 8% of the total budget authority. Funding for certain HHS agencies and activities is provided through three different appropriations bills: LHHS, INT, and AG. Each appropriations act provides discretionary HHS funding, with authorizing laws providing funding for other mandatory spending programs. HHS budget materials include estimates for mandatory spending programs under proposed law and current law. The proposed law estimates for mandatory spending programs in the HHS budget reflect changes in mandatory spending proposed in the FY2021 budget request. These estimates assume no changes to existing policies and are based on criteria established in current authorizing law. Other estimates from HHS, OMB, or Congress may reflect current law instead. Agencies within HHS may have the authority to use user fees and other collections to supplement their appropriations. HHS agencies can use user fees and transfers from other sources to supplement their appropriations. Budgetary totals at the program level may differ from appropriations bills, with notable variances for agencies like FDA and AHRQ. The Administration may use different conventions for estimating HHS programs compared to congressional scorekeepers. Transfers of funding between HHS agencies or to other federal agencies may also impact budget estimates. The FY2021 HHS budget request includes transfers of funding between agencies and to other federal agencies, not always reflected in congressional documents. CMS accounts for the largest share of the request, with a focus on mandatory spending programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The request includes proposals to reduce spending on these programs compared to current law estimates. The FY2021 HHS budget request includes proposals to reduce spending on CMS programs compared to current law estimates. Discretionary funds for CMS primarily support program operations and efforts to reduce health care fraud.

This represents a decrease of roughly $2.6 billion (-6%) from FY2020. The FY2021 HHS budget request includes reductions in funding for NIH and ACF. NIH would receive a decrease of $2.6 billion (-6%) from FY2020, while ACF would see a decrease of $4.2 billion (-17%). The majority of the NIH budget would support biomedical research, and ACF's funding would mainly go towards early childhood care and education programs. Several ACF programs, including LIHEAP and CSBG, are proposed for elimination. The FY2021 HHS budget request includes reductions in funding for NIH and ACF. NIH would receive a decrease of $2.6 billion (-6%) from FY2020, while ACF would see a decrease of $4.2 billion (-17%). The budget request provides context for each HHS operating division and the Office of the Secretary, displaying funding estimates over the four prior fiscal years (FY2017-FY2019). The table shows amounts in terms of budget authority (BA) and outlays, representing different ways of accounting for funding provided to each HHS agency. For example, Table 4 shows $0 in FY2021 BA for AHRQ. The FY2021 HHS budget request includes reductions in funding for NIH and ACF.
