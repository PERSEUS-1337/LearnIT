    "content": "The states have traditionally been responsible for permitting electricity transmission facilities, considering local factors like environmental concerns and safety. While the federal government has focused on transmission reliability, it has mostly left siting decisions to states. However, with growing concerns over grid congestion, the federal government has taken on a \"backstop\" role in transmission siting. The federal government has taken on a \"backstop\" role in transmission siting to encourage development of renewable energy in remote areas. However, court decisions have hindered federal efforts to create transmission corridors, leading to a lack of such corridors currently in effect. The federal government's increased role in transmission siting decisions has raised legal and policy issues, including concerns over loss of local and regional control. The Federal Power Act reserves certain governance aspects to states, leading to resistance from state commissions and federalism advocates. This report reviews the history of transmission siting, federal authority in designating transmission corridors, legal issues, and potential future expansions of federal transmission siting. The history of the power industry and development of the transmission grid is essential to understanding federal involvement in electricity transmission siting decisions. Transmission lines connect power generation facilities to distribution systems for final delivery of electricity. In the 20th century, vertically integrated electric utilities owned and operated these lines. The Federal Power Act of 1920 granted jurisdiction over wholesale electric power transactions and interstate transmission to the Federal Power Commission. Over time, local electric power systems interconnected into larger regional grids for reliability and economic benefits. The development of higher voltage transmission lines allowed for long-distance electricity transmission with minimal losses, leading to the interconnection of power systems for reliability and economic benefits. While states remained the primary authority for siting power transmission facilities, federal transmission systems like the Tennessee Valley Authority had some independence. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted the Department of Energy the authority to designate \"National Interest Electric\" for transmission siting. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the Department of Energy to designate \"National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors\" for the construction and operation of electricity transmission facilities. This federal authority is a \"backstop\" that is only used if the state lacks the authority to issue permits or has withheld approval for more than one year. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the Department of Energy to designate \"National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors\" to address transmission capacity constraints. Some legislators and commentators advocate for an expanded federal role in transmission siting to promote green energy technology. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has limited federal siting authority under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, prompting calls for legislation to expand FERC's authority. Congressional power to regulate interstate commerce has evolved over the years, potentially impacting legislation on transmission facilities siting. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce evolved over time. In the early 1900s, the Court struck down statutes extending commerce regulation to activities like production and manufacturing. However, in 1937, the Court ruled that Congress can protect interstate commerce from obstructions that affect commercial transactions. Subsequent decisions granted Congress discretion in regulating activities affecting interstate commerce as long as the legislation was reasonably related to its goals. This allowed for regulation of local commerce if market forces were impacted. The Supreme Court has ruled that local commerce can be regulated by the federal government if it negatively affects interstate commerce. In the case of United States v. Lopez, the Court identified three categories of laws authorized by the Commerce Clause. The power to regulate commerce applies to intrastate activities only when they \"substantially\" affect commerce. The Supreme Court has identified three categories of laws authorized by the Commerce Clause, allowing for regulation of intrastate activities that substantially affect commerce. Legislation impacting the interstate electricity grid could be considered an \"instrumentality\" of interstate commerce, similar to other interstate systems like railroads or the telephone network. Demonstrating that legislation is intended to ensure safety, efficiency, and accessibility of the electricity grid could support its classification under the Commerce Clause. Legislation aimed at enhancing the reliability of electricity service by streamlining the permit process for transmission facility construction could fall under the category of laws affecting interstate commerce. This could be justified by the argument that national interest in siting transmission facilities could have a significant economic impact on interstate commerce. The courts have found legislation impacting the electricity industry to be within Congress's Commerce Clause authority. FERC v. Mississippi case involved challenges to provisions in PURPA directing state utility commissions to consider retail rate designs and regulatory standards. Mississippi alleged that these requirements exceeded congressional power. The Court rejected Mississippi's challenge to PURPA requirements, deferring to congressional findings on the need for increased energy conservation, efficiency, and equitable retail rates. The Court determined that the congressional findings had a rational basis, supported by committee hearings. The Court upheld FERC's jurisdiction over electricity transmission, emphasizing the importance of interstate commerce in the energy sector. This included a mandate for utilities to provide open access to their transmission facilities for both wholesale and retail customers. The Court upheld FERC's jurisdiction over electricity transmission, emphasizing interstate commerce in the energy sector. FERC's authority was challenged but the Court ruled that retail transmissions are considered interstate commerce. This decision could impact future congressional exercises of the Commerce power in the electricity marketplace. The Supreme Court upheld FERC's jurisdiction over electricity transmission, citing interstate commerce in the energy sector. This decision could affect future congressional exercises of Commerce power in the electricity marketplace, allowing federal jurisdiction up to a consumer's toaster. The Court's consistent stance is that legislation impacting electricity transmission, even locally, affects interstate commerce due to the interconnected grid system. In 2005, EPAct granted FERC a federal role in transmission siting decisions, establishing a \"backstop\" authority for issuing permits in designated National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors. The Secretary of Energy conducts studies to identify areas with transmission constraints, allowing FERC to intervene in siting decisions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted FERC authority to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors based on factors like economic vitality, energy independence, and national defense. This allows FERC to issue permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted FERC authority to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, allowing FERC to issue permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities in these corridors. The permit application must meet specific criteria to be eligible for FERC authorization. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted FERC authority to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, allowing FERC to issue permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities. The permit application must meet specific criteria, including reducing transmission congestion, enhancing energy independence, and being consistent with public interest and national energy policy. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted FERC authority to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, allowing FERC to issue permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified DOE's mission for NIETCs to include areas where renewable energy may be hindered by lack of grid access. FERC's transmission siting authority under EPAct functions as a backstop authority, permitting transmission facilities when there is no state authority or when the state agency has withheld approval for more than one year. The FERC rulemaking proceeding established regulations for applying for federal transmission facility permits in national interest electric transmission corridors. One controversial interpretation of Section 1221 of EPAct limited permit applications to projects where state approval had been withheld for over a year. The FERC rulemaking proceeding established regulations for federal transmission facility permits in national interest electric transmission corridors. One interpretation of Section 1221 of EPAct limited permit applications to projects where state approval had been withheld for over a year. FERC found that rejection by the state agency was equivalent to \"withholding approval,\" making a project eligible for a federal permit if more than a year had passed since the permit request was submitted. In a FERC rulemaking proceeding, the interpretation of EPAct Section 1221 led to debate over whether withholding approval includes denial of an application. Commissioner Suedeen Kelly disagreed with the majority's interpretation, stating it goes against the plain language and purpose of the statute. Commissioner Kelly argued that the FERC's decision infringes on state authority by giving them no real choice in permitting decisions, essentially preempting state law without clear justification. Courts have traditionally been cautious in finding federal preemption of state laws, requiring strong reasons or clear congressional intent. Courts must presume that Congress did not intend to displace state law, as there is no evidence to counter this presumption against pre-emption. It is unlikely that Congress would have omitted denial of a permit from the list of circumstances triggering Commission jurisdiction. FERC's interpretation of the \"withholding approval\" language from Section 1221 of EPAct was challenged in requests for rehearing of Order No. 689, but FERC denied rehearing in Order No. 689-A, stating that the word \"withheld\" includes denying approval. FERC concluded that \"withheld approval for more than one year\" includes any action that results in an applicant not receiving state approval within one year. Commissioner Kelly dissented, citing her previous reasoning. In Piedmont Environmental Council v. FERC, organizations challenged FERC's interpretation of EPAct regarding transmission siting authority when a state has \"withheld approval for more than 1 year.\" The court reversed FERC's classification of a denial as \"withholding approval\" under EPAct language. It held that continuous withholding for over a year does not include a denial within the deadline. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in January 2010. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in January 2010 regarding FERC's interpretation of EPAct. The Fourth Circuit's decision in Piedmont Environmental Council v. FERC reversed FERC's interpretation in certain states, impacting permit approvals. FERC currently lacks authority to issue permits under EPAct due to the absence of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors. The Department of Energy's creation of the Mid-Atlantic Area and Southwest Area National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors sparked controversy due to the broad scope of the corridors, leading to concerns about federal overreach in local decision-making. Despite protests, the corridors were approved in October 2007. The Department of Energy approved National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors in October 2007, but they were vacated in February 2011. The Ninth Circuit found that the Department failed to consult with affected states as required by EPAct during the Congestion Study. The court determined that the Department's actions did not amount to consultation, as Congress intended for the Department to confer with the states. The Department's failure to provide modeling data to affected states hindered their ability to consult with the government, which was not considered a harmless error. During debates on the federal government's authority to site electricity transmission facilities, policymakers discussed expanding the federal role to address grid congestion, reliability, and clean energy development. Former FERC Chair Joseph Kelliher has been a prominent commentator on transmission siting policy. Former FERC Chair Joseph Kelliher advocated for Congress to grant FERC exclusive federal siting authority for transmission facilities to address reliability, promote competitive markets, and support green energy. He criticized the current transmission siting framework as leading to prolonged litigation and diffusing responsibility. Current FERC Chair Jon Wellinghoff also supports a more active federal role in transmission siting. Jon Wellinghoff, the current FERC Chair, believes that the federal government should play a more active role in siting electricity transmission facilities to meet renewable energy goals. He suggested giving FERC authority similar to that for natural gas pipelines, citing FERC's expertise in making siting decisions and efficient public participation processes. Jon Wellinghoff, the FERC Chair, proposes granting FERC authority in electric transmission facility siting to support renewable energy goals. This suggestion is met with opposition from state regulatory agencies like NARUC, who argue for limiting FERC's siting authority and maintaining primary jurisdiction by the states. NARUC recommends that any grant of additional siting authority to FERC for interstate transmission should include a regulatory agreement on cost allocation among states. The federal government may have a more significant role in siting transmission facilities on federal lands, with DOE authorized to coordinate federal authorizations and environmental reviews under Section 216(h) of the Federal Power Act. This authority was delegated to FERC for transmission facilities on federal lands. The DOE has the lead agency authority for transmission facilities on federal lands in National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors. A Memorandum of Understanding was issued to improve coordination among project applicants, federal agencies, states, and tribes involved in the permitting process for electric transmission facilities on federal lands. DOE serves as the single point of contact for coordinating all federal authorizations required for siting transmission facilities on federal lands. The lead agency's responsibilities under the MOU for transmission line projects include coordinating activities, consulting with relevant agencies, conducting environmental reviews, maintaining records, and implementing necessary procedures. There has been a recent push to expand the federal government's role in transmission siting, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 creating a \"backstop\" siting authority for FERC in certain cases of grid congestion. Recently, there have been suggestions and legislative proposals to expand the federal role in electric facility transmission siting due to grid congestion concerns. Legal precedent indicates that federal involvement would likely be constitutional if connected to interstate commerce. However, federal courts of appeals have hindered government efforts to create transmission corridors without state approval."
