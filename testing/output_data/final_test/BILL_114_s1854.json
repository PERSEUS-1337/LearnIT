The Postal Service is also required to develop guidelines for these upgrades. The Postal Service is required to develop guidelines for contracted and purchased vehicles, ensuring compliance with emissions standards and limiting carbon dioxide emissions to an average of 250 grams per vehicle mile. The Postal Service guidelines require vehicles to have crash avoidance technologies, meet fuel economy standards of 34.1 miles per gallon, and comply with emissions and safety standards for carbon dioxide, fuel economy, and safety. The Postal Service must equip vehicles with crash avoidance technologies and meet fuel economy standards. Standards apply to contracted vehicles and those purchased after the enactment of the Act. The Postal Service aims to reduce petroleum consumption by 2% annually until fiscal year 2025 compared to 2005 levels. The Postal Service can reinvest cost savings in innovation, research, and operations. They must use crash avoidance technologies for safety. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the Postal Service's potential to provide public broadband Internet service and Internet voting within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The study aims to explore cost-effective strategies utilizing Postal Service infrastructure, technology, and networks to benefit the public interest and improve the Postal Service's financial position."
