    "content": "Comprehensive refugee reform legislation, the Refugee Protection Act of 2011 (S. 1202 / H.R. 2185), introduced by Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and House Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren, would make significant revisions to asylum policy. Among the asylum revisions in the bill are the elimination of time limits on seeking asylum in cases of changed circumstances, providing alternatives to detention of asylum seekers, modifying elements necessary for asylum granting, and allowing aliens interdicted at sea the opportunity for an asylum interview. Foreign nationals seeking asylum in the United States must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. They can apply for asylum with USCIS or seek asylum before an immigration judge during removal proceedings. Foreign nationals arriving at a U.S. port of entry without proper immigration documents or engaging in fraud are placed in expedited removal. If they express fear of persecution, they receive a \"credible fear\" hearing and may be referred to an immigration judge for a hearing. The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security have discretion in granting asylum, with exclusions for those involved in persecution or convicted of serious crimes. Mandatory denials of asylum include being a danger to the community, firmly resettled in another country, or a national security threat. The report discusses asylum policy, top sending countries, asylum approvals by country of origin, and legislative policy issues. The United States agreed to the U.N. Refugee Protocol in 1968, which includes the principle of nonrefoulement. The U.N. Refugee Protocol, agreed to by the United States in 1968, ensures rights and protections for refugees. The Refugee Act of 1980 codified the definition of a refugee in U.S. immigration law, leading to a spike in asylum claims. The Refugee Act of 1980 led to a spike in asylum claims, with mass migration of asylum seekers from Cuba, Haiti, Central America, and China in the 1980s and 1990s. Events like the Tiananmen Square massacre and the coup in Haiti triggered waves of asylum seekers to the United States. In 1993, 683 Chinese arrived in California on three vessels, while 285 Chinese landed in New York on the \"Golden Venture.\" Asylum claims peaked at 149,566 in FY1995, with a backlog of 457,670 cases by the end of the year. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 made significant changes to the asylum process, including expedited removal and limits on judicial review. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) made changes to asylum process, including limiting judicial review and adding provisions for refugees to request asylum based on persecution from coercive population control policies. Asylum claims with the INS decreased after IIRIRA, and the Real ID Act of 2005 further revised asylum law by establishing standards of proof for asylum seekers. The credibility of an asylum claim is crucial in determining the likelihood of persecution if the applicant is returned home. The concept of \"credible fear\" and \"well-founded fear\" are key in establishing asylum standards, along with considering mixed motives for persecution. The INA defines credible fear as a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum, taking into account the credibility of the applicant's statements and known facts. The credible fear concept serves as a pre-screening standard for asylum eligibility, broader than the well-founded fear standard. To qualify for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate a fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion, with a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution if they return to their country. An asylum seeker must show a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion to qualify for asylum. They must also prove they are unable or unwilling to return to their country due to this fear. The regulations do not require evidence of individual persecution if there is a pattern of persecution in the applicant's country. An asylum seeker must demonstrate a reasonable fear of persecution based on specific grounds such as race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion to qualify for asylum. The persecutor's intent can have multiple motives, as long as one is based on the statutorily enumerated grounds. The applicant does not need to conclusively prove the reasons for past or potential persecution, but must provide evidence that suggests a connection to a protected ground. The asylum seeker must show that persecution was motivated by a protected ground, such as race or religion. There are two avenues to seek asylum - affirmative and defensive applications, with the burden of proof on the asylum seeker. In the United States, asylum seekers must prove they meet the refugee definition in the INA. They file an I-589 form with USCIS for an interview with an Asylum Officer. The officers grant asylum or refer unsuccessful applicants to immigration judges based on the application, interview, and country conditions. If approved, the foreign national undergoes checks before receiving asylum. Since the enactment of IIRIRA in 1996, there has been a 79% decrease in affirmative asylum cases filed, with a rebound in FY2000 and FY2001. The number of approved asylum cases more than doubled from FY1996 to FY2002, then declined to the lowest point in FY2009. Asylum officers do not deny claims but refer unsuccessful applicants to immigration judges for formal proceedings. Applicants in the affirmative process are not subject to mandatory detention requirements. In the affirmative process, applicants for asylum are not subject to mandatory detention requirements while their applications are being adjudicated. Defensive applications for asylum are raised during removal proceedings as a defense. Immigration judges and the BIA have exclusive control over asylum claims, which are litigated in immigration court with formal procedures. If the issue of asylum is not raised at the beginning of the process, it can only be raised after a successful motion to reopen is filed with the court. Defensive asylum claims may result in detention until a ruling by an immigration judge. The number of defensive asylum claims has decreased by 53% since FY1996, while approved cases have increased by 99% over a 14-year period. EOIR judges approved 5,131 cases in FY1996 and 10,186 cases in FY2009. Border Protection (CBP) officer can exclude foreign nationals without proper documentation through expedited removal unless they express fear of persecution. CBP officers must ask specific questions to identify those afraid of return. The foreign national expressing fear of return is detained by ICE and interviewed by a USCIS asylum officer for a \"credible fear\" determination. Those with a credible fear are referred to an EOIR immigration judge for asylum, while those without can request a review. USCIS has seen an increase in credible fear claims, with EOIR also experiencing a rise in reviews. The rise in EOIR numbers from 114 in FY2005 to 887 in FY2009 is notable. The former INS published a notice in 2002 regarding expedited removal proceedings for certain aliens arriving by sea. National security concerns were cited due to illegal mass migration diverting resources. The Attorney General's ruling in 2003 instructed immigration judges to consider national security interests when making bond determinations for unauthorized migrants. The case involved a Haitian unauthorized migrant who arrived by sea in Biscayne Bay, FL, in 2002 and was released on bond by an immigration judge. The Attorney General vacated the BIA decision regarding his release. All foreign nationals seeking asylum undergo multiple background checks, whether they enter legally or illegally. They are screened by various agencies such as consular officers, CBP officers, U.S. Border Patrol, and ICE agents. When asylum is requested, aliens are fingerprinted at USCIS-authorized sites. Aliens claiming relief from removal due to torture may be treated separately under regulations implementing the Torture Convention. The alien must establish torture involves severe pain or suffering, intentional infliction, and involvement of a public official. An applicant for non-removal under Article 3 must prove likelihood of torture if removed. Testimony may suffice without corroboration. If a reliable diplomatic assurance is obtained, the claim for protection will not be considered further. Foreign nationals seeking asylum in the United States have historically come from the Western Hemisphere, particularly Central America and the Caribbean. In recent years, asylum cases from the People's Republic of China and Somalia have increased, while numbers from Central America have decreased. The PRC became the top source country for asylum claims in FY1999, with a significant rise in cases by FY2002. In FY2009, asylum seekers from the People's Republic of China (PRC) dominated both affirmative and defensive asylum caseloads, comprising 36% of affirmative cases and 24% of defensive cases. Western Hemisphere nations like Haiti, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Colombia were also among the top 10 source countries for asylum seekers. Ethiopia was the only African nation in the top 10. \"Credible fear\" claims were smaller in number, with the PRC and El Salvador being leading source countries. In FY2009, El Salvador sent a comparable number of \"credible fear\" claimants as the People's Republic of China. More Western Hemisphere nations were among the top 10 source countries for \"credible fear\" claimants. The report focuses on six major source countries for asylum seekers: PRC, Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Mexico. The analysis focuses on six major source countries for asylum seekers: PRC, Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Mexico. Data on affirmative, defensive, and \"credible fear\" claims for these countries from FY1997 through FY2009 is presented. PRC asylum cases peaked in FY2002 for both affirmative and defensive claims. Time series data on \"credible fear\" claims were available since FY2005. The analysis focuses on six major source countries for asylum seekers: PRC, Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Mexico. Affirmative claims for asylum rose by 268.4% from FY1997 to FY2009, while defensive claims increased by only 11.4% during the same period. Colombian asylum cases peaked in FY2002, showing a bell curve pattern. Overall trends of Colombian asylum seekers from FY1997 through FY2009 increased by 48.2%. The overall trends of Colombian asylum seekers from FY1997 through FY2009 show an increase of 48.2% and 53.6%. Affirmative claims averaged 2,351 and defensive claims averaged 3,072 over 13 years. \"Credible fear\" claims decreased by 54.6% from FY2005 to FY2009. Affirmative asylum claims from El Salvador declined by 90.4% from FY1997 to FY2009. Defensive claims for Salvadorans peaked in FY1998 and FY2007. Overall, defensive asylum claims for Salvadorans decreased by 53.2%. The number of \"credible fear\" claims during expedited removal rose sharply from FY2005 to FY2009. Asylum seekers from Ethiopia had the smallest number of cases among six source countries studied, with a 13-year average of 972 affirmative claims and 689 defensive claims. Ethiopian asylum seekers consistently filed more affirmative cases than defensive cases from FY1997 through FY2009. The number of Ethiopian \"credible fear\" claims during expedited removal increased significantly from 13 in FY2005 to 107 in FY2009. Haitians interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard do not often claim asylum in the United States, and the number of asylum seekers from Haiti reaching the U.S. has remained relatively stable over a 13-year period. The number of asylum seekers filing affirmative, defensive, and \"credible fear\" claims has decreased over a 13-year period. Haitian asylum seekers saw a 74.5% decrease in affirmative claims, a 65.3% decrease in defensive claims, and a 57.4% decrease in \"credible fear\" claims. Mexican asylum seekers also experienced a decline, with a 89.8% decrease in affirmative cases and a 84.7% decrease in defensive claims from FY1997 through FY2009. The number of defensive claims has decreased by 84.7% from FY1997 through FY2009. Mexican \"credible fear\" claims have risen from 107 in FY2005 to 338 in FY2009. Asylum patterns varied among six selected source countries over a 13-year period. The data analysis suggests that conditions in major source countries drive asylum seekers, based on factors like economic, environmental, political, religious, or social issues. Country conditions are crucial in determining asylum claims to prevent persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Individualized persecution or persecution due to group identity can be grounds for asylum if there is a risk of suffering such persecution upon return to the country. Asylum seekers can be granted protection if they fear persecution in their home country based on factors like race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The number of asylum cases approved for individuals from the People's Republic of China (PRC) was high in FY2009, reflecting concerns about human rights abuses in the country. Asylum seekers from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Haiti had a significant portion of approved asylum cases in FY2009. The U.S. Coast Guard's interdiction of Haitians has reduced the number of asylum seekers from Haiti. African nations like Cameroon and Eritrea had fewer asylum seekers compared to other top source countries. In FY2009, African nations like Cameroon, Eritrea, and Ethiopia were among the top 10 source countries for approved asylum cases by USCIS and EOIR. Over the past decade, countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, Cameroon, Liberia, Egypt, and Sudan have been prominent sources for approved asylum cases. Middle Eastern and South Asian nations such as Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Burma also appeared in the top 20 source countries for asylum cases. Iraq and India were among the top 10 source countries for approved asylum cases in FY2009. Other top sending countries included Colombia, Haiti, Guatemala, and the PRC. Disparities in approval rates were found among USCIS regional asylum offices and EOIR immigration courts. Fredric N. Tulsky was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for investigative reporting on the inconsistent administration of political asylum. Syracuse University researchers found a lack of consistency in asylum cases. The Stanford Law Review analyzed disparities in asylum adjudication by EOIR immigration judges and USCIS asylum officers. A study found significant differences in approval rates for asylum seekers from the PRC across regions and jurisdictions from FY1994 to FY2005. Approval rates for PRC claimants varied widely, with some regions granting zero to over 90% of cases. In one regional office, grant rates ranged from zero to 68%, with 60% of officers deviating from the office's average approval rates. The study analyzed disparities in asylum approval rates for PRC claimants across different regions and jurisdictions. Immigration judges and USCIS asylum officers showed significant variations in granting asylum, with some courts approving as low as 7% and others as high as 76% of cases. Disparities continued at higher levels of appeal, with the Fourth Circuit never remanding a PRC case while the Ninth Circuit remanded 37% of cases. The study \"Refugee Roulette: Disparities in Asylum Adjudication\" highlighted significant disparities in asylum approval rates for asylum seekers from different countries. Asylum seekers from certain countries faced grant rates that were more than 50% below or above the national average in some immigration courts. For example, Colombian asylum seekers had a grant rate of 63% in Orlando Immigration Court but only 19% in Atlanta Immigration Court, compared to the national average of 36%. The data for high-volume immigration courts showed these disparities. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) analyzed disparities in asylum decisions in high-volume immigration courts. GAO identified nine factors affecting outcomes, including nationality, representation, and experience of the immigration judge. Statistical analyses showed significant variations in asylum decisions. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) analyzed disparities in asylum decisions in high-volume immigration courts. GAO found significant variations in asylum decisions across immigration courts and judges. Affirmative applicants in San Francisco were 12 times more likely to be granted asylum compared to those in Atlanta. The grant rate for affirmative cases exceeded 50% for asylum seekers from certain countries but was lower than 10% for others. In defensive cases, about 50% of asylum seekers from Iran and Ethiopia were granted asylum. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found disparities in asylum decisions in high-volume immigration courts. While about 50% of asylum seekers from Iran and Ethiopia were granted asylum, only 13% or less of cases from El Salvador, Honduras, and Indonesia were successful. The lack of data on case specifics creates a perception of unfairness in the asylum adjudication process. Researchers at Syracuse University's TRAC have identified wide variations in asylum outcomes dependent on the immigration judge. Wide variations in asylum outcomes were found to be dependent on the immigration judge. Recent analysis by TRAC showed disparities in asylum approvals, with some judges denying asylum to nine out of ten applicants while others granted asylum to the same proportion. Judge-to-judge disparities in asylum decisions have moderated but remain substantial, with examples like one judge in New York denying only 6% of cases while another denied 70%. In the San Francisco immigration court, the range was from 32% to 92%. The disparities in immigration court decisions were evident, with wide variations in asylum approval rates depending on the judge and the asylum seeker's country of origin. Denial rates for PRC asylum seekers in New York ranged from 4% to 74%, while Iraq asylum seekers had the lowest denial rates at 0% to 4%. Salvadoran asylum seekers had the highest denial rates at 90% to 98%. Calls for reform in U.S. asylum law stem from the unexplained disparities in approval rates and the difficulty in distinguishing between the persecuted and persecutors in light of global violence. Some express concern that U.S. sympathies for asylum seekers in current political uprisings could facilitate entry of terrorists. Current law lacks protections for those fleeing human rights violations. Asylum policy from the Cold War may not be adapting to 21st-century priorities. Calls for additional safeguards to curb abuses and protect asylum seekers with valid claims. Some critics argue for additional safeguards to curb abuses and protect U.S. national interests in the asylum system. Others believe the U.S. should re-calibrate asylum policy to provide more protections for asylum seekers and set an example. Some proponents advocate for reforms in the asylum system to remove unnecessary barriers for genuine asylees and increase congressional oversight of immigration courts due to disparities in asylum decisions. They suggest increasing funding for immigration judges and law clerks to improve the quality of judicial hearings. Some recommendations to address disparities in asylum decisions include higher recruitment standards and more training for immigration judges, particularly in the culture of asylum seekers' homelands. It is also suggested to require written opinions in asylum cases and provide enhanced training and research support for USCIS asylum officers and immigration judges. Establishing communication mechanisms among asylum offices and considering cases in pairs or panels are proposed to improve consistency. The issue of disparities in asylum decisions has raised concerns about potential politicization with greater congressional oversight. Lack of access to case facts and evidence makes the rationale for decisions unknown. Asylum seekers in removal proceedings have limited access to legal counsel, with pro bono options available but at no expense to the Government. Access to counsel for asylum seekers during removal proceedings has become a significant issue in recent years. Many believe that providing legal counsel for asylum seekers is crucial due to disparities in outcomes. The GAO study showed that having legal representation increases the chances of obtaining asylum. Lack of counsel could lead to deportation to a dangerous country. The one-year rule for applying for asylum is seen as a way to prevent abuse of the system. Some argue that the one-year rule prevents asylum system abuses, citing a drop in applicants after the 1996 law revisions. They suggest a good cause exemption to the time rule. Opponents of mandatory detention in expedited removal reference the UNHCR's stance against detaining asylum seekers. Detention is seen as psychologically damaging to asylum seekers, who are often held with criminal aliens. Some argue for alternatives like electronic monitoring, while others believe mandatory detention is necessary for immigration control. Releasing asylum seekers in expedited removal is seen as undermining the system and creating opportunities for fraudulent claims. Mandatory detention of asylum seekers is crucial for immigration control and homeland security, deterring aliens from using asylum claims to enter illegally. Critics highlight potential national security risks from asylum seekers of \"special concern\" countries. They argue that national security concerns should outweigh humanitarian considerations in asylum cases. Some argue that national security risks should take precedence over humanitarian concerns in asylum cases, advocating for restricted asylum relief and limited judicial review. They believe that asylum seekers undergo thorough security screenings and that any security risks are more due to past intelligence limitations rather than asylum policies. Additionally, they suggest that asylees from \"special concern\" countries could provide valuable information for national security, akin to communist defectors during the Cold War. Opponents of limiting judicial review fear erosion of traditional U.S. values. The judicial review of asylum cases raises concerns about eroding traditional U.S. values of due process and freedom from repression. Some argue for amending the law to provide exceptions for individuals coerced into supporting terrorists. Despite admitting or adjusting about 1 million foreign nationals to legal permanent resident status annually, only 4% are granted asylee adjustments. The issue of whether the law should make exceptions for coerced support remains contentious. Asylum issues in U.S. immigration policy focus on policy qualities and procedural efficacy. Adjudication is based on facts, evidence, beliefs, and circumstances. Policy tensions involve balancing humanitarian values, prevention of fraudulent abuses, protection of persecuted individuals, security of borders, moral responsibilities internationally, and social priorities domestically. The U.S. Congress plays a key role in considering revisions to asylum law and policies."
