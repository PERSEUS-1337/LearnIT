    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act\". Congress finds that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation, affecting up to 12,000 infants annually in the US. It also notes the related condition of Fetal Alcohol Effect, with higher infant mortality rates for children of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. These issues are national concerns with particular impact on American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect have significant impacts on American Indian and Alaska Native communities, with high rates of alcohol dependency leading to increased chances of newborns suffering from these conditions. The financial costs to the nation are substantial, with estimated healthcare costs for one affected child reaching at least $1,400,000 over a lifetime. Researchers have found that alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect in babies. There is no safe amount or time to drink during pregnancy, and it is recommended that all women abstain from alcohol to prevent harm to the baby. The purpose of abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy is to prevent harm to the baby. The Act aims to establish a program under the Department of Health and Human Services to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and provide intervention services. This includes coordinating public awareness programs, conducting research on prevention and intervention, and developing effective interventions for affected individuals. The program aims to provide interventions and support services for individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect, including advocacy, training, therapies, counseling, and medical services. It also promotes coordination among Federal, State, and local agencies, research institutions, and communities to address the needs of affected populations. The establishment of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention and Services Program under Title III of the Public Health Service Act includes interventions, support services, advocacy, training, therapies, counseling, and medical services for individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect. Coordination among Federal, State, and local agencies, research institutions, and communities is promoted to address the needs of affected populations. The Secretary will establish a comprehensive program for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention, intervention, and services delivery. This includes education and public awareness programs targeting various service providers and school-age children. The program for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome includes educating school-age children, raising public awareness, and coordinating services across community agencies. Additionally, there is a prevention and diagnosis program to support clinical studies and research. The program aims to develop medical diagnostic methods for identifying Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect, as well as effective prevention services for pregnant, alcohol-dependent women. It also includes an applied research program focusing on intervention and prevention for individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect and their families. The Secretary may award grants and provide technical assistance to eligible entities for carrying out diagnostic criteria dissemination for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect. Additionally, a National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect will be established. The National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect, chaired by an individual appointed by the Secretary, will coordinate research, programs, and surveillance efforts among governmental agencies, academic bodies, and community groups. The Task Force will include the Chairperson of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect, chaired by an individual appointed by the Secretary, will coordinate research, programs, and surveillance efforts among governmental agencies, academic bodies, and community groups. The Task Force includes representatives from research and advocacy organizations, academic community, and government agencies. Its functions include advising programs and research on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effect, education, public awareness, medical diagnosis, and interventions for at-risk women. The National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect will coordinate efforts for interventions and services for individuals and families affected. Members will be appointed within 6 months of enactment, and the Task Force will report biennially to Congress on its activities. The eligibility criteria for receiving a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract under this part include being a State, Indian tribal government, local government, scientific or academic institution, or nonprofit organization. The entity must submit an application with details of the intended activities. Authorization of appropriations is also discussed. Authorization of appropriations is set at $27,000,000 annually from 1999 to 2003 for this part. A maximum of $2,000,000 can be used for the National Task Force operations. The part will no longer apply after 7 years from the appointment of all task force members."
