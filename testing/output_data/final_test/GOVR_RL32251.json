    "content": "The \"state sponsors of terrorism list\" is mandated under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, with Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria currently listed. Countries on the list face restrictions on trade benefits, foreign aid, and support in international financial institutions. Validated licenses are required for exports to these countries, except for certain allowed items like informational materials, humanitarian assistance, and food and medicine. Being listed as a sponsor of international terrorism restricts bilateral assistance in foreign aid appropriations acts and makes a country ineligible for trade benefits like the Generalized System of Preferences. Assistance authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act is also prohibited to governments that have supported acts of terrorism. The Arms Export Control Act prohibits the export of munitions to countries that have provided support for terrorism. Cuba remains on the terrorism list, limiting trade and aid despite potential lifting of some U.S. sanctions. Sanctions under the Trading with the Enemy Act and Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 still apply, along with restrictions on defense exports under the Arms Export Control Act. The President can remove a country from the terrorism list by certifying to Congress that there has been a fundamental change in leadership and policies, the government is not supporting terrorism, and has provided assurances not to support terrorism in the future. Alternatively, the President can submit a report to Congress at least 45 days before the proposed removal will take effect. The President can remove a country from the terrorism list by certifying to Congress that there has been a fundamental change in leadership and policies, the government is not supporting terrorism, and has provided assurances not to support terrorism in the future. Three countries have been removed from the terrorism list over the years: South Yemen in 1990, Iraq in 1982 and 2004, and Libya in 2006. Congress could potentially pass legislation to block the President's removal of a country from the terrorism list. The Arms Export Control Act outlines a procedure for Congress to block the President's removal of a country from the terrorism list. Presidential waivers can be granted for national security or humanitarian reasons. Cuba was added to the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1982. The Commerce Department added Cuba to the list of countries sponsoring international terrorism in 1982 without providing an explanation. This addition was not considered significant due to existing economic sanctions on Cuba. The U.S. government under the Reagan Administration in 1981 and 1982 accused Cuba of ties to international terrorism, citing support for armed revolution and guerrilla groups. President Reagan highlighted this in his State of the Union address in January 1982. In 1982, the Department of State published a research paper detailing Cuba's support for terrorism and armed insurgencies in Latin America and the Caribbean, aiming to weaken government legitimacy and attract new supporters to armed struggle. Cuba was most active in Central America, particularly Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Cuba supported terrorist activities in Central and South America by providing advice, training, and financial support to various violent organizations, including Colombian M-19 guerrillas. The State Department's report in 1982 highlighted Cuba and the Soviet Union's involvement in promoting armed revolution and terrorism in the region. The United States added Cuba to the terrorist list in 1982 due to its support for the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia, providing arms and safe haven. The State Department added Cuba to the terrorist list in 1982 for supporting terrorist groups in Latin America, including FALN, FMLN, and FSLN. Cuba helped transship Soviet arms to Nicaragua and El Salvador for terrorist use, trained anti-American insurgents in Latin America, and supported insurgencies in Angola and Ethiopia. Cuba continues to oppose the U.S.-led war on terror and criticizes U.S. policies. The State Department report highlighted Cuba's close relationships with state sponsors of terrorism like Iran and North Korea, providing safe haven for members of various terrorist organizations. Cuba also shelters Basque ETA members from Spain and Colombian insurgent groups FARC and ELN. Colombia acknowledged and supported Cuba's mediation efforts with these groups. The 2005 report stated that Cuba allows U.S. fugitives to live legally in Cuba but will no longer provide safe haven to new fugitives. The U.S. government has requested Cuba to return wanted fugitives, but Cuba remains non-responsive. Many fugitives accused of violent crimes in the U.S., including Joanne Chesimard, entered Cuba in the 1970s. Cuba also demanded the return of five agents convicted of espionage in the U.S. In 2005, Cuba demanded the return of five agents convicted of espionage in the United States, known as the \"Cuban Five.\" They also requested the surrender of Luis Posada Carriles, accused of plotting to assassinate Fidel Castro and bombing a Cubana Airlines plane in 1976. Posada was arrested in the U.S. for illegal entry and remains in a federal immigration facility in Texas. Cuba had allowed U.S. fugitives to live there legally but no longer provides safe haven to new fugitives. In November 2000, Luis Posada Carriles was imprisoned in Panama for weapons charges related to a plot to kill Fidel Castro. He was later pardoned by the Panamanian President in August 2004. The 2005 terrorism report mentioned controversial allegations of Cuba's involvement in developing biological weapons, with some dispute about the extent of their program. In May 2002, Under Secretary of State John Bolton accused Cuba of having a limited offensive biological warfare research effort and providing dual-use technology to rogue states. Secretary of State Powell later clarified that while Cuba has the capacity for biological weapons research, the US did not claim they possessed such weapons. This statement contradicted Bolton's earlier claims. In June 2003, an employee of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research disputed Under Secretary Bolton's claims about Cuba and biological weapons. In March 2004, Bolton testified before Congress that Cuba posed a terrorist and biological weapons threat to the US, but acknowledged that intelligence on Cuba's BW program was unreliable. The Bush Administration concluded that Cuba may not have an active biological weapons program, but there is disagreement over whether Cuba has had one in the past. Supporters of keeping Cuba on the terrorism list point to the government's history of supporting terrorism in Latin America and Africa. Critics argue that Cuba's presence on the terrorism list is a Cold War relic driven by domestic politics, diverting attention from real threats. Supporters cite anti-American statements by Fidel Castro as justification for keeping Cuba on the list. Nations criticize the U.S. response to the attacks as \"fascist and terrorist,\" with Castro calling the government run by \"extremists\" and \"hawks.\" Cuba's offers of support to the U.S. after the 2001 attacks are seen as gratuitous by critics questioning its retention on the terrorism list. Some question the rationale for keeping Cuba on the terrorism list, citing Cuba's history of supporting revolutionary movements. Observers note Cuba's long-time hostility towards the US and its past involvement in supporting terrorist groups. Cuba has made offers to the US for a bilateral agreement to fight terrorism, but has not received a response. Some observers believe Cuba has moved away from supporting terrorist groups, citing agreements with home countries of terrorists residing in Cuba. However, others claim that ETA members sought by Spanish authorities for killings found refuge in Cuba after a 1984 agreement. Spain requested the extradition of an ETA suspect from Cuba in 2003. The State Department publicly requested Cuba to deny ETA members sanctuary in 2003. Colombia acquiesced to the presence of Colombian guerrillas in Cuba, and Cuba has been involved in hosting peace talks with the ELN. Some observers believe Cuba supported FARC's terrorist activities, citing the arrest of IRA operatives in Colombia in 2001. Niall Connolly, Sinn Fein's representative in Havana since 1996, along with two others, went into hiding in 2004 after being acquitted of training FARC in bombing techniques. They were later convicted in absentia and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Connolly denies being an IRA member and claims he was in Colombia to observe conflict resolution. They returned to Ireland in 2005 after the IRA ended its armed campaign. Supporters of keeping Cuba on the terrorist list point to over 70 fugitives from U.S. justice residing in Cuba. Hill and Michael Finney, wanted for killing a state trooper in New Mexico in 1971; Victor Manuel Gerena, member of a Puerto Rican separatist group, wanted for robbing a Wells Fargo armored car in Connecticut in 1983; and Guillermo Morales, convicted of illegal possession of firearms in New York in the 1970s. Critics argue that Cuba should not be on the terrorist list as it has expressed interest in negotiating the extradition of fugitives. They point out that other countries harbor U.S. fugitives without being labeled as terrorists. Cuba has been involved in harboring fugitives from justice, including those wanted for terrorist activities. Despite expressing interest in negotiating the extradition of fugitives, Cuba remains on the list of state sponsors of terrorism along with Iran, Syria, Sudan, and North Korea. Iran is considered the most active sponsor of terrorism, while countries like Sudan and Cuba are believed to be less active supporters. Critics argue that Cuba should not be on the terrorist list, pointing out that other countries also harbor U.S. fugitives without being labeled as terrorists. Some suggest a tiered approach to sanctions based on support for terrorism, while others believe any support should be met with strong sanctions. There are differing opinions on the flexibility of adding or removing countries from the terrorism list to induce behavioral changes."
