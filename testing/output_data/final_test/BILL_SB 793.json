    "title": "SB 793",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The commission mandates a green tariff shared renewables program for participating utilities, limited to renewable energy resources under 20 megawatts capacity, except for facilities in disadvantaged communities which are capped at one megawatt. The participating utility must use commission-approved tools to procure additional eligible renewable energy resources for the green tariff shared renewables program, beyond what is required by the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program. Commission-approved tools refer to procurement methods approved by the commission for meeting the program's requirements. A participating utility must allow customers to purchase electricity through a green tariff shared renewables program until the utility reaches its share of a statewide limit of 600 megawatts. The limit is based on each utility's retail sales ratio, and the commission may impose additional restrictions on purchases, such as annual capacity limits. One hundred megawatts reserved for small facilities in disadvantaged communities identified by California EPA. Areas must be most impacted 20 percent based on cumulative impact screening. Not less than 100 megawatts reserved for residential customers. The green tariff shared renewables program reserves 100 megawatts for residential customers and 20 megawatts for the City of Davis. It aims to procure renewable energy resources near participants and supports diverse procurement. Customers are limited to subscribing to 100 percent of their electricity demand. The green tariff shared renewables program limits customers to two megawatts of generating capacity, except for certain entities. No single entity can subscribe to more than 20 percent of the total capacity in a calendar year. Utilities must actively market the program to low-income and minority communities. Participating customers receive bill credits based on the class average retail generation cost for using eligible renewable energy resources. The renewables adjustment value accounts for differences in time-of-delivery profiles and resource adequacy in the utility's green tariff shared renewables program. Time-of-delivery profile refers to the daily generating pattern of renewable energy resources. The value of a participating eligible renewable energy resource is determined by comparing its generating pattern to the demand for electricity and other available generating resources. Participating customers in a green tariff shared renewables program pay a renewable generation rate set by the commission, along with administrative costs and other just charges to cover resource procurement. Rates are adjusted for commission-approved costs or values related to renewable energy resources. All other applicable charges remain unchanged for participating customers. Participating customers in a green tariff shared renewables program pay renewable generation rates set by the commission, along with administrative costs. Utilities provide support for community renewables programs. The commission ensures charges and credits are set to prevent cost shifting to nonparticipating ratepayers. A participating utility must track all revenues and costs for their green tariff shared renewables program to ensure transparency and cost recovery. Renewable energy credits associated with the program must be retired on behalf of participating customers and cannot be sold or transferred. Unused credits count towards the utility's renewables portfolio standard. The participating utility must apply excess generation from the green tariff shared renewables program to meet renewable portfolio standard obligations or bank it for future use as per commission rules. In meeting the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requirements, a participating utility can exclude kilowatthours generated by eligible renewable energy resources credited to participating customers in the green tariff shared renewables program. These resources must comply with the State Air Resources Board's Voluntary Renewable Electricity Program, with associated greenhouse gas allowances being retired on behalf of customers. A participating utility must provide a municipality with aggregated consumption data for participating customers to track progress towards climate goals. The utility must also publicly disclose consumption data and emissions reductions achieved by customers in the green tariff shared renewables program. This does not restrict community choice aggregators from offering their own renewable energy programs. The act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as defined by the California Constitution."
