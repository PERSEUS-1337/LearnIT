    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Spending Reductions through Innovations in Therapies Agenda Act of 2012\" or the \"SPRINT Act\". Congress finds that a significant portion of healthcare expenses in the United States is allocated to treating a small percentage of the population with costly health conditions that are leading causes of death. Developing innovative treatments to improve health outcomes and find cures can enhance public health, reduce government spending, and increase productivity. Additionally, a large number of Americans, especially older individuals, have multiple chronic conditions, with treatment for these conditions consuming a substantial portion of the healthcare budget. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias have a significant health and economic impact on patients, especially those with multiple chronic conditions. In 2004, Medicare and Medicaid payments for beneficiaries aged 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were significantly higher compared to average payments for other beneficiaries in the same age group. Alzheimer's patients often require full-time care at home or in institutions. Medicare and Medicaid cover 70% of costs for Alzheimer's care, with Medicare expected to spend $93 billion in 2011 and $627 billion in 2050. Medicaid costs are projected to increase from $34 billion in 2011 to $178 billion in 2050. Researchers advocate for increased investment in research for better health treatments. The US government has successfully tackled research challenges in the past by committing resources to high-risk, high-reward research. The US government has successfully tackled research challenges in the past by committing resources to high-risk and high-reward basic and applied research. The US government has established the SPRINT Program under the Public Health Service Act to address research challenges through high-risk and high-reward basic and applied research. The SPRINT Program, established under the Public Health Service Act, focuses on advanced research and development of novel therapies, biological products, devices, drugs, and early-stage companies. Definitions for terms like advanced research and development, biological product, device, drug, and early-stage company are provided in this section. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as Federal health care program, growth company, high-cost chronic condition, and therapy as identified by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish the SPRINT Program to develop therapies for high-cost chronic conditions, selected from the top 10 leading causes of death with the highest costs to Federal health care programs. The SPRINT Program aims to address high-cost chronic conditions that impact daily functioning, increase mortality rates, and lack effective therapies. Funding allocation is based on the severity of the conditions, guided by national plans. The SPRINT Program aims to accelerate research for high-cost chronic conditions and promote innovation in therapy development. The Secretary's duties include convening meetings with various stakeholders and ensuring coordination among relevant agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services will partner with a nonprofit entity to advise on investments in research for therapies targeting high-cost chronic conditions. They aim to reduce spending under the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 10 years. Additionally, the Department will award contracts and grants for this purpose. The Department of Health and Human Services will partner with a nonprofit entity to accelerate research and development of therapies for high-cost chronic conditions. This includes reducing barriers between laboratory discoveries and clinical trials, as well as facilitating expedited FDA review of these therapies. The SPRINT Award Program aims to accelerate the development and approval of therapies for high-cost chronic conditions by coordinating activities with the FDA and developing efficient regulatory pathways. The SPRINT Award Program, in partnership with a nonprofit entity, awards contracts, grants, and other transactions to support advanced research and therapy development for high-cost chronic conditions. Eligible entities include public, nonprofit, early stage, or growth companies, research institutions, medical centers, and biotechnology companies. The SPRINT Award Program supports advanced research and therapy development for high-cost chronic conditions. Eligible entities include public, nonprofit, early stage, or growth companies, research institutions, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and academic research institutions. Entities seeking an award must submit an application to the Secretary with a detailed project description, timetable, and assurance of project completion. The SPRINT Award Program supports research for chronic conditions. Awardees must submit reports on project progress and outcomes. Awardees must submit reports to the Secretary, including interim reports on project progress and a final report at the conclusion of the award period detailing project outcomes and compliance with research standards. The Secretary may modify or terminate funding for awardees who do not meet project milestones. Consultation with nonprofit strategic investment entities is allowed for award decisions. The Secretary may award funding to entities consisting of experts in various fields who promote therapy development and novel technologies. Recipients must provide matching funds for the project. The Secretary may award funding to entities for projects, requiring a match of not less than $2 for each $1 of Federal funds provided. The matching requirement can be waived on a case-by-case basis if necessary for the SPRINT Award Program goals. The Secretary may accept money gifts for the SPRINT Award Program. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2013, with additional funding for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will evaluate projects funded under section 230 of the Public Health Service Act and share the results widely. Reports to Congress will detail supported projects, progress, and recommendations for improvement. The SPRINT Program under section 230 aims to reduce Federal spending on high-cost chronic conditions by supporting advanced research and development."
