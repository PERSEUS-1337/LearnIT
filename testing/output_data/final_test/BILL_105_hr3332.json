    "content": "The Act titled \"Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Next Generation Internet Research Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of US leadership in science and technology for national prosperity, security, and competitiveness. Federal investment in research has led to the creation of new industries and jobs, with the Internet playing a crucial role in government transparency. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 emphasizes the need for a national research and education computer network to provide access to resources for researchers and educators, facilitate research and development for computer networks, and support ongoing network technology improvement through research. Inter-agency cooperation is crucial to prevent duplication in Federal networking research programs. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 emphasizes the need for national research and education computer networks to support research and development, improve network technology, and facilitate access to resources. Additional research is needed for new applications that can drive economic growth, enhance healthcare, and expand educational opportunities. Research in new networking technologies can alleviate economic challenges faced by rural Internet users, while information security is a critical aspect of computing and communications systems.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 aims to authorize research programs related to high-end computing, human-centered systems, high confidence systems, and education. It also focuses on developing a comprehensive research program to create a network infrastructure that supports greater speed, robustness, and flexibility, promoting connectivity and interoperability among advanced computer technologies. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 aims to promote connectivity and interoperability among advanced computer networks of Federal agencies and departments, focusing on research in technology for high-speed data access that is economically viable and flexible. The Act encourages researchers to pursue networking technology solutions that are maximally flexible and extensible.

The Act encourages researchers to pursue networking technology solutions that are maximally flexible and extensible. The Act also includes provisions for promoting the rapid development and wider distribution of networking management and development tools, as well as the rapid adoption of open network standards. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 focuses on advancing Internet technologies and creating high-performance testbed networks for research and development. It also includes provisions for an advisory committee and the Next Generation Internet. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 focuses on advancing Internet technologies and creating high-performance testbed networks for research and development. It includes provisions for an advisory committee and the Next Generation Internet, as outlined in Section 103. The National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, NASA, and National Institute of Standards and Technology may support the Next Generation Internet program. Objectives include research, development, and demonstration of advanced networking technologies, creating a testbed network for research sites, and developing advanced Internet applications for national goals or agency missions. The President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, established by Executive Order, assesses the Next Generation Internet program's alignment with national goals and addresses concerns such as geographic penalties and internet access for minority-serving institutions. The President's Information Technology Advisory Committee evaluates the Next Generation Internet program's alignment with national goals, including technology transfer, federal agency roles, research support, and recommendations for improvement. The Advisory Committee will review the Next Generation Internet program implementation and submit annual reports to specific Senate and House committees. Funding authorization for the Department of Energy is set at $22,000,000 for fiscal year. Funding allocations for various government agencies include $22,000,000 for the Department of Energy, $25,000,000 for the National Science Foundation, $5,000,000 for the National Institutes of Health, $10,000,000 for NASA, and $5,000,000 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. These funds are not to be used for routine upgrades to existing federally funded communication networks. SEC. 6. STUDY OF EFFECTS ON TRADEMARK RIGHTS OF ADDING GENERIC TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS. The Secretary of Commerce shall request the National Research Council to conduct a study on the effects of adding new generic top-level domains on trademark rights and related dispute resolution procedures. The study will assess the impact on trademark rights protection, consumer interests, and trademark rights clearance processes for domain names. The study will assess the impact of adding new generic top-level domains on trademark rights and dispute resolution mechanisms, including the accessibility of domain name databases for trademark clearance and the requirement for domain registrants to provide certain information. It will also focus on reducing trademark conflicts with new domains and through technical approaches to Internet addressing. The study will evaluate trademark rights disputes related to domain names, infringement liability for registrars, registries, and technical bodies, technical options for Internet addressing schemes, and public feedback on reports issued by intergovernmental bodies. The Secretary of Commerce will coordinate interagency cooperation for this study. The Department of Commerce and private corporations are requested to cooperate with the National Research Council in conducting a study on trademark rights disputes related to domain names and Internet addressing schemes. The National Research Council will submit an interim report after a period of public comment. The National Research Council will submit an interim report on a study to the Secretary of Commerce, followed by a final report within 9 months. The final report will include findings, conclusions, and recommendations on the effects of new generic top-level domains on trademark rights. The Secretary of Commerce will submit an interim report to relevant Senate and House committees, followed by a final report within 7 days. $800,000 is authorized for the study conducted under this section. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines \"geographic penalty\" as the higher costs imposed on Internet users in rural areas due to distance from network facilities or low population density. It also defines \"Internet\" as the international computer network. Additionally, it amends a section of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. The curr_chunk adds a new definition of \"Internet\" as the international computer network of both Federal and non-Federal interoperable packet switched data networks. The curr_chunk mentions the roles of Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice President of the United States."
