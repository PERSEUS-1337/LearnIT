    "content": "This report provides Congress with official data on transfers of conventional arms to developing nations by major suppliers from 2008 to 2015. It aims to help Congress identify existing supplier-purchaser relationships in weapons acquisitions and assess how the international weapons trade may impact U.S. national interests. Maintaining regional stability and ensuring the security of U.S. allies have been key elements of U.S. foreign policy. This report focuses on arms transfers by major weapons suppliers to developing nations from 2008 to 2015, providing Congress with data to evaluate policy decisions related to U.S. arms sales and foreign policy initiatives. The report highlights the potential for regional military conflicts in the developing world, where the majority of conventional arms trade occurs. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union provided conventional weapons to friendly states as part of their foreign policy. After the Cold War, U.S. arms transfer policy focused on enhancing the capabilities of allied nations to address regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers have changed post-Cold War and post-Persian Gulf War, with relationships between suppliers and recipients evolving in response to political, military, and economic changes. During the period of 2008-2015, arms sales by foreign suppliers have shifted towards economic motivations rather than foreign policy objectives. Developing nations remain the primary focus of arms sales, accounting for a significant majority of international agreements. In 2015, 81.7% of arms transfer agreements globally were with developing countries. During 2012-2015, arms deliveries to developing nations made up 67.89% of global international arms deliveries, and in 2015, they accounted for 72.69% of the total value. The data in this report supersedes previous editions and should be used for comparison due to significant updates and revisions. The values are in U.S. dollars, adjusted for inflation, excluding U.S. commercial arms exports and transfers to subnational groups. The report provides data on arms transfer agreements worldwide in 2015, with the United States leading at $40.2 billion and France ranking second at $15.3 billion. Developing nations accounted for 72.69% of the total value of arms deliveries in 2015. In 2015, the United States and France collectively made agreements valued at over $55.4 billion, accounting for 69.4% of all international arms transfer agreements. The total value of international arms transfer agreements from 2012-2015 was $317 billion, higher than the value from 2008-2011. Developing world nations accounted for 80.92% of all arms transfer agreements globally during 2012-2015. In 2015, the United States led in global arms deliveries, making $16.9 billion or 36.62% of all deliveries. Russia ranked second with $7.2 billion, and France ranked third with $7.0 billion. These top three suppliers collectively delivered $31.3 billion, accounting for 67.77% of all arms delivered worldwide. The total value of international arms deliveries in 2015 was nearly $46.2 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The total value of arms deliveries from 2012-2015 was about $199 billion, higher than the value from 2008-2011. In 2015, global arms deliveries totaled $46.2 billion, with the United States leading at $16.9 billion. Developing nations received 72.7% of international arms deliveries in 2015, up from 57.7% in 2008-2011. Worldwide weapons orders decreased to $79.8 billion in 2015, with the U.S. increasing its market share to 50.3%. In 2015, global arms agreements saw increases for major suppliers like France, while Russia experienced a slight decline. The collective market share of West European suppliers was around 22% in 2015. The U.S. had a significant outlier figure in 2011 with large sales to Saudi Arabia. Constraints on growth in the international arms market persist due to the weakened global economy. The global arms market has been constrained by the weakened state of the global economy, with the Eurozone financial crisis and slow international recovery limiting defense purchases. Many nations are deferring or limiting new weapon system purchases, opting instead for upgrades and support services. Despite reduced demand for major weapon systems, sales of upgrades and support services remain lucrative for weapons suppliers. Increased competition among sellers has made new arms sales more challenging to conclude. Competition among arms suppliers has intensified due to economic factors, leading to a focus on new clients and flexible financing options to overcome limited defense budgets in developing nations. European nations or consortia are competing for arms sales in a stagnating market. Competition for arms sales is intense between European nations/consortia and the United States, especially with more affluent developing nations. Recent examples include contests for combat aircraft sales to the Persian Gulf states and India. Wealthy developing nations in the Near East and Asia demand cost offsets, advanced technology transfer, and domestic production options in arms contracts. European weapons suppliers rely on foreign arms sales to support domestic weapons development programs. Some nations rely on arms contracts to support domestic weapons development programs and compensate for declining arms orders. Developed nations limit arms purchases from each other, leading to joint production of weapon systems to share costs. Certain suppliers focus on niche weapons categories where they have specialized production capabilities. Competition for contracts has led to consolidation in domestic defense industries. The consolidation of defense industries in key weapons-producing nations has enhanced competitiveness. Developing nations with financial assets continue to launch costly weapons-procurement programs, while oil-producing states benefit from oil sales to fund arms purchases. Some oil-consuming states face difficulties due to oil import dependency, leading to curtailed weapons acquisitions. The impact of significant oil declines since 2014 on global arms purchases is not covered in this report. Despite economic volatility, some nations continue to invest in arms procurement. Despite economic volatility, some developing nations in the Near East, Asia, Latin America, and Africa have resumed or continued large weapons purchases. Key factors influencing these decisions include the strength of their economies and the goal to modernize their military forces. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and India are among the countries making significant arms orders. Many developing nations in regions like Near East, Asia, Latin America, and Africa face financial constraints in purchasing weapons, leading to selective military acquisitions. Arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaled $65.2 billion in 2015, a decrease from $79.3 billion in 2014. Arms deliveries to developing nations also decreased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014. France ranked second in arms sales in 2015, following the United States and Russia. From 2012 to 2015, the United States and Russia dominated the arms market in the developing world, collectively making over half of all arms transfer agreements. The United States made $85.6 billion, while Russia made $48.6 billion during this period. France ranked second in arms sales in 2015, with nearly $27.7 billion in agreements with developing nations. During the period 2008-2015, the United States was the top supplier of arms to developing nations, making $111.1 billion in agreements, followed by Russia. Russia ranked first in 2009 and second in subsequent years, with significant agreements with India and clients in the Near East. France made $21.5 billion in agreements during this period. Russia has increased arms sales efforts in Latin America, focusing on Venezuela. They offer flexible payment arrangements, including forgiving debts to secure new purchases. Russia also improves follow-on support services to make their weaponry more competitive. France and the United Kingdom have been successful in securing orders from developing countries from 2008 to 2015. The United States has been a principal supplier of arms to developing nations since the Cold War, with a diverse client base and ongoing arms agreements. Germany and the United Kingdom have also seen success in selling naval and aircraft systems to developing countries. Despite competition from other major arms suppliers, the United States is likely to maintain its position due to its ability to provide upgrades, spare parts, and support services for a wide range of weapon systems. The United States remains a key supplier of arms to developing nations, with a diverse client base and ongoing arms agreements. Major arms-supplying nations focus on wealthier developing countries due to budget constraints in less-affluent nations. Arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased from 2008 to 2011, reaching a peak of about $78 billion in 2011. In 2011, arms sales to affluent developing nations, particularly in the Persian Gulf, drove the increase in arms transfer agreements. Non-major arms suppliers like China have also secured some deals with developing nations, albeit at lower levels. Significant arms deals include Canada selling armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia in 2014 and Sweden selling Erieye airborne systems to the U.A.E. in 2015. In 2015, Sweden sold two new Erieye airborne surveillance systems to the U.A.E. for $1.27 billion. These arms suppliers typically sell older or less-advanced equipment and are more focused on small arms and light weapons. They do not rank high in the value of their arms agreements, but some may rank among the top 10 suppliers in certain years. In 2015, the total value of United States arms transfer agreements with developing nations decreased to $26.7 billion. Despite the decrease, the U.S. market share of all such agreements increased to 40.99%. Major new orders were made in the Near East and Asia, including agreements with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and South Korea. The U.S. also secured orders globally for equipment and support services contracts. The total arms agreement value for the United States in 2015 was approximately $40 billion. The U.S. maintained its advantage in defense support arrangements with global weapons purchasers in 2015, including sales of major weapon systems, upgrades, and support services. Arms agreements with developing nations included deals with Saudi Arabia for munitions and Patriot PAC-3 missiles worth over $7 billion, and purchases from Qatar totaling $9.9 billion. In 2015, Qatar accepted major arms contracts worth $9.56 billion, including Patriot missiles, Javelin missiles, and Apache helicopters. South Korea's orders totaled nearly $5 billion, while Russia's arms transfer agreements with developing nations reached $11 billion, increasing from $10.2 billion in 2014. Russia's share of all developing world arms transfer agreements also rose from 12.9% in 2014 to 16.9% in 2015. During 2012-2015, Russia was the second-largest arms supplier to developing nations, with agreements totaling nearly $49 billion. Russia's success in this market can be attributed to overcoming industrial production challenges post the Soviet Union's dissolution. Former Soviet Union's major arms clients were less wealthy developing countries, receiving military aid grants and discounts. Russia adapted its selling practices in the post-Cold War era to compete with Western suppliers in new markets. Russia adapted its selling practices in the developing world to regain and sustain an important share in the international arms market. Efforts include providing creative financing, engaging in counter-trade, offsets, and licensed production agreements with key clients like India and China. Successful arms sales have been made in Southeast Asia with agreements signed with Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. Russia has signed arms agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia, as well as major deals with Venezuela and Algeria. Russian military equipment remains competitive in the developing world, with a range from basic to advanced. However, the lack of funding for new research and development has hindered Russia's long-term arms sales prospects. Other major arms suppliers have advanced more rapidly in developing weaponry, potentially limiting the expansion of Russia's arms client base. Russia's arms sales have been impacted by the lack of funding for research and development, which has hindered its long-term prospects. Despite important arms development and sales programs with India and China, Russia has lost major contracts to other key weapons suppliers, threatening its relationship with India. Russia's arms sales in South Asia have raised concerns for the United States due to tensions between Pakistan and India. The US aims to strengthen military cooperation with India as part of its strategic shift to the Asia-Pacific region. China has been a key client for Russian arms, purchasing advanced aircraft and naval systems since 1996. These acquisitions are seen as enhancing China's military capabilities in Asia. The U.S. aims to provide military equipment to allies in Asia to counter potential threats from China. China has been integrating Russian weapon systems into its military, causing tension between Russia and China. In 2015, Russia renewed arms agreements with developing nations, including delivering S-300 air defense systems to Iran and agreeing to supply Ka-226 helicopters to India. In 2010, India agreed to procure 200 Ka-226 helicopters and Algeria to purchase 14 Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter jets from Russia. China became the first foreign buyer of 24 Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets in 2015. Russia signed an agreement with Pakistan for four MI-35 attack helicopters after lifting its arms embargo in 2014. China emerged as an important arms supplier during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, providing weaponry to both belligerents without conditions. China's arms sales have been more regional and targeted in the developing world, with agreements totaling over $4 billion annually from 2012 to 2015. The highest value was in 2015 at $6 billion. Most of China's sales are smaller valued weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East, with continuing contracts with Pakistan. Few developing nations with significant financial resources have purchased Chinese military equipment during this period. China's arms sales have focused on smaller valued weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East. China is not a key supplier of major conventional weapons in the developing world arms market, but has increased promotion of its more advanced aircraft for foreign arms sales. China's likely client base will be states in Asia and Africa seeking small arms and light weapons. China has also been a source of missiles to some developing countries. China has been a significant source of missiles for some developing countries, such as supplying battlefield and cruise missiles to Iran and surface-to-surface missiles to Pakistan. While the Chinese government no longer provides complete missile systems to other countries, Chinese entities still supply missile-related technology. This raises concerns about China's adherence to restrictions on missile transfers under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and how its interpretation differs from other member states. China's military products, particularly missiles, are desired by some developing countries, posing challenges to efforts to prevent the proliferation of advanced missile systems in certain regions. China is a major source of small arms and light weapons transferred to African states, aiming to enhance its international political power and access to natural resources. Concerns have been raised by the United States and the United Nations regarding the control of arms sales to conflict regions, leading to efforts to establish an Arms Trade Treaty in July 2012. The United Nations adopted an Arms Trade Treaty as a resolution on April 2, 2013, with China and Russia abstaining. The treaty came into force on December 24, 2014, with 78 states ratifying it, including the United States. President Obama submitted the treaty to the Senate for approval on December 9, 2016. France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy are major arms suppliers in Western Europe. The United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy are major arms suppliers in Western Europe, providing sophisticated weapons to various nations. They serve as alternative sources for countries not supplied by the United States for policy reasons. Recent sales include combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia and India's selection of European aircraft over U.S. and Russian options. France also secured a major frigate deal with Egypt. Saudi Arabia purchased Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft from the UK. During the post-Cold War period, European allies like France have pursued their own national defense export policies, prioritizing economic considerations over foreign policy alignment with the United States. France often uses foreign military sales to support the development of its own weapon systems. Policy differences between the U.S. and major European arms suppliers have increased due to diverging views on appropriate arms sales. The conflict arose in 2004-2005 when France and Germany tried to lift the arms embargo on China, opposed by the United States. Although the embargo was not lifted, tensions between the U.S. and some EU members persisted. The arms sales activities of major European suppliers are closely monitored by U.S. policymakers due to their potential to sell advanced military equipment to countries of concern. France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy collectively increased their share of arms transfer agreements with developing countries. In 2015, major West European suppliers, including France, increased their collective share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations significantly. France led with $15.2 billion in agreements, while Italy had $1 billion. The total value of agreements in 2015 was $17.6 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2014. France also had notable years in 2009 and 2015, with $9.3 billion and $15.2 billion in agreements, respectively. In 2015, major West European suppliers, including France, increased their collective share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations significantly. France led with $15.2 billion in agreements, while Italy had $1 billion. The total value of agreements in 2015 was $17.6 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2014. The United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy also had significant arms agreements in previous years. The major West European suppliers have enhanced their competitive position in weapons exports through strong government marketing support for their foreign arms sales. In 2015, major West European suppliers, led by France, secured significant arms transfer contracts with developing nations. France's record-setting exports included a $7.1 billion contract with Qatar for Rafale fighter jets and missiles, and a $6 billion contract with Egypt for Rafale jets and a naval frigate. The strong demand for U.S. defense equipment has made it challenging for individual West European suppliers to secure new contracts with developing nations. The European Union member states adopted a new code of conduct for defense procurement practices on November 21, 2005, at the European Defense Agency's steering board meeting. The code aims to promote greater cooperation within the European defense equipment sector in awarding contracts for defense items. The EU hopes to make the code mandatory to enhance intra-European cooperation in defense program planning and collaboration in defense contracting, preserving the defense industrial bases of individual EU states. This will improve the capability of European defense firms to compete for arms sales globally. European weapons suppliers are engaging in joint production ventures to sustain their defense industrial bases. Some are collaborating with US in projects like the Joint Strike Fighter. The main markets for arms are in the Near East and Asia, with Latin American and African nations being minor purchasers. American and African nations are not major purchasers of weapons, as shown in regional arms agreement data tables. The United States focuses on maintaining stability in developing regions by supporting arms sales that align with this goal. Other arms suppliers may prioritize financial gain over stability concerns. The regional and country-specific arms transfer data in the report reveal where arms suppliers are focusing their attention and who their main clients are. The Persian Gulf crisis of August 1990-February 1991 led to major arms acquisitions in the Near East, establishing the United States as a key security guarantor for Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. This crisis prompted significant weapons purchases in the region over the last twenty-five years. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, have been increasing their purchases of advanced weapon systems due to concerns over the growing strategic threat from Iran. Egypt, Israel, and India have also been modernizing their military by acquiring advanced weaponry, primarily from the United States. Saudi Arabia has been the largest purchaser in recent years, with agreements totaling $52.5 billion from 2008-2011 and $41 billion from 2012-2015. The Near East region has been the largest arms market in the developing world, with significant arms transfer agreements totaling billions of dollars. The United States dominated arms transfer agreements with the Near East, while Russia was a distant second. In recent years, the United States has continued to lead in arms agreements with the region. In recent years, the United States has dominated arms agreements with Asia, totaling $54.6 billion in current dollars. Russia accounted for 17.87% of the region's agreements, amounting to $27.9 billion in current dollars. Asia is the second largest region in the developing world for orders of conventional weaponry, with several developing nations upgrading their defense forces. Russia has been a key supplier of advanced conventional weaponry to China and India. Russia has emerged as the main arms supplier to India and China in Asia, contributing to the region's increasing share of the arms market in the developing world. India has diversified its weapons suppliers by purchasing defense systems from Israel, submarines from France, cargo aircraft from the United States, jet trainers from the United Kingdom, and helicopters from Italy. France also secured a contract to upgrade India's Mirage-2000 combat aircraft in 2011. In 2011, France won a $2.4 billion contract to upgrade India's Mirage-2000 fighters, while the US sold India 10 C-17 Globemaster III aircraft for $4.1 billion. This signals increased competition for Russia in the Indian arms market. India also excluded Russia from a competition for new combat fighter aircraft, won by France. In 2015, Russia and India agreed on a deal for India to acquire 200 Ka-226T helicopters. Asia is the second-largest arms market in the developing world, with Asia accounting for 31.3% of arms transfer agreements from 2012-2015. In the period 2008-2015, the United States and Russia were the top arms suppliers to Asia, with the US leading in both periods. Saudi Arabia was the leading arms purchaser from developing nations, totaling $93.5 billion in agreements. India was the second largest developing world arms purchaser from 2008 to 2015, with agreements totaling $34 billion. Saudi Arabia ranked first in arms transfer agreements in both the 2008-2011 and 2012-2015 periods, with totals of $52.5 billion and $41 billion respectively. The total value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 2008 to 2015 was $468.4 billion. Weapons deliveries to developing nations are dominated by the United States, Russia, and major West European suppliers. Other European and non-European suppliers, including China, also play a significant role. Deliveries to the Near East region from 2012-2015 included tanks, combat aircraft, artillery, missiles, and armored vehicles from the United States and Russia. From 2012-2015, substantial quantities of major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, artillery, APCs, and surface combatants from various suppliers. From 2012-2015, major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, helicopters, air defense and anti-ship missiles. The United States, Russia, and European suppliers were the main providers. Other suppliers also delivered naval systems and ground equipment. Aircraft platforms and naval craft were expensive and constituted a large portion of arms deliveries. Other weapon systems like anti-ship and surface-to-surface missiles were also delivered, with Russia providing 60 surface-to-surface missiles during this period. From 2012-2015, major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, helicopters, air defense, and anti-ship missiles. The four major West European suppliers collectively delivered 170 anti-ship missiles. Official data on arms transfer agreements with developing nations by major suppliers from 2008 to 2015 show recent trends in arms contract activity. Delivery data reflecting sales implementation are also provided. Worldwide arms transfer agreements and deliveries data from 2008-2015 are available for analysis. The data sets provide the comparative magnitude of arms transactions by suppliers with recipient nations in constant dollar terms.

Table 9 and Table 10 compare the values of arms transfer agreements with developing nations by the top 11 suppliers from 2008 to 2015 and specifically in 2015. Table 11 focuses on arms transfer agreements with Near East nations from 2008 to 2015. Table 12 presents arms transfer agreements made by the top 10 recipients in the developing world from 2008 to 2015, ranking them based on total current dollar values. Table 13 lists the top 10 recipients in 2015, ranked by current dollar values of agreements. Table 14 displays annual current dollar values of arms deliveries to developing nations. Delivery Values Table 14 shows the annual current dollar values of arms deliveries to developing nations by major suppliers from 2008-2015. These values reflect transfers that have occurred and are used to derive other tables such as regional arms delivery values and supplier percentages. Table 17 gives the values of arms deliveries by suppliers to individual regions of the developing world for the periods 2008-2011 and 2012-2015, with Table 18 and Table 19 providing further breakdowns of the data. Arms deliveries to developing nations and the Near East from 2008-2015 are detailed in tables ranking top suppliers based on dollar values. Delivery values for specific periods are compared, with data presented in current U.S. dollars. Table 23 and Table 24 provide data on arms deliveries and transfer agreements to top recipients in developing nations from 2008-2015, ranking them based on current dollar values. The tables show the recipients and suppliers involved in these transactions. The data on arms deliveries to developing nations from 2008 to 2015 by various countries show trends in military equipment transfers. The tables display deliveries of weaponry to different regions, highlighting leading suppliers over time. The information includes specific numbers of military items but lacks details on equipment sophistication or names. The data cover fourteen categories of weaponry and involve the United States, Russia, China, major West European suppliers, other European suppliers, and other suppliers collectively. Aggregate data on weapons categories delivered by suppliers do not accurately reflect the quality or quantity of weaponry. Recent conflicts show that weapon sophistication can outweigh numerical advantage. The recipient nations' ability to effectively use the weapons is crucial, with training, equipment, proficiency, and logistics playing significant roles in warfare success. Ten tables provide total dollar values for arms transfer agreements. Table 35, Table 36, and Table 37 display total dollar values for arms transfer agreements and deliveries worldwide from 2008-2015. These tables follow the same format as others showing values for agreements and deliveries to developing nations.
