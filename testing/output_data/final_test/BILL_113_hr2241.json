    "content": "The Act titled \"Disaster Savings and Resilient Construction Act of 2013\" introduces a new section for Disaster Resilient Property Tax Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Disaster Savings and Resilient Construction Act of 2013\" introduces a new section for Disaster Resilient Property Tax Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This section allows a credit against the tax imposed for each qualified building placed in service during the taxable year. The applicable amount varies for commercial and residential properties, with a maximum credit of $25,000 per building for commercial properties and $3,000 per property for residential properties. A \"qualified building\" for the Disaster Resilient Property Tax Credit is a building owned by the taxpayer in a disaster area, constructed after the disaster, and used for commercial or residential purposes with a certificate of occupancy issued within 3 years of the disaster declaration. The term 'qualified commercial property' refers to a building in the US meeting specific construction requirements, while 'qualified residential property' refers to a building meeting similar requirements. Resilient construction requirements involve designing and constructing properties to resist hazards from disasters, maintain primary functions post-disaster, reduce disruptive event impact, and have the capacity to withstand such events. The property must meet specific requirements for resilient construction, such as being designed to meet the 2009 or later International Building Code and receiving the FORTIFIED for Safer Business designation. The property must meet requirements for resilient construction, including compliance with the International Building Code and FORTIFIED for Safer Business standards. The property must meet requirements for resilient construction, including compliance with the 2009 or later International Residential Code published by the International Code Council. It must also meet one of the following criteria: (i) FORTIFIED for Safer Living designation, (ii) FORTIFIED for Existing Homes designation at the silver level, or (iii) be designed and built in a jurisdiction that requires compliance with the 2009 or later International Building Code. The curr_chunk discusses the terms \"absorptive capacity\" and \"adaptive capacity\" in relation to construction resilience standards. Absorptive capacity refers to a construction's ability to endure disruptions without significant performance deviation, while adaptive capacity refers to its ability to adapt to drastic changes. The curr_chunk defines terms related to construction resilience standards, including recoverability, construction, federally declared major disaster, and disaster area. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a disaster area and how the business credit is treated as part of the general business credit. It also mentions the basis reduction for purposes of the subtitle. The curr_chunk discusses the basis reduction for property eligible for a credit under subsection (a) and the termination of the section for properties with occupancy certificates issued after December 31, 2017. Additionally, it integrates the disaster resilient property credit into the general business credit. The curr_chunk amends certain paragraphs by adding a new paragraph related to tax credits under section 30E(g). A clerical amendment is also made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to property with a certificate for occupancy issued after the enactment of this Act."
