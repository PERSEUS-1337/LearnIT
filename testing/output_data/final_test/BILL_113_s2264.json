The National World War I Memorial Act redesignates Pershing Park in Washington D.C. as the \"National World War I Memorial\" and authorizes the Commission to enhance the General Pershing Commemorative Work with sculptural and commemorative elements to honor U.S. Armed Forces members who served in World War I. The General Pershing Commemorative Work is defined as a memorial to John J. Pershing, General of the Armies of the United States, and the officers and men under his command in World War I. Compliance with standards for commemorative works applies, with a waiver of certain requirements for site selection for the National World War I Memorial.
