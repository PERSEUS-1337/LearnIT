    "content": "In 2009, the war in Iraq is winding down as security gains made since the insurgency peak in 2006 and 2007 continue to be sustained. A new U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement confirms Iraqis' responsibility for their security, marking a shift in Operation Iraqi Freedom and U.S.-Iraqi relations. U.S. military efforts now focus on stability operations and advising the Iraqi Security Forces. President Obama announced the drawdown of U.S. combat forces in Iraq by August 2010, transitioning the military mission to training and advising Iraqi security forces. The U.S. had 140,000 troops deployed in Iraq in March 2009, along with civilian experts and contractors supporting security, governance, and development efforts. Senior officials emphasized the need for more time for lasting change in Iraq despite the diminishing U.S. military presence. Iraq will require more time for lasting change despite the diminishing U.S. military presence. The Government of Iraq still faces challenges in countering insurgency and achieving a shared vision for the country. Key policy issues for the Obama Administration include identifying U.S. national interests in Iraq, monitoring the impact of changes in the U.S. presence, and laying the groundwork for a future bilateral relationship. The Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was launched in 2003 with the goal of removing Saddam Hussein's regime and helping Iraq build a prosperous and free nation. The mission evolved from regime removal to assisting the new Iraqi leadership in improving security, governance, and economic development amidst challenges from insurgents. In response to escalating violence in Iraq, President Bush announced the \"New Way Forward\" strategy in January 2007, which included a troop surge of additional U.S. forces and civilian experts. Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus implemented counterinsurgency approaches focused on population security, empowering Iraqi Security Forces, and building government capacity. During the surge in Iraq, security conditions improved significantly, with observers noting progress but cautioning that it was not yet self-sustaining. Factors contributing to the security gains included additional surge forces, new counter-insurgency approaches, technological capabilities of Special Operations Forces, and the experience of U.S. leaders. The improved security conditions in Iraq during the surge were attributed to factors such as additional surge forces, new counter-insurgency approaches, and the experience of U.S. leaders. The accumulated experience of U.S. leaders, growing capabilities of Iraqi Security Forces, and support from Sunni Arabs and Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr were also key elements in the progress. The end of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was expected to be determined by policy decisions rather than a decisive military victory on the battlefield, as evidenced by new agreements signed by U.S. and Iraqi officials in November 2008. The Iraqi parliament supported two agreements on November 27 and the Iraqi Presidency Council approved them on December 4. The first document was the Strategic Framework Agreement covering cooperation in various fields. The second document, the Security Agreement, outlined the terms of the security partnership and the legal basis for the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. The Iraqi parliament approved two agreements on November 27, including the Security Agreement subject to a referendum by July 2009. It emphasized Iraqi sovereignty and set deadlines for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and from Iraq by December 31, 2011. The Agreement prohibited the U.S. from using Iraqi territory for attacks. The Security Agreement emphasized Iraqi sovereignty and set deadlines for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. It prohibited the U.S. from using Iraqi territory for attacks and required bilateral consultations in case of external threats. The Agreement also constrained the role of U.S. forces in detaining Iraqis and granted Iraq legal jurisdiction over U.S. servicemembers in certain cases.

The Agreement also constrained the role of U.S. forces in detaining Iraqis and granted Iraq legal jurisdiction over U.S. servicemembers in certain cases. The premeditated felonies were committed off base and outside duty status. President Obama announced a new strategy to end the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi responsibility at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. U.S. Marines entered Iraq at the start of OIF and helped lead major combat and counterinsurgency efforts. Senior Marine Corps officials argued that increasing the Marine deployment to Afghanistan will require drawing down in Iraq during calendar year 2010. The President's policy calls for the withdrawal of all U.S. combat forces by August 31, 2010. The decision to withdraw all U.S. combat forces from Iraq by August 31, 2010, was the result of a strategic review ordered by President Obama. Military commanders considered different timeline options before settling on the 18-month withdrawal plan. After August 2010, U.S. forces in Iraq will focus on training, equipping, and advising Iraqi security forces, conducting counter-terrorism operations, and providing force protection. The \"transitional force\" will initially consist of around 35,000 personnel. The \"transitional force\" in Iraq will include between 35,000 and 50,000 troops initially, with all remaining U.S. forces expected to be withdrawn by the end of 2011. Administration officials announced that 12,000 U.S. troops would redeploy from Iraq without replacement by September 2009, and between 10 and 12 Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) are expected to remain during Iraq's national elections in 2009. The key components of the \"transitional force\" are expected to be \"Advise and Assist Brigades\" (AABs), with an initial target figure of six AABs. Officials have suggested an initial target of six Advise and Assist Brigades (AABs) in Iraq, which will be built on the chassis of Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and augmented with necessary capabilities. Each AAB will focus on stability operations, including training and advisory roles, and will work closely with U.S. civilian counterparts such as Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). The troop withdrawal policy does not rule out further deployments to Iraq, as some units will be replaced by fresh U.S. units, and some may serve shorter tours. The drawdown and transition plans in Iraq include consolidating three key military headquarters, which are expected to be significantly smaller in personnel. The consolidation is likely to occur after the Iraqi national elections but before the August 2010 transition. The Obama Administration's drawdown and transition policy in Iraq involved consolidating military headquarters to reduce redundancy and prioritize key tasks. The policy aimed to balance between a gradual and accelerated drawdown, with some advocating for a longer timetable while others preferred a more rapid reduction of forces. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates acknowledged the desire of military commanders to extend the combat mission until the end of 2010. The drawdown in Iraq was a key concern to retain a robust force through political hurdles in 2009. U.S. military commanders recommended a slow withdrawal of two BCTs over the first six months of 2009. Proponents argued for a gradual approach to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. MNSTC-I Commanding General LTG Helmick noted the ISF still had a long way to go in February 2009. Some military commanders urged delaying the drawdown in Iraq until 2010 to focus on training Iraqi security forces. Others advocated for an accelerated timeline to end the U.S. military commitment as soon as possible. Some argued that troop withdrawal plans in Iraq could encourage progress by prompting Iraqi leaders to take more responsibility and urging international partners to increase involvement. Accelerated timeline advocates highlighted the strain on U.S. military forces from simultaneous war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States increased troop deployments to Afghanistan in 2009 due to high demand for forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Concerns have been raised about the stress on servicemembers from repeated deployments and short dwell times at home. The Department of Defense implemented policies to manage this stress, such as limiting Army deployments to 12 months after August 1, 2008. Some observers have expressed concerns about the Obama Administration's policy on troop deployments. The Obama Administration announced its Iraq transition policy, questioning the need for a large residual force of 50,000 troops. Some urged flexibility in the timeline execution, citing ongoing challenges in Iraq. The Government of Iraq faces major tests in 2009, including provincial elections in January, district-level elections in June, a national referendum in July, and national-level elections. In 2009, the Government of Iraq faces challenges including provincial and national elections, a national referendum on a security agreement, and potential unrest. Persistent strategic challenges include tensions between Iraqi Kurds and Arabs, particularly regarding the status of Kirkuk and other disputed territories. These issues could disrupt progress towards a unified and stable Iraq. The Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) faces challenges in reclaiming areas resettled by Saddam's regime, disputes with the Government of Iraq (GoI) over oil revenues, and tensions in Kirkuk due to outside influences. In 2008, clashes occurred between Iraqi security forces and KRG peshmerga in Khanaquin. The year 2009 is crucial for resolving these ongoing debates. The year 2009 is pivotal for resolving tensions in the north, with UNAMI expected to present recommendations. Provincial elections in At Ta'amin province, including Kirkuk, are yet to be scheduled. Sunni Arabs need better integration into Iraqi society post-Saddam, with increased political representation seen in the 2009 elections. Integration of Sons of Iraq program members, mostly Sunni Arabs, remains a concern. The Sons of Iraq (SoI) program, consisting mostly of Sunni Arabs, faced challenges as the Iraqi government took over responsibility, leading to slow integration into security forces and delays in salary payments. Concerns were raised about potential security risks if the program was shut down or members were not provided alternative employment. Reports of arrests of SoI members by Iraqi Security Forces raised further tensions. In late March 2009, the detention of a key Sons of Iraq (SoI) leader in Baghdad by Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) led to armed clashes, detainment of SoI members, and the disbandment of the SoI group. Concerns about violence in southern Iraq due to power struggles among Shiite factions, Iranian interventions, and potential regional tensions were highlighted. In early 2009, Iraq was undergoing major transitions at the operational level, with significant security improvements achieved during the surge. Despite some remaining insurgent activity, sustainable security was not yet fully established. Concerns were raised about potential violence reigniting in Mosul and Diyala province due to volatile dynamics among Kurds, Shi'a, and Sunni Arabs. In 2008, U.S. military operations focused on stability in south and west Iraq, with continued emphasis on COIN in the north-central region. The Iraqi Security Forces' capabilities grew through operational experiences in Basra, Sadr City, Amarah, Mosul, and Diyala. ISF operations in Basra and Diyala required support from coalition forces. Additionally, there was a growth in formal security responsibility by the Government of Iraq in 2008. In 2008, the Government of Iraq took on formal security responsibility, preceding the Security Agreement, with additional provinces transitioning to \"provincial Iraqi control\" (PIC). This led to increased coordination of coalition operations with the GoI. The ISF's capabilities improved, leading to changes in training and partnering approaches with the coalition. Training focus shifted towards advanced skills and unit-to-unit partnering evolved for better advising. By early 2009, MNF-I became less multinational as coalition partners withdrew their troops from Iraq. Some countries signed agreements with the GoI to continue their presence, but their mandates were set to expire in July 2009. The focus of U.S. forces in Iraq shifted geographically. The geographical focus of U.S. forces in Iraq shifted from north to south in March 2009. The Multi-National Division-Center absorbed the UK-led Multi-National Division-Southeast to form the new Multi-National Division-South under U.S. command. Civilian-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams took the lead in some efforts previously spearheaded by the military, operating without significant U.S. forces presence in some provinces. In 2008, Iraqi officials showed less interest in being mentored by U.S. officials, leading to a decrease in U.S. leverage. This was evident in decisions made by Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, such as launching military operations in Basra and assuming responsibility for Sons of Iraq. With Iraqi confidence and capabilities growing, U.S. leverage is expected to further diminish in 2009 as the U.S. presence decreases under the new sovereignty regime. President Obama's drawdown and transition policy in Iraq aims for a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant nation. The U.S. will work towards promoting a just and representative Iraqi government, building new trade ties, and forging a partnership for regional peace and security. The U.S. aims to promote a stable Iraq and ensure it does not become a safe haven for terrorists. The importance of active intelligence-sharing by Iraq with the United States and the need for Iraq to develop expeditionary capabilities for regional counter-terrorist activities are key considerations for U.S. interests in the regional balance of power. It is crucial for Iraq to maintain peace with its neighbors as the situation in Iraq remains dynamic and challenging. The situation in Iraq remains dynamic and challenging, with violence expected to continue. U.S. policymakers may need to reassess how to effectively support Iraq's transformation. There is a mismatch between Iraqi warfighting commanders, who recognize the need for U.S. support, and political leaders, who are overconfident in Iraqi security forces. The strategic considerations for the long-term partnership between the United States and Iraq include the need for close military partnership, diplomatic, economic, and security ties. Secretary Gates emphasized the expectation of continued U.S. involvement in Iraq for many years. A challenge lies in transitioning from a paternalistic relationship to an equal partnership, which will impact decisions on the future U.S. presence in Iraq. One option for a future U.S. presence in Iraq could be establishing permanent military bases, similar to those in Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Italy. However, this option lacks support from the Obama Administration, Members of Congress, and the Government of Iraq. Another possibility is a robust U.S. Office of Security Cooperation responsible for training and advising Iraqi security forces. This would require revisiting and amending the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement. The OSC could be responsible to both the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the Commanding General of U.S. Central Command. Iraq faces a threat from Shi'a Iraqi proxy groups trained by Iran's Quds forces. U.S. forces shot down an Iranian drone over Iraqi territory. MNC-I is shifting focus to southern Iraq. The U.S. is increasing troop presence in southern Iraq as coalition partners withdraw. Growing U.S. forces in the region may concern Iran, especially with U.S. presence in Afghanistan. It is unclear how U.S. \"Iran policy\" considers Iranian activities in southern Iraq. There is a potential for low-level military confrontations with Iranian proxies in the area. Consideration should be given to scenarios where tactical developments escalate into strategic concerns. Lessons from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) could influence decisions on training foreign security forces, intelligence assets, dwell time policies, and operational integration between Special Operations Forces and conventional forces. President Obama's drawdown in Iraq prompts the Army to consider institutionalizing key capabilities developed through trial and error. The policy calls for the deployment of Advise and Assist Brigades (AABs) to Iraq by mid-2010, built on existing BCTs and augmented as needed for stability operations. The question remains on how permanent AABs should be, with the option to adapt standard force structure or establish a standing capacity. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates emphasizes the importance of building the security capacity of other nations through training and equipping programs. Dr. John Nagl has proposed creating a permanent Advisory Corps of 20,000 combat advisors to develop host nation security forces. The Army is hesitant to make permanent changes to force structure, preferring Brigade Enabled for Stability Operations (BESO) over Advise and Assist Brigades (AABs). BESOs from Fort Bliss will deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan, remaining full-spectrum capable. The Department of Defense is considering slight modifications to gain skill sets from the BESOs at Fort Bliss, which will remain full-spectrum capable. OIF experiences may shape future force planning discussions, but drawing conclusions is complex due to analytical challenges. Recent DOD guidance recognizes IW as a policy. The 2008 National Defense Strategy and 2009 Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review Report emphasized the importance of capabilities for complex contingencies like Iraq and Afghanistan. Lessons from OIF regarding government coordination in such situations raise questions about decision-making processes for going to war. The decision-making process for going to war and implementing activities in complex contingencies like Iraq and Afghanistan raises questions about inter-agency debates, military advice provision, and congressional oversight. Issues include balancing roles, responsibilities, resources, and authorities among U.S. government agencies, with different patterns observed in security forces training, governance, and economic reconstruction efforts. The capacity of U.S. Government civilian agencies and military units in Iraq should be enhanced for better coordination. The Obama Administration's transition policy calls for a diminishing U.S. government role in Iraq, but operational issues remain open for consideration. Senior officials on the ground will continue to make choices on supporting host nation partners. During the formal occupation of Iraq from 2003 to 2004, the coalition was responsible for all aspects of Iraqi public life. As Iraqi capacity grew, the role of Iraqi civilian and military officials shifted to leading with some support from the coalition. By 2008, U.S. officials were debating the level of assistance needed for the Iraqi Security Forces and civilian expert assistance. Some U.S. officials argue that it's time to reduce U.S. involvement in Iraq and let the Iraqis take more responsibility for their own security and problem-solving. This shift is seen as a way to prevent Iraqi dependence on U.S. help and encourage Iraqi capacity building. President Obama's drawdown and transition policy aims to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by August 2010 and all U.S. forces by the end of 2011. Remaining decisions include transitioning to Advise and Assist Brigades, determining the size of a residual force of 35,000 to 50,000 troops post-August 2010, and the drawdown timeline until the end of 2011. The Obama policy aims to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq by August 2010 and all forces by the end of 2011. Supporting the development of Iraqi Security Forces is a critical focus, with a key operational consideration being how to accomplish the ISF training mission as U.S. forces draw down. The focus is on training the Iraqi Security Forces as U.S. forces withdraw. Transition teams have been used, with varying team sizes. There has been an improvement in the quality and effectiveness of these teams over time. The use of embedded transition teams by the Military Departments to train the Iraqi Security Forces has evolved over time, focusing on higher-level ISF headquarters and shifting towards leadership and specialized skills. As the ISF capabilities improved, the teams worked on staff functions, logistics, and forensics, ultimately working themselves out of a job as their host nation partners improved. The U.S. military may not always have all the necessary skills for embedded teams, but they can share expertise in areas like logistics with their Iraqi counterparts. The U.S. Military Police lack specialized policing skills and rely on collaboration with civilian International Police Advisors due to a shortage. Unit partnering with Iraqi units has been emphasized as a temporary arrangement to show effective organization and leadership, complementing embedded transition teams in training Iraqi Security Forces. The U.S. Military Police collaborate with civilian International Police Advisors due to a shortage of specialized policing skills. Unit partnering with Iraqi forces has been temporary, extending to Ministry of the Interior forces. Coalition forces support capacity-building of key Iraqi security institutions. The MNSTC-I, part of MNF-I, mentors Iraqi senior leaders in leadership and management skills, providing technical assistance to ministry personnel. Coalition officials emphasize the importance of capacity-building efforts while Iraqis are receptive. Utilizing experienced mentors is crucial for the ISF development, reducing the need for U.S. support. The Obama transition policy highlights ISF training as a key mission for the U.S. transition force. The U.S. transition force's mission in Iraq includes ISF training and advisory efforts, with a focus on providing key enablers like logistics, ISR, and close air support. The ability of U.S. AABs to mentor ISF units and build close relationships with Iraqi counterparts may be challenged by the reduced U.S. military presence in Iraq. The U.S. transition force in Iraq is working on ISF training and advisory efforts, focusing on providing key enablers like logistics, ISR, and close air support. The U.S.-Iraqi security agreement requires the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraqi urban areas by June 30, 2009. The Obama drawdown policy aims to accelerate this shift, with the planned withdrawal of 12,000 U.S. troops by September 2009. The shift in U.S. strategy in Iraq involves withdrawing troops from urban areas by September 2009, which contrasts with the previous approach of maintaining a strong presence in cities and towns to build trust with the local population. The U.S. is planning to reduce its presence in urban areas in Iraq by June 2009, with some forces remaining in advisory roles to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. LTG Austin noted that Iraqi officials were likely to request a continuation of some U.S. force presence in Mosul and Diyala beyond the deadline. The U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement required coordination of all military operations with Iraqi authorities, with committees established for detailed instructions. GEN Odierno mentioned a shift in mission planning and new rules of engagement under the Agreement. MNF-I officials highlighted the importance of the Security Agreement in early 2009. In early 2009, MNF-I officials emphasized the Security Agreement as crucial for U.S. efforts in Iraq. The focus was on coordinating operations with Iraqi forces, with many already combined before the Agreement. The Provincial Iraqi Control process facilitated transitions of security responsibility to Iraqi control in provinces based on assessments of security conditions. Before the Security Agreement, 13 provinces had transitioned to PIC, requiring coordination with the GoI. Approval was granted in advance for certain U.S. activities. Warrant-based arrests were common in 2008. U.S. commanders reported a smooth transition to operations under the Security Agreement, working jointly with Iraqi security forces. Iraqi air space surveillance and control were addressed in the Agreement. The Security Agreement stated that Iraqi airspace control would transfer to Iraqi authority immediately, with the option for temporary U.S. support due to the Iraqi Air Force's limited capabilities. Iraqi officials acknowledge their lack of key counter-insurgency capabilities and remain eager for U.S. support. In late 2008, U.S. officials expressed confidence in reaching agreements on shared use of Iraqi airspace. The Security Agreement did not address operational coordination between Iraqi and U.S. forces, with ISF commanders sometimes informing U.S. forces after local operations. This could impact U.S. force protection and the ability to provide support during ISF operations. The Security Agreement outlined provisions for detainee operations, including constraints on U.S. forces taking Iraqis into custody and procedures for adjudicating detainee cases. U.S. forces were required to provide information on detainees and hand over custody of wanted individuals to Iraqi authorities. Detainees not wanted were to be released in a safe manner, leading to a detainee release program in 2008. In late November 2008, U.S. forces held around 15,800 detainees in internment facilities, releasing over 17,500 during the year. Concerns were raised about the remaining \"legacy\" detainees lacking sufficient evidence for release, posing security threats. Some feared a sectarian bias in the Iraqi adjudication of these cases. In January 2009, Iraqi and U.S. officials agreed to transfer 1,500 detainees per month to Iraqi authorities. Iraqi officials had warrants for 42 detainees, kept 70 for further investigation, and planned to release the rest to their home communities. Some detainees feared harm upon release and the Iraqi government agreed to help them resettle elsewhere. Six released detainees were later abducted and killed by local police officers in retaliation. The balance of U.S. civilian and military roles in Iraq has evolved during Operation Iraqi Freedom. As U.S. forces draw down, the future balance of civilian and military efforts is a key operational issue. The military has traditionally played a significant role in governance and reconstruction, with civilian integration increasing over time. The U.S. military in Iraq has been supporting civilian-led governance mentorship efforts, establishing connections between national, regional, and local levels. Military units work on fostering governance at district and local levels, linking them to higher levels of Iraqi government. Some support for small-scale reconstruction initiatives continued through early 2009. Some U.S. military units in Iraq are focusing on supporting civilian-led governance mentorship efforts and connecting national, regional, and local levels. As security conditions improve, there are increased opportunities for civilian assistance initiatives, with a potential to boost support for Iraqi civilian capacity-building. Iraqi officials are welcoming additional U.S. civilian expertise, and there is a suggestion to increase the U.S. civilian effort in Iraq as troops draw down. In 2008, efforts were made to enhance U.S. civilian assistance at the provincial level in Iraq, including adding civilian subject matter experts. Plans for a strategic drawdown of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) were initiated in response to Congressional direction. The Obama Administration's policy aims to consolidate PRT personnel at fewer locations and integrate their work with the AABs. Secretary Gates outlined future plans for PRTs in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee in January 2009. In January 2009, Secretary Gates discussed plans for consolidating Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) with military forces to protect civilian elements. There were suggestions for varying civil-military relationships geographically, with closer integration in unsettled areas and looser partnerships in permissive areas. Test cases in Najaf and Karbala provinces showed PRTs functioning without substantial U.S. forces presence. In late 2008, PRT in Najaf operated with a diverse civilian team and limited U.S. military presence. Private security contractors provided static security. In early 2009, Najaf was seen as a potential model for future operations. The role of contractors in supporting OIF varied in scope and scale, with DOD reporting 148,050 contractors in Iraq by the first quarter of 2009. According to DOD, as of the first quarter of 2009, there were 148,050 contractors in Iraq, including U.S. citizens, third-country nationals, and host country nationals. The role of contractors supporting U.S. operations in Iraq is a key operational issue as U.S. forces draw down. The functions of contractors may shift, with some requirements decreasing and others increasing, such as force protection for U.S. government civilians and specialized training and advisory support for the ISF. U.S. policy decisions may also influence the role of contractors. Contractors in Iraq were directed to reduce reliance on international contractors by five percent per quarter by GEN Odierno in 2009. The U.S-Iraqi Security Agreement mandates Iraq's jurisdiction over U.S. contractors. Legal jurisdiction concerns led to transitioning key contractors to U.S. Government employees. In 2009, U.S. government agencies directed key contractors in Iraq to transition to U.S. Government \"term employee\" status. This included members of Human Terrain Teams who were previously employed by BAE Systems. The shift was made due to concerns about jurisdiction. One key operational issue is the future disposition of U.S. military equipment as forces draw down, considering factors like costs and support to the Iraqi Security Forces. The ISF may urgently require supplies for their force development or current COIN fight. Some equipment no longer needed in Iraq may be sent to support U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. Stockpiles of heavy equipment in the CENTCOM theater may be kept for future contingencies pending host nation approval. Logistical support like HETs, air assets, and diplomatic permissions are needed for redeploying equipment. Congress has tools to shape U.S. policy towards Iraq, including limiting funding for certain activities. For example, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 prohibited funding for establishing military bases in Iraq or controlling its oil resources. Congress can also tie funding to specific milestones, as seen in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008. In the context of shaping U.S. policy towards Iraq, Congress established benchmarks for the Iraqi government's performance and conditioned further U.S. strategy on meeting those benchmarks. Oversight hearings were held to hold Administration officials accountable for policy implementation, such as a hearing on \"Security and Stability in Afghanistan and Iraq\" in 2008. The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2008, with Secretary Gates and General James Cartwright. Congress established reporting requirements in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, for progress towards military and political stability in Iraq. The report provides analysis of future strategic and operational considerations for the war in Iraq, including war planning, major combat operations, and post-major combat military activities. It aims to support congressional decision-making by evaluating strategies pursued and outcomes achieved, current dynamics on the ground, and key strategic and operational factors moving forward. The report will be updated as needed. The report analyzes combat military activities in Iraq, including operations, training of Iraqi security forces, and reconstruction efforts. It traces the decision to launch Operation Iraqi Freedom back to the 1991 Gulf War and concerns over Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. U.S. policy post-Gulf War supported UN-led weapons inspections and economic sanctions to ensure compliance. Before being withdrawn in 1998, U.N. weapons inspectors located and destroyed WMD in Iraq. U.S. post-Gulf War policy included containment initiatives like \"no fly\" zones imposed by the U.S., UK, and France. Operation Northern Watch protected Iraqi Kurds in the north, while Operation Southern Watch protected Shiite Arabs in the south. These measures faced Iraqi provocations, leading to Operation Desert Fox in 1998 to degrade Iraq's WMD capabilities. In the late 1990s, a policy shift in Washington towards aggressive action against Iraq began to emerge, with some advocating for regime change. Congress passed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998, authorizing support for Iraqi opposition groups. After the 2000 presidential elections, supporters of this policy gained influence in the Bush Administration. The September 11, 2001 attacks heightened concerns about WMD falling into the hands of terrorists, leading to a preemptive action policy highlighted in the 2002 National Security Strategy. In 2002, the Bush Administration adopted a policy of preemptive action against Iraq to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolutions. President Bush outlined conditions for Iraq to avoid retaliatory action, including giving up WMD, ending support for terrorism, and accounting for missing Gulf War personnel. In November 2002, the U.N. Security Council issued Resolution 1441, giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its obligations. Failure to comply would result in serious consequences, but did not automatically authorize military action under Chapter VII. Despite Iraq providing written materials, the Bush Administration deemed their compliance insufficient and chose not to seek further U.N. authorization for military action. The Bush Administration chose not to seek a U.N. Resolution authorizing military action against Iraq under Chapter VII, citing concerns of potential veto. President Bush publicly announced the intent for military action on March 17, 2003, giving an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq within 48 hours. The Administration planned for both combat operations and post-regime removal operations to achieve their goals in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Bush Administration's short-term goal for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was regime removal, as stated by President Bush in his March 17, 2003, Address to the Nation. The longer-term objective was to help Iraqis build a prosperous and free Iraq that would not be at war with its neighbors or abuse its citizens. The U.S. Central Command's OIF campaign plan aimed for a stable Iraq with territorial integrity, a broad-based government renouncing WMD development and use. The Bush Administration's strategic objectives for Iraq included regime removal and the establishment of a peaceful, united, stable, and secure Iraq that renounces WMD development, supports democracy, and is a partner in the global war on terrorism. The Administration's long-term goal was a unified, democratic, federal Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself, and is an ally in the war on terror. The Department of Defense reiterated the goal of a unified, democratic, and federal Iraq in its quarterly update to Congress. The Obama Administration's objective for Iraq was a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant government that is not a sponsor of terrorism. CENTCOM defined military objectives in Iraq as destabilizing the regime and supporting a new one. The military objectives in Iraq included destabilizing the regime, destroying WMD capability, protecting allies, destroying terrorist networks, gathering intelligence on global terrorism, and supporting long-term stability in the region. Different military capabilities and strategies were considered for regime removal, such as air power and joint efforts with Special Operations Forces. Key debates in major combat planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom were highlighted. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, key debates in major combat planning focused on the size of the force, timelines for action, and synchronization of ground and air power. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld advocated for a streamlined force and quick timeline, aligning with his vision of defense transformation. The 2002 National Security Strategy emphasized the need for a leaner and more agile military to address evolving threats. The planning process not only addressed how to fight the war in Iraq but also how to organize, train, and equip the force. The planning effort for combat operations in Iraq started early, with President Bush asking Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a plan for regime removal. This task was given to General Tommy Franks of U.S. Central Command, and the planning initially involved only a few key leaders. As the effort progressed, more people became involved, but key elements of the plans remained compartmentalized. The planning effort for combat operations in Iraq started early, with President Bush asking Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a plan for regime removal. General Franks briefed Secretary Rumsfeld on the existing Iraq war plan, known as 1003-98, which called for a large force deployment. However, Secretary Rumsfeld requested a new plan with fewer troops and a faster deployment timeline. General Franks then presented the \"Generated Start\" plan, which included early CIA infiltration and Special Operations Forces deployment in specific regions. The planning for combat operations in Iraq involved developing a plan for regime removal with a focus on northern Iraq and Al Anbar province. The main effort included air and ground attacks with a force of up to 275,000 troops. An alternative plan called \"Running Start\" was developed in response to the possibility of Iraqi provocation, aiming for a smaller force and shorter timeline. The \"Running Start\" plan for combat operations in Iraq involved a smaller force and shorter timeline, starting with CIA infiltration and SOF introduction, followed by air attacks and ground forces entering theater. A \"hybrid\" version combined elements of the \"Running Start\" plan, with a 5-day presidential notification, 11 days to flow forces, 16 days for the air campaign, and a total campaign lasting up to 125 days. The \"5-11-16-125\" plan, approved for action, involved a modified version of \"Generated Start\" with a short initial air campaign lasting a couple of days. The ground campaign would begin with U.S. Army V Corps and the I Marine Expeditionary Force crossing into Iraq from Kuwait, while the 4th Infantry Division would open a northern front from Turkey. The number of forces for the ground campaign was adjusted downward in the succeeding days. Army commanders learned on January 29, 2003, that they would enter Iraq with just two Divisions, less than their initial plans. V Corps in Germany realized they lacked sufficient forces to secure cities in southern Iraq during an exercise. Lieutenant General William Scott Wallace expressed discomfort with troop levels as summer approached. Administration's planning for post-war Iraq was deemed inadequate for the strategic objective of a free and prosperous Iraq. The post-war planning for Iraq, aimed at achieving a \"free and prosperous Iraq,\" was not as thorough as the planning for combat operations. The U.S. military had high stakes in the post-war efforts, with civilian agencies responsible for political, diplomatic, and economic tools. However, the majority of coalition personnel on the ground were U.S. military forces, leading to them taking on additional roles and responsibilities. Some argued that a larger number of U.S. troops should have been sent to provide security in the post-major combat period. Ambassador L. Paul Bremer criticized the lack of U.S. troops in Iraq during the post-major combat period, stating that more troops would have improved the situation. The post-war planning process did not clearly define commanders' post-war responsibilities before combat operations began. The focus of post-war planning debates was on who would be in charge in Iraq. The interagency post-war-planning debates focused on determining leadership in Iraq after the war. The Administration worked with Iraqi contacts and sponsored conferences with oppositionists to discuss post-war roles. Despite agreements on a political statement and a self-nominated \"leadership council,\" U.S. policy decisions were not directly influenced by these events. During the same time frame, the State Department supported a deliberate political process for post-war Iraq, involving building new institutions based on the rule of law. The \"Future of Iraq\" project brought together Iraqi oppositionists and experts to address post-war challenges, aiming to identify potential future leaders without producing formal plans. The Department of Defense favored putting Iraqis in charge of Iraq as soon as possible, based on the model of Afghanistan. A \"real\" Iraqi leadership with real power might shorten the U.S. commitment in Iraq. Discussions in fall 2002 focused on a U.S.-led \"transitional civil administration.\" Senior leaders discussed a U.S.-led \"transitional civil administration\" for governing Iraq, but details like authority, responsibilities, duration, and Iraqi involvement were unresolved. In January 2003, a post-war political process known as the \"mega-brief\" emerged, balancing State Department's preference for a gradual approach with DOD's desire for quick Iraqi leadership visibility. This involved creating an Iraqi Consultative Council (ICC) and replacing top Saddam-era leaders. The post-war political process in Iraq involved creating an Iraqi Consultative Council, dismissing top Saddam-era leaders, and holding various elections and referendums. The \"mega-brief\" approach aimed to balance a gradual approach with quick Iraqi leadership visibility, with governance tasks initially performed by coalition personnel. Military planners based operational plans on critical policy assumptions regarding post-war roles. During OIF planning, military commanders sought policy guidance by briefing their assumptions to elicit a response. In December 2001, General Franks included establishing a provisional Iraqi government in his brief to President Bush, inspired by the Bonn Conference for Afghanistan. By August 2002, CENTCOM included in its war plans briefing the assumption that the Department of State would promote the creation of a credible provisional government, despite the lack of a policy decision on post-war responsibilities. The military sought guidance on post-war responsibilities during OIF planning. General Franks presented war plans slides to President Bush and the National Security Council, including the concept of a \"military administration.\" Two months later, a full wiring diagram of the coalition's post-war structure was included, with a \"Joint Task Force\" for security and a civilian \"High Commissioner\" for other functions, both reporting to CENTCOM. In late 2002, military commanders began Phase IV planning efforts for post-war requirements. In January 2003, Brigadier General Steve Hawkins was appointed to lead Task Force IV for post-war planning and deployment to Baghdad. TFIV worked under the operational control of CFLCC, the ground forces component of CENTCOM. In March 2003, CFLCC launched a post-war planning effort led by Major General Albert Whitley (UK), known as Eclipse II, which lacked direct access to Washington policy debates. The planning efforts lacked insight into key aspects of the current state of affairs in Iraq, assuming availability of Iraqi law enforcement personnel for civic duties. The President created the Organization for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) on January 20, 2003, to plan for post-war efforts in Iraq. Retired Army Lieutenant General Jay Garner was appointed to lead ORHA, which held its founding conference in February 2003. ORHA, led by General Garner, was tasked with Civil Affairs, Humanitarian Affairs, and Reconstruction in post-war Iraq. Time constraints hindered civilian agencies from providing resources at the start of combat operations. Command relationships within the Department of Defense were initially disputed. After being tasked with Civil Affairs, Humanitarian Affairs, and Reconstruction in post-war Iraq, ORHA deployed to Kuwait with limited resources and set up headquarters at the Kuwait Hilton. The coalition force, joint and combined, launched major combat operations in Iraq following plans outlined at the CENTCOM Component Commanders Conference. The CIA had already begun infiltration into Iraq with NILE and SILE to gather intelligence and form relationships. Special Operations Forces (SOF) entered Iraq before the formal launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), securing bases, suspected WMD sites, and pursuing high-value targets. They worked with Iraqi Kurdish forces and other international contingents. Nearly 10,000 SOF participated in OIF major combat, which was publicly launched on March 20, 2003, after President Bush's ultimatum to Saddam Hussein. The planned sequence of the air and ground campaigns for Operation Iraqi Freedom shifted at the last minute due to concerns about the Iraqi regime destroying oil wells. The ground forces launch was moved up ahead of the air campaign launch, and there was a targeted attack on Saddam Hussein's location at Dora Farms near Baghdad just as the ultimatum expired. On March 21, 2003, coalition forces launched \"shock and awe\" attacks on Iraqi command and control sites after a barrage of Tomahawk missiles. The ground campaign, led by Army Lieutenant General David McKiernan, aimed for a quick push from Kuwait to Baghdad, with U.S. Army V Corps leading the western route. General William Scott Wallace led V Corps on the western route to Baghdad, while Lieutenant General James Conway led the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force on the eastern route. The long distances strained logistics and communications for both Army and Marines. The Marines took the eastern route with more urban areas, while the UK First Armored Division under IMEF took Basra. IMEF supported the UK Division in taking Basra, Iraq's second largest city, facing resistance from paramilitary forces and Ba'ath Party loyalists. They used a methodical approach to limit casualties before pushing into Basra on April 6, 2003. The main IMEF force encountered resistance at Nassiriyah, where friendly fire incidents with Apaches caused casualties. The Army's 507th Maintenance Company faced an ambush in Nassiriyah, where PFC Jessica Lynch was taken hostage. The area was hit by sandstorms, and the Saddam Fedayeen put up strong resistance. Additional Iraqi fighters joined the fight inspired by the ambush. Marines advanced towards Baghdad in the east, while the Army faced a longer route in the west. V Corps led combat operations with the Third Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division under its command. The 3ID and the 101st Airborne Division, led by Major General David Petraeus, swiftly advanced towards Baghdad, with the 3ID conducting \"thunder runs\" into the city to establish control. The 101st followed, clearing resistance in southern cities before setting up headquarters in Mosul. The Army division set up headquarters in Mosul, Iraq, facing unexpected resistance from Saddam Fedayeen. LTG Wallace noted the unconventional enemy tactics, including attacks with technical vehicles and various weapons. Sandstorms and long supply lines from Kuwait posed challenges. In the north, 1,000 soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade parachuted into northern Iraq to secure an airfield. The 173rd Airborne Brigade parachuted into northern Iraq to secure an airfield, working with Special Operating Forces and Kurdish pesh merga forces to expand the northern front of OIF. Initial plans for the 4th Infantry Division to open the northern front from Turkey were delayed, leading to equipment sitting on ships in the Mediterranean Sea. The Turkish parliament rejected a proposal for the 4th Infantry Division to use Turkish territory in March 2003. The Office of the Secretary of Defense had a program to recruit and train Iraqi expats as the \"Free Iraqi Forces,\" but the number of recruits was lower than expected. Iraqi expatriate oppositionist Ahmed Chalabi requested to send his fighters from northern to southern Iraq to join the fight in late March 2003. In early April 2003, Ahmed Chalabi and 600 fighters arrived in southern Iraq. The forces were not well-equipped or organized, and some engaged in lawless behavior. On April 9, 2003, Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in Baghdad, signaling the end of the old Iraqi regime. U.S. forces continued to flow into Iraq, with the 4th Infantry Division entering on April 12, 2003. 4ID and 1st Armored Division entered Iraq in April 2003, followed by the 1st Cavalry Division. However, Secretary Rumsfeld decided that 1CD was not needed at that time, causing concern among ground commanders. Widespread looting occurred in Baghdad and other areas, targeting government buildings, private businesses, and cultural institutions. The Iraqi National Museum reported the loss of 170,000 antiquities. Looters also targeted abandoned weapons stockpiles. In April 2003, widespread looting occurred in Baghdad and other areas, targeting government buildings, private businesses, and cultural institutions. Looters also targeted unguarded weapons stockpiles largely abandoned by former Iraqi security forces. Meanwhile, U.S. senior leadership attention had turned to Iraq's political future, with discussions held by expatriate opposition leaders and Iraqi Kurds on broad principles for Iraq's future. President Bush declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq on May 1, 2003, stating that the United States and allies had prevailed. The old Iraqi regime lost control over territory, resources, and population. Saddam Hussein was captured on December 13, 2003. The period post-major combat, from May 1, 2003, to the present, saw evolutions in national and military strategy. The transition of executive authority on June 28, 2004, marked a significant political and legal milestone. The major marker after May 1, 2003, was the transition of executive authority from occupying powers back to Iraqis on June 28, 2004. The period post-May 1, 2003, included combat operations and new missions. The coalition was recognized as occupying powers by the UN Security Council, and a multinational force was authorized in October 2003. As the deadline for the transfer of sovereignty approached, U.S. and Iraqi officials negotiated terms for the presence of the Multi-National Force-Iraq post-June 30, 2004. Parallel letters from U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi were appended to UN Security Council Resolution 1546, reaffirming authorization for the multi-national force at the request of the incoming Interim Government of Iraq. The UN Security Council Resolution 1546 reaffirmed authorization for the multi-national force in Iraq, with the force now authorized to take necessary measures for security and stability. The U.S. letter outlined tasks such as combat operations, training Iraqi security forces, and providing humanitarian assistance. The command-and-control relationship between the Iraqi government and the multi-national force was strictly defined. The UN Security Council Resolution 1546 reaffirmed the authorization for the multi-national force in Iraq, emphasizing a \"security partnership\" with the Iraqi government. Coordination modalities were outlined to ensure unity of effort, with parameters for the MNF-I presence detailed in a revised version of Order 17. This order addressed legal immunities, communications, transportation, customs, and entry and departure for government civilians, contractors, and military forces in Iraq. The UN Security Council Resolution 1546 reaffirmed the authorization for the multi-national force in Iraq, with coordination modalities outlined in a revised version of Order 17. The final U.N. authorization was issued on December 18, 2007, extending through December 31, 2008. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki requested the extension, stating it would be the final request for an extension under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. In November 2008, a new security agreement between the U.S. and Iraq took effect on January 1, 2009, defining the legal terms of the U.S. military presence. The security agreement between the U.S. and Iraq took effect on January 1, 2009, defining the legal terms of the U.S. military presence in Iraq. The relationships among U.S. military and civilian organizations in Iraq have shifted multiple times since the end of major combat operations. The Organization for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and the Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) had a clear division of labor in Iraq. President Bush appointed Ambassador L. Paul Bremer to lead the Coalition Provisional Authority in May 2003, giving it more authority than ORHA. Bremer reported to the President through the Secretary of Defense. In fall 2003, the White House took over coordinating efforts in Iraq from Ambassador Bremer. U.S. Army V Corps headquarters became CJTF-7, reporting to CENTCOM and CPA. The dual chain of command led to challenges, resulting in CJTF-7 splitting into MNF-I and a lower operational unit in May 2004. The Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), led by LTG Sanchez, and the Multi-National Corps-Iraq (MNC-I) were established. MNF-I maintained a \"direct support\" relationship with CPA until the end of the formal occupation. CJTF-7, a combined force with UK representation, split into MNF-I and a lower operational unit in May 2004. The Coalition Provisional Authority ceased to exist on June 28, 2004, with the new U.S. Embassy led by Ambassador John Negroponte inheriting none of CPA's executive authority for Iraq. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq, led by Ambassador John Negroponte, did not inherit CPA's executive authority. MNF-I, headed by General George Casey, is a joint force with civilian contractors. General Raymond Odierno leads MNF-I, with Lieutenant General Chris Brown as Deputy Commanding General. The MNF-I staff in Iraq is an ad hoc headquarters led by General George Casey and General Raymond Odierno. The Multi-National Corps-Iraq (MNC-I) in Baghdad synchronizes coalition forces actions, built around a U.S. Army Corps led by Lieutenant General Charles Jacoby. The structure and staffing of MNF-I and MNC-I have evolved significantly since the early days of OIF. The MNF-I staff in Iraq, led by General George Casey and General Raymond Odierno, focused on tactical-level ground campaigns. Senior staff positions were initially held by Colonels, gradually replaced by General Officers. Under MNC-I command, Divisions covered all of Iraq with shifting boundaries to adapt to security needs and coalition deployments. U.S. forces in Iraq peaked at 250,000 during major combat operations, varying in response to events like Iraqi elections and strategic decisions such as the 2007 surge, reaching 168,000 troops in October 2007. The total number of U.S. troops in Iraq decreased to about 146,000 by February 1, 2009, from a peak of 168,000 in October 2007. This reduction was due to the redeployment of surge brigades without replacement, including the withdrawal of additional Army BCTs. Before President Obama's February 2009 announcement of his Iraq drawdown and transition policy, the departure of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred about six weeks earlier than planned. This left 14 U.S. BCTs or BCT-equivalents in Iraq, highlighting the challenges of maintaining continuity and expertise in the face of evolving mission requirements. Army V Corps was not initially tasked with serving as the post-war task force headquarters, with no set timeline for the commitment. After major combat operations ended, some members of the 3rd Infantry Division expressed a desire to redeploy. Changes in the security situation on the ground have led to decisions to extend deployments, such as in April 2004 when Muqtada al-Sadr and his militia prompted a dramatic example. In 2004, Muqtada al-Sadr and his militia staged uprisings in southern Iraq, while Fallujah was volatile. The 1st Armored Division was extended by 90 days and deployed to southern cities. In 2007, the Department of Defense announced new rotation policy goals for active and Reserve Component units. In April 2008, President Bush announced that active component Army units deploying after August 1, 2008, would deploy for 12 months instead of 15, with a goal of five years between deployments. OIF has been a multinational effort with varying contributions from coalition partner countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland. During the post-major combat period of the Iraq War, coalition forces saw a peak in contributions from various countries. However, many countries later withdrew their troops due to reasons such as perceived mission accomplishment or domestic political pressures. The Spanish troop withdrawal, triggered by the 2004 Madrid train bombings, is a notable example of this trend. In the aftermath of the Iraq War, several countries withdrew their troops, including Spain, Australia, Georgia, and Poland. The Spanish troop withdrawal was influenced by the 2004 Madrid train bombings, leading to a change in government and the decision to bring troops back home. Other countries also redeployed or reduced their forces in Iraq for various reasons. In October, Poland withdrew its remaining 900 soldiers from Qadisiyah province in southern Iraq. In December, the Republic of Korea concluded its deployment in northern Iraq. The United Kingdom had approximately 4,100 troops in Basra but planned to reduce to 400 by summer 2009. The UN mandate expiration in December 2008 led to most coalition partners either negotiating a status of forces agreement with Iraq or withdrawing their forces. In December, the GoI signed agreements with the UK and Australian governments, allowing their troops to stay in Iraq for the first six months of 2009. Romania also reached an agreement to continue deploying 350 troops, while Estonia and El Salvador decided to withdraw their forces. Additionally, NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) had staff from 14 countries in theater. NATO reached an agreement with the GoI to extend specific NTM-I missions until July 2009. The security situation in Iraq is complex and constantly changing, with violence peaking in 2005 and 2006 before tapering off in 2008. Iraqi people often have to make pragmatic decisions about their protection and interests. In 2005 and 2006, violence peaked in Iraq before tapering off in 2008. The insurgency strength declined, with terrorism by Sunni Arabs, including Al Qaeda in Iraq, being a major form of violence. The network includes financiers, planners, and recruits for attacks, capitalizing on under-employment and disaffection in Iraq. The AQI network in Iraq capitalized on porous borders and lack of opportunities, with safe houses and communication lines. Foreign fighters flowed from Syria into Iraq, with AQI adapting quickly to changing circumstances. Pushed out of urban areas, they sought refuge in rural settings like Diyala and Ninewah provinces. In early 2008, AQI elements regrouped in Mosul but were pushed out by coalition and Iraqi operations. By August 2008, U.S. commanders assessed AQI as in disarray but still capable of spectacular attacks. AQI increasingly used \"surgical\" attacks like sniper attacks and intimidation tactics. In Anbar province, where security progress was achieved earlier, popular support for AQI had sharply diminished, forcing them to operate clandestinely. As of the end of 2008, DOD assessed that AQI retained limited freedom of movement. As of the end of 2008, DOD assessed that AQI retained limited freedom of movement in rural and urban areas, with intent and ability to carry out high-profile attacks in key urban centers. Mosul was identified as a logistical hub for AQI operations. In early 2009, a viable insurgency was still present in Mosul, with attacks on U.S. troops by individuals in Iraqi police uniforms. AQI maintained the intent and capability to carry out spectacular attacks, while Shi'a militias also contributed to post-Saddam Iraq violence. Muqtada al-Sadr, a prominent Shi'a cleric, has been a central figure in the conflict. Muqtada al-Sadr, a young Shi'a cleric, led the Jaish al-Mahdi militia in violent uprisings against the coalition forces in southern Iraq in April 2004. Despite his opposition to the U.S. presence, he declared a ceasefire in 2007 and shifted focus to social and political activities by 2008. Muqtada al-Sadr led the Jaish al-Mahdi militia in uprisings against coalition forces in 2004. In 2008, he supported the Iraqi government and urged followers to avoid harming civilians. Some rogue elements continued violence despite Sadr's ceasefire call. Sadr called for renegade members to return and created a new armed wing within his movement. Muqtada al-Sadr created a new armed wing within his movement, the Promised Day Brigade, and some Shiite extremists fled to Iran during Iraqi-led military operations in southern Iraq. Despite Iran's pledge to reduce aid, Shiite extremist groups like AAH and Ketaib Hezbollah continued to receive support and improved training from Iran as of March 2009. As of August 2008, cross-border smuggling, including lethal aid and consumer goods, was prominent along the border of Maysan province. Quds forces were still training Iraqi Shiite extremists, with infiltrations for potential attacks ongoing. There were concerns that special groups might try to regain influence in Iraq with Iranian assistance. In March 2009, Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani stated that Shiite militants were regrouping in Baghdad and southern Iraq with help from Iran. The Iranian government seeks influence among Iraqi Shi'a through soft power tactics like fostering relationships with political leaders and providing social services. Militant activities in southern Iraq and Baghdad occur amidst an intra-Shi'a struggle. The power struggle in Iraq and Baghdad involves a deeply rooted intra-Shi'a struggle for power and resources. Key players include Prime Minister Maliki's Da'wa party, the Islamic Supreme Council in Iraq (ISCI), and smaller Shi'a political parties backed by militias. Additionally, southern tribal leaders are emerging as new voices in the power struggle. In 2008, Prime Minister Maliki aimed to establish tribal support councils in Shi'a-populated areas of Iraq to address tribal needs. This initiative expanded to mixed-population provinces, sparking protests from officials who saw it as a political strategy. The power struggle in Iraq involves various Shi'a factions vying for influence, including Maliki's Da'wa party and tribal leaders. In April 2008, a moratorium expired on a 2006 law on federalism in southern Iraq, with Shi'a groups advocating for regionalization. Efforts to seek regionalization of Basra province failed in 2008. Iranian interest in regional grouping of southern Iraq was also noted. The 2009 elections in Iraq carried the potential for violence as many incumbents feared lack of popular support. Prime Minister Maliki's Da'wa party gained more representation in southern provinces, reshuffling political power. Coalition-building will be necessary for governance due to no clear majorities. Iraq has long struggled with sectarian violence. Sectarian violence in Iraq escalated in February 2006 after the bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, leading to reprisals and further attacks by armed groups. The displacement of Iraqis from their homes due to sectarian violence resulted in greater segregation in urban areas. As of late 2008, there were nearly 2.8 million internally displaced persons. The High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that by late 2008, there were around 2.8 million internally displaced persons in Iraq. Challenges of displacement are worsened by sectarian and class-based differences, with some facing difficulties accessing resettlement and restitution initiatives. Opportunistic criminality, driven by material gain rather than political motives, thrives due to Iraq's weak judicial system and law enforcement. Since major combat, coalition forces in Iraq have dealt with two Foreign Terrorist Organizations, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and another group, causing concern for Iraq's neighbors. The PKK aims to establish an independent Kurdish state and operates from northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, targeting Turkish security forces. This has been a significant focus for MNF-I staff in Iraq and senior leaders in Washington, D.C. Since 2003, the Turkish government has taken action against PKK members in northern Iraq with support from the U.S. and Iraqi governments. In 2007 and 2008, Turkey conducted cross-border military actions against the PKK in northern Iraq, despite objections from Iraqi government officials. In 2008, Turkey conducted air and ground attacks on PKK positions in northern Iraq, with U.S. support. Turkish forces launched additional strikes in response to PKK attacks, leading to a trilateral forum between the U.S., Iraq, and Turkey to coordinate activities. Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Baghdad in 2009, marking the first visit by a Turkish head of state in 30 years. During the Iraq visit, Iraqi President called on PKK to disarm or leave, which was rejected by PKK representatives. CJTF-7 and CPA focused on the Mujahedin-e Khalq, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, with some U.S. officials considering using them against Tehran. During the Iraq visit, Iraqi President called on PKK to disarm or leave, which was rejected by PKK representatives. CJTF-7 and CPA focused on the Mujahedin-e Khalq, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, with some U.S. officials considering using them against Tehran. Officials have considered using the MeK as leverage against Tehran. Members of Congress signed letters supporting the MeK in 2000. U.S. Special Operations Forces signed a ceasefire agreement with MeK leaders during OIF major combat operations. MeK members were brought under coalition control at Camp Ashraf in Diyala province. Efforts were made to ensure MeK compliance to prevent large-scale operational requirements. Efforts have been made to determine the future of MeK members in Iraq, facing obstacles due to reluctance from some countries to accept them and MeK members' fear of persecution in Iran. The Iraqi government has started transitioning control of the MeK camp to Iraqi security forces, aiming for sovereignty over any groups within the country. The Iraqi government took control of the outer perimeter around Camp Ashraf from U.S. forces in 2009. The government intended to close the facility, with National Security Advisor Dr. Mowaffaq al-Rubaie stating that members of the group must return to Iran or choose another country. Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei expressed impatience for the expulsion of the group. The U.S. military strategy in Iraq has evolved over time to support national objectives, drawing lessons from operational experience. The Administration's strategic goals have remained consistent, with a focus on political, economic, and diplomatic activities. Commanders and decision-makers have adapted their views on achieving security in Iraq, leading to key episodes and turning-points in the theory and practice of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The review of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) military operations highlights key episodes and turning-points in the application of counter-insurgency (COIN) theory and practice. The identification of the \"kind of war\" in OIF proved challenging for senior Bush Administration officials and military leaders, impacting the tools selected to prosecute it. Administration officials and military leaders struggled to define the nature of the war in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). General John Abizaid described it as a \"classical guerrilla-type campaign,\" while Secretary Rumsfeld avoided using the term \"guerrilla war.\" In Iraq, there were \"looters, criminals, remnants of the Ba'athist regime, foreign terrorists, and those influenced by Iran.\" By July 2003, it was recognized as an insurgency. The Pentagon resisted the terminology of \"insurgency,\" with General Peter Pace using the term \"insurgent\" in November 2005. During the formal occupation of Iraq from 2003 to 2004, the military command CJTF-7 focused on establishing \"security\" through political, economic, essential services, and security efforts to gain popular support. CJTF-7's strategy in Iraq from 2003 to 2005 focused on four main areas: governance, economic development, essential services, and security. The approach involved pursuing these lines of operation simultaneously to achieve mutual reinforcement. Major General Peter Chiarelli argued against prioritizing security over the other areas, emphasizing the need for a sustainable infrastructure and strong government alongside security efforts. In the \"security\" line of operation, military operations under CJTF-7 focused on aggressive combat operations to detain Iraqis, leading to popular frustration. The release of graphic photos of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib in April 2004 shocked many and may have fueled the insurgency. Counter-insurgency practices included creating \"gated communities\" for population control. Saddam's hometown of al-Awja was controlled through strict measures like fencing, check-points, and ID cards. Military operations aimed to be less hostile by using \"cordon and knock\" instead of \"cordon and search.\" The presence of U.S. forces in Iraq was seen as an \"antibody\" in society to prevent insurgents from gaining popular support. The focus was on quickly transitioning to an \"overwatch\" posture and building up Iraqi security forces. The military command in Iraq focused on building up Iraqi security forces and working with them to address essential services concerns. They created Task Forces for restoring Iraqi electricity and oil, and launched the Commanders Emergency Response Program to jumpstart local economies. The military command in Iraq launched the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP) to support small-scale projects initiated by local community leaders. Commanders worked with Iraqi interlocutors to address urgent reconstruction and humanitarian priorities, as official Iraqi agencies were not intact. By June 2004, the security situation had worsened due to unrest in Fallujah and al-Sadr-led uprisings. Throughout the south, the implementation of civilian-led or military-led lines of operation during the formal occupation of Iraq was hindered by a lack of personnel and resources. GEN Abizaid's goal of reducing the presence of U.S. forces in Iraqi society was not achieved, as Iraqi security forces training efforts were still in early stages. CJTF-7's assumption that establishing security required all lines of operation simultaneously may not have been fully tested. Operation Phantom Fury in Fallujah in November 2004 showcased the challenges of countering the Sunni Arab insurgency and the complexities of coalition military efforts. During major combat operations and the early part of the formal occupation in Iraq, coalition forces in Al Anbar province faced challenges in countering the Arab insurgency. The military command's approach of quick unit shuffling hindered the establishment of local relationships critical for counter-insurgency efforts, especially in a region where social structure is based on powerful tribal affiliations. Special Operations Forces were primarily deployed in Al Anbar initially, with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment later taking responsibility for the province in fall 2003. In fall 2003, the 82nd Airborne Division and subordinate units arrived in Iraq and were briefly assigned to Al Anbar province before handing off responsibility to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. The city of Fallujah, predominantly Sunni Arab, had special privileges under the old Iraqi regime and produced senior leaders in security forces. Concerns arose among residents about their future in post-Saddam Iraq after four American contractors were ambushed, killed, and their bodies mutilated in Fallujah on March 31, 2004. In April 2004, there were high-level deliberations in Baghdad and Washington regarding the appropriate response to the situation in Fallujah. Initial calls for military action were tempered by concerns about potential reactions and casualties. The Administration ultimately decided to respect Iraqi leaders' concerns and avoid sending US military forces into Fallujah. In April 2004, high-level deliberations in Baghdad and Washington discussed the response to Fallujah. Concerns about potential reactions and casualties led to a decision to avoid sending US military forces into the city. Negotiations with Fallujah community representatives led to the formation of the Fallujah Brigade, but it collapsed in the summer, allowing insurgents to strengthen their hold. Operation Phantom Fury was launched in November 2004 by IMEF to address the situation. The Fallujah operations in November 2004 involved a coalition force including UK, Iraqi, and US Marine and Army battalions. Most residents evacuated the city, leaving behind around 500 hardcore fighters who used asymmetrical tactics against the larger force. The operation aimed to eliminate insurgency before key Iraqi elections in January 2005. The Fallujah operation in November 2004 involved a coalition force with Iraqi and US Marine and Army battalions. It included 540 air strikes, 14,000 artillery and mortar shells fired, and 2,500 tank main gun rounds fired. The city suffered significant damage, with 18,000 buildings destroyed out of 39,000. Security measures were implemented, including vehicle searches and biometric scans of male residents. Despite the destruction, only half of the original population had returned by spring 2005, with disrupted services and damaged property. The operation's lasting impact was questioned, as Al Qaeda affiliates gradually resurfaced. The comprehensive \"clearing\" in Fallujah was not lasting as Al Qaeda affiliates gradually returned and made it a stronghold. In 2005, military operations in Tal Afar marked a successful application of counter-insurgency approaches in OIF, leading to the birth of a new Iraq policy lexicon in Washington. Tal Afar, located in Ninewah province, had a mixed population and was a key area for COIN practices. In 2005, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment arrived in Tal Afar, a base for former regime elements and Sunni extremists. Colonel H.R. McMaster, familiar with OIF issues, led the regiment after serving at CENTCOM. In early 2005, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, led by Colonel H.R. McMaster, prepared for deployment in Iraq by studying COIN approaches, training in Arabic, and focusing on \"population security\" to secure the population and allow for development. In early 2005, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, led by Colonel H.R. McMaster, took a deliberate approach to the problem in Iraq. They beefed up security along the Syrian border, targeted enemy safe havens, and constructed a dirt berm around Tal Afar. Before launching full-scale operations in September 2005, civilians were urged to leave the city. The Regiment cleared Tal Afar block by block, then set up 29 patrol bases around town, basing coalition forces among the population, which was an unusual approach at the time. Operating Bases (FOBs) were established by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Iraq, separate from the local population to avoid antagonizing them. Close collaboration with Iraqi security forces, particularly the 3rd Iraqi Army Division, was crucial for their counterinsurgency strategy. Popular support was key to their success in Fallujah, with active cooperation from a large percentage of the population. The use of the \"clear and hold\" approach, reminiscent of General Creighton Abrams in Vietnam, was emphasized by COL McMaster. In October 2005, the Administration adopted the \"clear, hold, build\" strategy for Iraq, emphasizing clearing areas from insurgent control, holding them securely, and building national Iraqi institutions. President Bush echoed this language in a Veterans Day speech, and a new National Strategy for Victory in Iraq was issued the following month, focusing on security, political, and economic tracks for success. The new Strategy for Victory in Iraq adopted the \"clear, hold, build\" strategy in October 2005, focusing on security, political, and economic tracks for success. The strategy emphasized pursuing these tracks simultaneously, with progress in each reinforcing progress in the others. \"Clear, hold, build\" was prescribed for the security track, while the political and economic tracks also had their own trinitarian set of approaches. \"Build\" in the security track referred to Iraqi security forces and local institutions, reflecting a focus on national-level institutions. In March 2006, the official narrative emerged confirming the success of the \"clear, hold, build\" strategy in Tal Afar, showcasing the interdependence of political, security, and economic tracks. This strategy was further implemented in Baghdad through \"Operation Together Forward\" in June 2006, aiming to reduce violence and enhance security with the deployment of 48 battalions totaling 51,000 troops. Operation Together Forward in June 2006 involved 48 battalions totaling 51,000 troops, including Iraqi and coalition forces. The focus was on security measures such as clearing operations, extended curfews, and more police patrols. The effort aimed to reduce violence and enhance security, with Iraqi forces leading the operations supported by the coalition. Operation Together Forward in June 2006 involved 48 battalions totaling 51,000 troops, including Iraqi and coalition forces. MNF-I stated publicly that the operation was expected to take months. Levels of violence in the capital rose as insurgents fought back hard after areas were cleared. Lack of sufficient forces to hold cleared areas was a challenge, with Iraqi forces still developing their capabilities. MNF-I Spokesman noted that Iraqi security forces were not yet able to assume complete control of the situation. By October 2006, MNF-I admitted that Operation Together Forward had not met expectations of reducing violence in Iraq. A \"New Way Forward\" strategy was pursued due to continued high levels of violence despite previous efforts. The \"New Way Forward\" strategy in Iraq introduced a new theory focusing on security as a prerequisite for progress in political and economic areas. This shift in strategy emphasized the importance of security as the most urgent priority for success in Iraq. The \"New Way Forward\" strategy in Iraq emphasized security as crucial for progress in political and economic areas. General David Petraeus believed that improved security would lead to economic growth and government stability. By 2008, this approach had gained widespread support among practitioners and observers. The basic premise of the New Way Forward strategy in Iraq, emphasizing the importance of security for political progress, had broad support among practitioners and observers. Key figures like General James Conway and General James Jones highlighted the complex relationship between security and political reconciliation in Iraq. President Bush announced the deployment of additional military units to help implement the strategy in January 2007. The United States deployed additional military units to Iraq, primarily to Baghdad, as part of the New Way Forward strategy. The mission was to clear and secure neighborhoods, protect the local population, and ensure Iraqi forces could provide security. The surge forces included five Brigade Combat Teams, an Army combat aviation brigade, a Marine Expeditionary Unit, two Marine infantry battalions, a Division headquarters, and support troops. The number of U.S. forces peaked at 168,000 in October 2007, with an increase in civilian-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The Fact Sheet highlighted the importance of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in the President's 'New Way Forward' Strategy during the surge operations in Iraq. The focus shifted to population security, while still training Iraqi security forces for eventual transition of responsibilities. Division Commanders were advised to be patient and not rush the transition to Iraqi forces during the surge in early 2008. During the surge operations in Iraq, the focus shifted to population security as outlined in the January 2008 mission statement of one division. The surge aimed to establish sustainable security through collaboration with Iraqi security forces and the provincial government, neutralizing insurgents and defeating terrorists. Emphasis was placed on population control using concrete barriers, checkpoints, curfews, and biometric technologies for identification. Key Baghdad neighborhoods were entirely sealed off using these approaches in April 2007. In 2007, key Baghdad neighborhoods were sealed off as \"gated communities\" to protect the population from terrorist attacks. The controls made it difficult for infiltrators and provided added protection, although some citizens initially expressed dismay. By early 2008, Iraqi residents were pleased with the security measures for keeping out threats. The surge strategy in Iraq involved getting troops out of large Forward Operating Bases and into local communities to live and work among the population, aiming to secure the population by building partnerships and trust with Iraqis. During the surge in Iraq, coalition forces established small combat outposts (COPs) and joint security stations (JSSs) in populated areas to secure the population by building relationships with local communities. General Petraeus emphasized the importance of these bases in developing trust with the local population. During the surge in Iraq, coalition forces created combat outposts and joint security stations to secure the population by clearing, holding, and building areas. This strategy aimed to prevent insurgents from returning to cleared neighborhoods, with a focus on maintaining control to facilitate the build phase of operations. General Petraeus highlighted the significance of these bases in fostering trust with local communities. During the surge in Iraq, coalition forces established combat outposts and joint security stations to secure neighborhoods and facilitate the build phase of operations. President Bush announced the lifting of political restrictions on operations, allowing Iraqi and coalition forces to enter neighborhoods previously off-limits due to political and sectarian interference. During the surge in Iraq, coalition forces were given the green light to enter neighborhoods previously off-limits. Major combined operations were launched in 2007, focusing on population security in Baghdad. The plan involved clearing out extremists and controlling and retaining the areas. During the surge in Iraq, coalition forces were authorized to enter previously restricted neighborhoods in 2007. The operation focused on population security in Baghdad, with the goal of clearing out extremists, controlling neighborhoods with a full-time presence, and retaining security with Iraqi forces. Specific targets included Al Qaeda in Iraq and rogue Shi'a militia elements. Baghdad encompassed surrounding areas providing bases for Sunni and Shi'a extremists, requiring coalition forces to cover major supply lines leading into the capital. During the surge in Iraq, coalition forces increased their presence in Baghdad and its surrounding areas in 2007. New division headquarters were established to cover parts of Baghdad province and other provinces south of Baghdad. A series of operations, including Phantom Thunder, Phantom Strike, and Phantom Phoenix, were launched in coordination with Iraqi counterparts. These operations involved division- and brigade-level actions across Iraq, with close coordination with U.S. Special Operations Forces and Iraqi military and police forces. The city of Baghdad was the main focus of these operations. During the surge in Iraq in 2007, coalition forces increased their presence in Baghdad and its surrounding areas. The city of Baghdad was the main focus of operations, with a strong presence of AQI and JAM special groups. Corps-level operations led by the 4th Infantry Division focused on clearing the city and establishing a strong presence in each neighborhood. Multi-National Division-Center, led by 3ID, focused on clearing restive areas south of Baghdad along the Tigris River. The Division-Center, led by 3ID, focused on clearing restive areas like Salman Pak and Arab Jabour, as progress was made. AQI affiliates pushed out of Baghdad relocated to Baquba, renamed as the new \"capital of the Islamic State of Iraq.\" MND-North, led by 1st Armored Division, cleared areas where AQI sought refuge, pushing them east into the Diyala River Valley near Muqtadiyah. Operations in Diyala with Iraqi 5th Army Division uncovered major weapons. In Al Anbar province, the Multi-National Force-West, led by II Marine Expeditionary Force, targeted AQI concentration around Lake Thar Thar. Coalition and Iraqi forces focused on eliminating AQI remnants in rural areas. Operations in 2008 saw growing ISF capabilities and assertiveness of the GoI in employing the ISF against Al Qaeda in Iraq affiliates and extremist Shi'a militia members. In 2008, operations pushed AQI out of Anbar and Baghdad to the east and north. AQI members tried to establish Mosul as their stronghold due to its strategic location and mixed population. Ninewah province provided geographic advantages and a volatile population mix, making it a key area for AQI affiliates. In January 2008, Prime Minister Maliki announced a major offensive against AQI in Mosul, establishing the Ninewah Operations Command. Despite delays, ISF launched clearing operations and secured Mosul. In October 2008, U.S. and Iraqi forces dealt a significant blow to AQI by killing Abu Qaswarah, the senior AQI emir of northern Iraq. In 2008, U.S. and Iraqi forces targeted AQI in Mosul by killing Abu Qaswarah, disrupting the AQI network significantly. Operations in Mosul benefitted from a task force formed by Multi-National Corp-Iraq in the Jazeera desert, facilitating the identification and interdiction of fighters. Operations in Diyala province in January 2008 had also driven AQI affiliates out. In January 2008, operations in Diyala province drove AQI affiliates out of major population centers into rural areas. ISF, supported by coalition forces, launched operations against AQI in Diyala in late July 2008. Prime Minister Maliki publicly stated the intention to launch operations, causing many \"bad guys\" to flee. U.S. support included blocking operations and air support. Iraqi security forces, with U.S. support, conducted operations in Diyala province, including rehearsals and joint planning. Iraqi Army showed proficiency in \"clearing\" but struggled with the \"hold\" phase due to insufficient planning and lack of police. In March 2008, a major operation, Sawlat al-Fursan (Charge of the Knights), was launched in Basra to target criminals. In Basra, Iraqi security forces, supported by the US, conducted operations targeting criminals. Muqtada al-Sadr loyalists accused the government of using armed forces influenced by ISCI to attack political rivals. UK forces in Basra were seen as catalysts for violence and later consolidated at the airport. In Basra, Iraqi security forces, supported by the US, conducted operations targeting criminals. The division reportedly made an accommodation with Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM) to limit its presence in the city. The launch of the \"Charge\" in March 2008 was seen as precipitate, with Iraqi forces not well-prepared for the magnitude of the challenge. Maliki may have been over-confident in the abilities of the ISF, applying considerable forces including 21 Iraqi Army battalions and 8. The ISF, supported by the US, faced fierce resistance in Basra from JAM-affiliated forces. Iraqi Minister of Defense was surprised by the level of resistance, requiring a change in plans. Without coalition assistance, the operation would have been in jeopardy. Prime Minister Maliki's reputation was at stake, and the government's collapse was a possibility if the operation failed. The coalition support in Basra included embedded transition teams, air strikes, and air lift. Some ISF units performed competently, while others collapsed under pressure. Over 1,000 ISF members laid down their weapons, leading to the dismissal of 500 Iraqi Army Soldiers and 421 Iraqi Police members. The security situation improved after the operations, with the ISF regaining freedom of movement. The main challenge now was to address criminal activities. The main challenge now was to act against criminals and outlaws. In March 2008, JAM elements targeted coalition and Iraqi forces in Baghdad, particularly from Sadr City. U.S. and Iraqi forces launched operations to quell the attacks, dragging Iraqi security forces to engage in the fight. After two months of pressure, the fight in Sadr City ended. The fight in Sadr City ended in May 2008 with a deal allowing ISF access, ending rocket attacks, and removing explosives. JAM forces were not disbanded, but ISF regained freedom of movement. In June 2008, ISF cleared weapons caches in Amarah with little resistance. In Amarah, ISF found weapons caches with help from locals, provided humanitarian aid, and initiated a temporary employment program. IEDs are a major threat in Iraq, leading to changes in coalition operations. The Department of Defense and military command in Iraq prioritize countering IEDs, with efforts focused on attacking the network of emplacers, financiers, and strategists. The Joint IED Defeat Organization facilitates the development of new technologies to combat these threats. The Multi-National Corps-Iraq and its divisions work with experts from JIEDDO to combat enemy IED use by sharing information, providing training on counter-IED technology, and analyzing found IEDs. Enemy IED incidents decreased significantly from 2007 to 2008, with most incidents involving unsophisticated devices. Enemy IED use shows cycles of innovation. Enemy IED use shows cycles of innovation, with trends in different types of IEDs emerging and diminishing over time. In late 2007, concerns were focused on explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) and improvised rocket-assisted mortars (IRAMs), which had indiscriminate and catastrophic effects. By mid-2008, \"building-borne IEDs\" became more common, highlighting the need for operatives to blend in with the local population. The success in countering IEDs is attributed to the Iraqi population turning against these efforts. U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) have played a crucial role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, targeting key enemy leaders. SOF work closely with conventional forces, relying on their detailed knowledge of the battle space. After SOF actions, conventional forces and Iraqi forces remain to \"hold\" the area. Most media coverage of the counter-insurgency effort in Iraq focuses on ground forces like the Army and Marine Corps. Air power has played a significant role in the OIF counter-insurgency effort in Iraq, providing critical ISR capabilities and facilitating troop mobility. The role of air power has evolved over time, with a notable increase in the kinetic use of air power. Defense expert Anthony Cordesman highlighted its growing importance, and statistics show a sharp spike in the number of weapons dropped from fighters and bombers after the surge troops arrived in Iraq. The use of air power in Iraq increased significantly after the surge troops arrived, with a sharp spike in the number of weapons dropped. Statistics from 2004 to 2007 show a steady rise in close air support strikes, with the heaviest demand during the initial surge period. Maj. Gen. Edgington highlighted the importance of close air support in Iraq, especially during coordinated air/ground operations. The surge in air power usage in Iraq was primarily driven by the increased number of U.S. troops working closely with Iraqi counterparts. This led to better target identification, with a shift towards targeting deeply buried IEDs by January 2008. However, some experts question the use of kinetic air power due to the risk of civilian casualties fueling insurgency. Commanders emphasize the importance of minimizing civilian casualties to prevent antagonisms towards the United States. In December 2007, Anthony Cordesman assessed the use of air power in Iraq and Afghanistan, noting considerable restraint. U.S. commanders highlight the increased availability of air assets, including more full-motion video assets in 2008. These assets were crucial in supporting combined coalition and Iraqi operations on the ground, such as the Basra operations in March 2008. In March 2008, U.S. transition teams embedded with Iraqi units in Basra relied on ISR and kinetic air support. The Sadr City operations in Baghdad faced challenges due to civilian presence and frequent attacks. Success was attributed to pushing air asset control to lower levels in the U.S. chain of command, providing commanders with multiple options for targeting. The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) consisted of Army, Navy, and Air Force under the Ministry of Defense, Iraqi Police Service, National Police, Department of Border Enforcement under the Ministry of Interior, Facilities Protection Service, and Iraqi Special Operations Forces. Developing ISF and security Ministries is crucial for U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, evolving in response to events and changes in strategy. Iraq's pre-war security forces were not available after major challenges. Pre-war planning in Iraq had assumed that local police and military units would be available for security after major combat, but they effectively disappeared. The need for security providers with an \"Iraqi face\" was stressed, but civilian law enforcement bodies and military units were not available as expected. After the war, the Coalition Provisional Authority dissolved all Iraqi military services, including the Army, which hindered the option of unit recall for security or reconstruction. However, the Kurds in northern Iraq and the Shi'a Arab political party SCIRI maintained well-trained forces like the pesh merga and Badr Corps, respectively. During the formal occupation of Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority faced the challenge of incorporating well-trained militias like the Badr Corps and pesh merga into official Iraqi security structures. Limited long-term strategic planning and resources hindered the training of Iraqi security forces by the CPA. The CPA Ministry of the Interior office, led by Bernard Kerik, focused on rebuilding the Baghdad Police Academy and re-training Iraqi police officers. Limited resources and staff hindered their efforts, while military units initiated their own police re-training initiatives in different areas of Iraq. The CPA Ministry of the Interior office, led by Bernard Kerik, focused on rebuilding the Baghdad Police Academy and re-training Iraqi police officers. Meanwhile, Ambassador Bremer instructed CJTF-7 to cease police recruiting and directed the creation of the New Iraqi Army (NIA) under the supervision of Walt Slocombe. The training effort, led by Major General Paul Eaton, aimed to recruit and train Iraqi soldiers battalion-by-battalion, with the goal of creating 27 battalions in one year. In early September 2003, the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) was established as a security and emergency service agency for Iraq under LTG Sanchez's development. Division Commanders launched recruiting and training programs for the ICDC with support from CERP funding. The ISF training efforts for the police, NIA, and ICDC proceeded separately without integrated strategic planning. President Bush issued NSPD 36 on May 11, 2004, assigning CENTCOM the mission of organizing, training, and equipping all Iraqi security forces, including civilian police. This directive aimed to coordinate all U.S. and international efforts in Iraq under the newly created MNSTC-I headquarters. Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I) was established to unify Iraqi security forces training under one lead in Iraq. The Commanding General also leads the NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I), providing training, equipment assistance, and technical advice. MNSTC-I's initiatives include building a Non-Commissioned Officer Corps for the Iraqi Army and updating the skills of Iraq's National Police with help from Italy's Carabinieri. The MNSTC-I was tasked with updating the skills and training of Iraq's National Police and mentoring Ministries of Defense and Interior. Transition teams were embedded with Iraqi military units to train and advise them, a strategy that grew under different commanding generals. The strategic intent of the training mission has evolved over time towards transition. The MNSTC-I's goal was to transition security responsibility to Iraqis, allowing U.S. forces to go home sooner. The focus shifted in 2007 to emphasize population security before complete transition. Iraqi units worked with U.S. counterparts to improve their skills for providing security. Under MNF-I, Iraqi units practice skills for independent operation with U.S. counterparts. MNSTC-I works on generating and replenishing ISF, improving quality, and supporting security ministries' institutional capacity development. MNSTC-I shares responsibilities with MNC-I, which focuses on operational management and transition teams embedding with Iraqi Army, Border Enforcement, and National Police. Under MNC-I, the Iraq Assistance Group (IAG) coordinates with Iraqi Security Forces and transition teams. Transition teams were attached to brigade combat teams in mid-2007 for better command unity. The IAG ensures training and support for transition teams throughout Iraq. The Iraq Assistance Group (IAG) coordinates with Iraqi Security Forces and transition teams, providing training, equipment, and support for their Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration (RSOI) in Iraq. The IAG also supports transition teams working with Iraqi headquarters staffs and is involved in creating an Iraqi Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Corps. MNSTC-I is expected to transition into an Office of Security Cooperation focused on mil-to-mil partnership activities and capacity-building in security ministries. The Advise and Assist Brigades are set to form the transitional force responsible for advising the Iraqi Army, while MNSTC-I may partner with other ISF forces. Transition teams play a crucial role in training and mentoring Iraqi forces, providing access to Coalition capabilities and situational awareness. They work with various Iraqi military and police units, operational headquarters, and security forces. In 2008, the embedded advisory effort in Iraq was dynamic, shifting focus from basic skills to more sophisticated capabilities and from lower-level units to higher-level headquarters. The training teams worked with Iraqi military and police units, with some units graduating from the need for embedded advisors while others were just entering into partnerships. The Ministry of Interior forces were also part of the training efforts. As of August 2008, there were 27 border transition teams and 41 National Police Transition Teams working with Iraqi forces. Additionally, there were 223 Police Transition Teams partnering with Iraqi police at various levels, supported by U.S. Military Police brigade and civilian International Police Advisors. About 400 IPAs were deployed in Iraq for training and support. 400 IPAs were deployed in Iraq for training and support, with some observers suggesting the expansion of the program. U.S. military officials caution that not all IPAs have relevant backgrounds for training civilian law enforcement personnel. Approaches to police training varied by U.S. battle space in Iraq, with different strategies implemented in Anbar province by Multi-National Force-West. In mid-2008, the focus of police training in Iraq shifted towards professionalizing the force, with emphasis on higher-end skills like police intelligence and forensics. MNF-W brought in experts from the Royal Irish Constabulary to assist with this new focus. Additionally, the Iraqi Navy received support from a Maritime Strategic Transition Team and a Naval Transition Team, while the Coalition Air Force Transition Team provided advisory teams. The Coalition Air Force Transition Team (CAFTT) provides advisory teams to the Iraqi Air Staff and individual squadrons at the Umm Qasr Naval Base. As of September 2008, there were 183 Military Transition Teams (MiTTs) working with Iraqi units from battalion to division level. The MiTTs consist of small teams with a wide array of specializations, including intelligence, logistics, communications, and medical expertise. MNF-W preferred larger MiTTs with 30 to 40 people, and U.S. Army MiTTs have also been augmented to form larger teams. In 2008, the focus of Iraqi Army training shifted to enablers like logistics. MNC-I created Logistics Transition Assistance Teams (LTATs) to develop Iraqi Army logistics capabilities. U.S. commanders emphasized the need for combat enablers and advisory efforts shifted to Iraqi brigade and division levels. The rhetoric also shifted from \"training\" to \"advising.\" The methodology for forming and preparing MiTTs has evolved significantly. Initially, teams were quickly assembled without specific standards, but later a consolidated training program was established at Ft. Riley, Kansas. Training included 72 days with inprocessing, theater orientation in Kuwait, and counter-insurgency training. The program for preparing Transition Team members improved significantly with training at Ft. Riley, Kansas, Kuwait, and Camp Taji, Iraq. The Marine Corps also established the Marine Corps Training and Advisory Group (MCTAG) to train and equip Marine Corps advisor and training teams. The Transition Team program selects individuals with recent command or combat experience for advisory roles in Iraq. Most teams are external, but 20% are internal, sourced from U.S. units in Iraq. The Army and DOD are debating future training requirements. In 2008, unit partnering was introduced alongside embedded transition teams. In 2008, unit partnering grew substantially as a one-to-one matching between U.S. and ISF units of similar size. This practice allows U.S. units to demonstrate how headquarters function and coordinate efforts, providing valuable lessons to their Iraqi partners. Unit partnering was described as more energizing than transition teams by some commanders. Colonel Mike Kershaw utilized unit partnering in 2007 in Mahmudiyah and Yusufiyah south of Baghdad. In 2008, Colonel Mike Kershaw tasked his field artillery battalion to embed with the 4th Brigade of the 6th Iraqi Army Division in Yusufiyah south of Baghdad. The partnership between U.S. and Iraqi forces showed positive results in enhancing Iraqi operational capabilities. Unit partnering became more common, with U.S. brigades assigned to partner with Iraqi Army divisions in their respective battle spaces. In 2008, U.S. brigades were assigned to partner with Iraqi Army divisions in their battle spaces. Unit partnering involved partnering at various levels, from brigades to squads and platoons. Some U.S. units also partnered with other Iraqi security forces, such as the police in Baghdad. However, unit partnering was resource-intensive and not always possible due to operational requirements. Unit partnering with Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) in their battle space is a dynamic endeavor aimed at boosting Iraqi units' capabilities. As of early 2009, ISF units were at varied stages of development, with some proficient and others newly formed. Unit partnership requires a robust U.S. forces presence, which may become more challenging as U.S. forces draw down in Iraq. U.S. commanders institutionalized unit partnerships in 2008 to maximize their remaining time in Iraq. In 2008, the Department of Defense reported approximately 615,000 members of the Iraqi Security Forces. The numbers of ISF, by category, were authorized, assigned, and trained, with some discrepancies due to various reasons like casualties or hirings at different levels. The overall numbers of ISF continue to grow based on revised estimates by the Government of Iraq. The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are expected to grow further in the future, with a target size of 600,000 to 650,000 by the end of 2010. Recent assessments show evidence of operational capabilities but raise questions about institutional capabilities. The Jones Commission's assessment in late 2007 highlighted the ISF's progress but doubted their ability to operate independently in the near future. General McCaffrey later noted some improvements in the ISF's operational contributions. By early 2008, U.S. commanders in Iraq noted significant improvements in the Iraqi Security Forces' operational capabilities, with the ISF now taking a major and successful independent role in the war. Division Commanders regularly reported on Iraqi forces carrying out operations unilaterally or with coalition support, showing increased competence and responsibility for their own turf. In fall 2008, U.S. commanders praised Iraqi forces' tactical capabilities in Basra, Mosul, and Sadr City. The ISF demonstrated the ability to conduct extensive operations independently, but still relied on the Coalition for logistics, fire support, and intelligence. Lieutenant General Frank Helmick noted the ISF's continuous improvement. The ISF in Iraq are improving but still rely on close partnership with U.S. forces. Iraqi views vary on ISF readiness, with some wanting U.S. combat forces to stay for five more years while others believe ISF are nearly ready to maintain security independently. Defense Minister Abd al-Qadir expects Iraq to have a fully independent security force. Defense Minister Abd al-Qadir expects Iraq to have a fully independent security force by 2011 or the beginning of 2012. The biggest long-term challenges for the Iraqi Security Forces are institutional, focusing on improving ministerial capacity, clarifying chains of command, and crafting integrated force modernization plans. MNF-I and MNSTC-I officials emphasize the critical importance of civilian ministerial capacity. DOD assessed that Iraqi civilians in key positions are crucial for decision-making and problem-solving. The Iraqi Security Forces are still facing challenges with untrained civilian personnel in key positions. The current chains of command reflect the government's counter-insurgency efforts, with operations commands reporting directly to the Prime Minister. This direct access has raised concerns about potential misuse of the forces for personal or sectarian purposes, creating tensions with provincial-level officials and parent ministries in Baghdad. The Iraqi Security Forces face challenges with untrained civilian personnel in key positions. Operations commands report directly to the Prime Minister, causing tensions with parent ministries in Baghdad. The IA-led commands create practical confusion as units rely on their parent organizations for support. Jointness at the tactical level is successful, but complications arise when units seek support from their respective ministries. Force modernization planning is a long-term challenge. The Iraqi Security Forces face challenges with force modernization planning and balancing near-term security needs with long-term requirements. The force is training for counter-insurgency operations against Sunni and Shi'a extremists, with plans to shift towards a division of labor where MoD forces focus externally and Iraqi police handle domestic security. Minister of Defense Abd al-Qadir emphasized the importance of the Iraqi police in providing security. The Iraqi Ministry of Defense is focused on purchasing equipment for a future force, including tanks and fighter aircraft. Concerns have been raised about their ability to identify, fund, and contract for future requirements, with some officials prioritizing cost over long-term maintenance and interoperability. In September 2008, the Ministry signed the first letters of offer and acceptance. In September 2008, the MoD signed the first letters of offer and acceptance (LOA) through the foreign military sales (FMS) program for M1A1 tanks, armored reconnaissance helicopters, and C-130J transport aircraft. Concerns have been raised about the size and scope of the ISF compared to other Iraqi government institutions, with some fearing the ISF's increasing power and potential threats to the unified state. The Iraqi Army (IA) has been steadily growing in size and capabilities, with 166 combat battalions conducting operations as of December 2009. By January 2009, the IA had 175 combat battalions, 13 infantry divisions, one mechanized division, and 55 brigades. The Iraq Study Group noted in December 2006 that the IA was making progress towards becoming a reliable fighting force. The Iraqi Army has shown progress in becoming a reliable and disciplined fighting force loyal to the national government. By September 2007, the Jones Commission reported that the Iraqi Army was increasingly effective at COIN and reliable, although progress among units was uneven. Coalition commanders noted further improvements in operational capabilities by the end of 2007. Major General Joseph Fil praised the Baghdad Operational Command in December 2007 for making good tactical decisions and planning intelligence-driven operations. By early 2008, Iraqi Army divisions were growing in size and capacity, with some units able to move independently across Iraq. The 3rd Brigade of the 1st Iraqi Army Division deployed from Al Anbar to Diyala in less than a week to support combat operations. This demonstrated important capabilities for Iraqi units to operate independently in the future. In August 2008, U.S. commanders praised the performance of Iraqi Army units in various operations, noting significant tactical proficiency. By early 2009, further growth in Iraqi Army capabilities and initiative was reported, with improvements in planning, executing operations, intelligence gathering, and civil-military operations. Iraqi brigade commanders were developing their own operational plans and leading their units effectively. The Iraqi Army faces challenges in developing strong leadership and key enablers like logistics. Commanders are increasingly operating independently and seeking specific help when needed. Leadership development is crucial but cannot be rushed due to the need for experience. The Iraqi Army's leadership challenge is more acute compared to other security forces, as noted by various reports highlighting the lack of seasoned leadership at all levels. The focus is on mid-level leadership, such as non-commissioned officers and field grade officers, to address the gap. Initiatives have been launched to improve the situation. The Iraqi Army has launched initiatives to address the lack of seasoned leadership, including accelerated officer commissioning for university graduates and recruitment of former Army officers and NCOs. The quality of IA leadership varies, with some Commanding Generals being praised for their effectiveness. Major General Oothman, Commanding General of the 8th IA Division, is highlighted as an impressive leader. In the IA, leadership selection processes vary in quality. Some choices are good, like the commanding general of the 17th IA division in 2008, while others are criticized for being politically connected rather than competent. Developing key enablers like intelligence and logistics is crucial for the Iraqi Army to operate independently. The Iraq Study Group and Jones Commission highlighted the Iraqi Army's lack of logistics and support. The Army relied on coalition forces for combat support and service. LTG Dubik admitted in 2008 that the Army couldn't fully sustain itself. By March 2008, the Army could feed itself, but maintenance backlog persisted. The Iraqi Army's logistics and maintenance backlog have been stabilized, with plans to develop a national-level maintenance and supply system. The National Depot at Taji is a key component, though completion has been delayed. LTG Helmick and LTG Austin both emphasized the importance of improving logistics for the Iraqi military. The Iraqi Army's logistics and maintenance backlog have been stabilized, with plans to develop a national-level maintenance and supply system. Iraqi counterparts acknowledge the need for improvement in logistics. The Iraqi Air Force is working towards increasing its personnel to 6,000 by December 2009. The Iraqi Air Force aims to grow to 6,000 personnel by December 2009, with a fleet of 123 aircraft. Despite being in the early stages of development, efforts to train pilots and maintenance personnel have been ongoing since 2007. The Iraqi Air Force training initially focused on counter-insurgency, but expanded to include air to ground attack and ISR capabilities by 2008. Progress was made in COIN capabilities like ISR and airlift, but ground attack, airspace control, and command and control capabilities were still lacking. The number of weekly sorties flown by the Iraqi Air Force increased to about 230 in August 2008. The Iraqi Air Force saw a decrease in weekly sorties in 2008 due to various challenges but later increased to over 350 sorties per week by March 2009. They provided support during Basra operations, transporting personnel, dropping leaflets, and assisting with ISR. The future capabilities and equipment needed by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense remain uncertain. The Iraqi Air Force is expected to focus on external threats and develop jet aircraft capabilities by 2011 or 2012. There are discussions about the necessary air defense capabilities versus fighter aircraft, with Iraqi Air Force leaders being former fighter pilots. The Iraqi Navy is still in early stages of development with approximately 2,000 assigned personnel out of 3,596 authorized. It includes former Iraqi Army soldiers forming the 2nd Iraqi Navy Marine Battalion based in Umm Qasr. The Iraqi Navy consists of one support squadron, two Marine battalions, and 15 vessels. Their missions include protecting Iraq's coastline and offshore assets, conducting patrols and ship boardings. They face challenges in expanding their fleet and have initiated partnerships with neighboring countries for joint patrols. The Iraqi Navy is preparing to double its fleet, facing challenges in crafting a future force vision. U.S. advisors note the Ministry's lack of priority for the Navy. Iraqi Special Operations Forces have 4,160 assigned personnel as of December 2008. The ISOF brigade, as of March 2009, consists of nine battalions including a counter-terrorism battalion and five commando battalions. The ISOF is highly competent, with a rigorous selection process and training conducted by U.S. SOF. It operates independently under the Counter-Terrorism Command and has been praised for its effectiveness by U.S. officials. The ISOF, under the Counter-Terrorism Command, is highly competent with nine battalions, including a counter-terrorism battalion and five commando battalions. Future challenges include integrating ISOF with Iraqi conventional forces and ensuring it is not misused for personal or political purposes. The ISOF aims to improve capabilities by seeking access to specialized assets like rotary air assets, ISR, and SIGINT. The Iraqi Police Service comprises patrol, station, and traffic police categories based on local principles. The Iraqi Police Service consists of patrol, station, and traffic police based on local recruitment. The future vision is for IPs to handle internal security while the Iraqi Army focuses on external threats. As of October 31, 2008, there were 300,156 IPs assigned out of 334,739 authorized, with a training backlog of over 90,000 personnel. This backlog has led to shortages in areas like Diyala province, where IPs were needed to \"hold\" cleared areas. The system has been overwhelmed, according to a senior U.S. official. The Iraqi Police Service is facing a training backlog, with over 90,000 personnel needing training. To address this, training has been condensed into shorter periods and accelerated processes are offered to recruits with degrees in other fields. Local recruitment from ethnically homogenous neighborhoods has shown improvement in IP capabilities, with many units effectively providing security and intelligence in their neighborhoods. U.S. military commanders have reported successful operations carried out by local units. The Iraqi Police Service has shown improved capabilities in planning and carrying out operations independently, with a focus on professionalization of the force. By early fall 2008, U.S. commanders noted their competency in basic skills, leading to a shift towards more advanced training and advisory efforts. In Baghdad, security responsibility was being handed over to the IPs neighborhood by neighborhood. In August 2008, U.S. commanders noted that the Iraqi Police Service (IPs) were considered \"Iraqi good enough.\" Iraqi Army commanders recognized the importance of IPs but still had doubts about their capabilities. Coordination between the Iraqi Army and IPs was seen as crucial for security. Concerns about infiltration of IPs by militia and insurgents persisted, posing serious challenges to their effectiveness. In August 2008, U.S. military officials confirmed terrorist and nationalist infiltration of the Iraqi Police Service (IPs). The Iraqi National Police (NPs) are being regionalized to establish a presence in all provinces except those of the KRG, providing backup for the IPs. As of early 2009, NP Divisions were based in Baghdad, Salah ad Din, and Basra, with plans to expand to other provinces. 18 of the 33 NP battalions were reported capable of independent operations by the Department of Defense in December 2008. As of January 2009, there were 43,000 National Police assigned, with 52,513 trained. Concerns about competence, corruption, and sectarian bias were raised, with the NPs being the most sectarian influenced organization in Iraq. The National Police have been deemed operationally ineffective due to sectarianism within its units. The Iraq Study Group and Jones Commission proposed solutions for the National Police's operational ineffectiveness. The Iraqi leadership opted to replace senior leaders and retrain personnel with the help of Italy's Carabinieri. The Carabinieri gradually increased training and advisory support to enhance the National Police's professionalization efforts. In early 2008, U.S. commanders in Iraq acknowledged serious problems with the National Police, noting mixed results from leadership changes and re-education efforts. Major General Hussein recognized challenges faced by the NPs, stating \"The National Police has two enemies\u2014the insurgency, and our own reputation.\" MNSTC-I accelerated the re-bluing process by increasing student capacity. U.S. commanders in Baghdad highlighted the varied effectiveness of NP brigades. The Iraqi National Police (NPs) are praised by U.S. commanders in Baghdad for their effectiveness. However, they face challenges in transitioning from a military role to policing. The Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) struggles to protect Iraq's borders due to a lack of trained personnel. The Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) in Iraq faces challenges due to a low level of training and lack of support from the Ministry of Interior. The DBE is described as \"stretched thin\" and has not shown significant progress in capabilities. The Iraqi Government's plan includes constructing border forts and increasing biometric scan systems. U.S. officials criticize the under-funding of the DBE, with examples of inadequate support such as providing money instead of fuel in some provinces. The Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) in Iraq faces challenges from corruption and infiltration by outside interests, leading to concerns about cross-border smuggling. In response, the Ports of Entry Directorate now reports directly to the Ministry of Interior. The Iraqi Oil Police (OP) protects oil infrastructure, with the Ministry of Interior handling salaries and sustainment, while the Ministry of Oil focuses on infrastructure development. Clarification of roles is needed to address these issues. The Iraqi Oil Police (OP) faces challenges with training, equipment, capacity, and corruption within the Ministry of Interior. Despite some improvements, there are still shortcomings in key ministry functions. The Ministry of Interior in Iraq has improved its planning ability but still lacks capacity to process personnel demands. To address this, they are expanding training centers and recalling former army and police officers for training. The absorption of the \"oil police\" in 2008 added pressure to the training system, highlighting issues of corruption and inefficiency. The Ministry of Interior in Iraq is facing challenges with corruption, as highlighted by various reports. Despite some efforts to combat internal corruption, the Ministry is still perceived as dysfunctional and sectarian. In 2007, over 6,000 investigations were opened, resulting in firings, disciplinary actions, and forced retirements. The Jones Commission in September 2007 criticized the Ministry of Defense for bureaucratic issues. Despite some progress noted by DOD in December 2008, logistical and sustainment capabilities remain a concern. MNF-I officials praised the MoD for progress compared to other Iraqi ministries. A future challenge for the MoD is clarifying the chain of command. The Jones Commission criticized the Ministry of Defense in September 2007 for creating a politically motivated parallel chain of command. U.S. military officials confirmed this assessment in August 2008, noting ineffective coordination and unclear lines of authority within the MoD. Iraqi Army divisions reported to the Iraqi Ground Forces Command, which reported to the Joint Headquarters, ultimately under the MoD. Some forces fell under provincial Operations Commands, potentially reporting directly to the Prime Minister's office. Operations Commands in Iraq are meant to integrate counter-insurgency efforts by the Iraqi Security Forces in specific areas. They have been established in several provinces and there is a possibility they could evolve into Army Corps headquarters. However, as of early fall 2008, there were no plans for such a transition. The Ministry of Defense faces challenges in resolving issues related to unclear lines of authority and coordination within the military. The Ministry of Defense in Iraq faces challenges with centralized decision-making, difficulty in identifying requirements and budgeting, and inefficient spending. The Defense Minister reviews most funding decisions, hindering efficient functioning. The MoD struggles with obligating and spending required funds, leading to a trend of exceeding spending by the Iraqi Security Forces Fund. The MoD in Iraq faces challenges with centralized decision-making, budgeting, and inefficient spending. MNSTC-I notes the lack of fully developed direct contracting capability. DOD reports 40% of civilian positions within the MoD were unfilled in December 2008. U.S. military commanders highlight changes in Iraqi population attitudes as crucial for security progress. Efforts to reach out to the population have increased. Efforts to reach out to the Iraqi population have increasingly focused on \"reconciliation,\" a term broadly used in various contexts including U.S. national strategy and Iraqi government structures. The goal is to achieve multi-lateral reconciliation among all sub-groups in Iraqi society, excluding those deemed irreconcilable. Various forms of reconciliation have shaped the security climate in Iraq, with early coalition efforts constrained by lack of expertise and resources. In 2003, coalition efforts in Iraq were hindered by lack of expertise, limited resources, and policy decisions. Recognizing the importance of tribal dynamics, leaders engaged with local tribal leaders but lacked detailed expertise. The Iraqi Governing Council had minimal tribal representation. A concerted outreach effort was made to Sunni Arab communities in the \"Sunni Triangle\" region, urging them to cease support for insurgents in exchange for assistance with reconstruction and political representation. In early 2004, the CPA established an outreach office to engage with tribal leaders and disaffected groups, including religious extremists. U.S. national leadership crafted \"Sunni engagement strategies\" in 2004, offering political representation, economic assistance, and detainee releases. By 2005, coalition leaders in Iraq pursued direct contacts with insurgents and their supporters, often brokered by Iraqi leaders, focusing on a cessation of violent actions against Iraqis. The talks in 2007 focused on a cessation of violence in exchange for benefits like amnesty and political/economic participation. Critics question the ethics of negotiating with perpetrators of violence. Coalition leaders acknowledge the need to engage with those with blood on their hands. In 2008, reconciliation efforts in Iraq targeted both Sunni insurgents and Shi'a extremists, offering incentives like stipends, reinstatement in the ISF, and safety guarantees. The GoI played a role in managing these initiatives, aiming to bring hopelessness to the enemy and fatigue to the table for negotiations. The GoI is involved in reconciliation initiatives in Iraq, facing challenges like potential sectarian favoritism perceptions and decreasing Iraqi receptiveness. MND-North also launched a separate initiative targeting economic insurgents in Hawija, offering negotiated surrender and job opportunities. Funding sources are utilized to support civilian job placements. U.S. forces and PRT counterparts have used various funding sources to find civilian jobs for program participants in MND-North. By August 2008, over 2,100 individuals had taken part in the program, with many expressing a desire to leave conflict behind and return to a peaceful life. The \"awakening\" movements, originating in Al Anbar province, have significantly impacted the security and political landscape in Iraq, with each movement having unique characteristics and regional impacts. After the collapse of the old regime in Al Anbar province, state-owned enterprises closed, pensions went unpaid, and De-Ba'athification policies led to job losses, causing many Anbaris to feel disenfranchised. Al Qaeda affiliates exploited this situation, promising to \"rescue\" the population but resorting to brutal tactics, including murder and intimidation. The \"Desert Protectors\" movement emerged in 2005, with local tribes in al Qaim and Haditha collaborating with U.S. Special Operations Forces and Marines to combat the insurgency. The \"awakening\" movement in Al Anbar province, led by Sheikh Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, emerged as a response to Al Qaeda's presence. By January 2008, six of the initial eleven sheikhs challenging Al Qaeda were dead. The movement expanded to include more tribes and changed its name to Mutammar Sahwat al-Iraq. Leading sheikhs in the awakening movement describe their efforts to combat insurgency. The awakening movement in northern Iraq, known as Sahwat al-Iraq, has tribal leaders seeking help to combat Al Qaeda, viewing it as a \"blood feud.\" This movement spread through provinces like Ninewah, Salah ad Din, Kirkuk, and Diyala in 2007, similar to the Al Anbar example. Sunni Arabs in these regions, feeling politically disenfranchised, self-organized to protect their interests against Al Qaeda affiliates who took up residence in areas like Mosul and the upper Diyala River Valley. In Ninewah, Sunni Arabs, making up 75% of the population, did not vote in elections, leading to under-representation on the Provincial Council. Kurdish expansion into Mosul and Kirkuk has caused tension among Sunni Arabs. \"Awakening\" movements are emerging in southern Iraq due to security conditions and exposure to similar movements elsewhere. Movements are emerging in southern Iraq among tribal leaders, driven by a desire for security and opportunity for their families. The political landscape in southern Iraq is dominated by the power struggle between the Islamic Supreme Council in Iraq (ISCI) and the Office of the Martyr Sadr, led by Muqtada al-Sadr. Schisms within the Jaish al-Mahdi have led to the emergence of violent splinter groups. In southern Iraq, violent splinter groups known as \"special groups\" have emerged, reportedly with ties to Iran. The Islamic Supreme Council in Iraq (ISCI) and Muqtada al-Sadr's Office of the Martyr Sadr are the leading contenders for political power in the region. The \"Sons of Iraq\" have been credited with improving security in Iraq since late 2007, with military commanders praising the program as a cost-effective way to buy security. In late 2008, the Sons of Iraq program transitioned to Iraqi Government control, with local residents helping protect their communities. By August 2008, there were 99,374 Sons of Iraq in Iraq, with some integrated into ISF or civilian employment. The Sons of Iraq program included Sunni and Shia Arabs, with the majority being Sunni. By January 2009, the mix was estimated at about 85% Sunni and 15% Shia. Some groups were homogenous while others were mixed, such as in a region south of Baghdad where 60% were Sunni Arab, 20% were Shia Arab, and 20% were mixed. In Baghdad, the Sons of Iraq (SoI) groups consisted of 60% Sunni Arab, 20% Shia Arab, and 20% mixed. U.S. commanders acknowledged that many SoIs were former insurgents, with one Division Commander stating that 80% were former insurgents. Concerns were raised about infiltration by extremist groups, with ISF commanders also worried about AQI corrupting the SoIs. Major General Oothman expressed concern about AQI infiltrating and corrupting the SoIs. The Sons of Iraq (SoI) movement started as grassroots initiatives by Iraqis to protect their communities. Coalition forces provided support to volunteers, forming partnerships like the \"Ghazaliyah Guardians.\" Concerns were raised about infiltration by extremist groups, with some SoIs possibly \"playing both sides.\" MNF-I leaders noted that SoIs emerged after threats from Al Qaeda affiliates. The Sons of Iraq (SoI) movement began with grassroots initiatives to protect communities. SoIs volunteered after threats from Al Qaeda were eliminated. Coalition forces standardized the SoI system, paying them through the Commanders Emergency Response Program. Most SoIs earned around $300 per month. The Sons of Iraq (SoI) movement started as a grassroots effort to safeguard communities from threats. They were paid around $300 per month, with variations in salaries by region. Some SoIs received bonuses for good performance, while others faced penalties for negligence. The understanding of their role varied, with some considering them to work for the ISF and others as working with the ISF. The Sons of Iraq (SoI) were intended to fill gaps in areas where ISF presence was limited, working closely with coalition forces. They manned checkpoints, protected infrastructure, and reported suspicious activity. By August 2008, SoIs in one area maintained 2,159 checkpoints and turned in 668 IEDs. Their contributions directly saved lives and equipment, with a decrease in IED attacks after their establishment. Some SoIs were former IED emplacers. In 2008, \"Daughters of Iraq\" groups were formed as security volunteers to screen female Iraqis and combat suicide bombings. By March 2009, over 600 \"Daughters\" were working under coalition control in Anbar, Diyala, and Salah ad Din provinces, with an additional 400 under Iraqi control through the Baghdad Operations Command. The recruitment of temporary \"Daughters\" for the 2009 provincial elections was successful. In Al Anbar province, local residents organized into different security volunteer groups. Some formed provincial security forces (PSF) with training from the Marines, while others created neighborhood watch-style organizations. Concerns were raised about the potential for these groups to revert to violence or form new militias. Key Shi'a leaders in the Government of Iraq are worried about potential challenges to their leadership from Shi'a tribal organizations that could emerge from the Sons of Iraq (SoI) groups in the south. Prime Minister Maliki appointed a close associate to oversee the integration of SoIs into Iraqi government structures. Sunni and Shi'a political parties are hesitant to face competition for influence in southern Iraq from the SoIs. The Iraqi Islamic Party saw the SoIs as potential competitors for Sunni Arab support. Kurds were wary of organized Sunni Arab groups in cities like Kirkuk. In December 2007, Iraqi government and coalition leaders set ground rules for the SoI program, including a cap of 103,000 members nationwide and a ban on recruitment in southern provinces. SoIs were prohibited from representing political parties and had to reflect demographic balance. The SoI program in Iraq, supported by key leaders, raised concerns about creating alternative forces challenging the government's authority. The program was intended to be temporary, with plans to integrate some SoIs into the system. The SoI program in Iraq, supported by key leaders, aimed to integrate roughly 20% of SoIs into Iraqi security forces or non-security jobs by July 2008. The transition of SoIs into permanent jobs proceeded slowly, with some difficulties in accurately recording data due to the dynamic nature of the SoI population. Between December 2007 and August 2008, 5,189 SoIs transitioned to the Iraqi Police, 53 to other Iraqi security forces, and 2,515 to non-security jobs, while 3,547 SoIs quit, were killed, went missing, or were dismissed. Between December 2007 and August 2008, 5,189 SoIs transitioned to the Iraqi Police, 53 to other Iraqi security forces, and 2,515 to non-security jobs. The application process for SoIs interested in joining the Iraqi Police involved local-level screenings by various authorities to assess background, residency, skills, and demographic balance. Formal requirements included literacy, physical fitness, and a medical check. The formal requirements for SoIs interested in joining the Iraqi Police included literacy, physical fitness, and a medical check. Approved candidates were referred to the Implementation and Follow-up Committee on National Reconciliation for further processing. Constraints on incorporating SoIs into the Iraqi Police included the MoI's overloaded personnel and training systems, as well as reluctance from some MoI officials. For SoIs not incorporated into the ISF, the goal was to help them transition into civilian jobs. The Coalition focused on helping SoIs transition into civilian jobs, with programs like JTERP and CSDs. However, progress was slow, and the program stalled in 2008. The Coalition focused on helping SoIs transition into civilian jobs through programs like JTERP and CSDs. CSDs, part of a new Civil Services Corps, aimed to provide essential services in Iraq. Pilot projects were launched in Baghdad and Kirkuk, with plans to transfer funding responsibility to the Iraqi government in 2009. The goal was for the Iraqi government to fully embrace the initiative once its worth was demonstrated. Initial support was expressed by IFCNR for increasing the size and number of CSDs. IFCNR expressed initial support for increasing the size and number of proposed CSDs, agreeing to pay salaries while the coalition covered equipment and training costs. Progress on establishing CSDs was slow, leading MNC-I officials to consider alternatives like a rapid employment initiative. The Government of Iraq announced plans to assume responsibility for Sons of Iraq ahead of schedule in October 2008. Minister of Defense Abd al-Qadir stated that the Sons of Iraq were considered citizens and the government would take responsibility for them. He mentioned that while the SoIs had helped with security, they would still be subject to the law. The GoI assumed responsibility for the 54,000 SoIs in Baghdad province on October 1, 2008, despite initial concerns from U.S. officials. The GoI assumed responsibility for approximately 54,000 Sons of Iraq in Baghdad province on October 1, 2008. By mid-March 2009, there were 81,773 SoIs under GoI control, with plans to integrate 20% into jobs with the ISF. Transition of SoIs to GoI control in various provinces continued through April 1, 2009. The GoI began assuming responsibility for Sons of Iraq in 2008, transitioning many to jobs with the Iraqi police and army. Efforts were made to secure civilian jobs for the remaining SoIs, with promises from various ministries. While some officials were optimistic about the job transition timeline, some SoIs expressed skepticism due to delays in salary payments and lack of permanent employment prospects. The coalition detainee operations in Iraq evolved significantly by 2008, with improved accountability through the introduction of biometrics. The transition of Sons of Iraq to civilian and security jobs by the Iraqi government in 2008 marked a shift towards permanent employment opportunities. Improved accountability through biometrics and better information-sharing was implemented in coalition detainee operations in Iraq. MNF-I introduced \"COIN inside the wire\" practices to separate true \"irreconcilables\" from opportunists among detainees, leading to a low recidivism rate of about 9%. The coalition previously used internment facilities for detainee storage, but now focuses on identifying and addressing underlying motives for detainment. The coalition in Iraq transformed its theater internment facilities into \"jihadist universities\" where extremists recruited and trained followers. They isolated hardcore cases in high-security compounds and provided literacy and vocational training programs for the majority of detainees. Imams offered voluntary religious education, and a family visitation program was introduced. The coalition in Iraq transformed its theater internment facilities into \"jihadist universities\" where extremists recruited and trained followers. Imams offered voluntary religious education, and a family visitation program allowed about 1,600 visits per week. A series of detainee releases was initiated, with concerns about the \"legacy\" population of detainees posing security risks. MNF-I launched efforts to streamline the problem and promote reconciliation. To promote reconciliation in Iraq, MNF-I launched an accelerated detainee release program through TF-134. Detainees were reviewed by the MNF-I Review Committee, given the chance to present their case, and good behavior was considered for early release. Concerns about job opportunities and potential criminal behavior post-release were addressed by involving \"battle space owners\" in decision-making. The program also utilized a guarantor system for released detainees. The detainee release program in Iraq involved a guarantor system where tribal leaders vouched for detainees' good conduct upon release. The detainee population increased from 14,000 to 26,000 in 2007 due to surge operations. By September 2008, there were 19,000 detainees in coalition facilities, dropping to 15,800 by November. U.S. forces had to transfer custody of detainees to Iraqi authorities per the security agreement, with those without warrants being released in an orderly manner. In January 2009, Iraqi and U.S. officials agreed on a process for detainee transfer. In 2009, Iraqi and U.S. officials agreed on transferring detainees to Iraqi authorities. Observers believe some detainees may benefit from the Amnesty Law. Governance and economics were crucial for long-term success in Iraq, with the Iraqi government leading in these areas. The Iraqi government leads governance and economics in Iraq, with support from the coalition. There is tension between civilian and military roles, with civilian agencies facing resource limitations. Military forces have sometimes taken the lead in these efforts. The 2007 surge saw a revitalization of civilian/military Provincial Reconstruction Teams. In 2007 and 2008, military units focused more on governance and economic activities in Iraq. Current debates revolve around civilian and military roles in Iraqi capacity-building as U.S. forces decrease. Iraqi officials may be less willing to be mentored as their sovereignty grows. Coordination between civil/military teams at the provincial level has been a longstanding concept. Under the Coalition Provisional Authority, plans for \"Governorate Support Teams\" led by State Department personnel, military Civil Affairs officers, and USAID representatives were implemented with some delays. Foreign Service Officers served as \"Governorate Coordinators\" supported by civil/military staff. Regional meetings were held in 2003 to share concerns and lessons learned. The U.S. Embassy established Regional Embassy Offices at the end of the formal occupation, discontinuing the provincially based \"GC\" system. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) were established in Iraq in 2005, led by State Department officials with mixed civilian/military staffs. The PRTs aimed to assist Iraq's provincial and local governments in developing governance capabilities, supporting economic and social development, and upholding the rule of law. The PRT effort was expanded in 2007 as part of the surge, with the goal of leveraging increased security for economic and governance work at the provincial level. President Bush praised the PRTs in June 2007 for their contributions. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq were praised by President Bush in June 2007 for their efforts at the provincial level. The teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities with reconciliation, strengthening moderates, and transitioning to self-reliance. PRTs operate under a joint DoS-DoD mission, led by the Department of State, reporting to the Office of Provincial Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The Chief of Mission provides guidance to all PRTs. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq provide economic guidance and direction to all PRTs. There are 28 PRT-like structures in Iraq with about 800 total staff, covering the entire country unevenly. These teams vary in size and composition, with some as small as a four- or six-person core staff. In August 2008, PRT sizes varied from 16 in Najaf to 70 in Kirkuk. PRTs work closely with U.S. military Civil Affairs teams and Human Terrain Teams. The largest group of PRT personnel were locally engaged staff, with State Department and USAID Foreign Service Officers also present. Departments of Agriculture and Justice provided expertise in small numbers. By August 2008, about 85% of DoD civilians were sent in. In August 2008, the PRTs were being filled with Department of State hires and outside contractors, with specialized skills like an epidemiologist and a retired Air Force pilot. Military units also contributed personnel to partner PRTs to support their efforts. MNF-West was transitioning out of civil-military operations business by October 2008. In October 2008, MNF-West decided to transition out of civil-military operations business and contribute Marines to work directly for the PRT. By January 2009, there were about 800 PRT personnel, with 453 managed by the Department of State and the rest including locally engaged staff, advisors, and DOD personnel. The civil/military balance of responsibilities varied by location, with U.S. military leading operations in Baghdad PRT. The ePRTs are responsible for economics and governance initiatives, coordinating with civilian counterparts and military units. Some ePRTs operate independently with their own assets, while others rely on their partner BCT for support. They report up through their respective provincial PRTs to the U.S. Embassy. The ePRTs have a coordination relationship with their partner BCTs, with some functioning more like a BCT staff section. They may take direction from the BCT commander and operate independently. There is variation in the type of military units PRTs are partnered with. The ePRTs collaborate closely with military units, such as BCTs, in various regions of Iraq. U.S. military commanders often praise their partnership with ePRTs, with some even stating that the ePRTs work so effectively that they are indistinguishable from military personnel. Different regions show varying levels of cooperation and integration between military units and PRTs, with some emphasizing the close working relationship and shared initiatives to address challenges. In August 2008, military commanders in Iraq emphasized the need for more expertise and presence from PRTs, especially as the security situation improved. Some commanders questioned the lack of a civilian surge and called for increased involvement from State officials. Despite optimism from some commanders about the role of ePRTs as the main effort, civilian officials tempered expectations about their presence. In early 2008, OPA officials highlighted the current PRT presence as the civilian surge. By August 2008, the U.S. Embassy planned a strategic drawdown of PRTs based on congressional direction. Some officials felt the PRT presence was excessive in certain areas, suggesting a focus on specific needs like agriculture and public health. Frustration was expressed towards the military for taking on governance and economic tasks instead of leaving them to more qualified personnel. The military is criticized for taking on governance and economic tasks instead of leaving them to civilian experts. Many commanders agree that responsibilities should be transitioned to civilians when available. Cultural differences shape PRT/military relationships, with some divisions launching campaigns to recruit ePRT members from their own staff. In 2008, civilian and military officials suggested targeted training for civilians working with military units. Pre-deployment visits to Ft. Bragg and counter-insurgency training at Camp Taji were seen as valuable for exposure to military culture. By 2009, new PRT members had expanded training to include exercises with U.S. BCTs. In 2009, new PRT members expanded training to include exercises with U.S. BCTs at Ft. Irwin, California, and Ft. Polk, Louisiana. Concerns were raised about military resources for PRT movement and force protection as U.S. forces in Iraq draw down. There were discussions about shifting the lead role for capacity-building to PRTs in stability operations, with military support. The Office of Provincial Affairs briefing materials highlight the significant role played by coalition forces in governance and economics-related tasks in Iraq, despite the potential for civilian experts to handle these tasks. PRTs serve as the main interface between the U.S. government, coalition partners, and Iraqi provincial and local governments. In Baghdad, the full Baghdad PRT engages with key officials, while ePRTs focus on district- and neighborhood-level councils. ePRTs, responsible for districts, may struggle to work closely with all neighborhood councils due to constraints. Military units have frequent interactions with Iraqi officials, with different levels of command engaging with various local government bodies. The PRT focuses on connecting the provincial government with the national government and mentors young military officers in governance work. Coalition efforts aim to establish connectivity between national ministries and local governments. Military commanders work on building informal bridges among tribal councils, Iraqi Security Forces, and local government bodies. Current governance efforts by coalition forces focus on fostering connectivity among tribal councils, Iraqi Security Forces, and local government bodies. Efforts include mentoring Iraqi interlocutors at each level to ensure linkages between local and higher governments for effective prioritization and resource allocation. For example, in a town south of Baghdad, community leaders were brought together regularly by an Army Captain to address their disconnect from the local council's deliberations. Current governance efforts by coalition forces involve bringing local community leaders together regularly to articulate and prioritize concerns. Coalition forces connect these leaders with Iraqi officials chosen to represent the area, with mentoring and support from higher levels of command. Brigade Commanders review local council memberships for vacancies and demographic balance, urging improvement where needed. Many commanders believe PRTs and ePRTs are not robust enough for comprehensive governance missions. In early 2008, the Division aimed to assist PRTs in establishing governance in Iraq. The U.S. military has been involved in economic reconstruction, focusing on local-level initiatives like neighborhood economic revitalization. This included reopening small shops such as fruit stands and convenience stores to improve economic conditions. In early 2008, military commanders in Iraq supported local businesses through micro-grants, enabling entrepreneurs to purchase equipment and raw materials. This initiative aimed to jumpstart small businesses and improve economic conditions in the neighborhoods. In Iraq, the number of open shops is seen as a measure of community security and local population safety. Sustainable development requires not just local shops but also production, supply, distribution systems, and a customer base. Economic policy discipline is a challenge, as seen in the \"great poultry debate\" of 2008 when officials proposed supporting domestic poultry and egg farming for sustainable economic activity. In 2008, there was a debate over supporting domestic poultry and egg farming in Iraq. Some believed it would provide employment and income for local families, but others argued it would not be profitable due to high costs. Military commanders used the Commanders Emergency Response Program for various projects, with a focus on supporting essential services and sustained initiatives like the Sons of Iraq. In 2008, the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP) was used to support essential services and sustained initiatives like the Sons of Iraq program. Some BCT commanders had to seek approval from Division headquarters to spend CERP funds, raising concerns about civil/military coordination. Projects for CERP support were typically proposed by local Iraqi officials and residents, with military cross-walking initiatives with local Iraqi councils' plans. In 2008, concerns were raised about the extensive use of CERP funding on projects in Iraq that may not be necessary or could be funded by Iraqis themselves. Some officials worried that this liberal use of funding could hinder the goal of encouraging Iraqis to solve their own problems. Coordination between BCT, PRT officials, and Iraqi councils was emphasized in Kirkuk and Baghdad for project planning and funding decisions. In 2008, concerns were raised about the extensive use of CERP funding on projects in Iraq that may not be necessary. Some officials worried that this could hinder the goal of encouraging Iraqis to solve their own problems. Multi-National Force-West officials noted in August 2008 that they were \"giving CERP money back\" to help make the Iraqi system work. In 2008, concerns were raised about the extensive use of CERP funding in Iraq. Multi-National Force-West officials were \"giving CERP money back\" to help the Iraqi system work. Instead of CERP, Marines were using I-CERP, which raised concerns about teaching Iraqis bad habits. Strategic decision-making for the US in Iraq requires a clear assessment of security trends and factors. Metrics in early 2009 indicated that security gains from 2008 had been maintained. In 2008, security gains were maintained in Iraq. Overall attacks, including various types of attacks, peaked in June and July 2007 before declining sharply after July 2007. The level of attacks continued to decrease by late 2008. In late 2008, the level of attacks in Iraq had fallen to under 200 per week, a significant decrease from previous years. Commanders noted that low attack levels did not necessarily mean no adversaries were present, as some areas could be used as sanctuaries. The number of Iraqi civilian deaths due to extremist actions peaked in late 2006 but began to decline in 2007. After the surge forces arrived in Iraq in 2007, civilian deaths sharply declined by over 72% through January 2008. However, there was a spike in deaths in late March 2008 during military operations in Basra and Sadr City. The number of weapons caches found and cleared increased significantly from 2004 to 2008, with 503 caches cleared in January 2009. The size and contents of the caches are not always indicated, and the discovery success rate is unconfirmed. After the surge forces arrived in Iraq in 2007, civilian deaths sharply declined by over 72% through January 2008. The number of weapons caches found and cleared increased significantly from 2004 to 2008, with 503 caches cleared in January 2009. MNF-I tracks high profile attacks, including explosions involving car bombs and suicide vests, with a peak of about 130 attacks in March 2007 decreasing to about 40 in December 2007. Erecting barriers and kinetic operations helped lower vehicular attacks. After a surge in high-profile attacks in March 2008 during military operations in Basra and Sadr City, the number of vehicular attacks decreased significantly by January 2009. MNF-I tracks improvised explosive devices (IEDs) based on two metrics - the number of IED explosions and the total number of IED incidents. The number of IED explosions spiked in October 2006 during Ramadan, remained high until July 2007, and fell sharply until October 2007. The incidence of IED explosions increased in late spring during an offensive operation. IED explosions spiked in late spring during offensive operations in Basra and Sadr City in 2008, and again in late summer during operations in Diyala and Ninewah provinces. By December 2008, the level of IED explosions had fallen to levels last seen in early 2004, of less than 50 per month. The use of explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) from Iran declined in late 2007 but briefly increased in early 2008 before declining again through early 2009. Improvised rocket-assisted mortars (IRAMs) emerged as a new deadly threat in November 2007, with 13 attacks reported by August 2008. In late 2008, new IED tactics emerged in Iraq, including building-borne IEDs and sticky IEDs attached to vehicles. The use of female suicide bombers also increased. As security measures improved against vehicle-borne attacks, person-borne IEDs became more common in early 2009. Security gains in Iraq led to debates on the contributing factors. The security situation in Iraq improved due to a combination of factors, including a shift towards counter-insurgency focus and the use of more sophisticated technologies by coalition personnel. Former MNF-I Commanding General, General David Petraeus, emphasized the importance of achieving population security. The improved security situation in Iraq was attributed to various factors, including the need to separate irreconcilables from reconcilables in counter-insurgency efforts. Key components included targeted operations by special forces, increased presence of coalition and Iraqi Security Forces, rejection of extremists by \"awakening\" movements, efforts by security volunteers, and improved intelligence assets for timely decision-making. New technologies, such as counter-IED equipment, greatly improved commanders' decision-making abilities and response times. The integration of various force components and increased intelligence assets, particularly from the air component, contributed to security improvements in Iraq. Special Operations Forces (SOF) benefited from sophisticated technologies to enhance their efforts in capturing or eliminating threats. Special Operations Forces (SOF) have utilized advanced technologies to target high-value individuals, but it is emphasized that SOF alone is not sufficient. Coalition forces in Ramadi found that a combined approach with conventional forces, who have close ties to local communities, is most effective. Conventional forces play a crucial role in maintaining control of the area after SOF operations, with many leaders having prior experience in Iraq. Leaders and commanders with previous experience in Iraq have a greater understanding of Iraqi governing structures and customs. They have absorbed lessons from past tours, including the 2006 COIN manual.
