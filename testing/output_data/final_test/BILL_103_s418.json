    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civil Aircraft Trade Enforcement Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Airbus Industrie is a multinational consortium of 4 aircraft manufacturers supported by their respective governments, including France, the UK, Germany, and Spain. The US Department of Commerce is analyzing Airbus Industrie's aircraft programs for economic performance advice to the US Government. The US Department of Commerce analyzed government support for Airbus Industrie, finding that France, Germany, and the UK provided $8.2 billion in support through 1989, with an additional $2.3 billion in government support. The total government funds committed to Airbus Industrie would be valued at $25.9 billion, with almost 75 percent of development funds provided by the governments of the Airbus Industrie member countries. The financial analysis of Airbus Industrie shows little likelihood of government support repayment in full. Airbus Industrie programs are not commercially viable and have a negative net present value. If Airbus continues selling aircraft at subsidized prices, US manufacturers may lose market share and be pressured to lower their prices. Both current and expected profits for US aircraft manufacturers will decline due to continued government support for Airbus Industrie programs. Reduced profits on current US aircraft programs have significant impacts as manufacturers rely heavily on internally generated funds for investments. Lower profits may discourage the introduction of new advanced-technology aircraft while Airbus introduces its own models. Airbus Industrie's global market share of jet aircraft orders rose from 7% in 1980 to 28% in 1992, while US manufacturers' share declined from 88% to 63%. In the US, Airbus's market share went from 0% to 44%, while US aircraft's share dropped from 100% to 56%. US imports of Airbus large civil aircraft increased from $133 million in 1981 to $844 million in the first 3 quarters of 1992. In 1992, employment in the US civil aircraft manufacturing industry decreased from 326,000 positions in 1989 to 266,000 positions in 1993. The purpose of this Act is to start a countervailing duty investigation on large civil aircraft made by Airbus Industrie. SEC. 3.

An investigation will determine if the US aircraft manufacturing industry is harmed by imports of Airbus Industrie aircraft. The administering authority will initiate the investigation within 45 days of the Act's enactment. The administering authority will initiate a countervailing duty investigation under the Tariff Act of 1930 regarding imports of civil aircraft manufactured by Airbus Industrie.
