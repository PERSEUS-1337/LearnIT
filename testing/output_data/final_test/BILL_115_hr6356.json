    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Less Imprecision in Species Treatment Act of 2018\" or the \"LIST Act of 2018.\" It includes a requirement to initiate delisting. The \"Less Imprecision in Species Treatment Act of 2018\" includes a requirement to initiate delisting a species from the Endangered Species Act if recovery goals have been met or if the species has sufficiently recovered and no longer needs protection. The Secretary will remove a species from the list if substantial scientific or commercial information shows the species has recovered or met recovery goals. If a species is removed, only a notice of removal will be published. Additionally, within 90 days of receiving relevant information, the Department of the Interior must act on delisting a species from the list. The Secretary will assess if a species should be removed from the list based on scientific or commercial information. The information must show that the listing was inaccurate, fraudulent, or misrepresentative. The Secretary has the authority to remove a species from the list if a positive finding is made, which will be promptly published in the Federal Register. Positive findings are not subject to judicial review, while negative findings are. If a species is removed from the list, only a notice of removal will be published. If a person submits a petition with false information, they will be disqualified as an interested party for 10 years. SEC. 3. EXPANDED CONSIDERATION DURING FIVE-YEAR REVIEW.
