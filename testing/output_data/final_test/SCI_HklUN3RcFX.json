A new approach called ConfGCN is introduced in this paper to estimate label scores and their confidences jointly in a GCN-based setting, enhancing neighborhood aggregation capabilities. ConfGCN is a new approach in Graph-based Semi Supervised Learning that enhances neighborhood aggregation capabilities. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and focuses on predicting properties of nodes in graphs. The source code for ConfGCN is available for reproducible research. Incorporating smoothness constraint on labels estimated on nodes BID36, BID2, BID31, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) provide a framework for deep neural networks on graph-structured data. GCNs have been successful in tasks like semantic role labeling, machine translation, relation extraction, event extraction, shape segmentation, and action recognition. GCN formulations for graph-based SSL have achieved state-of-the-art performance. This paper focuses on graph-based SSL using GCNs, where node embeddings are iteratively estimated by aggregating neighborhood nodes' embeddings and backpropagating errors from a target loss function to estimate label scores on the nodes. Incorporating smoothness constraint on labels estimated on nodes, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) provide a framework for deep neural networks on graph-structured data. GCNs have been successful in various tasks. This paper focuses on graph-based SSL using GCNs, where node embeddings are used to estimate label scores on the nodes. Confidence-based GCN is explored for the first time in this paper, showing improved label prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. ConfGCN is a GCN framework for graph-based SSL that estimates label scores on nodes and their confidences. It helps subdue irrelevant nodes in a node's neighborhood, enabling anisotropic behavior in GCNs. This addresses limitations in neighborhood aggregation schemes like Kipf-GCN. In a k-layer Kipf-GCN model, nodes are influenced by all nodes in their k-hop neighborhood, leading to issues in heterogeneous neighborhoods where nodes of different labels surround a target node. ConfGCN addresses this problem by estimating confidences on each node's label scores, allowing for more accurate influence from relevant nodes. ConfGCN uses label confidences to adjust node influences, leading to accurate predictions. Compared to Graph Attention Networks, ConfGCN is more effective due to its utilization of label confidences. ConfGCN is a Graph Convolutional Network framework for semisupervised learning that incorporates label distribution and confidences for each node. It utilizes label confidences to estimate node influence during neighborhood aggregation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in real-world datasets. Source code and datasets are publicly available for reproducible research. Semi-Supervised learning on graphs involves classifying nodes with limited available labels. Implicit graph regularization via learned node representation has proven to be effective for a small fraction of nodes. Methods like DeepWalk, node2vec, and LINE learn graph representations through random walk or traversal, while Planetoid learns node embedding by predicting class labels and neighborhood context. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are used for node representations, with improvements proposed for non-euclidean domains. BID6 introduces spectral and spatial construction of GCNs, enhanced by an efficient filter approximation BID8. BID14 presents a first-order formulation of GCNs for SSL on graphs. GCNs for directed graphs with edge-wise gating are proposed, improved by BID29 allowing nodes to attend to neighbors with varying weights. BID18 introduces Graph Partition Neural Network (GPNN) for learning node representations on large graphs. Incorporating confidence in predictions is explored by BID16 for active learning, while BID15 proposes a confidence-based approach. BID16 explores incorporating confidence in predictions for active learning. BID15 introduces a confidence-based framework for classification problems. BID30 uses uncertainty for word embeddings in representation learning. BID0 extends this idea to learn hierarchical word representation through probability distributions. BID21 proposes TACO for semi-supervised node classification, learning label distribution and uncertainty. BID3 embeds graph nodes as Gaussian distributions to capture representation uncertainty. Gaussian embeddings are used for collaborative filtering and topic modeling. In an undirected graph G = (V, E, X), with labeled (V l ) and unlabeled (V u ) nodes, the goal is to predict labels of unlabeled nodes using seed labels Y. Confidence is incorporated by estimating label distribution \u00b5 v and covariance matrix \u03a3 v for each node v. The diagonal of \u03a3 v represents the variance in the estimation of label scores. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for undirected graphs are briefly overviewed. Node representations after a single layer of GCN are defined using model parameters, adjacency matrix, and activation function. Multiple GCN layers can capture multi-hop dependencies between nodes. ConfGCN utilizes a co-variance matrix for confidence estimation. ConfGCN uses a co-variance matrix based symmetric Mahalanobis distance to define distance between nodes in the graph. The distance metric gives more relevance to neighboring nodes with similar confident labels, reducing importance of nodes with low confident labels. ConfGCN uses a co-variance matrix based symmetric Mahalanobis distance to define distance between nodes in the graph, giving more relevance to neighboring nodes with similar confident labels. The final node representation obtained from ConfGCN is used for predicting labels of the nodes in the graph. To learn label scores and co-variance matrices jointly with other parameters, ConfGCN includes terms in its objective function for enforcing neighboring nodes to be close to each other and for ensuring the label distribution of nodes is close to their input label distribution. The objective function of ConfGCN includes terms to enforce neighboring nodes to be close to each other and ensure the label distribution is close to the input label distribution. It incorporates a regularization term to constrain the co-variance matrix and a term to push the label distribution close to the final model prediction. The final objective is a linear combination of these terms, optimized using stochastic gradient descent. We optimize ConfGCN using stochastic gradient descent and validate its performance on semi-supervised classification benchmarks including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets. Additionally, we evaluate on the Cora-ML dataset to examine models on datasets with more heterogeneous neighborhoods. The datasets are citation networks with undirected citation links between documents, represented using bag-of-words features. Performance comparison of various methods for semi-supervised node classification on benchmark datasets shows ConfGCN outperforming others consistently. The datasets are citation networks with undirected links between documents, and additional labeled nodes are used for hyperparameter tuning. ConfGCN outperforms baseline methods on benchmark datasets like Citeseer, Cora, and Pubmed. The model is trained using Adam with a learning rate of 0.01 and initialized weight matrices. Evaluation includes comparison against Feat and ManiReg baselines. The curr_chunk discusses various frameworks for graph-based semi-supervised learning, including ManiReg, SemiEmb, LP, DeepWalk, Planetoid, GCN, G-GCN, and GGNN. These frameworks utilize different techniques such as geometric regularization, label propagation, and convolutional neural networks to improve training and prediction on graph-structured data. The curr_chunk discusses the performance of different graph-based methods in relation to node entropy and degree. ConfGCN outperforms Kipf-GCN and GAT due to its use of confidence scores. It also introduces GPNN and GAT as graph partition and attention-based algorithms. The section poses questions about ConfGCN's comparison to existing methods and the impact of node degree and label mismatch on performance. The evaluation results show that ConfGCN consistently outperforms existing approaches in semi-supervised node classification across various datasets. It performs significantly better on the noisy Cora-ML dataset, with a nearly 20% increase in accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. This improvement is attributed to ConfGCN's ability to model nodes' label distribution and confidence scores, which helps mitigate the impact of noisy nodes during neighborhood aggregation. The performance of G-GCN and GAT is lower compared to Kipf-GCN on Cora-ML due to difficulties in suppressing noisy neighborhood nodes. Neighborhood label entropy is used to quantify label mismatch, which increases with node degree, making node classification more challenging. ConfGCN's performance remains consistent and does not degrade with increasing node entropy or degree, showing its ability to effectively use label distributions and confidence to filter out irrelevant nodes during aggregation. In contrast, Kipf-GCN's performance decreases significantly with an increase in the number of layers, while ConfGCN's performance decline is more gradual. ConfGCN outperforms Kipf-GCN at all layer levels and remains consistent in performance. Ablated versions of ConfGCN show that including all terms in its loss function yields the best results. ConfGCN is a confidence-based Graph Convolutional Network that estimates label scores and confidences jointly, inducing anisotropic behavior to GCN. Its effectiveness in semi-supervised node classification is demonstrated against recent methods. ConfGCN's source code is available for task analysis and performance evaluation in various settings."
