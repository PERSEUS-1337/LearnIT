    "content": "During the 111th Congress, the economy emerged from a recession, but continued to face challenges in the housing market. The economic downturn was caused by issues in the housing finance system, leading to rapid declines in home prices and record-high foreclosures. Housing policy issues were a focus during this time, following the enactment of a sweeping economic stabilization program in the previous Congress. During the 111th Congress, legislation was enacted to address the troubled financial system and housing market, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act. Reforms were pursued to support the housing finance system and assist troubled homeowners amidst a challenging economic landscape. During the 111th Congress, legislation was enacted to address housing market issues and support troubled homeowners. The Congress also considered reforms to meet the affordable housing needs of low-income populations and federal homelessness assistance. Various laws were passed, including mortgage origination process reform and reauthorization of federal homelessness assistance. Legislation on GSE reform and Section 8 voucher program reform was also discussed but not enacted. This report provides a summary of major housing issues considered in the 111th Congress. During the 111th Congress, legislation was enacted to address housing market issues and support troubled homeowners. The federal government placed housing GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in conservatorship in September 2008 due to concerns about their safety and soundness. The GSEs play a major role in the U.S. housing market by facilitating a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship in 2008 by the federal government due to concerns about their safety and soundness. They buy home mortgages from lenders, repackage them as mortgage-backed securities, and sell them or hold them in their investment portfolios. The Department of the Treasury signed contracts to purchase preferred stock to keep each GSE solvent. Treasury has purchased over $150 billion in preferred stock, and the Federal Reserve has purchased over $1 trillion in GSE-issued mortgage-backed securities. The combined mortgage guarantees of the three housing GSEs represent a risk to the economy. The Dodd-Frank Act required recommendations for ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by January 31, 2011. Foreclosure rates in the U.S. began to rise sharply in 2006 and have remained high. Congressional focus on regulating the GSEs has increased due to their guarantees. Widespread foreclosures have negative consequences for homeowners, communities, and the economy. Congress has taken steps to encourage mortgage holders to prevent foreclosures. There is a debate over the government's role in foreclosure prevention, as it may be costly and raise concerns about fairness. The 111th Congress enacted laws related to foreclosure mitigation. The 111th Congress enacted laws related to foreclosure mitigation, including provisions to amend existing programs, provide additional funding, establish protections for renters in foreclosed properties, and make changes to mortgage modification programs. The 111th Congress made changes to foreclosure mitigation programs, including amendments to HAMP and funding for legal assistance. Additional funding was provided for NFMCP and NSP, with requirements on how the funds could be used. The 111th Congress considered various foreclosure-related initiatives, including proposals to reform the bankruptcy code. Additional information can be found in CRS reports on foreclosure prevention initiatives, amending the bankruptcy code, and community development block grants. Many troubled mortgages had complex or predatory features like adjustable interest rates and high prepayment penalties, contributing to the housing bubble and subsequent collapse. Calls have been made for standards in mortgage origination to protect consumers and prevent future financial losses. The Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) implemented changes to mortgage origination standards to protect consumers and prevent future financial losses. It set minimum standards for residential mortgages, restricted prepayment penalties, imposed limitations on high-cost mortgages, and prohibited deceptive practices in mortgage lending. Additionally, it regulated mortgage originator compensation and increased consumer disclosures. Several employees and individuals with power-of-attorney signing authority for major mortgage servicers were deposed in 2010 as part of foreclosure contests, raising concerns about \"robo-signing\" - the practice of having a small number of individuals sign a large number of legal documents for foreclosures. This has led to questions about the validity of sworn affidavits in property foreclosures. The legality of foreclosures is being questioned due to procedural defects in the execution of assignments and sales of mortgages, notarization of legal documents, and employee oversight. This could lead to judicial sanctions, civil penalties, and criminal prosecutions. Mortgage servicers claim they have not wrongfully foreclosed but admit to paperwork errors in the foreclosure process. The extent of wrongful foreclosures is unknown at this time. The report highlights uncertainties regarding procedural and substantive issues in mortgage ownership, potentially leading to delays in foreclosures. These problems could have legal and economic repercussions for financial institutions, including violations of securities laws related to mortgage-backed securities. The report discusses issues with mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and violations of representations and warranties in mortgage contracts, which could lead to significant legal and financial consequences for financial institutions. These concerns were raised in hearings during the 111th Congress, but no legislation was passed to address the risks. The 110th Congress enacted a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in 2008, initially set at $7,500 and required repayment over 15 years. Subsequent legislation increased the credit to $8,000, removed the repayment requirement, and extended the expiration date. The tax credit was further extended and expanded to repeat homebuyers in later acts. The Homebuyer Assistance and Improvement Act of 2010 extended the homebuyer tax credit deadline. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages with lower downpayment requirements, making it easier for certain populations to purchase homes. During the mid-2000s housing boom, FHA's mortgage market share fell to under 2%. However, as housing prices declined, FHA played a larger role in the market, guaranteeing nearly 40% of home-purchase mortgages in FY2010 and assisting over 1.1 million homebuyers. Despite increased defaults, FHA faces tension between supporting the market and protecting itself. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) faces financial challenges with its capital reserve ratio falling below the mandated level of 2%. Despite a modest increase in FY2010, the ratio remains low at 0.59%. The addition of Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) further impacts the MMIF, with a capital ratio of -0.98% in FY2010. Bringing more income to the MMIF is crucial to raise the capital ratio. One option to increase income for the MMIF and raise the capital ratio is to raise upfront and annual insurance premiums for FHA-insured loans. The 111th Congress enacted P.L. 111-229, allowing FHA to raise annual insurance premiums and upfront premiums. Additionally, the FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed at broader FHA reforms but did not pass the Senate. Since 2008, FHA has been able to insure mortgages at temporarily increased levels. The maximum mortgage amounts that FHA can insure have been temporarily increased. Some argue for decreasing limits to limit FHA's involvement in the mortgage market, while others warn that reducing limits could further soften the market by limiting available credit. The 111th Congress kept the maximum mortgage limits at their increased levels through FY2011. Housing assistance programs for low-income individuals are funded through HUD's budget in the annual appropriations process. The cost of maintaining the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program has been increasing due to rising rental voucher costs driven by market changes and additional vouchers created by Congress. Funding offsets within HUD's budget have decreased, leading to pressure to increase overall funding or make cuts. In recent years, Congress has increased funding for HUD, including the Section 8 voucher program, and enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate the economy. Reforms to streamline the administration of the Section 8 program have also been considered. The Section 8 voucher program is HUD's largest housing assistance program for low-income families, serving over 2 million families at a cost of roughly $18 billion. Administered by public housing authorities, it provides portable rental subsidies to very low-income families to reduce their rents in the private market. Recent reform bills aim to simplify the income eligibility and rent determination process and give PHAs more flexibility in the physical inspection process. Proposed legislation aims to reform the Section 8 voucher program by giving Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) more options for inspections, changing the funding allocation formula, and expanding the Moving to Work demonstration. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 3045) was reported out of the House Financial Services Committee. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 3045) was reported out of the House Financial Services Committee but was not considered on the House floor before the end of the 111th Congress. There are over 1 million units of public housing in need of capital repairs, estimated at $18 billion-$20 billion in the late 1990s. Congress typically provides annual appropriations for capital needs. The Obama Administration proposed the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative to address the backlog of capital needs in public housing. PHAs have been turning to private market loans due to insufficient funding from Congress. The initiative, known as PETRA, aimed to allow PHAs to convert public housing contracts to new rental assistance contracts with higher subsidies. The PETRA proposal aimed to convert public housing contracts to new rental assistance contracts with higher subsidies, allowing properties to be mortgaged. While some supported the proposal, low-income housing advocates feared privatization of public housing if PHAs defaulted on loans. Another reform bill, H.R. 5814, aimed to guarantee notes issued by public housing instead of converting them to new assistance. The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act, part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, was enacted to provide more flexibility in administering HUD Homeless Assistance Grants. The issue of veterans experiencing homelessness has gained prominence in recent years. In recent years, legislation to assist homeless veterans has been considered by Congress. $75 million per year was allocated for Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans from FY2008 through FY2010. The Department of Veterans Affairs announced a plan to end veteran homelessness, resulting in additional funds for VA programs. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program provides housing for households with a member age 62 or older. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act in the 111th Congress allowed owners of older Section 202 developments to refinance and make improvements by removing impediments to obtaining funds for property improvements. The new law allows owners of older Section 202 developments to refinance with lower interest rates and reduced debt service, as long as they address the property's physical needs. It also authorizes \"Senior Preservation Rental Assistance\" and establishes \"Service Enriched Housing\" within the Assisted Living Conversion Program. Additionally, the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Act provides capital grants and rental assistance for housing development for persons with disabilities. In the 111th Congress, the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act (P.L. 111-374) addressed criticisms of Section 811 housing by converting funding for rental assistance to the Section 8 program and allowing it to be used with other financing sources like LIHTC and HOME program. This aimed to reduce the isolation of individuals with disabilities in housing developments. The Housing Trust Fund created during the 110th Congress provides annual grants for affordable housing for low-income households, separate from the annual appropriations process. This fund aims to supplement Section 811 funding for persons with disabilities in multifamily housing developments. The Housing Trust Fund, established by the Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), aimed to provide grants to states for rental housing for extremely low-income households. Funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was suspended when they entered government conservatorship in 2008, leaving the Housing Trust Fund without a source of funding. The 111th Congress considered bills to provide initial funding, with most proposing $1 billion in capitalization and some including an additional $65 million for rental housing. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, aimed to provide grants for rental housing for low-income households. Two bills with initial funding were passed by the House, but the funding was not included in the enacted legislation. No funding was provided by the end of the 111th Congress. \"Affordable housing preservation\" refers to efforts to maintain affordability of rental properties financed by HUD, USDA, or Low Income Housing Tax Credits. In the 1960s, property owners entered contracts with HUD or RHS for affordable housing. Government assistance was provided in exchange for maintaining affordability. Owners may exit programs in high-rent areas to convert to market-rate housing. HUD or RHS may end contracts for violations or property deterioration. Ending restrictions on properties poses a risk. In the 111th Congress, the Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act (H.R. 4868) aimed to address issues in preserving HUD-subsidized housing by offering grants or loans for property rehabilitation, extending voucher protections to tenants, and creating a Preservation Exchange Program for transferring properties to maintain affordability. H.R. 4868 aimed to establish a right of first refusal for HUD to maintain property affordability but was not enacted. The financial crisis impacted the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, a key tool for affordable housing development. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program provides tax credits to developers to fund affordable rental housing projects. However, after the economic downturn, large corporate investors reduced their demand for tax credits, causing a fall in market value. This led to concerns about financing for LIHTC projects. To address this, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created the Tax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP) and a temporary LIHTC-grant exchange program. The Tax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP) and a temporary LIHTC-grant exchange program were created to address financial shortfalls in tax credit developments. $2 billion in grants were provided under TCAP, while the exchange program allowed states to exchange LIHTC allocations for grants to ensure construction of affordable rental housing. The grant exchange program was not extended before the end of the 111th Congress. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided nearly $800 billion to address the economic recession, including $13.7 billion for HUD through discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue provisions. This included funding for public housing and various housing-related provisions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated significant funding for public housing capital repairs and a new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program, marking the first time HUD funding was dedicated to preventing homelessness. This funding was in addition to the $13.7 billion provided to HUD through discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue provisions to address the economic recession. Since FY2008, Congress appropriated $7 billion in Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funds to help state and local governments acquire, rehabilitate, and resell abandoned and foreclosed homes. The NSP was authorized with the passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289). An additional $2 billion for NSP-2 activities was allocated in 2009 under ARRA (P.L. 111-5), which revised key elements of the program and awarded funds competitively to nonprofit and for-profit entities. Under ARRA, NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to nonprofit and for-profit entities. In 2010, an additional $1 billion was appropriated for NSP-3 under the Dodd-Frank Act. Each NSP round had specific deadlines for fund obligation and expenditure. NSP-1 grantees had 18 months to obligate funds and four years to expend them. NSP-2 recipients had to spend at least half within two years and 100% within three years. NSP-3 had no obligation deadline, but 50% of funds must be expended within two years and 100% within three years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides temporary housing assistance to disaster victims under the Stafford Act. Assistance includes repairs, rental aid, or direct housing for up to 18 months. The program faced challenges after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, leading to new partnerships and approaches. FEMA partnered with HUD to provide longer-term housing for disaster victims using resources from the President's Disaster Relief Fund. They limited the use of manufactured housing, created safety standards, and were reviewing a pilot program for safer temporary housing units in partnership with HUD. Legislation related to housing and community development considered by the 111th Congress primarily focused on programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture, as well as housing finance and tax issues. The list excludes military housing and housing assistance for disabled veterans provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Notable legislation enacted includes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, and the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2010, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, Homebuyer Assistance and Improvement Act of 2010, Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and General and Special Risk Insurance Funds Availability Act of 2010 were key legislative acts passed by the 111th Congress. The 111th Congress passed various key legislative acts, including the General and Special Risk Insurance Funds Availability Act of 2010, Indian Veterans Housing Opportunity Act of 2010, Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010, and Helping Heroes Keep Their Homes Act of 2010. Bills Passed by Only One Chamber House-Passed Bills include various acts such as the Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2009, TARP Reform and Accountability Act of 2009, Homes for Heroes Act of 2009, Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, and others. The curr_chunk lists various bills such as the Rural Housing Preservation and Stabilization Act of 2010, FHA Reform Act of 2010, Flood Insurance Reform Priorities Act of 2010, HELP Veterans Act of 2010, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2011, and others."
