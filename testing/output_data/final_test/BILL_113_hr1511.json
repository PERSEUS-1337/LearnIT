    "content": "Title VI of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include a new section on Emergency Forest Rehabilitation and Restoration. The new section on Emergency Forest Rehabilitation and Restoration defines a catastrophic event as any natural disaster or fire, flood, or explosion that causes significant damage to Federal land. The term 'Secretary' refers to the individual responsible for making such determinations. The Secretary is defined as the individual responsible for making determinations. The Secretary must ensure that 600,000 acres of Federal land are treated with mechanical treatments annually to produce merchantable wood. Funding for this purpose includes specified funds and any other available funds. Emergency circumstances are declared for Federal land affected by catastrophic events. The Secretary may declare emergency circumstances for Federal land impacted by catastrophic events, prioritizing rehabilitation of land affected by beetle infestations. Emergency alternative arrangements can be used to comply with environmental regulations, limiting administrative appeals. The Secretary must initiate salvage activities on Federal land affected by catastrophic events within 30 days to prevent deterioration of timber values or significant fire hazard, following emergency declarations. Administrative appeals are not allowed for emergency alternative arrangements or categorical exclusions due to declared emergencies. The Secretary must initiate salvage activities on Federal land affected by catastrophic events within 30 days to prevent deterioration of timber values or significant fire hazard. Funding for these activities will come from specified funds and any other available funds. Certain Federal lands are excluded from this section, including components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, areas where vegetation removal is restricted by law, and wilderness study areas. There are limitations on land acquisition, with exceptions provided in specific cases. Beginning on the date of enactment of this section and for the next 5 fiscal years, funds available to the Secretary cannot be used to survey or discuss acquiring land as Federal land, with exceptions for ongoing transactions, land exchanges, and donations. The Secretary can now accept donations of non-Federal land as Federal land and use funds for forest treatments and salvage activities instead of purchasing non-Federal land."
