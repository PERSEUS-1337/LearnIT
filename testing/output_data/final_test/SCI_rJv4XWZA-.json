    "content": "In this paper, a technique for generating artificial datasets with differential privacy guarantees is presented using a Gaussian noise layer in the discriminator of a generative adversarial network. The experiments show that high-quality data can be generated under a small privacy budget, allowing successful training of machine learning models on this artificial data. Recent research by BID8 suggests that even without access to internal model parameters, it is possible to recover individual faces from a training set using hill climbing on output probabilities of a neural network. This poses a threat to privacy as deep learning models are increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives. To protect privacy while using statistics and machine learning, various data anonymisation techniques like kanonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness, and differential privacy have been developed. Differential privacy is a widely accepted standard for publishing datasets in a private manner, ensuring sensitive information remains protected. The goal is to allow third parties to benefit from machine learning while safeguarding individual data and preventing adversaries from recovering it. In this paper, a simple solution using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained with Gaussian noise is proposed to create artificial datasets that maintain the same distribution as real data while ensuring differential privacy. This method is advantageous as it is easy to implement, does not require training multiple models on separate data, and can be done by the user, eliminating the need to trust the machine learning service provider. The paper introduces a novel mechanism for non-interactive differentially private data release and a technique for preserving privacy in neural networks by adding noise during training. It guarantees differential privacy for both outputs and learned weights, achieving high accuracy with a reasonable privacy budget. The paper discusses the structure and content of the sections, including related work, background on differential privacy and generative adversarial networks, the proposed approach with theoretical analysis, experimental results, and conclusion. The increasing focus on privacy-preserving deep learning is noted, with a suggestion to distribute training using disjoint sets of data. The paper discusses privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, including training in a distributed manner with disjoint sets of data. An alternative method using an ensemble of teacher models and semi-supervised knowledge transfer achieves high accuracy with privacy bounds. This approach extends previous work to generic learning models, making it the most accurate privacy-preserving learning result to date. The paper discusses privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, including using differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) to train models privately. The goal is to enable data usage by third-party machine learning service providers while maintaining privacy. An alternative solution is to focus on sanitizing data to ensure privacy when training machine learning models. The authors propose a method to generate private data without using real seeds, ensuring privacy without the need for privacy tests. They utilize GANs for scalability and applicability to complex real-world data. The paper also discusses differential privacy and the moments accountant method for computing privacy bounds during training. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their extensions like DCGAN and EBGAN have advanced deep generative models. GANs are chosen for their practical success in generating sharp images quickly, making them ideal for realistic image generation. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) consist of two components: the generator G(z) and the discriminator D(x). The generator aims to produce realistic data samples based on a random variable z, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated samples. GANs are trained adversarially to reach a Nash equilibrium, with common tricks like Adam optimization, feature matching, batch normalization, and one-sided label smoothing used to improve convergence. The notion of differential privacy, introduced by Dwork et al., is a strong privacy standard defined for datasets differing by a single element. Mechanisms like Laplacian and Gaussian noise are used to achieve this privacy, with a focus on the Gaussian noise mechanism due to improved privacy bounds analysis. The Gaussian noise mechanism involves feeding sensitive data X into a discriminator D with sensitivity s f and standard deviation s f \u03c3. The text describes a privacy-preserving method using a discriminator and generator to create an artificial dataset while ensuring differential privacy guarantees. The goal is to generate a dataset that follows the same distribution as the original data and provides privacy guarantees. The method is theoretically proven, but limitations are also discussed. Generative models like GANs are used to estimate the true data distribution when it is unknown. However, differential privacy cannot be guaranteed due to information leakage in the training process. This is illustrated with an example of datasets with small numbers where a large number can significantly impact the discriminator's updates. To maintain differential privacy guarantees in GAN training, a Gaussian noise layer is proposed for the discriminator network. This ensures that the generator's weights remain private with respect to the input data. The solution involves creating a differentially private dataset using this generator. The theoretical analysis shows that adding the noise layer yields differential privacy in the generator's output. The steps include analyzing privacy of the noise layer's output, determining privacy bounds on the network output, and demonstrating the solution's effectiveness. The text discusses ensuring differential privacy in a neural network with a Gaussian noise layer. It explains the setting with two datasets and a feed-forward neural network. The noise layer's output must be (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differentially private with a certain standard deviation. If the noise layer output is private with respect to the input and the network layers preserve adjacency, then the network's output is also private. The proof and theorems are provided in the text. The text discusses ensuring differential privacy in a neural network with a Gaussian noise layer. The proof and theorems in the appendix show that the outputs of the network are (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differentially private with respect to the input data. The main theoretical result is the differential privacy of the gradients and weights of the network. Weight updates are also (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differentially private with respect to the input data in each iteration of gradient descent. The text discusses ensuring differential privacy in a neural network with a Gaussian noise layer. The main theoretical result is the differential privacy of the gradients and weights of the network with respect to the input data X. Corollary 1 states that gradient updates of the generator G in a GAN have the same privacy bounds as gradient updates of the discriminator D. Theorems 1 and 2 define differential privacy of the neural network with respect to inputs X only, not considering labels y. The proposed approach discusses incorporating label privacy in training a face recognition model. This can be achieved by either including labels as part of the data or using a separate privacy-preserving mechanism to retrieve labels during training. The privacy w.r.t. the pair (X, y) can be ensured through a composition of these mechanisms. Theorem 3 states that gradient updates in a neural network are (\u03b5 1 + \u03b5 2 , \u03b4 1 + \u03b4 2 )-differentially private with respect to (X, y) during each iteration of gradient descent. This is achieved through two privacy mechanisms applied to X and y separately, ensuring their privacy composition. The privacy bounds for differential privacy in neural networks are obtained using the BID4 theorem. It is important to note that using parallel composition instead of sequential composition may not provide a tighter bound due to the strong correlation between X and y. The analysis focuses on feed-forward networks and deterministic networks, with additional investigation needed for other architectures like RNNs and LSTMs. The limitations for implementing a privacy-preserving layer in a neural network include the requirement for a feed-forward network, absence of randomised layers like dropout, and avoidance of adjacency-breaking layers such as batch normalisation before the privacy layer. These restrictions only apply to the discriminator in this case. In this section, implementation details and evaluation results on MNIST BID16 and SVHN BID20 datasets are discussed. A generative model is trained with differential privacy by adding Gaussian noise to the discriminator. The model, called a teacher, generates an artificial dataset of comparable size. A separate nonprivate classifier, called a student, is trained on the generated data and tested using held-out test sets. This step allows for quantifying the quality of generated samples and comparing test errors to previous values. There are no dependencies between the teacher and student models, and student models are not limited to neural networks. For our experiments, we used MNIST and SVHN image classification datasets. MNIST has 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples of handwritten digits. SVHN has 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images of house numbers from Google Street View. Implementation was in Python using Pytorch 1, with a modified DCGAN for the generative model. The discriminator has five layers for SVHN and four for MNIST. The modified DCGAN by BID24 includes a discriminator with five convolutional layers, leaky ReLU activations, and a linear classifier with sigmoid output. The generator has two linear layers followed by five deconvolutions with batch normalization and ReLU activations. Both networks were trained using Adam optimizer with typical GAN training parameters. Privacy bounds were evaluated using the moments accountant and the privacy amplification theorem. The student network consists of two convolutional layers with ReLU activations. The student network consists of two convolutional layers with ReLU activations, batch normalization, and max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers with ReLU, and a softmax output layer. Training is done using the Adam algorithm. The network does not achieve state-of-the-art performance but focuses on evaluating the performance drop compared to a non-private model. Results show 98.19% accuracy on MNIST and 83.49% accuracy on SVHN while maintaining approximately (3.45, 10^-5) and (8, 10^-6)-differential privacy. The study achieved 88.96% accuracy on privately generated data compared to 92.58% on original data using a logistic regression model on MNIST. Generated images lack contrast and dynamic range due to the absence of batch normalization in the discriminator. The study uses generative adversarial networks to create privacy-preserving datasets for non-interactive data release with differential privacy guarantees. The method allows for publishing sanitized data and training non-private models on it, ensuring scalability and suitability for real-world data with complex structures. The generated images show similarities to real examples but may differ in shape, color, or surrounding digits, and often come from different classes. The method uses generative adversarial networks to create privacy-preserving datasets without the need for privacy tests. It introduces a novel technique for preserving privacy in deep neural networks by adding noise during training. Experimental results show high utility on MNIST dataset and acceptable performance on SVHN data. Future work may focus on improving the quality of generated data for given privacy bounds. The appendix reiterates and proves lemmas and theorems related to differential privacy in deep neural networks. It discusses the concept of differential privacy and the deterministic nature of the network, emphasizing the concentration of the distribution of X. The text discusses the concentration of the distribution of X in a deterministic neural network with differentially private layers, proving that the output is also differentially private. The complexity arises from randomised layers and marginalisation over possible outcomes. The text discusses the concentration of the distribution of X in a deterministic neural network with differentially private layers, proving that the output is also differentially private. Weight updates in the network are shown to be (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differentially private w.r.t the input datasets. The text introduces the moments accountant technique for analyzing DP-SGD algorithms, which tracks bounds on the moments of the privacy loss random variable to obtain tail bounds using Markov inequality.
