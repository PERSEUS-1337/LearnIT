    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chinese Human Rights Act of 1995\" and includes definitions. The \"Chinese Human Rights Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as political prisoner, thought control, political reprisal, and forced abortion. The \"Chinese Human Rights Act of 1995\" defines terms like forced sterilization as coercing individuals to undergo surgery to prevent offspring, and cannibalism as consuming human embryos or fetuses. The \"Chinese Human Rights Act of 1995\" defines terms like forced sterilization and cannibalism. SEC. 3 states the findings and purpose of the act. Congress finds that China has promulgated a document allowing the removal of organs from executed prisoners, including political dissidents, for transplant purposes. This practice is carried out due to opposition to the government's policies or refusal to submit to thought control. Fear of the government prevents relatives from claiming the bodies of executed dissidents. The United States aims to use its economic power to reduce the Chinese government's brutality against its people, including forced abortion, sterilization, infanticide, and cannibalism. China's actions have isolated it from the international community. SEC. 4. MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS. Any waiver by the President of subsections (a) and (b) of section 2432 of title 19, United States Code, with respect to China is null and void. China shall not be granted most-favored-nation treatment until Congress provides by statute. SEC. 5. TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT. SEC. 5 of the Trading with the Enemy Act is amended to include provisions related to products with military applications in relation to the People's Republic of China. SEC. 6 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to protect individuals persecuted for resisting coercive population control measures. It deems such persecution as being on account of political opinion. SEC. 7 states that the Act will take effect immediately upon enactment."
