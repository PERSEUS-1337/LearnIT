    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Intermodal Equipment Safety and Responsibility Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that promoting safety on highways is a national priority and the Department of Transportation has regulations to ensure this. Intermodal transportation is crucial for the nation's economy. Motor carriers receive intermodal equipment for interstate commerce but lack the necessary level of responsibility. Carriers lack control over intermodal equipment maintenance, leading to safety violations and fines. Congress should intervene to ensure compliance with safety regulations. Congress should mandate that only parties controlling intermodal equipment are responsible for its safety during interstate travel. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the document. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to motor carriers and equipment used in the road transport of intermodal freight. It includes definitions for \"motor carrier,\" \"equipment,\" and \"equipment interchange agreement.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to equipment interchange in intermodal transportation, including \"equipment controller\" and \"interchange.\" It clarifies that a motor carrier is not considered an equipment controller unless delegated responsibility for maintenance and repair. The curr_chunk defines Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations as regulations governing the condition and maintenance of commercial motor vehicles. The curr_chunk introduces new regulations regarding the jurisdiction over equipment controllers and their responsibilities in commercial motor vehicle safety. Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include new regulations requiring equipment controllers to systematically inspect, maintain, and repair equipment intended for interchange. Equipment must comply with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations before being offered for interchange to a motor carrier agent. The equipment controller is responsible for ensuring compliance with safety regulations at all times. The equipment controller must reimburse a motor carrier for necessary repairs to comply with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The controller is not liable if the carrier's negligence caused the need for repairs. SEC. 6. SAFETY COMPLIANCE. Sec. 5912 of title 49, United States Code, states that the equipment controller is liable for violations of safety regulations related to their equipment, except in cases of negligence or willful misconduct by the motor carrier. Motor carriers and their agents have limited liability in such cases. The motor carrier and any agent receiving equipment through interchange are not liable for violations of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations related to that equipment. Violations of safety regulations related to interchanged equipment do not affect a motor carrier's safety rating unless caused by negligence or willful misconduct. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a procedure for correcting records within six months. Transportation will establish an expedited procedure within 6 months to correct records or reports of violations that should not impact a motor carrier or agent. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO INSPECT. Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to inspect equipment at facilities of equipment controllers to ensure compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. Inspections must occur at least once every 3 months, and non-compliant equipment will be addressed accordingly. During inspections, equipment found in violation of safety regulations must be taken out of service until repairs are completed and documented. The Secretary has the authority to impose fines on equipment controllers for violations. SEC. 8. PENALTIES FOR RETALIATION.\n\nChapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section that prohibits equipment controllers from retaliating against motor carriers or agents who request maintenance or repair of equipment to comply with safety regulations. Retaliation includes failing to provide compliant equipment within 60 minutes, and violators may face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation. SEC. 9. DELEGATION OF MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nChapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to prohibit equipment controllers from delegating maintenance and repair responsibilities for equipment intended for interchange to motor carriers or their agents in an equipment interchange agreement.\n\nSEC. 10. COMPATIBILITY OF STATE LAWS. SEC. 10. COMPATIBILITY OF STATE LAWS. This section addresses the preemption of State laws that conflict with federal regulations under Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code. It specifies that State laws are preempted if compliance with both State and federal requirements is not possible, except when State laws are more stringent but compatible with federal regulations. SEC. 11. IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. This section outlines the regulations for jurisdiction over equipment controllers, inspection, repair, and maintenance of equipment, compliance with safety regulations, authority to inspect, penalties for retaliation, maintenance responsibility, and the compatibility of State laws. The Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to implement provisions of the Act. These regulations will identify equipment controllers, require unique identifying numbers for equipment, maintenance and repair record systems, evaluate compliance with safety regulations, and prohibit non-compliant controllers from placing equipment on public highways. The regulations under the Act will address equipment placement on public highways, maintenance facility impact on equipment safety, anonymous petitions for investigations, dispute resolution procedures, and inspection and audit programs. Deadlines for rulemaking proceedings are set within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Act requires regulations to be issued within one year of enactment, prohibiting citations for equipment violations until then, except as outlined in the Act. Authorization of $7,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2004-2008 to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for inspection program implementation. Effective date for sections 3-10 of the Act is 30 days after enactment."
