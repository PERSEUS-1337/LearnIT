    "content": "The United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile border with important rivers like the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. These rivers are crucial for border communities and water supplies. In 1944, the two countries signed the 1944 Water Treaty, establishing the International Boundary and Water Commission to oversee water treaties. Congress has been involved in binational water sharing under this treaty. The International Boundary and Water Commission oversees binational water sharing under the 1944 Water Treaty, focusing on managing the Colorado River's water and infrastructure to improve availability during droughts and protect ecosystems. Mexico has at times failed to meet its Rio Grande water delivery obligations to the US, leading Congress to direct annual reporting on Mexico's compliance efforts. The report examines Colorado River and Rio Grande water sharing, the evolution of the IBWC, and recent developments in water sharing agreements. Appendix A provides reporting requirements for the Rio Grande since 2014, while Appendix B discusses recent drought conditions in North America. Appendix C covers binational transboundary aquifers. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 established borders between the US and Mexico, including parts of the Rio Grande and Colorado Rivers. The International Boundary Commission was created in 1889 to manage border agreements. Mexico raised concerns about water shortages due to US westward expansion in 1895. The United States and Mexico addressed water shortages caused by westward expansion through various treaties. The 1906 Convention required the U.S. to deliver water from the Rio Grande to Mexico, while the 1944 Water Treaty allocated water in the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins. The International Boundary and Water Commission oversees water allocation, border demarcation, and flood control measures between the two countries. The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) oversees sanitary measures and construction at the U.S.-Mexico border. It consists of U.S. and Mexican Sections, each led by an engineer commissioner. The USIBWC is a federal agency headquartered in El Paso, TX, operating under the Department of State's guidance. The President appoints the USIBWC commissioner, and the IBWC is funded through appropriations acts. Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs oversees the Mexican Section. The 1944 Water Treaty authorizes the IBWC to develop rules and issue proposed decisions. The 1944 Water Treaty authorizes the IBWC to issue proposed decisions called minutes for approval by both countries. If approved, the IBWC addresses issues such as sanitation plants, water conveyance, dam construction, and water salinity problems. The Department of State negotiates resolutions in response to proposed minutes. The IBWC addresses issues such as sanitation plants, water conveyance, dam construction, and water salinity problems during droughts. The 1944 Water Treaty defines water-distribution arrangements between the United States and Mexico, with Congress authorizing construction projects pursuant to the treaty. Mexico and the United States have water rights in the Rio Grande basin, with Mexico having rights to two-thirds of certain tributaries' flows. The United States has rights to flows from its own tributaries and one-third of Mexican tributaries' flows. If Mexico fails to meet its obligations due to drought, it must make up the deficiency in the next cycle using various methods outlined in Minute 234. The 1944 Water Treaty between Mexico and the United States outlines mechanisms for resolving disputes over water allotment in the Rio Grande basin. If Mexico fails to meet its obligations due to drought, the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) has the authority to settle differences between the two countries. Additionally, the treaty allows for recourse through diplomatic channels or other agreements for dispute resolution. Article 9 of the 1944 Water Treaty allows the IBWC to authorize temporary water diversions between Mexico and the United States during extraordinary droughts. The treaty also establishes a hierarchy of preferred water uses, including domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, as well as navigation and fishing. The IBWC maintains records on water ownership and ensures that any diversions do not establish permanent rights. The 1944 Water Treaty hierarchy prioritizes water uses for domestic, agricultural, industrial, navigation, fishing, and other beneficial purposes. However, it has been criticized for not addressing ecological water needs. The treaty focuses on water quantity requirements, with a protocol outlining construction and operation guidelines for works like dams. Minute 319 and Minute 323 allow for integrated operations in specific situations. Mexico's reservoir operations and treaty obligations in the Rio Grande Basin are discussed, highlighting water delivery shortfalls. The 1944 Water Treaty prioritizes water uses for various purposes but lacks consideration for ecological water needs. It focuses on water quantity requirements and outlines guidelines for dam construction. Minute 319 and Minute 323 allow for integrated operations in specific situations. Mexico's Rio Grande water delivery shortfalls are discussed, with the treaty empowering the IBWC to address issues related to flood control, hydroelectric energy generation, and reservoir regulation. Post-1944 border disputes between the United States and Mexico were resolved through new treaties, such as the Chamizal Convention in 1963. The Chamizal Convention in 1963 resolved a border dispute between the United States and Mexico by relocating the Rio Grande channel and transferring over 400 acres to Mexico. The IBWC was tasked with maintaining the new channel, and Congress implemented the convention into U.S. law in 1964. In 1970, the United States and Mexico signed the 1970 Boundary Treaty to settle boundary disputes, including the Rio Grande and Colorado River boundaries. The treaty prohibits construction that alters river flow, requires removal of prohibited works, and allows for improvement projects to stabilize river channels. The 1970 Boundary Treaty established maritime boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. The Colorado River flows through seven U.S. states and forms the border between Baja California Norte and Sonora in Mexico. Disputes over water supplies have occurred between the U.S. and Mexico for most of the past century. The 1944 Water Treaty negotiations between the United States and Mexico involved varying estimates of the Colorado River's flow volume. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation estimated the long-term average natural flow of the river between 1906 and 2016 at 14.8 million AF, with lower flows during the ongoing drought. This has impacted the distribution of river flows between the two countries as outlined in the treaty. In December 2012, the Bureau of Reclamation published a study showing that the demand for Colorado River water in the United States sometimes exceeds supply, with projections of worsening imbalance in the future. Concerns about meeting U.S. water demands are significant for discussions on water sharing with Mexico. Treaty-implementation issues in the basin include salinity, environmental instream flows, Minute 319, and Minute 323. Disputes have arisen over the quality of water delivered to Mexico, with concerns about salinity levels in the past. The United States and Mexico had water disputes over the salinity of the Colorado River. In 1965, Minute 218 required the US to reduce salinity levels, but Mexican farmers were still unhappy. In 1973, Minute 242 was agreed upon, requiring the US to build more channels, clean up damaged lands, and maintain low salinity levels in delivered water. This agreement is still in effect, with the US complying with its terms. The Colorado River Delta, covering 9,650 square miles in the US and Mexico, is home to endangered species. Environmental degradation, caused by water diversion and agricultural expansion, has led to the loss of 90% of the delta's wetlands. Advocates recommend high-volume water releases to restore the ecosystem. Environmental stakeholders recommend annual flows with pulse releases every four years to restore wetlands in the Colorado River Delta. Some stakeholders are concerned about reduced water availability for U.S. users and want Mexico's water delivery issues addressed first. Bilateral discussions in the late 1990s focused on improving management and conservation of the Colorado River and its delta. The governments, state officials, and conservation groups collaborated with the IBWC to develop an agreement for water allocation to Mexico based on surplus or drought conditions. Minute 319, signed in 2012 and replaced by Minute 323 in 2017, allowed for temporary adjustments to water deliveries to Mexico in the Colorado River Basin. Minute 319, signed in 2012 and replaced by Minute 323 in 2017, allowed for temporary adjustments to water deliveries to Mexico in the Colorado River Basin, including joint investments for environmental protection, water conservation incentives, and increased water storage in upstream reservoirs. Key elements included extending provisions of Minute 318 to allow Mexico to defer water delivery for earthquake repairs and delivering additional water to Mexico during high water levels in Lake Mead. The 1944 Water Treaty with Mexico includes provisions for reducing water deliveries during shortages in the Colorado River basin, holding U.S. water deliveries in reservoirs for later use, addressing salinity concerns, and implementing water efficiency projects. A pilot program under Minute 319 involved releasing stored water to simulate a spring flood, allowing the river to reconnect with its estuary. The pilot program under Minute 319 involved releasing stored water to reconnect the river with its estuary. A binational team of experts monitored the impacts on various aspects of the ecosystem. An interim report in 2016 showed positive results, including improved bird diversity and abundance in the floodplain. Active management of riparian sites is needed for better restoration of native species. More freshwater is required to enhance fish and zooplankton in the upper estuary. Mexico deferred water delivery under the 1944 Water Treaty, raising Lake Mead's water elevation. This, along with other conservation efforts, increased the lake's elevation by nearly 10 feet by the end of 2016. These actions helped maintain Lake Mead's elevation above 1,075 feet, preventing potential reductions in water supply. Without Minute 319, reductions in Colorado River water deliveries for lower basin states and Mexico would have occurred if water elevation fell below 1,075 feet. The U.S. lower basin states would not have benefited from Mexico sharing cutbacks during basin shortage conditions without the treaty. Additionally, higher Lake Mead elevations resulting from delayed deliveries by Mexico would not have been possible without Minute 319. Minute 323 extends or replaces key elements of Minute 319 in the Colorado River Basin, resulting from negotiations among federal and state authorities from both governments. Signed in 2017, it aims to provide water supply certainty and planning opportunities through 2026, with additional sections on flow variability and a Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan. Minute 323 extends provisions of Minute 319 in the Colorado River Basin, including delivering additional water to Mexico during high water levels in Lake Mead and reducing deliveries during water shortages. It establishes a Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan, Mexico's Water Reserve, and addresses salinity concerns. Minute 323 extends provisions of Minute 319 in the Colorado River Basin, addressing salinity concerns and providing water for habitat restoration and environmental purposes. It does not authorize pulse flows but allocates 210,000 AF of water for environmental use, to be shared equally by both countries and NGOs. The US will generate its share of water solely through its efforts. The United States will contribute $31.5 million for water conservation projects in Mexico under Minute 323. U.S. water agencies will receive 109,100 AF of water in return. Mexico can defer water delivery and store it in Lake Mead for later use. Minute 323 also establishes a revolving account for Mexican water storage in the U.S. Minute 323 in the United States aims to establish cooperative efforts to avoid severe water shortages through the Mexico 's Water Reserve. Mexico would contribute water savings proportionally equivalent to the United States' reductions under the Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan. These measures are contingent on the adoption of the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan by the United States. The projected January 2019 Lake Mead elevation of 1,078.9 feet would trigger the Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan restrictions. The LBDCP must be finalized and approved by all U.S. basin states and Congress for the provisions to take full effect. Some concerns exist about U.S. investment in water conservation in Mexico affecting water availability for irrigation. Minute 323 efforts to increase water levels in Lake Mead are seen as crucial for preventing future water shortages and maintaining cooperation between the two countries. Water sharing in the binational Rio Grande basin is determined by the 1906 Convention and the 1944 Water Treaty. The United States is required to deliver water to Mexico in the El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez Valley, while Mexico is obligated to deliver water to the United States below Fort Quitman, TX. Water demands regularly exceed supply, leading to imbalances, especially during droughts. Both parts of the basin can experience multiyear droughts. The Rio Grande basin can face multiyear droughts, impacting water availability for the U.S. population and economy in border counties. Concerns arise from Mexico not meeting delivery obligations, leading to below-target water supplies. Dry conditions have caused U.S. deliveries to Mexico to fall below requirements in recent years. The role of dry conditions in shaping Mexico's deliveries in the current five-year cycle is unclear. In the current five-year cycle, Mexico initially fell 15% below its water-delivery obligations but later exceeded the cumulative target. Despite delivering less than 350,000 AF in the third year, Mexico's higher deliveries in the second year brought cumulative deliveries close to the three-year target. Congress has increased oversight of water deliveries, and the IBWC is working on a binational water management model to improve reliability. The IBWC is developing a binational model for water management in the Rio Grande, with recent water deliveries in the basin discussed. U.S. deliveries to Mexico under the 1906 Convention have been reduced in about 30% of years, with no requirement for repayment. Table 1 shows U.S. deliveries falling below the 60,000 AF annual requirement in recent years. The Rio Grande Project, managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, has seen water deliveries to Mexico fall below the 60,000 AF annual requirement for six of the seven years from 2012 to 2018. U.S. water deliveries in the El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez Valley have drawn attention due to low flow and reservoir storage caused by drought. When project reservoirs are low, water deliveries to Rio Grande Project users are significantly reduced. Data shows that Mexico received around 9% of the water allocated to U.S. irrigation districts from 2012 to 2018. Hydrologic changes in the Rio Grande basin have led to decreased water availability and seasonal streamflow, impacting water delivery to U.S. users and Mexico. Winter and spring temperatures have increased, snowpack has declined, and flows in late spring and summer have diminished. Disagreements exist between Texas stakeholders and the IBWC regarding water allocation to the United States at Fort Quitman, TX. The 1944 Treaty between Mexico and the United States allocates half of the Rio Grande main channel flow between Fort Quitman and the lowest major international storage dam to each country. Since 1958, the IBWC has divided the water reaching Fort Quitman equally between Mexico and the United States. There are disagreements over water allocation in the U.S.-Mexico border segment between El Paso and Fort Quitman, with arguments that Mexico waived its rights to the Rio Grande waters at Fort Quitman in a 1906 Convention. The 1944 Water Treaty divides Rio Grande waters below Fort Quitman, with the USIBWC disputing TCEQ's interpretation of the treaty. The treaty requires Mexico to deliver portions of water in tributaries to the United States. The 1944 Water Treaty divides Rio Grande waters below Fort Quitman, TX. Mexico is required to deliver one-third of the flow from specific rivers and arroyos, with an annual target of 350,000 acre-feet. Mexico historically met its obligations until the 1994-2003 drought. Mexico has not met its delivery obligations under the 1944 Water Treaty in several five-year cycles, including 2010-2015. Factors like over-allocation and extended drought conditions have contributed to this. A 2011 assessment found that under drought conditions, the water-sharing system did not recover as expected, leading to a 15% shortfall in Mexico's water deliveries for the 2010-2015 cycle. Mexico faced a 15% shortfall in water deliveries, largely due to low deliveries early in the cycle. By January 25, 2016, Mexico paid off the debt from the previous cycle and made deliveries under the current cycle. They used water stored behind Amistad Dam and water from treaty tributaries to pay off the remaining deficit. The current cycle began in October 2015 and is expected to end in October 2020. In the first year, Mexico delivered 216,562 AF, which was below the target delivery. However, in the second year, they exceeded the two-year target of 700,000 AF. Mexico exceeded the two-year delivery target of 700,000 AF by delivering almost 800,000 AF in the first and second years of the current cycle. This was achieved in part by using flexibility provided by Minute 234 to count 50% of water from some Rio Grande tributaries towards deliveries. Tension exists over the predictability and consistency of Mexico's deliveries within the five-year cycle, particularly highlighted in 2012 when Texas faced dry conditions and received significantly less water than expected. Reservoirs at Amistad Dam and Falcon Dam store much of Mexico's delivered water, helping regulate its availability for U.S. interests. Some U.S. stakeholders argue that Mexico's uncertain water delivery timing hinders effective water management. Mexico's delivery pattern is seen as prioritizing its own water uses over U.S. interests, causing frustration for U.S. water users in Texas. The flexible five-year cycle for Mexico's Rio Grande deliveries contrasts with the more prescriptive U.S. water-delivery requirement in the Colorado River. Some stakeholders suggest renegotiating the 1944 Water Treaty due to concerns about Mexico's water delivery timing and compliance. Complaints from Texas farmers and officials have been raised regarding Mexico's inconsistent compliance with the treaty. Members of Congress question the efforts of USIBWC and the U.S. Department of State in ensuring Mexico's consistent compliance. The U.S. Department of State is being urged to ensure Mexico's compliance with the 1944 Water Treaty, with Congress requiring regular reports on the Rio Grande. This includes annual reports on Mexico's efforts to meet treaty obligations and other reports on water deliveries. Stakeholders are considering treaty renegotiation due to concerns about Mexico's compliance. The U.S. Department of State is urged to ensure Mexico's compliance with the 1944 Water Treaty, with Congress requiring regular reports on the Rio Grande. Stakeholders are considering treaty renegotiation due to concerns about Mexico's compliance. Diplomatic efforts since 2010 include Mexican government releases from a reservoir on the San Rodrigo River in 2013 and exchanging technical data for future water management. IBWC is working on a binational model for the Rio Grande. IBWC is developing a binational model for the Rio Grande, aided by investments in monitoring equipment since 2016. The goal is to improve water delivery predictability and reliability to the United States by shifting to proactive management. Binational working groups are being used to address water and environmental management issues in the Rio Grande, similar to efforts in the Colorado River. The IBWC is working on a binational model for the Rio Grande to enhance water delivery predictability and reliability for both the United States and Mexico. The hydrology work group focuses on data, modeling, and operations for treaty compliance, while the policy group addresses compliance actions. Texas and Mexico's CONAGUA provide technical advice. Efforts may lead to improved water management and ecological health in the basin, with discussions on proactive water delivery management and terms of the 1944 Water Treaty. Unresolved questions remain regarding Minute 234 of the 1944 Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico. Minute 234, established in 1969, outlines a procedure for Mexico to pay a water debt in the Rio Grande using three different water sources. There is a disagreement between the two countries on the interpretation and implementation of Minute 234, particularly regarding deficit payments during different five-year cycles. Mexico argued that only the deficit from the 1992-1997 cycle needed to be repaid by 2002, while the United States believed that all deficits must be repaid concurrently. The disagreement over the interpretation of Minute 234 remains unresolved, especially during dry conditions and when Mexico's Rio Grande deliveries fall below annual targets. Unconventional oil and gas development in northeastern Mexico could impact water use in the Rio Grande basin. Congress has significant interest in Mexico's water-sharing issues, primarily through oversight. The tone and nature of binational water relations between the United States and Mexico depend on efforts to resolve water tensions and improve cooperative management of shared rivers. The broader U.S.-Mexico relationship, including trade, immigration, and border security, may also influence binational water relations. Factors such as basin hydrologic conditions, water demand, and economic activity will shape future water sharing. The role of the IBWC in addressing flooding concerns related to border wall construction is questioned. The U.S. Department of State, Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and executive branch leaders influence IBWC actions on water sharing. Issues affecting Colorado River basin and Rio Grande water deliveries are being addressed by the IBWC for improved management and cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. Department of State has been delivering reports to Congress since 2014 regarding Mexico's Rio Grande water deliveries, as required by the 2014 farm bill. Limited information about the contents of these reports has been publicly available. The Secretary of State submits a report to Congress on Mexico's water deliveries to the Rio Grande as required by the 2014 farm bill. This reporting requirement has no end date and has been ongoing since 2014. Appropriations bills have included directions for these reports since FY2015. In 2015, P.L. 113-235 mandated the Secretary of State to report on water delivery issues with Mexico to improve transparency and predictability of water deliveries to the Rio Grande. The report mandated by P.L. 113-235 requires the Secretary of State to provide updates on water delivery issues with Mexico, specifically focusing on the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers, the Rio Grande, and efforts to address water deficits owed to the United States. The report must project the balance of the water delivery deficit at the end of the current 5-year cycle and estimate the impact of a negative delivery balance on the United States. Reporting requirements have been carried forward in subsequent fiscal years, emphasizing Mexico's treaty obligations to supply water deliveries to the Rio Grande. The Committee directs IBWC to regularly publish water delivery data on its website and hold quarterly meetings with stakeholders. Reporting requirements on Rio Grande water topics are being considered by the 115th Congress in various bills. The FY2019 appropriations bill includes language from H.Rept. 115-829 for H.R. 6538, which continues the requirement for publishing data and holding stakeholder meetings. It also includes provisions for flood control rehabilitation along the Rio Grande, consistent with the Mexican Water Treaty of 1944. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs supports efforts to maintain the health of the river by reducing sediment and other activities. Efforts to reduce sediment and maintain river health are crucial during droughts in the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins. The North American Drought Monitor, created by experts from the US, Mexico, and Canada, shows extreme drought conditions in September 2018. Drought conditions persisted in both basins from 2011 to 2015, with dry conditions in 2011 and 2012 due to high heat and low precipitation. The Colorado River basin experienced dry conditions from 2012 to 2016 and again in 2018 due to high heat, low precipitation, and low runoff. Binational aquifers along the U.S.-Mexican border, like the Hueco Bolson aquifer, are crucial water sources for populations in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso. Border aquifers have seen declines in volume and quality, with no broad bilateral agreement on groundwater management. The availability of groundwater along the U.S.-Mexican border is a concern due to deteriorating water quality and increasing use of groundwater resources. Limited knowledge about transboundary aquifers has been identified, with 36 aquifers along the border. The depletion of aquifers like the Hueco Bolson has led to changes in surface water flows, impacting the Rio Grande. The Rio Grande recharge the aquifer, diminishing surface water flows, turning the river into a losing stream in the Hueco Bolson area. A binational aquifer assessment program was initiated under the U.S.-Mexican Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act, focusing on four priority border aquifers. This collaboration aims to provide information for addressing water challenges along the U.S.-Mexican border. Ground-water pumping along the U.S.-Mexican border has led to water table depletion, aquifer depletion, and reduced stream flow, impacting riparian habitats. Urban centers like El Paso/Ju\u00e1rez have experienced land subsidence due to excessive groundwater pumping. Water quality degradation has also affected habitat suitability for diverse biota in the region. Both U.S. and Mexican entities fund the aquifer assessment program, with federal funding resuming in FY2016 after years of no funding. In FY2016, federal funding resumed for the aquifer assessment program along the U.S.-Mexican border. A binational study of the San Pedro aquifer in November 2016 identified data gaps and declining discharges into the San Pedro River. Activities planned for 2018 include developing a report and database on the Santa Cruz aquifer and researching saline-water topics near El Paso."
