    "content": "Short-term fiscal stimulus measures aim to boost economic activity through increased demand for goods and services to prevent a cycle of decreasing output, employment, and consumption. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has outlined three criteria for evaluating stimulus proposals: timing, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with long-term fiscal goals. The effectiveness of a payroll tax rate reduction as a short-term stimulus is assessed based on these criteria. Effective stimulus should be implemented during economic weakness, considering that recessions are typically short-lived. Effective short-term stimulus measures should be short-lived and quickly implemented during economic weakness. An extension of payroll tax reductions could be designed to expire as the economy strengthens, increasing household income and boosting demand for goods and services. Targeted provisions for low-income individuals or the unemployed may be more cost-effective than broad tax rate reductions, as those facing financial constraints are more likely to spend any additional income. An extension of payroll tax reductions could boost demand for goods and services, but the increase in disposable income may be saved or used to pay down debt rather than spent. CBO estimates show a temporary reduction in payroll taxes could raise output and increase employment, but the impact on spending is uncertain. An extension of the reduction in payroll taxes could be a cost-effective stimulus, with the potential to increase hiring by reducing labor costs. Expanding the reduction to include employer contributions may provide even greater stimulus per budgetary cost. The effectiveness of subsidies on the employer side for hiring or investment depends on increased demand. Short-term stimulus like extending payroll tax reduction may increase deficits and signal a lack of resolve to reduce deficits. Proposals to extend or expand payroll tax reduction should include offsets to address long-term fiscal objectives. The extension of the payroll tax rate reduction through 2012 was not offset by other tax provisions. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended many expired tax provisions through 2013, reducing uncertainty for businesses and taxpayers. Expired tax provisions can diminish the influence of tax incentives on behavior. The potential for tax incentives to influence behavior is reduced when expired tax incentives are retroactively reinstated. The cost of extending these expired provisions, such as the payroll tax rate reduction, is estimated to be significant. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that extending various provisions would cost billions over the budget window. This includes the cost of extending first-year bonus depreciation and adjusting the Alternative Minimum Tax exemption amount for inflation. Extending the payroll tax reduction through 2012 cost $93.2 billion. Some proposals for further extension include budgetary offsets, but not all. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 did not offset costs. Offsets can reduce spending or increase revenues, but they can also diminish short-term stimulative effects and be contractionary. The economic weakness has passed, limiting short-term contractionary effects and promoting long-term fiscal sustainability. Low- and middle-income taxpayers see a greater increase in after-tax income and decrease in federal tax liability compared to high-income taxpayers. Offsets reducing income or benefits for these groups could diminish the benefit of the payroll tax rate reduction. One option to offset costs is to raise additional revenues, with various proposals discussed. The Obama Administration has proposed options for raising additional revenues to finance an extension of reduced payroll tax rates. These options were not included in the final version of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Paying for the extension would have required considering measures not previously included in the legislation. A high-income surtax has been proposed as a way to raise revenues for extending the temporary payroll tax reduction. The American Jobs Act of 2011 and the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011 both suggested imposing a surtax on those with modified adjusted gross income above $1 million. The surtax rates varied between 3.25% and 5.6%, with estimated revenues ranging from $267.5 million to $452.7 billion over the 2012-2021 budget window. Imposing a surtax on high-income individuals could address concerns of lower tax rates for some high-income earners. In 2006, 65% of taxpayers with incomes over $1 million paid lower average tax rates than those with less than $100,000 in taxable income. High-income taxpayers would receive limited benefits from a payroll tax rate reduction, with a maximum benefit of $2,202 under a one-year, two percentage point reduction. Benefits would be diminished as more income is earned above the wage cap. To maintain the benefits of a payroll tax rate reduction, offsetting it with a high-income surtax could be more effective in preserving its stimulative impact. Concerns about the impact on small businesses are minimal, as only a small percentage of tax returns report business income over $1 million. The majority of taxpayers benefited from the temporary payroll tax rate reduction, while only a small fraction had adjusted gross incomes over $1 million. Individual income tax expenditures annually reduce income tax revenues by approximately $1 trillion. Limiting tax expenditures, such as the mortgage interest deduction and charitable contributions, could generate additional revenues of over $1 trillion annually. Options include limiting deductions for higher-income taxpayers and capping deductions for state and local income taxes. The Obama Administration proposed capping itemized deductions at 28%, which would affect taxpayers in the 33% bracket. Limiting the value of itemized deductions to 28% would increase tax revenue by $293.3 billion over 2012-2021. This change would affect taxpayers in the 33% and 35% brackets, with those earning over $200,000 seeing a slight increase in taxes. Average federal tax rates would increase by 0.4% for taxpayers with cash incomes between $500,000 and $1 million, and by 0.6% for those with incomes over $1 million. Limiting itemized deductions to offset a payroll tax rate reduction would increase tax burden on high incomes by scaling back certain tax subsidies. Modifying inflation adjustments in the tax code could raise additional revenues. Indexing the tax code for inflation using a chained consumer price index (CPI) would generate $59.6 billion in additional revenues over the 2012 through 2021 budget window. This re-indexing would result in increased tax liability for taxpayers at all income levels, with moderate income taxpayers seeing a 0.3% increase, higher-income taxpayers a 0.2% increase, and those with incomes over $1 million facing higher tax rates. Enacting a re-indexing of the tax code using a chained CPI would increase tax rates for taxpayers at all income levels, with moderate income taxpayers seeing a 0.3% increase and higher-income taxpayers a 0.2% increase. Tax rates for taxpayers with incomes over $1 million would not increase. The additional tax burden would be spread across the income distribution, offsetting some of the stimulus from the reduced payroll tax rate. Delaying the re-indexing would postpone the contractionary effect and reduce revenues generated within the 10-year budget window. Another option for raising revenues is to increase the social security payroll tax base, which currently applies to the first $110,100 in wage income. Increasing the Social Security payroll tax base to cover 90% of earnings could raise an estimated $456.7 billion in revenue over the 2012-2021 budget period. In recent years, around 83% of employment earnings have been below the Social Security wage cap, which has fluctuated over time. Legislation in the late 1970s increased the tax base to cover 91% of earnings in 1983, but the share of covered earnings has since declined. This option was included in deficit reduction plans and could help generate additional revenue. Increasing the Social Security payroll tax base to cover 90% of earnings would have a net revenue impact of $456.7 billion over the 2012-2021 budget window. This measure would make the payroll tax less regressive and improve the fiscal outlook of the Social Security trust fund. Possible offsets for a payroll tax rate reduction extension include reductions in federal worker compensation and war contingency funds. The House-passed version of H.R. 3630 and the Senate's S. 1931 propose extending the federal employee pay freeze. The House bill also aims to reduce discretionary spending limits, with estimated savings of $26.2 billion over the 2011-2021 budget window. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under S. 1931, discretionary spending would be reduced by $221.8 billion over the 2012-2021 budget window through provisions like freezing federal workers' salaries and reducing the federal workforce. Another option to raise revenue is by reducing federal civilian employee pay through adjustments under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, which could save $50.3 billion over the 2012-2016 budget window. The Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included provisions to increase pension contributions for newly hired federal employees, generating $15.5 billion in additional revenues. Freezing federal worker pay or reducing annual pay adjustments could offset benefits of the payroll tax rate reduction for some wage earners. Regions with high concentrations of federal employees may receive less stimulative benefit from the payroll tax if employees have the reduction offset through reduced wages. Trading future reductions in federal worker salaries for current revenue losses from a payroll tax rate reduction could pose challenges. Offsetting revenue losses from a payroll tax rate reduction could hinder federal government recruitment and retention of skilled employees. Using savings from overseas contingency funds is one option. The CBO projects growth in Overseas Contingency Operations spending, with a $126.5 billion adjustment made for FY2012. Testimony in 2011 estimated a $1.3 trillion cost for overseas operations from 2012 to 2021. The 2021 budget window is set at $1.3 trillion. If the drawdown in overseas military operations continues as expected, budgetary savings will be achieved. Legislation in the 112th Congress has constrained discretionary spending growth, with the Budget Control Act resulting in $917 billion in savings over the 2012-2021 period. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked with finding an additional $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, leading to automatic spending reductions due to its failure. An additional $1.1 trillion will be reduced under this process. The Budget Control Act resulted in $917 billion in savings over the 2012-2021 period. An additional $1.1 trillion will be cut from the deficit over the 2013 through 2021 budget window, with $813 billion from reduced discretionary spending. This represents a nearly 15% reduction in discretionary spending projections. Spending cuts enacted while the economy is weak could offset the stimulative effect of the payroll tax rate reduction. The payroll tax rate reduction extension bills proposed limiting federal benefits like unemployment compensation, SNAP, and Medicare based on income. Legislation aimed to restrict benefits for high-income individuals to generate savings. The provisions in H.R. 3630 and other legislation aimed to increase Medicare premiums for high-income individuals, generating savings of $31.0 billion over the 2012-2021 budget window. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included health offsets estimated to raise $18.2 billion over the 2012-2022 budget window, without increasing Medicare premiums for higher-income individuals. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 aimed to increase Medicare premiums for higher-income individuals, generating savings. Reducing mandatory spending could have a contractionary impact, but if high-income individuals maintain consumption levels, the impact will be reduced. Additionally, the Act included provisions for a temporary extension of emergency unemployment compensation and readjustment of physicians' Medicare reimbursements. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 did not include an extension of the 100% bonus depreciation allowance due to potential revenue losses. Lawmakers considered provisions to promote investment but required a budgetary offset to avoid increasing the deficit. Legislation also addressed issues related to the temporary payroll tax rate reduction and Environmental Protection Agency regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations include MACT standards for boiler and solid waste combustion units, flood insurance reform, spectrum reallocation, emergency communications, and the Keystone XL pipeline project."
