    "content": "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants immigration officials discretion over aliens' eligibility for various benefits or relief, including adjustment of legal status or work authorization in the United States. This discretion allows officials to determine eligibility for benefits and waive statutory requirements that may prevent aliens from obtaining relief. Additionally, the executive branch is authorized to grant certain benefits to aliens, not solely based on Congress granting discretion to waive restrictions. The executive branch has discretion to waive restrictions on benefits or relief for aliens, as authorized by Congress. This authority can play a significant role in immigration decisions, such as granting Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is relief from removal granted by the executive branch to aliens unable to safely return to their home countries due to ongoing armed conflicts, disasters, or other extraordinary conditions. To qualify for TPS, aliens must meet specific conditions, including continuous physical presence in the US since their home country's TPS designation date, continuous residence in the US, admissibility as an immigrant, and not being ineligible for TPS. TPS provides relief to aliens unable to return home due to conflicts or disasters. To qualify, aliens must meet conditions like continuous physical presence, admissibility, and not being ineligible. TPS grants work authorization and protection from removal. It can also aid in crafting immigration policy. The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows aliens from countries with displacement issues to stay in the United States, even if they don't qualify as refugees. This can lead to prolonged stays and work opportunities, potentially causing further migration. Additionally, discretionary authority under the INA grants employment authorization documents (EADs) to certain aliens, allowing them to work legally in the U.S. Unauthorized aliens are barred from employment under Section 274A of the INA. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to grant Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) to aliens, including those without lawful immigration status. Regulations allow for the issuance of EADs to aliens granted deferred action or other forms of relief from removal. This played a role in the Obama Administration's DACA initiative. DACA beneficiaries became eligible for EADs and driver's licenses due to their deferred action status. However, a court decision in 2015 questioned the expansion of the DACA program. The majority found that the DACA-like program, known as DAPA, would increase aliens eligible for work authorization, undermining Congress's goal of preserving jobs for lawful residents. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision without explanation. The discretionary waiver authority allows immigration authorities to exempt certain aliens from eligibility requirements for immigration benefits. Judicial review of waiver decisions is limited, but federal courts can review legal questions. The executive has some discretion in applying waivers when statutes are silent or ambiguous. The Obama Administration clarified the definition of \"extreme hardship\" for waivers of the 3- and 10-year bars for aliens unlawfully present in the US. Discretionary waiver authority is significant in applying grounds of inadmissibility under Section 212 of the INA. Some grounds of inadmissibility result in permanent bars to entry. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides grounds of inadmissibility that can permanently bar aliens from entering the United States, such as criminal offenses or fraud. In some cases, aliens may be barred for a specific period, like those unlawfully present for over 180 days. Immigration authorities can waive many of these grounds, especially for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Immigration officials can waive inadmissibility grounds for nonimmigrant visa applicants, allowing temporary entry to the US. Waivers do not grant eligibility for permanent immigrant visas or LPR status without further waivers. Examples include waivers for aliens unlawfully present for over 180 days if refusal would cause \"extreme hardship\" for a US citizen. Section 212(h) allows immigration officers to waive inadmissibility grounds for qualifying aliens, including those with convictions over 15 years old or whose denial of admission would cause \"extreme hardship\" for a U.S. citizen or LPR. However, waivers for aliens previously admitted as LPRs and seeking readmission are limited under Section 212(i). Section 212(i) permits waiver of inadmissibility grounds for aliens who committed fraud or misrepresentation, if denial of admission would cause \"extreme hardship\" to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent. Former Section 212(c) allowed LPRs to waive most grounds of inadmissibility when seeking reentry, with certain conditions. The waiver authority under Section 212(c) of the INA allowed LPRs to waive grounds of inadmissibility during deportation hearings. Even though this provision was removed in 1996, immigration officials still have discretion under Section 212(d)(5) to permit aliens to enter or remain in the US temporarily. This authority allows officials to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility for excludable aliens to be admitted into the US. Parole of aliens into the United States does not constitute \"admission\" for immigration purposes, allowing them to be present in the country without legal immigration status. However, some paroled aliens may be able to adjust to lawful permanent resident status and obtain work authorization. Parole authority has been authorized by statute since 1952, focusing on those whose entry into the country is permitted temporarily. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to parole aliens into the United States on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. Parole authority has been used to permit various groups of aliens to enter the country, including through advance parole for certain non-LPR aliens physically present in the US. \"Parole-in-place\" is granted to aliens without lawful immigration status, including spouses, children, or parents of U.S. Armed Forces members. This allows them to adjust status under Section 245 of the INA. The Obama Administration also paroled inventors, researchers, and entrepreneurs for public benefit. The Obama Administration granted parole-in-place to aliens without lawful immigration status, including spouses, children, or parents of U.S. Armed Forces members, allowing them to adjust status under Section 245 of the INA. The administration also paroled inventors, researchers, and entrepreneurs for public benefit, with actions involving greater consistency in determinations for advance parole and parole of certain unlawfully present family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs seeking to enlist in the armed forces. The executive branch has discretion in granting immigration benefits or relief, even in cases where the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is silent or ambiguous. Questions may arise about the consistency of these actions with historical practice, the INA, or Congress's intent. Granting Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) to all aliens is not expressly prohibited by the INA. Granting EADs to all aliens would be unprecedented and may conflict with Congress's provisions in the INA for protecting domestic labor. The executive branch has some independent authority in prosecuting violations of federal law. The executive branch has authority in prosecuting violations of federal law, including prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases. This discretion allows for decisions on removal proceedings, charges against aliens, cancellation of charging documents, and appeals of immigration judge decisions. Granting immigration benefits is not considered prosecutorial discretion but an authority delegated by Congress, typically based on humanitarian factors or resource constraints. A favorable exercise of discretion in immigration cases does not grant legal status but allows an alien to remain in the US, potentially leading to future legalization. Executive discretion includes decisions on issuing charging documents for removal proceedings. The use of discretion in immigration cases allows certain aliens to remain in the US without legal status, based on humanitarian factors or resource constraints. Examples include the INS's decision in 1962 to allow Cuban refugees to stay indefinitely. Sparse evidence of discretion use exists until the mid-1970s when the executive branch began issuing memoranda. Currently, the executive branch issues memoranda detailing specific aspects of immigration enforcement, such as priorities for removal. This includes not targeting schools or churches for immigration enforcement purposes and giving highest priority to aliens involved in terrorism, espionage, or criminal activities. The Obama Administration amended DHS's enforcement priorities in 2014, including targeting aliens involved in organized criminal gangs, felonies, and aggravated felonies. This action was not affected by the injunction on the DAPA program and DACA expansion. The executive's enforcement priorities are within DHS's discretion. The Obama Administration amended DHS's enforcement priorities in 2014, targeting aliens involved in organized criminal gangs, felonies, and aggravated felonies. This action was not affected by the injunction on the DAPA program and DACA expansion. The Administration also replaced the Secure Communities program with the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) in November 2014, focusing on aliens convicted of felonies or \"significant\" misdemeanors. PEP will not involve states and localities holding aliens after their release for initial arrests. Grants of deferred action to removable aliens have been in place since the 1970s, showing discretion in enforcing immigration law. Grants of deferred action to removable aliens have been in place since the 1970s, documented in the alien's immigration file and seen to govern unless circumstances change. Immigration officials may grant deferred action on their own initiative or upon request by aliens. Not issuing an NTA is not binding on other officers, unlike deferred action which historically holds unless circumstances change. Examples include the Obama Administration's DACA initiative. The Obama Administration's DACA initiative and the planned expansion of DACA and creation of DAPA for parents of U.S. citizens or LPRs involve grants of deferred action for a specified period of time, with explicit factors considered for eligibility. The Obama Administration's DACA initiative and the planned expansion of DACA and creation of DAPA involve grants of deferred action for specific categories of aliens. The determinations for deferred action are made on an individual basis, and no one is guaranteed deferred action even if they meet all the guidelines. The Administration continues to grant deferred action outside of DACA and DAPA on a smaller scale. The executive branch's enforcement discretion is under scrutiny. The executive branch's enforcement discretion is subject to limits, including the possibility of impermissible abdication of statutory duties as recognized in Heckler v. Cheney. The definition of abdication was not clearly defined, and inadequate enforcement may not constitute a reviewable abdication of duty. The appellate court clarified that the executive must either be \"doing nothing to enforce the laws\" or have \"consciously decided to abdicate\" its enforcement responsibilities. A federal district court distinguished a case involving the 2014 DAPA initiative and DACA expansion as \"abdication by any meaningful measure,\" not just \"mere ineffective enforcement.\" The court considered the government's announcement not to seek removal of certain aliens and the large number eligible for the initiatives. The plaintiffs could not solely challenge based on \"the abdication of duty.\" The court did not find that the plaintiffs could challenge based on \"abdication standing.\" The decision to enjoin the Administration from implementing the 2014 deferred action initiatives was due to a procedural violation of the APA. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision, citing violations of the APA both substantively and procedurally. The question of whether DAPA and DACA expansion represent an \"abdication\" of the executive's duties was not directly addressed. The Fifth Circuit found a substantive violation of the APA in relation to DAPA and the DACA expansion, stating that Congress had addressed the issues at hand. The court also deemed the executive's interpretation as \"unreasonable\" and contrary to INA provisions regarding aliens entering the US, relief from removal, and work authorization. The Fifth Circuit found a violation of the APA in relation to DAPA and DACA expansion, stating that Congress had addressed the issues. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision. Another limitation involves statutory mandates that exercises of prosecutorial discretion could violate, such as DACA conflicting with certain provisions in the INA. The Fifth Circuit found that Section 235 of the INA mandates detention for removal proceedings if an alien is not clearly entitled to admission. The court later dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, which was upheld by the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit did not directly address Section 235 in its decision but stated that it directs immigration agents to detain aliens for removal proceedings without limiting the Department of Homeland Security's authority to pursue removal after detention. The Fifth Circuit's view on whether to pursue the removal of detained aliens is not always mandatory, as shown in a 2011 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. The BIA noted that discretion exists for immigration officers in choosing between expedited or formal removal proceedings, despite the use of \"shall\" in the INA. This contrasts with the Federal criminal code, where \"shall\" mandates punishment for certain conduct. The executive branch has discretion in interpreting and applying immigration laws, as explained in the Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council case. When Congress has clearly spoken on an issue, both the court and agency must follow its intent. However, in cases where a statute is unclear, courts typically defer to agency interpretations. This allows the executive branch to fill any gaps left by Congress in administering the law. The executive branch has discretion in interpreting and applying immigration laws, with deference given to agency interpretations when statutes are unclear. This allows the executive branch to fill any gaps left by Congress in administering the law, affecting the implementation of immigration law without the need for additional legislation. The executive branch has discretion in interpreting and applying immigration laws, with deference given to agency interpretations when statutes are unclear. This includes provisions in the PRWORA that restrict noncitizens' eligibility for certain public benefits, determined through regulations rather than explicit statutory definitions. The executive branch has discretion in interpreting and applying immigration laws, with deference given to agency interpretations when statutes are unclear. This includes provisions in the PRWORA that restrict noncitizens' eligibility for certain public benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, food stamps, and the state Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) at the Department of Justice has opined that the executive's regulations on defining \"federal means-tested public benefits\" would likely be viewed as entitled to deference by a court, despite questions about including only mandatory spending programs. OLC viewed factors as less weight than Congress's decision not to define \"federal means-tested public benefits\" in PRWORA. OLC cited the interpretation canon and provisions struck from the Senate-passed version. PRWORA should be construed in light of reconciliation rules that shaped its enactment. The enactment of PRWORA was shaped by reconciliation rules, which limited consideration of provisions affecting discretionary spending. OLC's interpretation on aliens adjusting to LPR status after accruing unlawful presence has not been challenged in court. The BIA's interpretation of \"departure\" for aliens with unlawful presence has evolved over the years, allowing some aliens granted advance parole to adjust their status under Section 245 of the INA. The BIA's interpretation of \"departure\" for aliens with unlawful presence has evolved, allowing some aliens granted advance parole to adjust their status under Section 245 of the INA. The BIA distinguished cases where aliens left the US with advance parole from those who departed without permission, leading to a reconsideration of the implications of inadmissibility under Section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II). After further review, the BIA concluded that Congress did not intend this section to apply to aliens who left and returned to the US with advance parole. The BIA's interpretation of \"departure\" for aliens with unlawful presence has evolved, allowing some aliens granted advance parole to adjust their status under Section 245 of the INA. The BIA held that aliens leaving the US with advance parole do not make a \"departure\" for purposes of Section 212(a)(9)(B)(i). The executive branch has discretion in interpreting immigration law when the INA is silent or ambiguous, but this discretion is not unlimited and must be a \"permissible\" and \"reasonable\" interpretation. The Supreme Court has ruled that agency interpretations must be \"permissible\" and \"reasonable\" to receive deference. Concerns arise when new interpretations conflict with long-standing ones, potentially leading to arbitrary changes. Inconsistencies in agency regulations may not be a basis for rejecting interpretations under the Chevron framework, but unexplained inconsistencies could be deemed arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that agencies can modify interpretive rules without notice-and-comment rulemaking. Some argue that certain executive actions on immigration may qualify for the \"major policy\" exception to Chevron deference, based on the significance of the policy change. This exception is rooted in the Court's 2000 decision in FDA v. Brown & Williamson. The Brown & Williamson Court suggested denying deference in \"extraordinary cases\" involving \"major questions.\" The \"major policy\" exception was limited by the Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, but played a role in the 2015 decision in King v. Burwell. The Fifth Circuit used this exception to rule that executive actions on immigration exceeded authority. The executive's authority in the field of immigration has long been of interest to Congress. Questions have arisen regarding specific actions announced by the Obama Administration in 2014, as well as in the past and are likely to recur in the future. The executive's authority in immigration is based on three types of discretion: express delegations of authority, enforcement discretion, and interpreting and applying statutes. Each type of authority has constraints that must be considered. The executive's authority in immigration is subject to constraints. Statutory authority must align with delegation terms, enforcement discretion may be limited by specific mandates, and agencies must adhere to Congress's intent in interpreting statutes. Express adoption of policies that neglect statutory duties could be impermissible."
