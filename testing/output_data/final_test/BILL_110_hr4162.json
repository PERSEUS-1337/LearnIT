    "content": "The \"San Bernardino Biomass Use Facilitation Act\" aims to facilitate a land exchange between the Federal Government and San Bernardino County, California. This exchange will provide land for biomass utilization facilities, biomass recycling activities, and industrial resource recovery and recycling activities in the county. The \"San Bernardino Biomass Use Facilitation Act\" defines key terms like County, Federal land, Non-federal land, and Secretary. It allows for a land exchange between the County and the Secretary of Agriculture for biomass utilization facilities and industrial resource recovery activities. The County will exchange approximately 71 acres of non-Federal land for approximately 53 acres of Federal land without further environmental analysis. The exchange is subject to any valid existing rights and additional terms required by the Secretary. The Federal land and non-Federal land exchange will be described on maps available for public inspection. The land exchange should be completed within one year of the enactment of the Act and will be valued through an appraisal process. Equal value and cash equalization will be considered in the exchange. The land exchange under this section must be for equal value, or values can be equalized by a cash payment. The County or Secretary can equalize values with a cash payment without limit. Cash payments received by the Secretary will be deposited in a specific fund for future use. The Secretary can use funds from various sources for land acquisition for the San Bernardino National Forest. Title to non-Federal land must meet Attorney General's standards for Federal land acquisitions before exchange. The Secretary will inspect non-Federal lands to ensure they meet Federal standards, including hazardous materials and land surveys. Implementation costs for the land exchange will be shared equally by the Secretary and the County. The acquired non-Federal land will be managed according to the Weeks Act and other relevant laws. Additionally, the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail relocation will be addressed. Before completing the land exchange, the Secretary will relocate a portion of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail to adjacent National Forest System land without further environmental analysis."
