    "content": "The \"Community Pharmacy Fairness Act of 2007\" allows independent pharmacies to negotiate with health plans without violating antitrust laws. Independent pharmacies negotiating with health plans are entitled to the same antitrust treatment as recognized bargaining units under the National Labor Relations Act. They are treated as employees engaged in concerted activities and protected for good faith actions taken in connection with negotiations. The exemption under subsection (a) shields independent pharmacies from criminal sanctions and civil penalties beyond actual damages. This exemption only applies to pharmacies excluded from the National Labor Relations Act and does not alter any provisions of that Act. The exemption is effective from the enactment date and does not protect agreements that boycott or exclude independent pharmacies. The section prohibits actions that could harm independent pharmacies, such as market allocation, tying products or services, or monopolizing a market. It does not apply to negotiations between independent pharmacies and health plans.
