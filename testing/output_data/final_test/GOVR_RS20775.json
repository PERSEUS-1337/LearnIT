    "content": "Congress has found that using its power of the purse is an effective way to influence the President's decisions on military deployments. Funding cutoffs and restrictions have been used to limit the use of U.S. military force abroad, proving more effective than the War Powers Resolution. During the final years of the Vietnam War, Congress attempted to restrict military actions in the Indochina region to compel the withdrawal of U.S. forces. Despite opposition from the President, some proposals were enacted into law, such as the Special Foreign Assistance Act of 1971 which prohibited the introduction of U.S. ground combat troops into Cambodia. This use of funding restrictions has proven more effective than the War Powers Resolution in influencing military deployments. The President signed legislation cutting off funds for combat activities in Indochina after August 15, 1973, prohibiting support for combat activities in Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam by U.S. forces. The President signed legislation on July 1, 1973, and December 30, 1974, cutting off funds for combat activities in Indochina and setting personnel ceilings for U.S. forces in Vietnam. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY1994 and FY1995 imposed funding limitations on U.S. military deployments overseas, specifically in Somalia. These limitations included cutting off funding for combat forces in Somalia after March 31, 1994, except for a limited number of military personnel to protect American diplomatic personnel and citizens. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY1994 and FY1995 imposed funding limitations on U.S. military deployments overseas, specifically in Somalia, including cutting off funding for combat forces after March 31, 1994. The Act also prohibited the continuous presence of U.S. military personnel in Somalia after September 30, 1994, except for protecting American personnel. Congress further restricted funds for U.S. military participation in Operation Support Hope in Rwanda after October 7, 1994, unless necessary to protect American citizens. Despite the War Powers Resolution enacted in 1973, no successful instance has occurred where Congress compelled the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from foreign deployments against the President's will. President Reagan believed the War Powers Resolution was unconstitutional, but compromised with Congress in 1983 for the Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution. Despite this, 241 U.S. Marines were killed in Lebanon in 1983. Reagan announced their redeployment in 1984. President Reagan announced the Marines' redeployment in 1984, ending U.S. participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon. President Bush deployed U.S. military personnel to Saudi Arabia in 1990 without Congress authorization, leading to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution in 1991. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution in 1991 provided specific statutory authorization for the President to use US Armed Forces to achieve objectives set out in UN Resolutions related to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, with a certification to Congress. President Bush clarified that this authorization did not change the executive branch's long-standing positions on the President's constitutional authority to use the Armed Forces. The President and Congress had differences on the issue of congressional authorization for military actions, particularly in the context of U.S. military involvement in Kosovo. President Clinton's notification to Congress about air strikes against Yugoslavia sparked a debate on the President's authority to order combat activity abroad without Congressional authorization. The President's decision to commence air strikes against Yugoslavia without Congressional authorization led to debates on using the War Powers Resolution to support or overturn the actions. Congress also tried to deny funding for the Kosovo operation, with the House passing a bill prohibiting the deployment of ground forces in Yugoslavia without specific authorization. On April 28, 1999, the House defeated a resolution to declare war on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A lawsuit was filed on April 30, 1999, seeking authorization from Congress before continuing military action. On May 4, 1999, the Senate tabled a joint resolution authorizing military action against Yugoslavia. On May 6, 1999, the House defeated an amendment to prohibit the use of U.S. ground forces in Yugoslavia. Congress cleared an emergency appropriations bill for the Kosovo operation on May 20, 1999. In May 1999, a bill provided funding for the U.S. Kosovo operation. On the 60th day, Representative Tom Campbell sued, claiming a violation of the War Powers Resolution. President Clinton did not seek a 30-day extension and argued the resolution was constitutionally flawed. The lawsuit was dismissed on June 8, 1999. The court ruled that Representative Campbell lacked legal standing to sue President Clinton for conducting military activities in Yugoslavia without Congress authorization. Campbell appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which affirmed the District Court's decision. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case on October 2, 2000. The United States Supreme Court refused to hear Representative Campbell's appeal, letting stand the U.S. Court of Appeals' decision regarding military activities in Yugoslavia. Congress has used funding restrictions to limit foreign military operations, as seen in legislation related to Angola and Nicaragua. In 1976, legislative bans were imposed on covert assistance to paramilitary forces in Angola. The Defense Department Appropriations Act for FY1976 imposed funding restrictions on activities involving Angola, which were later made permanent in the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976. This legislation prohibited any assistance that could enhance military capabilities of nations, groups, or individuals. The Defense Department Appropriations Act for FY1976 imposed funding restrictions on activities involving Angola, prohibiting any military assistance without congressional authorization. This included a provision for the President to report to Congress if aid was deemed necessary for national security interests. Additionally, the Foreign Assistance Act for FY1976 stated that no funds could be used for military assistance to Angola. In 1984, controversy over U.S. assistance to the opponents of the Nicaraguan government led to a prohibition on military support in a continuing appropriations bill. The legislation stated that no funds could be used for military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organization, movement, or individual. In 1985, the President could spend $14 million on military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua if Congress approved it."
