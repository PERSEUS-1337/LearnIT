The Drug-Free Families Act of 1999 findings show a significant increase in drug use among adolescents and young adults by 1979, with high percentages using illicit drugs in their lifetime and in the past month, including daily marijuana use among high school seniors. Between 1972 and 1978, a nationwide political campaign led to the decriminalization of marijuana in 11 states, which reinforced the belief that marijuana was relatively harmless. This led to the emergence of \"head shops\" selling drug paraphernalia. Between 1977 and 1980, national parent drug-prevention organizations emerged to help parents form local prevention groups, as drug education materials promoted the responsible use of illicit drugs. The parent drug-prevention movement, with 4,000 local groups nationwide, aims to prevent drug use, persuade users to stop, and help addicts recover for drug-free lives. Parents educate themselves and their children about drug dangers, set expectations, and establish consequences for drug use. The parent drug-prevention movement, with 4,000 local groups nationwide, aims to prevent drug use, persuade users to stop, and help addicts recover for drug-free lives. It helped parents form groups to set guidelines to protect children from drugs, stopped efforts to decriminalize marijuana, and worked for laws to ban drug paraphernalia sales. The parent drug-prevention movement, with 4,000 local groups nationwide, aims to prevent drug use and help addicts recover for drug-free lives. Drug legalization organizations challenged paraphernalia laws in Federal courts until the early 1980's when the Supreme Court upheld Nebraska's law. The movement insisted on drug-education materials conveying a strong no-use message in compliance with medical and scientific information. It encouraged various sectors of society to join the drug prevention effort. The parent drug-prevention movement, along with various sectors of society, including the criminal justice community, faith community, and political leaders, collaborated to reduce drug use among young people. Between 1979 and 1992, their efforts led to a significant decrease in illicit drug use and daily marijuana use among adolescents and young adults. Additionally, the movement increased high school seniors' awareness of the harmful effects of marijuana. The decrease in drug use led to the disbandment of parent groups, creating a vacuum filled by a drug-legalization movement advocating for various proposals to weaken and repeal drug laws. Additionally, proponents are now advocating for maintaining addicts on the drugs they are addicted to. During the 1990's, the message promoting drug use has led to an increase in adolescent drug use, reversing previous reductions. Today's parents are often busy working, leaving little time for volunteering, resulting in various family structures where children are raised by grandparents, aunts, uncles, or foster parents. Several national parent and family drug-prevention organizations have formed the Parent Collaboration to address challenges in reaching parents today and prevent drug use among children. The key goal is to motivate parents to coordinate with local anti-drug coalitions and collaborate with various governmental and private agencies, as well as leaders from different sectors. The Parent Collaboration aims to motivate parents to work with anti-drug coalitions and government agencies to prevent drug use among children. The Act aims to build a movement to prevent drug use among children, reduce drug abuse in adolescents, increase awareness of the harmful effects of drugs, educate society on the importance of a no-use message, and enhance collaboration between parents and others in protecting children from drug-related issues. The Act aims to prevent drug use among children by providing resources for a national campaign to mobilize parents and families through information, training, and other services. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, administrative costs refer to the costs incurred by the assigned Federal agency to administer the grant to the Parent Collaboration. The Administrator is defined as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. A no-use message means no illegal drug use or illegal use of legal drugs for children and adolescents. The Parent Collaboration is a legal entity established by National Families in Action. The Code of 1986, established by various groups, requires organizations to have a primary mission of preventing drug use among children and families for at least 5 years. They must base their missions on a strong no-use message in compliance with relevant laws. The Code of 1986 requires organizations to prevent drug use among children and families by following relevant laws and building a new parent and family movement against illegal drugs. The Administrator will grant funds to the Parents Collaboration for a 5-year national campaign to prevent drug abuse among children. $5,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2000 through 2004, with up to 5% for administrative costs."
