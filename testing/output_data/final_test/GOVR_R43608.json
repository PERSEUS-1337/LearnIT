    "content": "The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet by nearly 1,000 points before quickly rebounding. This event highlighted flaws in the market structure and led to increased scrutiny of high-frequency trading (HFT), an algorithmic securities trading method. HFT, which lacks a formal definition, has raised concerns about market fragility, systemic risk, and the quality of securities. The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, raised concerns about high-frequency trading (HFT) and its impact on market fragility, systemic risk, and securities quality. HFT may constitute illegal front-running and create a two-tiered trading system benefiting some traders at the expense of others. Congressional interest in the Flash Crash stems from the SEC's responsibility for investor protection and maintaining fair markets. In the 113th Congress, legislation such as S. 410, H.R. 880, and H.R. 1579 proposed securities transaction taxes on high-frequency trading (HFT) to regulate the market. H.R. 2292 aimed to define HFT in derivatives markets, require registration with the CFTC, and impose civil penalties for non-compliance. The CFTC may impose civil penalties for violations of HFT regulations based on the duration of the violation. Congressional oversight has addressed HFT and the Flash Crash, with studies from the CFTC and SEC exploring HFT and proposing further regulation. Interest in HFT has increased due to the book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis. The DOJ, FBI, CFTC, SEC, and other agencies are investigating HFT firms for potential insider trading violations. The book \"Flash Boys\" by Michael Lewis has brought attention to the issue, with allegations of \"legalized front-running\" by HFT firms. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced a specific investigation into HFT practices. The FBI is investigating HFT firms for potential front-running, market manipulation, and illegal insider trading. They are seeking evidence from traders and stock-exchange workers. This probe is part of a larger effort that has already resulted in 79 convictions related to insider trading. The New York Attorney General enforces the state's securities law, including the Martin Act. The New York Attorney General, under the Martin Act, is investigating whether stock exchanges give high-frequency trading (HFT) firms unfair advantages. Deals with entities providing early news releases to HFT traders have been suspended. The Attorney General has also subpoenaed several HFT firms. The Attorney General is investigating whether HFT firms have an unfair advantage. City of Providence is suing market entities for fraud and market manipulation, diverting billions of dollars annually. The suit alleges collusion with brokerage firms and HFT firms. The civil case alleges that HFT has diverted billions of dollars from investors to market centers, brokerage firms, and HFT firms. William F. Galvin has sent inquiries to investment advisers regarding their HFT practices. SEC is conducting ongoing investigations into various market activities. The SEC is involved in ongoing investigations related to market integrity and structure issues, including high-frequency traders and automated trading. SEC Chair Mary Jo White expressed concerns about aggressive trading strategies in vulnerable market conditions, prompting the development of recommendations for an anti-disruptive trading rule. The SEC is investigating market integrity and structure issues, focusing on high-frequency traders and automated trading. SEC Chair Mary Jo White is concerned about aggressive trading strategies in vulnerable market conditions, leading to the development of recommendations for an anti-disruptive trading rule. The SEC is also considering subjecting unregistered active proprietary traders to SEC rules as dealers and eliminating exceptions for off-exchange venue traders. Recommendations are being prepared to improve firms' risk management of trading algorithms and enhance regulatory oversight. The CFTC is deliberating on potential regulatory intervention to address these issues. The CFTC is responding to concerns about potentially abusive HFT practices and investigating market manipulation under federal securities laws. The report provides an overview of equities HFT, recent probes and investigations, how it works, perceived benefits and disadvantages, the Flash Crash of 2010, SEC and EU regulatory initiatives, and domestic HFT regulatory ideas under discussion. The report focuses on equities HFT, which is a subset of algorithmic trading used in the financial industry. HFT has no legal definition and involves computer algorithms making trading decisions automatically. The CFTC is also looking into HFT in derivatives and regulatory developments. High frequency trading (HFT) is a significant market structure development involving professional traders using high-speed computer programs for generating trades. Other characteristics include short time-frames for positions, use of co-location services, and ending the trading day with minimal positions. The CFTC Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) advises on the impact of technological innovations on financial services and futures markets. Attributes of HFT include algorithmic decision-making, low-latency technology, high-speed market connections, and high-message rates. Some securities regulators and the CFTC are debating the need for a formal definition of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) to better understand market structure issues. There are differing opinions on whether a clear distinction between HFT and automated trading can be made for regulatory purposes. Some argue that defining High-Frequency Trading (HFT) would be challenging due to the need for arbitrary performance thresholds and complex data collection. The SEC staff highlights difficulties in differentiating HFT from other forms of algorithmic trading using market-wide proxies like high message rates and order cancellations. Algorithmic trading, including HFT, is a significant part of today's markets. Various computer-assisted trading tools, such as smart order routing systems and automated trading systems, play a role in generating market activity. These tools may not fit the strict definition of HFT but still enable orders to be executed in ways beyond human capacity. Alternative trading systems (ATSs) are also essential components in the market structure. Alternative trading systems (ATSs) are key components of the securities market where HFT operates. ATSs, including electronic communication networks (ECNs) and dark pools, match orders of buyers and sellers using established methods. Regulation ATS, implemented by the SEC in 1998, aimed to promote competition and innovation in these systems. In 2013, 35 broker-dealers operated 44 ATSs actively trading exchange-listed securities. In 2013, 35 broker-dealers operated 44 ATSs actively trading exchange-listed stocks, including ECNs like INET and Archipelago. ECNs publicly display best orders and allow quotes to be accessed by investors. Some ECNs have merged with exchanges like BATS and Direct Edge. ATSs, including ECNs, have gained market shares in equity trading through the years. Dark pools, a type of ATS, operate without providing quotes to the public stream, attracting institutional investors seeking anonymity in trading large blocks of shares. Approximately 40 dark pools exist, with some owned by broker-dealers who use their order flow for price discovery. Dark pools, such as Credit Suisse's CrossFinder and Goldman Sachs' Sigma X, provide price discovery by using order flow. Examples of agency broker dark pools include Liquidnet and ITG Posit, while exchange-owned dark pools are offered by BATS and the NYSE. Electronic market maker dark pools, like those operated by Getco and Knight, do not provide price discovery as they do not calculate transaction prices from the national best bid and offer. Dark pools, under Regulation ATS, must register as exchanges with the SEC or as broker-dealers with FINRA. They are subject to the same rules as trading on an exchange or by a broker-dealer. Concerns have been raised about dark pools contributing to market uncertainty, but former SEC commissioner Roel Campos stated that they must reflect the last, best price for a security. In \"Flash Boys,\" Michael Lewis discusses large broker-dealers using dark pools for customer orders, where best price execution is unclear due to opacity. Sullivan and Russello highlight dark pools' potential for improper trading, citing an insider trading case involving SAC Capital Advisors. DOJ and SEC complaints revealed allegedly unlawful trades executed quietly through algorithms and dark pools. The authors discuss the potential misuse of dark pools for unlawful trading, citing concerns raised by SEC Chair Mary Jo White about ongoing investigations. FINRA rules now require ATS to publicly report trading volume information to improve transparency in dark pools. High-frequency trading (HFT) is carried out using supercomputers. High-frequency trading (HFT) involves supercomputers executing trades with extremely low latency. Traders aim to earn small profits per trade, with some strategies based on the law of averages. While some strategies may only be profitable 51% of the time, the high frequency of trades can still result in overall profitability. HFT traders use a variety of passive and aggressive trading strategies. Passive and aggressive trading strategies in high-frequency trading (HFT) involve different approaches. Passive strategies, like market making, inject liquidity into the markets by providing limit orders. On the other hand, aggressive HFT involves market orders or marketable limit orders that do not add liquidity and may remove liquidity-producing limit orders. Some argue that public policy concerns should focus on the aggressive form of HFT, as the passive form tends to improve price and liquidity. Passive HFT tends to result in price and liquidity improvements compared to aggressive HFT. A study found that aggressive HFTs earn higher returns than passive HFTs, with aggressive HFTs earning an annualized alpha of 90.67% while passive firms earn 23.22%. Market making is a common HFT strategy where firms provide liquidity by matching buyer and seller orders or trading through their own inventories. Market makers profit from the bid-ask spread. Some HFT firms engage in market making by posting limit orders to buy and sell securities, receiving liquidity rebates in return. Arbitrage trading involves profiting from price differences between different market centers or securities. Slow market arbitrage exploits minute price differences between exchanges due to small time discrepancies. Pair arbitrage trading involves exploiting relative price discrepancies between closely related companies. Momentum ignition strategies aim to cause rapid up or down securities price movements by initiating a series of orders. Liquidity detection trading uses computer algorithms to identify large institutional orders in dark pools or other stock order trading venues. HFT traders may submit small-sized exploratory trading orders to detect orders from large institutional investors. Flash Boys describes how HFT traders use liquidity detection to gain intelligence on large institutional orders in dark pools, allowing them to trade ahead of these orders for profit. Broker-dealers like Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley sold access to HFT firms to trade against orders in dark pools, exploiting the predictability and size of these orders. Flash Boys describes how HFT firms use liquidity detection strategies like pinging to gain an advantage over large institutional orders in dark pools. By placing buy and sell offers in 100-share lots, HFT traders can outmaneuver buy side orders and profit from the information they receive through pings. This allows them to act as the counterparty to the buy side order and profitably trade ahead of it. Some market participants view pinging as a way for HFT firms to bait institutional investors into revealing their order intentions. However, SEC officials suggest that traditional buy side trading is becoming as complex as HFT firms. Blackrock, a major buy side firm, acknowledges the risk of inflated transaction costs due to predatory HFT activity but employs strategies to mitigate this risk. Various strategies are used to mitigate predatory HFT activity, involving technology, trading tactics, and transaction cost analysis. Major types of HFT practitioners include traditional broker-dealers, bank holding companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, independent proprietary trading firms like Getco and Virtu, and hedge funds such as Citadel and Renaissance Technologies. HFT occurs in various securities classes, including equities, options, derivatives, fixed income securities, and foreign currencies. In the domestic equities arena, the volume of HFT has leveled off in recent years. HFT firms dominated domestic stock trades from 2008 to 2011, but their share may have decreased to half by 2012. Profits and revenues of HFT firms have declined significantly, with average profits dropping from a tenth to a twentieth of a penny per share traded. Domestic HFT revenues fell from $7.2 billion in 2009 to $1.3 billion in 2014. Mark Gorton of Tower Research Capital noted that profits have collapsed in the changing HFT landscape. HFT firms have seen diminishing profits due to various factors such as increased competition in technology and higher fees from securities exchanges. Raj Fernando of Chopper Trading noted that margins on trades are no longer covering expenses for many firms. The promise of high profits led to oversaturation in the market, making it harder to make money. HFT firms face challenges as trading volumes decline and competition increases, leading to diminishing profits. Research shows that a few HFT firms accumulate trading profits disproportionately, creating a winner-takes-all industry structure. New firms entering HFT earn fewer profits and are more likely to exit due to intense competition dominated by a small number of fast HFT practitioners. The HFT industry is dominated by a small number of fast firms due to technological advances and for-profit market trading centers selling faster access. Regulatory changes by the SEC, such as Decimalization in 2000, have also promoted the growth of HFT. Regulatory changes by the SEC, such as Decimalization in 2000, made traditional market making less profitable and increased demand for computerized trading devices. The SEC also implemented Regulation Alternative Trading System in 1998 and Regulation National Market System in 2005 to improve market execution and access to market data. These regulations contributed to the development of Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) and fragmented the market centers, benefiting certain HFT arbitrage strategies. Reg NMS rules aim to ensure best buy/sell prices for investors by eliminating trading through orders at worse prices. The rules also improve access to trade quotations and market data, leading to a fragmented trading marketplace with 13 exchanges and 40 dark pools. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms often exploit these rules for arbitrage strategies. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms exploit fragmented markets with 13 exchanges and 40 dark pools. There is vigorous debate on the costs and benefits of HFT strategies, with a focus on differentiating predatory practices from those benefiting end-investors. Electronic market making, a type of HFT, provides benefits such as tighter spreads and intermediation in the trading landscape. High-frequency trading (HFT) involves low latency, automated order management, and diverse trading strategies. It is difficult to distinguish from other computer-based trading tools like algorithms. HFT is not solely passive market making but encompasses a range of strategies, helping asset managers achieve best execution for clients. Market making strategies in high-frequency trading (HFT) involve liquidity providing orders on order books. The level and nature of HFT activity can vary across different stocks. Arguments both in support of and critical of HFT exist, with supportive arguments highlighting market quality and its monetary implications for investors. Arguments in support of HFT include improved market quality, narrowed bid-ask spreads, increased liquidity, reduced price volatility, and enhanced price discovery processes. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) involves a price reversal strategy where traders quickly buy securities after price drops and sell them after price increases. This can help detect price anomalies and stabilize prices. Research suggests that passive HFT strategies have improved market quality metrics like bid-ask spreads and liquidity. However, other factors like market structure changes and technological advancements also played a role in these improvements. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) strategies have contributed to improving market quality metrics like bid-ask spreads and liquidity. Market volatility, the frequency and magnitude of asset fluctuations, can be influenced by HFT. Some HFT strategies aim to profit from volatile markets, but research shows instances where HFT helped reduce volatility during turbulent times. Passive HFT strategies tend to decrease intraday volatility, although studies have conflicting findings on the overall impact of HFT on volatility. HFT may not be fostering unduly fast markets, as concerns about rapid trading reducing market transparency have been raised. Data from the SEC's Office of Analytics suggest that investors can access short-lived quotes. Sell side's use of HFT-related strategies may not be the whole picture, according to a SEC official's speech in March 2014. The SEC received market data analysis suggesting that the buy side is becoming as complex in trading as sell side firms in HFT. This challenges the notion that HFT significantly disadvantages institutional investors. Concerns about HFT include lack of dependable liquidity and potential market liquidity deterioration from HFT firms incurring large losses. High-frequency trades can quickly incur large losses and may not provide comparable liquidity to traditional market makers. These trades often lack depth due to small quote sizes and no market-making obligation. HFT firms tend to focus on securities of large companies, neglecting smaller ones. However, analysis shows that HFT traders provide liquidity when spreads are wide, demand it when narrow, and overall stabilize liquidity over time. Phantom Liquidity is a criticism of HFT where provided liquidity is fleeting, known as \"phantom liquidity\" or \"flickering quotes.\" Speed differences between trading venues and order book dynamics contribute to this issue, leading to concerns about increased trading costs for institutional investors. Former SEC Chair Mary Schapiro acknowledged the challenges in evaluating transient liquidity due to HFT practices. The SEC and regulators are investigating practices related to cancelled orders in high-frequency trading to determine if they violate rules. Some argue that cancellations are logical market responses when orders don't get favorable execution. Concerns exist about the impact on price discovery and capital markets, with suggestions for additional regulations to ensure fair and orderly markets. The SEC is investigating high-frequency trading practices related to canceled orders to determine rule violations. Concerns exist about the impact on price discovery and capital markets, with suggestions for additional regulations to ensure fair and orderly markets. An analysis of 2013 market data found that high cancellation rates reflect robust competition between market makers, including HFT firms, vying for trade execution priority. About 39% of canceled orders were active for one-half of one second or less, with 27% of executed trades resulting from another trader accessing posted orders within that time frame. The SEC is investigating high-frequency trading practices related to canceled orders to determine rule violations. Concerns exist about the impact on price discovery and capital markets, with suggestions for additional regulations to ensure fair and orderly markets. An official suggested potential takeaways, including the alignment of canceled orders and executed trades speeds, the dominance of HFT in stock exchanges may be overstated, and regulations to reduce high cancellation rates would also affect trading speeds of liquidity \"takers.\" Insider trading is illegal and regulated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 prohibit insider trading. The 1934 Act requires disgorgement of short-swing profits by insiders and has a general antifraud provision used to sanction insider trading. FINRA prohibits illegal front-running by members or associated persons with material non-public market information. The DOJ and FBI are involved in enforcing these regulations. The DOJ and FBI are investigating whether HFT traders engaged in front-running and insider trading. A University of Michigan report suggests that HFT algorithms can exploit market disparities before they are public. HFTs use direct connections to exchanges for faster data access, bypassing the slower SIP feed. This allows them to act on market orders before they are reflected in the NBBO. High-frequency traders (HFTs) cannot front-run customers as they do not have access to order information before it's in the market. SEC Chair Mary Jo White clarified the distinction between legal HFT trading based on public information and illegal front-running. If federal prosecutors pursue cases of HFT front-running, they may face legal challenges related to insider trading laws. HFTs aim to get the best prices by executing trades ahead of others. High-frequency traders aim to get the best prices by executing trades ahead of others, similar to front-running. They gather order information by \"pinging\" different markets to determine stock direction. Proving market manipulation against them is challenging as intent to affect prices must be shown. High-frequency traders seek the best price advantage, not necessarily to manipulate prices. High-frequency traders can trade ahead of others without driving prices, often with no real interest in underlying company values. Proving intent to defraud is difficult due to the rapid algorithmic decision-making. These traders pay for differential access to market center technology, including direct data feeds and colocation services for faster trading. High-frequency traders gain an advantage by using direct data feeds and colocation services to access market data faster than others, allowing them to make rapid algorithmic decisions and trade ahead of the competition without impacting prices. Some argue that HFT firms gain an unfair advantage by using direct data feeds and colocation services to access market data faster than conventional traders, leading to competitive disadvantages. Others point out that differential access to market information has always existed, and the benefits of direct feeds and colocation are available to those willing to pay for them. Some argue that the cost-benefit tradeoff for investing in high-frequency trading tools is more favorable for well-capitalized traders. Market centers customize order types for HFT firms to optimize trading protocols. Market centers offer various order types to all customers, aiming to attract more volume and compete for market share. Research shows numerous order types available, with thousands effectively existing through combinations. Former HFT practitioner Haim Bodek praised the industry for moving in the right direction regarding order types. Market centers have been improving order types, aiming to eliminate all problematic orders by the end of 2014. The SEC is reviewing the development, approval, and monitoring of customized order types. Concerns include potential market manipulation by HFT firms through manipulative strategies like quote cancellations. FINRA is prioritizing surveillance of abusive algorithms, particularly focusing on \"momentum ignition strategies.\" FINRA is concerned about market manipulation through \"momentum ignition strategies\" like layering and spoofing, where artificial supply and demand are created to drive stock prices up or down. HFT firms use these strategies to benefit from inflated or reduced securities prices. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms engage in spoofing by placing large orders to manipulate stock prices and profit from the resulting bargain prices. The SEC and CFTC have prosecuted spoofing offenders, but detecting this practice is challenging. Small investors may be harmed by HFT, as they are often unaware of the manipulation and lack control over their orders. Investors, including big ones, had no control over their orders. When sending orders to banks like Bank of America, the banks treated the orders as their own. The big Wall Street banks controlled stock market orders and dark pools where orders could be executed. They often routed orders to their own dark pools before the wider market, allowing them to trade against orders or sell access to high frequency traders. Access to dark pools and high frequency traders is a concern for investors. Research shows that small investors incur the most costs from high frequency trading. However, Blackrock, a major buy side firm, believes that retail investors are generally not negatively impacted by HFT. They argue that most retail orders are not routed to stock exchanges where they could encounter HFT. The majority of retail orders are filled internally within large wholesalers like UBS, Citadel, KCG, and Citigroup, avoiding fees for sending orders to exchanges. In 2012, Canadian regulators increased fees on market messages, affecting high-frequency traders more as they transmit more messages. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, the number of messages fell by 30%. The study on the Toronto Stock Exchange found that the number of messages decreased by 30%, leading to a 10% increase in bid-ask spreads. Retail investors may see their intraday trading losses grow with the presumed decline in high-frequency trading (HFT) activity. Day traders are more likely to be affected by HFT compared to \"buy and hold\" investors. Retail investors who interact with the market through institutional investors like pension and mutual funds may also be impacted by HFT. The report discusses the impact of HFT on institutional investors, highlighting liquidity detection strategies used by HFT firms. A micro market structure analysis identified four types of HFT trading counterparties: fundamental traders, non-HFT market makers, small traders, and opportunistic traders. The study found that fundamental traders incurred the least cost to HFT, while small traders incurred the most. Institutional investors' exposures to HFT may vary, with index mutual funds likely among the least affected. A survey in 2014 found that over 51% of respondents considered HFT to be harmful. The Vanguard Group expressed an optimistic view of HFT, believing that the majority of high-frequency traders play within the rules. AQR Capital Management, an institutional investor, believes high-frequency traders add value to the market by connecting fragmented centers. They state that HFT has reduced costs and potentially increased investment opportunities. Concerns about the speed of HFT trades have been raised, with some viewing it as unnecessary and possibly risky. High-frequency trading (HFT) is seen as unnecessary, dangerous, and possibly nefarious by some. While HFTs aim to outpace other HFTs rather than individual or institutional traders, concerns arise about potential market manipulation and lack of transparency. The complexity of electronic markets makes it challenging for buy side firms to understand the impact of HFT on their trading. Electronic market making and algorithmic trading are legitimate elements of market structure, aiding asset managers in achieving best execution for clients. Blackrock opposes predatory HFT practices that manipulate the market or disadvantage investors, advocating for legal action against such abuses. It is crucial to differentiate between predatory practices and beneficial HFT strategies like electronic market making, which provide clients with tighter spreads. The SEC HFT literature survey highlighted studies suggesting some HFT firms use order anticipation and momentum ignition strategies, potentially increasing institutional investor transaction costs and volatility. Messaging fees on the Toronto Stock Exchange disproportionately affected HFT but had no significant impact on institutional traders. Higher HFT activity on the Nasdaq was linked to increased trade implementation costs. HFT activity on the Nasdaq was associated with higher trade implementation costs for institutional investors, impacting investor confidence in the fairness of the markets. Charles Schwab Corporation expressed concerns about HFT undermining investor confidence. The Investment Company Institute's survey on stock market exposure and confidence highlighted the complex effects of HFT on investors. Equity ownership in the U.S. has declined over the years, with the number of stock-owning households dropping from 57 million to 54 million. The proportion of equity-owning households has also decreased from 53 percent to 44 percent. Factors such as an aging population, job losses, and debt repayment have contributed to this trend. The stock market has seen a decline in trust among affluent investors, with only 15 percent indicating trust in recent polls. Media reports, like the one on 60 Minutes about market rigging, contribute to investor skittishness. Despite this, the stock market offers a more level playing field with lower trading costs. The market currently offers a more level playing field with lower trading costs and access to various investment options. Market confidence has been shaken due to recent chaos and volatility, leading many Main Street investors to withdraw from equities. High-frequency trading has played a significant role in taking advantage of market inefficiencies. Concerns about systemic risk arise from the correlation of algorithmic trades, potentially limiting the diversity of strategies compared to human traders. High-frequency trading (HFT) may pose systemic risks due to correlation of algorithmic trades and potential market disruptions. Independent HFT traders, often lightly capitalized, could face financial risks exacerbated by their high turnover rates and slower securities trade clearing systems. Concerns exist about their ability to handle counterparty risk, leading to worries about generating systemic market disruptions. The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research (OFR) has also highlighted operational risks from automated trading. The Office of Financial Research (OFR) is monitoring operational risks from automated trading systems, including high-frequency trading, as a potential threat to financial stability. In \"Flash Boys,\" Brad Katsuyama claimed that the stock market is rigged due to the significant role played by HFT. Michael Lewis further explored this theme, stating that technology should have reduced the tax on capital but instead, HFT increased it by billions of dollars. The term \"rigged\" was not clearly defined. According to SEC Chair Mary Jo White, the U.S. markets are not rigged, but not perfect. High-frequency trading (HFT) benefits individual traders with smaller spreads and faster trade execution, but larger traders may be disadvantaged by front running. Institutional investors like mutual funds and exchange traded funds can incur additional trading costs from front running. High-frequency trading (HFT) can lead to additional trading costs for mutual funds and exchange traded funds, potentially causing a drag on fund returns. Concerns have been raised about HFT contributing to extreme market movements, such as the Flash Crash of 2010. While the benefits of smaller spreads from HFT are acknowledged, the overall impact on market stability remains uncertain. The Flash Crash of 2010 saw the DJIA drop by 1,000 points in a historic decline, only to rebound most of the losses within 20 minutes. The SEC and CFTC issued a joint report on the event, highlighting the impact of a single large trade on the fragmented and fragile market. The Flash Crash of 2010 was caused by a large sell order of E-Mini S&P 500 contracts worth $4 billion, which led to market stress. The report raised concerns about market structure and liquidity, noting that high-frequency traders were net sellers during the crash. The Flash Crash report highlighted concerns about market structure and liquidity, particularly regarding high-frequency traders. Brooksley Born emphasized the disruptive nature of algorithmic and high-frequency trading. Studies showed that while HFT did not cause the crash, their responses to selling pressure worsened market volatility. The CME Group criticized the joint SEC and CFTC report on the incident. The CME Group report criticized the joint SEC and CFTC report on the Flash Crash, stating that the E-mini S&P 500 trade was not the main cause of the crash. Observers noted that mini-crashes, attributed to high-frequency trading, are common in the market. SEC officials have responded to these incidents. The SEC officials attribute mini-flash crashes to human errors like inadequate risk management practices, rather than high-frequency trading. In 2010, the SEC released a document seeking public comment on equity market structure issues, including implications of HFT. The SEC requests public comment on equity market structure performance, particularly regarding high-frequency trading (HFT). Questions include the fairness of the current automated market structure, the impact of HFT strategies on other investors, and the potential need for regulatory initiatives. Colocation advantages for proprietary trading firms and potential benefits for long-term investors are also addressed. The SEC is seeking public input on equity market structure, specifically high-frequency trading (HFT) and its impact on market quality. Questions arise about the efficiency of colocation for liquidity providers, the risks posed by HFT, and the need for regulatory oversight of proprietary trading firms. SEC Chair Mary Jo White has mentioned potential regulatory initiatives related to HFT, while the SEC has already implemented measures to protect investors and maintain fair markets. The SEC has implemented initiatives like MIDAS and the Consolidated Audit Trail to monitor and mitigate potential issues related to high-frequency trading (HFT). MIDAS captures trading data from national exchanges to help the agency understand market behavior and detect problematic activities like excessive order cancellations. The Consolidated Audit Trail, adopted in 2012, requires all domestic stock exchanges to create a uniform system for tracking trading activity. The SEC has implemented initiatives like MIDAS and the Consolidated Audit Trail to monitor high-frequency trading. The Audit Trail allows real-time access to data for market reconstruction. Regulation SCI proposes new standards for trading systems, while the Large Trader Reporting Rule imposes registration and reporting requirements on large traders. The SEC has introduced a reporting regime for traders involved in substantial trading activity to assess market impact, reconstruct trading activity, and analyze market events. Before the Flash Crash, HFT firms used \"naked access\" to gain special access to securities exchanges through SEC-registered brokers. In 2010, the SEC introduced Rule 15c3-5 to prohibit HFT firms from receiving naked access through registered brokers. In 2012, the SEC implemented a \"limit up-limit down\" mechanism to prevent trades in individual securities from occurring outside of specified price bands. The European Parliament adopted the EU's first common HFT-related regulatory initiative in April 2014. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFiD) has been in force since 2008 and is the framework for the regulation of the EU's financial markets. The EU is now implementing an updated MiFiD known as MiFiD II. The EU is implementing MiFiD II, aimed at establishing a safer and more transparent financial system. It includes regulatory frameworks to increase transparency in markets, improve competition in trading, and define HFT as algorithmic trading with regulatory curbs. Investment firms engaging in such trading must have effective systems in place. The EU is implementing MiFID II to establish a safer financial system with regulatory frameworks for transparency and competition in trading. High-frequency trading regulations include circuit breakers to stop trading in case of high volatility, testing algorithms on authorized venues, and storing order records for regulatory access. These rules aim to ensure market safety, financial stability, and control systemic risks posed by the increase in order flows. The prospective HFT regulations under MiFID II, an EU Directive, may vary among individual EU members. One potential regulation is Order Cancellation Fees, which some argue would deter manipulative strategies but others fear would reduce market liquidity. Nasdaq already imposes such fees to prevent exchange overload. Some argue that minimum order exposure times, proposed by SEC Chair Mary Jo White, could curb excessive order cancellations by HFT firms, but detractors believe it would only impact liquidity providers and not liquidity demanders. Concerns arise from the belief that HFT firms provide efficient liquidity, suggesting that such regulations may have unintended consequences. Some argue that HFT firms are efficient liquidity providers, and introducing a minimum exposure time protocol could harm market liquidity. Detractors believe that HFT traders flooding the market with orders prioritize speed over pricing, leading to potential losses for conventional liquidity providers. This could result in wider bid-ask spreads, causing investors to pay more to trade. Some researchers suggest that continuous limit order books may not always work effectively in high-frequency trading due to pricing relationships collapsing at millisecond speeds. To address this, there is a proposal for exchanges to conduct batch auctions at frequent intervals, such as once per second, to match bids and offers and improve demand-supply reconciliation. Batch auctions are proposed to reconcile demand and supply by matching bids and offers at frequent intervals. Proponents believe this reform could lead to markets with narrower bid-ask spreads, improved liquidity, and investor savings. Critics argue that exchanges may resist changes that reduce order volume, as they profit from high order volumes. Critics also suggest that HFT firms could find ways to work around batch auctions. Some critics propose a transaction tax on HFT trades to limit high-frequency trading and its negative impacts. In the past, the US had a stock transfer excise tax on securities transactions from 1914 to 1966, with tax rates of 0.1% and 0.04%. The tax was repealed as part of the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965. The Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been proposed multiple times in the US, including by Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, but no proposal has been enacted into law. In 2013, Italy imposed a tax on trades on Italian financial markets generated by computer algorithms. Italy imposed a 0.02% tax on trades on Italian financial markets generated by computer algorithms to address concerns about the impact of high-frequency trading (HFT) on market integrity. The tax applies to changed or canceled orders less than half a second in duration exceeding 60% of total orders, excluding market makers. In the US, legislative proposals have been made to institute a 0.03% tax on all financial transactions. H.R. 1579 proposes a levy on stock, bond, and derivative trades to reduce the budget deficit and curb high-frequency trading. Supporters believe it would raise revenue and slow down volatile financial markets. However, a CRS report questions the effectiveness of such a tax in improving market efficiency. The report suggests that the effects of a financial transaction tax on market efficiency are uncertain. It may be more effective to improve financial market operations through regulatory reforms for derivatives and high-frequency traders. If policymakers choose to implement an STT, starting with a low tax rate below 0.25% and increasing it based on research could be an option. Some propose imposing affirmative trade obligations on HFT firms to ensure liquidity during market disruptions, but critics argue it may impact profits. Some HFT firms may see reduced profits due to changing regulations. Critics of HFT affirmative trade obligations point to past market disruptions caused by market makers not fulfilling their duties. A proposed solution is a kill switch to suspend trades in case of errors or excessive volume, but it would need careful implementation to avoid misuse. The implementation of a kill switch in high-frequency trading (HFT) is being considered to prevent market disruptions caused by market makers not fulfilling their duties. Concerns exist over the timing and effectiveness of such mechanisms, especially in futures markets where HFT has grown significantly, comprising over 60% of all futures volume in 2012 on U.S. exchanges. The CFTC reported that by 2012, 92% of exchange-trading futures volume in the United States was executed through automated trading. In 2012, 92% of exchange-trading futures volume in the United States was executed electronically. Automated Trading Systems (ATS) trading accounted for over 50% of trading volume in significant futures exchange products by 2010. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) has grown rapidly in futures markets, raising concerns about market fairness and stability. Questions have been raised about whether HFT gives an advantage to hedge funds and large investment banks over small investors in both futures and equities markets. Institutions serving small investors, like mutual funds or pension funds, may pay more for futures contracts and stocks due to concerns about HFT traders manipulating markets. Regulators at the CFTC are investigating the use of HFT to flood markets with wash trades, which are prohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act. There are also concerns about the impact of HFT on market stability in futures and equities markets. The impact of HFT on market stability has been a concern in both futures and equities markets. A joint study by the SEC and CFTC linked the 2010 Flash Crash to a single mutual fund's trading algorithm. Knight Capital Group Inc. lost $440 million in an hour due to a computer malfunction, highlighting worries about HFT technical trading issues. Regulators oversee HFT on futures exchanges like CME and ICE, while the SEC monitors HFT in the securities market. The CFTC is investigating potential wash trades related to HFT. The CFTC regularly holds meetings of its Technical Advisory Council (TAC) to investigate potential wash trades related to HFT. In February 2012, the TAC created a Subcommittee on Automated and High Frequency Trading that examines various HFT trading practices. The CFTC issued interpretive guidance on disruptive trading practices in May 2013, which includes issues related to HFT. Section 747 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act to prohibit disruptive trading practices, including spoofing. A study by the Swedish financial regulatory authority in 2012 found that spoofing was associated with HFT. The CFTC prohibited spoofing in May 2013, fining Panther Energy Trading LLC and Michael J. Coscia $1.4 million for engaging in the practice. Spoofing involves placing and quickly canceling bids and offers in futures contracts using a computer algorithm. The CFTC prohibits violating bids and offers in derivatives trading, including Automated Trading Systems (ATS) like HFT. They issued a Concept Release in 2013 to assess risk controls for automated trading environments and seek feedback on potential regulatory approaches. The CFTC issued a Concept Release in 2013 to evaluate risk controls for automated trading environments and explore new regulatory approaches for ATS and HFT. The release emphasizes the shift towards highly automated trading environments and the need for updated regulatory standards to match current market technologies and risks. Public feedback is being solicited on this matter. The CFTC issued a Concept Release in 2013 to evaluate risk controls for automated trading environments and explore new regulatory approaches for ATS and HFT. The release emphasizes the shift towards highly automated trading environments and the need for updated regulatory standards to match current market technologies and risks. The release solicits public feedback and poses 124 questions divided into four categories, including Pre-Trade Risk Controls. These controls aim to protect against the submission of a large volume of orders, trade executions, or positions over a short period of time, with proposed solutions such as execution throttles and greater volatility awareness. The CFTC's Concept Release in 2013 evaluated risk controls for automated trading, including pre-trade controls like alerts for rogue algorithms, self-trade prevention, price collars, maximum order sizes, and trading pauses. Post-trade risk controls were also highlighted to complement pre-trade measures and reduce negative feedback loops. The CFTC's Concept Release in 2013 evaluated risk controls for automated trading, including pre-trade controls like alerts for rogue algorithms, self-trade prevention, price collars, maximum order sizes, and trading pauses. The release also discusses post-trade controls to address potential operational, market abuse, and transmission risks unique to electronic trading. Potential new system safeguards could include controls related to order placement, design, testing, and supervision of ATS, and self-certifications and notifications for firms operating ATS and clearinghouses. The CFTC proposed self-certifications and notifications for firms operating ATS and clearinghouses to certify adherence to requirements and notify others of \"risk events.\" The Mercatus Center criticized the proposal, stating that market participants' self-interest should drive adoption of effective risk-control protocols. Some commenters raised concerns about the CFTC's proposed regulations for high-frequency trading (HFT). Citadel, a proprietary trading firm, warned that mandatory \"resting periods\" for order executions could harm market liquidity. The Chicago Federal Reserve Bank suggested that voluntary adoption of risk controls may not be effective, and proposed defining best practices for HFT with penalties for non-compliance. In congressional testimony on May 13, 2014, a CFTC official noted the agency had received 43 public comments on regulating HFT. Commenters had differing opinions on the need for a regulatory definition of HFT, with some opposing it. MIT academic Andrei Kirilenko suggested creating a new category of \"automated brokers and traders\" to include all active proprietary traders. Andrei Kirilenko proposed creating a new category of \"automated brokers and traders\" to include all active proprietary traders. These traders would need to register with the CFTC, maintain records, and provide an audit trail for regulators to examine in case of market disruptions. Kirilenko also recommended that automated exchanges publish data on system latencies to increase transparency in the industry."
