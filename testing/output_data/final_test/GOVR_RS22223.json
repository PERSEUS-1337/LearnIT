Graham, a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the Commandments in public school classrooms was struck down as it lacked a secular purpose, making it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court found that public displays of the Ten Commandments lacked a secular purpose and were deemed unconstitutional. This decision was made in cases where the Commandments were posted in public school classrooms and courthouses, despite being funded by private contributions. The ACLU of Kentucky sued counties for displaying the Ten Commandments in courthouses, alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause. The counties argued that the Commandments were part of Kentucky's legal code and referenced the Founding Fathers' belief in acknowledging God. The district court ordered the Commandments to be removed immediately. The ACLU sued counties for displaying the Ten Commandments in courthouses, alleging an Establishment Clause violation. Despite a court order to remove them, the counties erected a new display titled \"The Foundations of American Law and Government Display.\" The U.S. Supreme Court emphasized the importance of neutrality under the Establishment Clause, stating that government actions advancing religion violate neutrality. The case raised questions about the purpose prong of the Lemon test. The Court emphasized the importance of government neutrality under the Establishment Clause, stating that favoring religion contradicts religious tolerance. Purpose is a valid consideration in determining constitutionality, with the Lemon test requiring a genuine secular purpose. The counties' actions were deemed unconstitutional due to an unconstitutional purpose. The Court found that the counties acted with an unconstitutional purpose in displaying the Commandments, emphasizing religious values and violating government neutrality under the Establishment Clause. Their actions were deemed impermissible and unconstitutional. The Court found that the counties displayed the Ten Commandments with an impermissible religious purpose, despite attempting to justify it with a secular theme. This was seen as a violation of government neutrality under the Establishment Clause. The Eagles paid for a monument at the State Capitol commemorating Texan identity. In 2001, a lawsuit was filed claiming the monument violated the Establishment Clause. The Court analyzed the monument's placement based on its nature and history, citing examples of government acknowledging religion in American life. In Marsh v. Chambers, the Court allowed state legislatures to start sessions with prayers by chaplains paid by the state. The Court upheld laws based on the Ten Commandments in cases like McGowan v. Maryland. Despite recognizing the Commandments' historical significance, the Court acknowledged their religious nature. Simply having religious content or promoting religious messages does not violate the Establishment Clause. The Court distinguished Van Orden from Stone based on the passive display of the Commandments at the Texas State Capitol, stating that the Establishment Clause does not apply to legislative chambers or capitol grounds. The Court found that the Texas monument did not raise the same concerns as displays in school settings, as Van Orden had walked past it for years before bringing the lawsuit. The Court's 2005 cases on public display of the Ten Commandments reached different conclusions, with the displays in McCreary being viewed as having religious significance. The Court did not establish a clear test for determining if such displays violate the Establishment Clause, but the decisions can be reconciled by examining the specific facts of each case. The Court's decisions on public display of the Ten Commandments varied in 2005. The display in McCreary was seen as having religious motivations, implicating government endorsement. In contrast, the display in Van Orden was considered passive and not likely to be seen as government endorsement due to its location among other monuments. The status of the Lemon test in Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains unclear, with the majority opinion in McCreary using a modified version to evaluate endorsement of religion. The Court's decisions in McCreary and Van Orden regarding the public display of the Ten Commandments diverged in 2005. The Lemon test was not consistently applied in these cases, with the Court using different factors to evaluate government endorsement of religion. Justice Breyer's deciding votes in both cases emphasized the need for the government to avoid excessive interference with or promotion of religion. The future approach of the Court in similar cases remains uncertain. The Court has upheld public displays of religious symbols in diversified contexts, such as in the cases of McCreary and Van Orden. Displays of the Ten Commandments are frequently challenged, but other religious symbols have also been contested under the Establishment Clause. In the 1980s, the Court ruled on cases involving religious symbols in Christmas holiday displays. The Court upheld public displays of religious symbols in various contexts, including Christmas holiday displays. In Lynch v. Donnelly, the Court found that the inclusion of a creche in a city's Christmas display did not violate the Establishment Clause. The display had a legitimate secular purpose and did not advance religion directly. In Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU, the Court ruled that a creche displayed at a county courthouse violated the Establishment Clause as it endorsed a religious message without any other elements to balance it. However, the inclusion of a menorah with a Christmas tree and a liberty sign outside a government building was deemed constitutional. The Supreme Court addressed First Amendment issues in Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum, where a religious group challenged the city's refusal to include their monument in a public park that already displayed the Ten Commandments. The case focused on free speech grounds rather than the religion clauses of the First Amendment. The Court's decision highlighted the celebration of a holiday season with a mix of symbols, emphasizing a message of pluralism. The Supreme Court ruled that privately donated monuments in a public park are considered government speech, not private speech. This means the display of the Ten Commandments could be challenged under the Establishment Clause in the future. The debate over religious symbols on public grounds has included Latin crosses in recent years. The debate over displaying religious symbols on public grounds, specifically Latin crosses as war memorials, has sparked controversy. One notable case involved a cross in the Mojave National Preserve, managed by the National Park Service. Erected in 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the cross became the subject of a legal battle over its constitutionality under the Establishment Clause. Congress intervened to prevent its removal using federal funds. In response to constitutional problems, Congress passed legislation prohibiting federal funds for cross removal and designated it as a national memorial. A lawsuit alleged an Establishment Clause violation due to the cross being displayed on public land. The district court issued an injunction against the display, leading Congress to transfer the land to the VFW. The U.S. Court of Appeals later ruled that the land transfer did not resolve the Establishment Clause issue. The 9th Circuit Appeals court held that the transfer of land did not resolve the Establishment Clause violation, as carving out a small parcel of property did not minimize the governmental endorsement. The Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration by the district court, with no majority opinion given. Justice Kennedy stated that the case was best left for the district court to analyze due to its fact-specific nature. The Supreme Court remanded a case involving a challenge to a 43-foot cross atop Mt. Soledad in California to the district court for reconsideration. The transfer of land did not resolve the Establishment Clause violation, and Justice Kennedy emphasized the need for a fact-specific analysis by the district court. In January 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found the Mt. Soledad cross unconstitutional due to its religious endorsement and exclusion of other religions. The court determined that the cross symbolized Christianity exclusively and lacked secular history as a war memorial. The setting of the cross within the memorial was highlighted as central and dominant. The Mt. Soledad memorial's cross was deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in January 2011. The court emphasized the cross's exclusive Christian symbolism and lack of secular history as a war memorial. The cross's central and dominant position within the memorial was a key factor in the decision."
