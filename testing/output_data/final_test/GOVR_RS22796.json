    "content": "The Medicare Board of Trustees oversees the financial operations of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, which cover different Medicare services. The funds are separate, and the trustees report annually to Congress on their financial status. The HI Trust Fund is primarily financed by a payroll tax on covered earnings with no annual maximum limit on taxable earnings. The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is funded by a payroll tax on covered earnings with no annual maximum limit. Workers with annual wages over $200,000 for single filers or $250,000 for joint filers pay an additional 0.9%. Other revenue sources include interest on U.S. Treasury securities, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and premiums from individuals not qualifying for Medicare Part A. The Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund is funded differently, with no payroll taxes collected. Enrollment in Medicare Parts B and D is voluntary, with premiums covering 25% of costs and the remaining 75% coming from general revenue transfers. The Medicare Board of Trustees estimates that by 2026, the HI Trust Fund will become insolvent, while the SMI Trust Fund cannot face insolvency. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 created a trigger for certain actions if general revenue funding for Medicare exceeds a certain proportion of total outlays within a specified timeframe. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established a trigger for action if general revenue funding for Medicare is expected to exceed 45% of total outlays for the current fiscal year or the following six years. If a warning is issued, specific procedures for introducing legislation are outlined, but there is no requirement for enactment or automatic sequestration of funds. Section 801 of the MMA defines key measures for determining Medicare funding warning. Excess general revenue Medicare funding occurs when funding exceeds 45% of total outlays. Fraud and abuse collections applied to Medicare trust funds are deducted from the total. Dedicated revenue sources include HI payroll taxes and transfers to Medicare trust funds. The Medicare funding warning is triggered when general revenue funding exceeds 45% of total outlays for two consecutive years. Dedicated revenue sources for Medicare include HI payroll taxes, transfers from the Railroad Retirement pension fund, income from taxation of certain Social Security benefits, state transfers for dual-eligible beneficiaries, Medicare premiums, and gifts received by the trust funds. Interest earned on the trust fund is not considered a dedicated source. The Medicare trustees projected that general revenue funding for Medicare would not exceed 45% of total outlays in the next seven years from 2014 to 2016, avoiding the issuance of funding warnings during those years. The Medicare trustees projected that general revenue funding for Medicare would not exceed 45% of total outlays in the next seven years from 2014 to 2016, avoiding funding warnings. In 2017, they projected that general revenues would exceed the threshold in FY2023, triggering a determination of excess general revenue Medicare funding. The Medicare trustees projected excess general revenue Medicare funding in 2018 and 2022, triggering a funding warning requiring a legislative response. Funding is expected to exceed 45% by 2021, reaching almost 54% by 2042 and declining to about 51% by 2092. The President must submit proposed legislation in response to funding warnings. The President is required to submit proposed legislation to Congress in response to a funding warning triggered by excess general revenue Medicare funding projections. The proposal must be submitted within 15 days of the budget for the succeeding year. However, if Congress enacts legislation to eliminate excess funding, the requirement is waived. The executive branch has argued that Congress cannot compel the President to submit legislative proposals directly. President George W. Bush and the Obama Administration objected to the requirement for the President to submit proposed legislation to Congress in response to a Medicare funding warning, citing constitutional concerns about Congress compelling the President to submit legislative proposals directly. President Bush submitted legislation in 2008 in response to Medicare trustees' funding warning, but no action was taken. No additional legislative proposals were submitted from 2007 to 2013. The President was not required to submit related legislation in 2014-2017. However, a funding warning in 2018 report will require a legislative proposal after the FY2020 budget release. The President is required to submit legislative proposals to Congress as per the Recommendation Clause, ensuring he can present necessary and expedient measures directly to Congress. This right may be infringed if Congress prevents the President from submitting his own legislative recommendations. The President is required to submit legislative proposals to Congress under the Recommendation Clause, but his right may be infringed only if Congress prevents him from submitting his own proposals. Congress directing the President to submit a proposal, within his discretion, in response to a specific trigger is unlikely to impose an excessive burden. The Department of Justice's claim that bills requiring recommendations are unconstitutional has not been supported by judicial decisions. The MMA mandates the President to submit draft Medicare funding legislation, with the bill introduced in each chamber within three days of session. The bill \"A bill to respond to a Medicare funding warning\" may be considered under fast track rules, limiting committee consideration and members' ability to debate and amend legislation. These procedures ensure each house can address the funding warning but do not guarantee the President's proposal will be considered or that Congress will pass legislation to lower general revenue spending. Chambers have the flexibility to modify these procedures if needed. The House and Senate introduced bills in response to President Bush's proposal. The House adopted resolutions to nullify expedited parliamentary procedures in the 110th and 111th Congresses. No further action has been taken to waive these rules in subsequent Congresses. In response to President Bush's proposal, the House and Senate introduced bills. The House adopted resolutions to nullify expedited parliamentary procedures in subsequent Congresses. The committee(s) of referral must report Medicare funding legislation by June 30 when required by the MMA. The chairman of the House Committee on the Budget certifies if Medicare funding legislation eliminates excess general revenue funding. The House may consider alternative Medicare funding measures. The House may consider Medicare funding legislation under regular procedures if affirmatively certified. If not voted on by July 30, a motion to discharge committee can be made after 30 days. This is a fallback provision if no action is taken on certified legislation. Once a motion to discharge is agreed upon, it cannot be made again in that session of Congress. The House can consider Medicare funding legislation under regular procedures if certified, with a fallback provision for a motion to discharge if no action is taken. The motion must be supported by one-fifth of the House, debatable for one hour, and if adopted, the legislation is considered in Committee of the Whole with limited debate and amendment time. After consideration, the committee reports the legislation back to the House for a final vote, with the option for a motion to recommit. The Senate's statutory procedures for Medicare funding legislation apply to bills reflecting presidential proposals under the MMA or any other bill with the same title. If the Finance Committee has not reported the bill by June 30, a Senator can move to discharge the committee from the measure, with limited debate allowed. The Senate's procedures for Medicare funding legislation allow for one assured opportunity to consider the bill, either the one reported by the Finance Committee or the one specified in a discharge motion. After the Finance Committee reports or is discharged, any Senator can move to proceed to consider the bill, with the possibility of a filibuster. The Senate's procedures for Medicare funding legislation allow for one assured opportunity to consider the bill, either the one reported by the Finance Committee or the one specified in a discharge motion. In the absence of a limitation, opponents could use a filibuster to prevent the motion from coming to a vote. The statute does not preclude a filibuster of the measure, nor does it expedite the resolution of differences between versions of Medicare funding legislation. The Medicare HI and SMI Trust Funds are independent, and funds raised for one cannot be used for the other. The trigger formula combines revenue streams from both funds. The Medicare trigger formula combines revenue streams from both the HI and SMI Trust Funds. To reduce the general revenue percentage, options include increasing dedicated financing or reducing outlays. Increasing payroll taxes could help lower the general revenue funding percentage to 45%. To reduce general revenue funding percentage to 45%, options include increasing payroll taxes by $32.5 billion or reducing Part A spending by $59.0 billion. These actions would eliminate excess general revenue Medicare funding but have no impact on federal general revenue spending. To reduce general revenue funding percentage to 45%, options include increasing payroll taxes by $32.5 billion or reducing Part A spending by $59.0 billion. These actions would eliminate excess general revenue Medicare funding but have no impact on federal general revenue spending. Alternatively, Part B outlays could be reduced, leading to a decline in the general revenue percentage and the level of Medicare spending financed through federal general revenues. In order to reduce general revenue funding to 45%, options include increasing payroll taxes or reducing Part A spending. A reduction in Part B outlays of $108.2 billion would be needed to achieve this threshold. Excess general revenue Medicare funding is a key measure of the Medicare program's financial status, serving as an early warning system for the impact of Medicare spending on the federal budget. Opponents argue that the measure does not recognize the shift towards outpatient services, the impact of the Part D program on revenue, and suggest other measures to determine Medicare's health."
