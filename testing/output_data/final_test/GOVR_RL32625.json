However, the risk to passengers is relatively small compared to the number of daily trips, and rail travel is generally safer than driving. Passenger rail systems in the United States face security challenges due to the large number of access points, ridership volume, and operational pace, making it impractical to screen all passengers like in airports. The diverse operators and scale of operations also make it difficult to provide uniform security levels. Despite concerns raised by attacks on rail systems in other countries, there have been no recent terrorist attacks on US passenger rail systems, but they remain vulnerable. The vulnerability of passenger rail systems to terrorist attacks is a concern, highlighted by incidents in other countries resulting in deaths. While the risk of dying in a terrorist attack on rail systems is small, accidents have caused fatalities in the United States. The goal of a terrorist attack is to spread fear and disrupt social order, making security measures crucial despite the low probability of such events. One possible consequence of a terrorist attack on passenger rail systems could be people switching to other modes of transportation, such as driving, which actually increases the risk of death due to higher accident rates. While the risk of a terrorist attack on rail systems is smaller compared to other risks passengers face, the nation's sense of social order is more vulnerable. Fear and the possibility of further attacks can disrupt the social order, despite government efforts to reduce the risk of attacks. Passenger rail systems are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, and restoring normalcy quickly after an attack is crucial. Tim O'Toole emphasized the importance of rapid response and service restoration to deter terrorists. Following 9/11, vulnerability assessments were conducted by the FTA and security inspections by the FRA on transit agencies and commuter railroads. Transit agencies have used assessments to prioritize security actions, with $2.5 billion spent on security measures since 9/11. Congress directed DHS to create a national transportation security strategy and mode-specific security plans, with $1.09 billion in grants provided for passenger rail. Since September 11, 2001, Congress has allocated $1.09 billion for grants to passenger rail systems for security-related purposes. Following the Madrid bombings in 2004, TSA issued security directives for U.S. passenger rail systems, including measures like increasing security presence, using video surveillance, conducting random inspections, and encouraging riders to report suspicious activity. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about TSA's security directives for the passenger rail industry, noting limited industry input and lack of baseline security standards based on best practices. GAO recommended collaboration with the Department of Transportation to develop measurable and enforceable security standards. TSA acknowledged the need for closer partnership with the rail industry. In 2007, TSA recognized the need to partner with the passenger rail industry for security standards. They hired 100 inspectors to enforce compliance with rail security directives and outlined roles with FRA. TSA inspectors have built relationships with security officials, participated in exercises, and enhanced security measures. GAO found similarities in security practices between U.S. and foreign transit agencies, but identified three unique practices used by a few nations. The GAO identified three unique security practices not commonly used in the United States: covert testing of employee response, random screening of passengers and baggage, and a national government clearinghouse for security technologies. Implementing these practices in the U.S. may face challenges. Additionally, centralizing the research and development of passenger rail security technologies was seen as beneficial. TSA is using a risk-based approach for security efforts, but there is a lack of information sharing on best practices for passenger rail security. TSA is using a risk-based methodology, as recommended by GAO and the 9/11 Commission. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directed the use of this approach for protecting critical infrastructure assets. Threat-based risk management includes vulnerability, threat, and criticality components. Risk analysis allows for tailored strategies in managing risk to passenger rail systems. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed DHS and DOT to prepare a strategy for transportation security, including risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets. This involves making changes in passenger rail systems to lower vulnerability to attack, reducing consequences of an attack through emergency response training, and investing in intelligence and law enforcement to combat terrorism. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed DHS and DOT to prepare a strategy for transportation security, including risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets. Plans were due to Congress by April 1, 2005, with classified information provided separately. DHS sent a classified report to Congress in September 2005 on a \"National Strategy for Transportation Security.\" Mode-specific security plans were released by DHS on May 21, 2007. The DHS released mode-specific security plans on May 21, 2007, as part of completing sector-specific infrastructure plans. The plans identify underwater and underground tunnels as high-security priorities. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) guides risk management for prioritizing protection efforts within infrastructure sectors, requiring sector-specific agencies to submit plans by December 2006. Sector councils involving federal, state, regional, and local government agencies, along with private sector stakeholders, develop these plans. The transportation sector did not have a private sector council as of March 2007, but each transportation mode has a sector council. A transportation sector council will be formed once the modes are organized. The transportation sector-specific plan and mode-specific annexes were completed on May 21, 2007. TSA is primarily responsible for transportation security, originally created within DOT and later transferred to DHS. DOT agencies are responsible for safety within transportation modes. The passenger rail industry has raised concerns about TSA's understanding and openness compared to DOT agencies. TSA has acknowledged the need to work more closely with the industry in developing security standards. Coordination between DHS and DOT in transportation security has been improved through a Memorandum of Understanding. The passenger rail industry has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TSA, FTA, and FRA to define responsibilities and procedures for cooperation. Congress provided significant funding for security grants to passenger rail and transit agencies, but funding constraints limit security improvements. The primary issue for the industry is finding ways to pay for additional security measures. The transit industry, excluding Amtrak, has spent over $2.5 billion on security activities since 9/11. A survey revealed over $6 billion in unmet long-term security needs, including $5.2 billion in capital investment and $800 million annually in operating expenses. APTA has requested increased federal grants to fund these security improvements. Advocates argue for increased federal responsibility in funding security improvements for passenger rail due to the current concern about terrorist attacks. They believe the federal government should reflect its role in national defense by providing more funding. On the other hand, some argue for a limited federal role, stating that national defense efforts already receive federal funding and taxpayers should not have to pay for security improvements for a small number of transit agencies in large cities. Comparisons to aviation security funding are deemed irrelevant. The federal government provides funding for passenger rail security through grants and the Urbanized Areas Security Initiative. State and local governments have discretion in applying these funds for security activities deemed most valuable to their communities. The National Transit Systems Security Act of 2007 also plays a role in enhancing security measures for passenger rail. The Transit Systems Security Act of 2007 authorized $2.6 billion for security grants over four years. The federal government emphasizes employee training as a crucial component of passenger rail security. The federal government has developed training courses for rail employees, but there are concerns about the effectiveness and extent of the training provided. Only a quarter of transit employees have received security training according to FTA testimony. TSA acknowledges the need for more extensive training, emergency planning, and drills for transit employees. The National Transit Systems Security Act of 2007 authorizes funding for security grants. The National Transit Systems Security Act of 2007 authorizes funding for security training grants for transit and rail operators. Congress determines the funding amount through appropriations to DHS. There is a policy issue regarding the trade-off between security and efficiency in passenger rail. Some question the value of efforts to secure all potential terrorist targets in the United States. Some argue that efforts to secure all potential terrorist targets in the United States may not be cost-effective, as terrorists could shift to softer targets if one set is made more secure. It is suggested that disrupting terrorist groups and improving response efforts may be more effective, along with enhancing the resiliency of transportation systems. The resiliency of transportation systems is considered valuable in quickly resuming operations after an incident. Congress passed passenger rail security legislation in 2007, expanding federal involvement in securing passenger rail through grants and regulation of security-related activities. The 2007 passenger rail security legislation includes grants for public transportation and railroad security, totaling $3.4 billion and $1.2 billion respectively over FY2008-FY2011. Additional grants of $650 million for Amtrak systemwide security upgrades and $200 million for safety improvements to rail tunnels in New York, Baltimore, and Washington, DC are also included. These grants are administered by DHS, with some specific grants disbursed by DOT. The 2007 passenger rail security legislation authorizes grants for public transportation and railroad security totaling $3.4 billion and $1.2 billion respectively over FY2008-FY2011. The grants are to be awarded by DHS but disbursed by DOT, with $840 million allocated for security-related operating expenses and $2.56 billion for security-related capital projects. These transit security grants will go directly to transit agencies, and no local match is required. Additionally, the legislation includes provisions for studying the feasibility of establishing transportation-related user fees for funding security improvements. The 2007 passenger rail security legislation authorizes grants for public transportation and railroad security totaling $3.4 billion and $1.2 billion respectively over FY2008-FY2011. Provisions include funding for transit security research, rail security research, security plans for high-risk targets, hiring more security inspectors, background checks for frontline employees, and regulating employee security training standards. The FY2008 DHS appropriations act allocated $47 million for surface transportation security, including $22 million for rail security inspectors and canine teams, and $400 million for public transportation and railroad security grants."
