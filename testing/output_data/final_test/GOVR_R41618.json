This development is expected to reduce the country's reliance on coal and oil imports, improve the trade balance, and decrease carbon dioxide emissions. Tax policy changes are also being considered to increase revenues but may impact after-tax profits for developers. Israel's success in natural gas exploration has sparked interest in the region, with concerns from Lebanon over sovereignty. Noble Energy's discoveries, including the Leviathan field with 16 trillion cubic feet of gas, position Israel to be self-sufficient in natural gas and potentially an exporter. Israel's natural gas discoveries by Noble Energy, including Tamar, Dalit, and Leviathan, have significantly increased the country's reserves to an estimated 25 tcf. This puts Israel in a position to be self-sufficient in natural gas and potentially become an exporter, improving energy and economic security. The new discoveries could provide over a 100-year supply of natural gas if half of the resources are produced at current levels. Israel's energy mix is likely to shift towards natural gas in the coming years. Israel's natural gas discoveries by Noble Energy, including Tamar, Dalit, and Leviathan, have significantly increased the country's reserves. Tamar's production is expected by the end of 2012, with Dalit following one or two years later, and Leviathan between 2016 and 2018. Tamar alone is projected to reach a capacity of one billion cubic feet per day by 2013 or 2014, which is over three times Israel's consumption in 2009. Egypt has been supplying natural gas to Israel since 2008, but the new fields could potentially displace these imports. Israel's natural gas discoveries by Noble Energy have increased reserves, with Tamar, Dalit, and Leviathan fields coming online. Importing natural gas from Egypt could improve Israel's energy security, while stopping exports to Israel could benefit Egypt politically. Recent unrest in Egypt has disrupted natural gas exports, impacting supply to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. The recent natural gas discoveries in Israel have the potential to significantly change the country's energy mix. Israel's consumption of natural gas has been growing, but it still remains a small portion of its energy sources. Industry forecasts project a threefold increase in natural gas consumption by 2015. The three new natural gas fields could provide 26 times the energy currently consumed annually in Israel. Israel's electricity generation sector is expected to utilize new natural gas resources, potentially leading to the electrification of the car fleet. Converting existing power generation to natural gas would require significant changes and investment. Currently, natural gas fuels 26% of Israel's electric generation, with coal supplying almost two-thirds of the capacity. Converting all generation to natural gas would necessitate an additional 0.8 bcf/d of natural gas. Switching to natural gas for electricity generation in Israel would require significant investment and time. It could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 52% and 50% if coal units are replaced. This shift would also allow Israel to increase domestic energy production and decrease reliance on coal and oil imports. Israel's Minister of Finance appointed a committee in 2010 to evaluate fiscal policy related to oil and gas resources in the country. The Finance Ministry appointed a committee in 2010 to evaluate Israel's fiscal policy on oil and gas reserves. The committee recommended eliminating the depletion deduction and implementing a progressive tax on profits. The draft conclusions did not suggest changing the royalty rate of 12.5%. The committee's final report, released on January 3, 2011, was fully accepted by Prime Minister Netanyahu and the cabinet. Recommendations include increasing the government's share of oil and gas revenues to between 52% and 62%, eliminating depletion allowances, and imposing a tax on profits starting at 20% and increasing to a maximum of 50%. Fields starting production before 2014 would be partially exempt from the tax increase. The final report recommended increasing the government's share of oil and gas revenues to between 52% and 62%, imposing a profits tax starting at 20% and increasing to 50%. The tax increase will not apply to reserves starting extraction before January 1, 2014 until reaching certain income thresholds. Israeli and U.S. companies oppose the tax increase, arguing it will deter future energy resource development. Oil and gas producers in the U.S. pay a corporate income tax of 35% on taxable income. The United States has not imposed a specific profits tax on the oil and gas industry, but did levy a windfall profits tax from 1980 to 1988. The tax was determined by the price of oil rather than profits, enacted to address increased industry profits after oil price decontrol. Concerns have been raised over natural gas discoveries in Lebanese waters potentially being claimed by Israel. Lebanon and Israel are in dispute over maritime borders and natural gas resources. The Lebanese government has appealed to the UN for intervention, but no action has been taken. Both countries have threatened military action to defend their resources. Israel may become a natural gas exporter if estimates are correct, but doubts remain due to domestic demand. A number of factors raise doubts about the viability of natural gas exports, including growing domestic demand, energy security issues, the expense of liquefying gas for transport, a global glut of natural gas, and political challenges. Noble Energy is considering building a liquefaction facility in Cyprus for exports to Europe and Asia, but feasibility is uncertain. Cyprus, Lebanon, and Syria are planning auctions for oil and gas exploration licenses, with Cyprus and Syria holding theirs this year and Lebanon scheduled for 2012. Uncertainty surrounds Lebanon's energy development plans due to political deadlock. In December 2010, Cyprus and Israel signed an agreement defining their sea border. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the Levant Basin may hold 1.7 billion barrels of oil and 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Noble Energy plans to drill deeper in the Leviathan field to search for oil, estimating a 17% probability of finding 3 billion barrels. The U.S. government is not directly involved in Israel's oil and gas policies. In the near-term, consultations on energy policy and regulations could be an area for government interaction between the U.S. and Israel. Israel, not a major energy producer, must balance economic and security concerns with developing its resources. The U.S. can offer expertise in regulatory oversight, tax policy, and environmental issues. Regional interest in energy development creates opportunities for discussions between Israel and its neighbors. Resolving maritime boundaries with Lebanon would reduce industry uncertainty."
