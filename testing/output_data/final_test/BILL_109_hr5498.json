    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Equitable Access to Disaster Relief and Preparedness Services Act.\" Congress finds that effective communication is crucial for meaningful access to disaster relief services. The lack of language and culturally competent services creates barriers for individuals with limited English proficiency. Communities nationwide face challenges with language services and funding, hindering access to public services like health care, mental health, housing assistance, and small business support. The number of non-English speaking residents in the United States is on the rise. The United States has a growing population of non-English speakers, with 47 million people speaking a language other than English at home. Among them, 21 million individuals cannot effectively communicate with health and social service providers. Within the Hurricane Katrina and Rita disaster areas, thousands of individuals spoke English less than very well, including Asian and Pacific Islander language speakers. Approximately 30,000 Vietnamese-Americans lived in the Gulf Coast region affected by the hurricanes. The Hurricane Katrina and Rita disasters affected 67,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, with an estimated 15,000 Vietnamese-Americans evacuating to Houston, Texas. Despite past efforts to address discrimination in disaster assistance, it remains a problem that should be tackled, as discrimination based on national origin, including language, is prohibited under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Discrimination based on language for individuals with limited English proficiency in disaster relief services should be avoided. Language services should be provided free of charge to ensure meaningful access. Funding for language services is a societal responsibility. Linguistic and cultural diversity in the disaster relief workforce is crucial. The importance of a diverse disaster relief workforce is highlighted to ensure equitable access to services for individuals with limited English proficiency. Providers are encouraged to educate staff and constituents on language barriers and improve communication for better service quality. To ensure equal access to services for individuals with limited English proficiency. SEC. 3. NONDISCRIMINATION IN DISASTER ASSISTANCE REGARDING ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to ensure that Federal entities provide interpreter and translation services for individuals with limited English proficiency in disaster preparedness planning. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to provide translated notices and documents for disaster relief assistance to various organizations for distribution to affected populations. The information in these translated materials should align with the President's communication through various media channels. The President is authorized to provide assistance under the Act, including notices for reduction, denial, or termination of services, right to appeal actions, and availability of free language services. A cadre of disaster relief employees must be available for activation, and an informational clearinghouse of best practices for language assistance programs should be maintained. The Act authorizes assistance including language services for individuals with limited English proficiency during disasters. Technical assistance is provided for the development of plans and programs for individuals with and without English proficiency. The Act authorizes a $1,500,000 emergency preparedness demonstration program by the Director of FEMA to study and address the needs of individuals and households with limited English proficiency for disaster awareness and readiness in communities."
