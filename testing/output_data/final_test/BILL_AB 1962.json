    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1369 of the Penal Code is amended to establish the order for a trial on mental competence, with exceptions outlined in subdivision (g). The court appoints experts to examine the defendant's mental state, with two psychiatrists or psychologists appointed if mental incompetence is not sought. They assess the defendant's mental disorder, ability to understand the proceedings, and need for antipsychotic medication. The court appoints experts to examine the defendant's mental state, assessing whether antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate and can restore the defendant to mental competence. Psychiatrists or psychologists evaluate the defendant's capacity to make decisions about medication and determine if the defendant poses a danger to themselves or others. If necessary, a psychiatrist will evaluate whether treatment with antipsychotic medication is suitable. The court appoints experts to assess the defendant's mental state and determine the appropriateness of antipsychotic medication. If the defendant is suspected to be developmentally disabled, the court may appoint a director from a regional center to examine them. The regional center director recommends a suitable residential facility or state hospital for the defendant. The court considers this recommendation before issuing an order. The defendant receives necessary care and treatment while confined. The defense and prosecution present evidence of mental incompetence, with each party offering rebutting testimony. In a trial, the prosecution and defense present final arguments. In a jury trial, the court instructs the jury on all necessary legal matters for a unanimous verdict. Competency is presumed unless proven otherwise by a preponderance of evidence. Competency in probation or parole violations is determined in a court trial. The State Department of State Hospitals must adopt guidelines by July 1, 2017, for education and training standards for psychiatrists or psychologists seeking court appointments. This will involve a workgroup with various stakeholders to develop the guidelines. When appointing experts for court cases, guidelines must be followed. If no expert meeting the guidelines is available, the court has the discretion to appoint an expert without meeting the guidelines."
