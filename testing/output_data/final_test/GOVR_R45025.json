    "content": "Iraqis have faced wars, sanctions, displacements, and terrorism for decades. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion removed Saddam Hussein's regime, leading to chaos, violence, and political transition. Tensions among Iraqis escalated post-2003, with political parties and ethnic groups vying for power amid insurgency and corruption. The 2011 U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq led to fragile gains, with security deteriorating from 2012 to 2014 due to the rise of ISIS. The war against ISIS has dominated events in Iraq since 2014, with ongoing social, economic, and governance challenges. Iraqis celebrate successes in fighting ISIS but are cautious about the political future. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi is preparing for reelection amidst potential challenges from rival Shia factions. Some parties oppose continued U.S. military presence in Iraq. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq held a controversial independence referendum in 2017. Kurdish forces controlled areas from mid-2014 to October 2017. In mid-2014 through October 2017, Kurdish forces controlled disputed areas, including Kirkuk. Iraqi government forces reasserted control in 2017, leading to armed confrontations. Popular demands for improved services, security, and governance persist in Iraq. Stabilization and reconstruction efforts are needed in areas liberated from ISIS. Paramilitary forces have grown stronger but are not fully integrated into national security institutions. Iraqis continue to grapple with political and security challenges. Iraqis are facing political and security challenges influenced by various identities and interests. Iraq's strategic importance to U.S. policymakers is driven by its location, potential, and diverse population. U.S. engagement since 2011 aims to reinforce unity and minimize divisive outcomes, with a focus on partnership and minimal involvement compared to the 2003-2011 era. The Trump Administration has maintained a cooperative relationship with the Iraqi government, focusing on security training for Iraqi forces rather than extensive deployment of U.S. military forces. As major military operations against the Islamic State conclude, the U.S. military presence in Iraq is expected to evolve to assist Iraqis in consolidating gains and training security forces. The 115th Congress has allocated funds for ongoing military operations, security assistance, humanitarian relief, and foreign aid for Iraq. Congress is currently considering appropriations and authorization bills. In July 2017, Prime Minister Haider al Abadi visited Mosul to mark the completion of major combat operations against Islamic State forces. Iraqi forces launched operations to retake Mosul in October 2016, seizing the eastern half in January 2017 and the western half in February. Fighting in west Mosul resulted in greater displacement, casualties, and destruction, with estimates of over $1 billion needed for reconstruction. Thousands of civilians were killed or wounded during the battle. The defeat of IS forces in Mosul resulted in thousands of civilian casualties and over 1 million people displaced. IS now has isolated areas of control in Tal Afar, Hawijah, and Anbar governorate. Iraqi forces have retaken Tal Afar and Hawijah, with ongoing operations in Anbar. Prime Minister Abadi visited Al Qaim and raised the Iraqi flag, while officials announced the recapture of Rawa. Analysts anticipate IS shifting towards insurgency tactics as their territorial control in Iraq diminishes. Experts anticipate IS leaders and fighters transitioning to insurgency tactics after their territorial losses in Iraq. Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani announced a referendum on independence from Iraq, despite opposition from Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi and international observers. The Kurdish people view the referendum as a right to self-determination. The Kurdish referendum on independence from Iraq was held despite opposition from Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi and international observers. Kurdish leaders intended to pursue separation negotiations with Baghdad after the referendum, leading to concerns about territorial and resource disputes. Despite U.S. and Iraqi opposition, the referendum proceeded as planned, with over 72% voter turnout and 92% voting \"Yes\". Prime Minister Abadi deemed the referendum unconstitutional and called for its results to be cancelled. Iraqi authorities have called for the cancellation of the Kurdish referendum results and are reasserting control over border crossings and airspace in the Kurdistan Region. Kurdish officials criticize the measures as collective punishment and an attempt to impose a blockade. The referendum was held in disputed territories, including Kirkuk and Ninewa governorate, where Kurdish forces had gained control after the retreat of national government forces in 2014. In 2017, Prime Minister Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to return to disputed territories, including Kirkuk, previously controlled by national forces. Kurdish forces mostly withdrew without incident, despite some clashes and casualties. Concerns about Iranian influence in Iraq arose due to the involvement of Iran-backed militia units. Changes in territorial control have affected Kurdish financial and political prospects, leading to division among Kurdish leaders and parties. Some oil fields and infrastructure previously under Kurdish control have been retaken. In response to territorial changes, Kurdish leaders face division and accusations of malpractice. KRG President Barzani will not seek reelection and elections have been delayed. U.S. officials urge Kurds to engage in dispute resolution and avoid unilateral military actions. U.S. assistance to KRG continues with national government consent. The Trump Administration has not indicated any changes in U.S. assistance programs for Iraq's national government or the Kurdistan region. The Popular Mobilization Commission and its militias have been involved in fighting against the Islamic State in Iraq. The implementation of the PMF law adopted in 2016 has shown no tangible progress according to the U.N. Secretary-General. The PMF in Iraq, under the command of the commander-in-chief, is subject to military discipline. Some units, including those supported by Iran, are not fully integrated into the legal structure. The inclusion of Kata'ib Hezbollah in the PMF could hinder counterterrorism efforts. Iran-aligned PMF forces were involved in operations after the Kurdish referendum. Leaders like Hadi al Amiri and Qais Khazali are prominent figures in the PMF. The PMF leaders, such as Hadi al Amiri and Qais Khazali, may participate in future elections despite PMF law restrictions. Legislation in Congress supports U.S. military operations and assistance to Iraq. PMF figures are speculated to use their profile for political gain. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act extends the U.S. train and equip program in Iraq through December 2019. It authorizes $1.3 billion for continued efforts and requires a comprehensive report on conditions in Iraq. The Trump Administration plans to use $250 million in FY2017 funding to support Iraq's defense efforts. The Trump Administration has requested $1.269 billion for defense funding to train Iraqis in FY2018, along with $347.86 million for foreign aid, including $300 million for post-IS stabilization. The US has contributed over $1.7 billion for humanitarian relief in Iraq since 2014. Military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria cost $14.3 billion as of June 2017, with Congress appropriating over $3.6 billion for train and equip assistance in Iraq. Iraq is governed as a parliamentary republic under a constitution adopted in 2005. Iraq is governed as a parliamentary republic under a constitution adopted in November 2005. Executive authority lies with the prime minister, while legislative elections for the Council of Representatives have been held in December 2005, March 2010, and April 2014. The 328-seat legislature is directly elected by proportional representation, with elections for the next Council of Representatives planned for May 2018. The constitution allows for a sharing of powers between the national government and recognized subnational entities, with the Kurdistan Region of Iraq being the sole constitutionally recognized region at present. Iraq's economy benefits from energy resources, central location in the Middle East, and young population. Despite GDP per capita growth, conflict, instability, and corruption hinder development. The government heavily relies on oil revenue, facing challenges from low prices and war with the Islamic State. Iraq's economy has been strained by lower global oil prices and the fiscal demands of war with the Islamic State since 2014. The country has sought international aid and lending to meet its fiscal needs, leading to accumulating arrears. Iraq's society is diverse, with a Shia Arab majority, Sunni Arab and Kurdish communities, and various ethnic and religious minority groups. Political change and conflict have been prevalent since 2003, fueling anxieties about the future and contributing to sectarian political behavior. Since 2003, Iraq has experienced political change and conflict, leading to sectarian tensions and violence. Different groups seek autonomy, protection, and benefits from the state, causing confrontations between Sunnis and Shia, and Kurds and non-Kurds. An informal system ensures representation in government based on identity and political orientation, perpetuating divisive, identity-based politics. Leadership of key ministries is determined by identity, but communal representation in official positions does not guarantee actual policy influence or benefits. Extensive negotiations post national elections in 2005, 2010, and 2014 led to prime ministers from Iraq's Shia Arab majority. The presidency was held by a Kurdish minority member, the Council of Representatives' speaker was Sunni, and three vice presidencies were filled by representatives of Shia Arab, Sunni Arab, and Kurdish communities. Calls for a nonsectarian political order have arisen due to tensions and violence since 2003, especially after the Islamic State's advance in 2014. Opposition to merit-based cabinet selections persists, with concerns about exclusion from government representation. Various factions have proposed national reconciliation and reform, but Iraqis struggle to achieve it. Observers of Iraqi politics are closely watching debates over 2018 electoral legislation and the composition of electoral authorities to see if established patterns will continue or if a new chapter is about to unfold. The US military completed its withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 after failed negotiations for a residual presence. Iraqi forces, backed by the US, had dealt significant blows to insurgent groups like the Islamic State of Iraq. Despite some military capability gaps, Iraqi forces were deemed capable of independent security operations. After the US withdrawal in 2011, Prime Minister Maliki's confrontational stance towards Sunni rivals led to growing discontent and distrust. The Islamic State of Iraq gained strength in 2012 amid political turmoil, heavy-handed tactics against Sunni protestors, and ongoing corruption within government institutions. Sunni disaffection was capitalized on, further fueling the escalating civil conflict. The Islamic State of Iraq rebranded itself as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in April 2013, escalating violence in both countries. Governorate council elections were held amid rising inter-sectarian tensions, with attacks against civilians increasing rapidly. Prime Minister Maliki visited Washington in late 2013 to request military support and pledged conciliatory steps towards Iraqi Sunnis. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk warned of the Islamic State's attempts to establish camps in November 2013. In November 2013, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk warned Congress about the Islamic State's efforts to establish camps in Iraq's western border regions. In January 2014, Islamic State forces took over Ramadi and Fallujah in the Anbar governorate. National legislative elections were held in April 2014, with Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki's State of Law coalition winning the most seats. As the Islamic State threatened Baghdad in June 2014, Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani called for Iraqis to volunteer to defend the country. Sistani issued a fatwa for Iraqis to volunteer to defend the country, leading to the creation of the Popular Mobilization Commission and volunteer militia forces. U.S. and Iranian officials, along with Iraqi Shia clerics, pushed for the formation of a new government and supported the nomination of Haider al Abadi as an alternative to Maliki. Some Iraqis criticized the U.S. for linking security support to calls for Maliki's replacement. Prime Minister Abadi quickly formed an inclusive cabinet and requested international military intervention to combat the Islamic State. In mid-2015, Prime Minister Abadi proposed sweeping reforms in response to mass protests demanding improved services and an end to corruption. This came after progress on reconciliation and security issues in late 2014 and early 2015, which slowed down due to blackouts sparking protests. In response to mass protests, Prime Minister Abadi proposed reforms in 2015, including eliminating Iraq's three vice presidencies. Despite controversy, the proposal was overturned by Iraqi courts, leading to political paralysis from late 2015 to mid-2016. Abadi's reform initiatives faced backlash from vested political interests and confrontational mass protests. Events in Iraq are still influenced by the aftermath of the war with the Islamic State. Prime Minister Abadi, known for his reform efforts and success against ISIS, faces resistance from entrenched interests and powerful rivals. The future of the Popular Mobilization Forces and the Kurdistan Region are key issues, with discussions on post-IS stabilization and aid ongoing. Iraq's COR voted to delay governorate elections to coincide with the 2018 national elections. Debate now focuses on the 2018 national elections law and an electoral law for governorate/provincial council elections. Former PM Maliki remains politically active, aligning with Iran-backed PMF units and criticizing Kurdish leaders. In the aftermath of the independence referendum, Iraqi leaders express anti-U.S. sentiment and opposition to Kurdish independence. Prime Minister Abadi has more support among non-Shia Arab Iraqis. Some Sunni and Shia leaders support preserving the Kurdistan Regional Government as a check on national authority. PMF leaders seek Abadi's permission to join the fight against ISIS in Syria. Prime Minister Abadi has resisted requests for PMF involvement in raids against IS-held strongholds, preferring traditional security forces to lead anti-IS operations. PMF's role could increase their popularity and political influence. Iraqi leaders are preparing for national elections, with some expressing gratitude for PMF's contributions in the war against IS. In July 2017, Ammar al Hakim, a Shia Arab politician, established the Hikmah (Wisdom) National Trend, breaking away from the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. Sunni leaders also planned to coordinate under a National Forces Alliance for the upcoming 2018 elections. Analysts speculate on potential cooperation between Hakim, Prime Minister Abadi, Vice President Allawi's National Coalition, and Shia cleric Muqtada al Sadr, who supports anti-corruption initiatives and state control. The upcoming 2018 elections in Iraq may see Prime Minister Abadi facing competition from Vice President Maliki and potential Kurdish party involvement. Kurdish parties' participation could be significant if larger parties boycott or align with a new coalition. Kurds, the fourth largest ethno-linguistic group in the Middle East, have a history of seeking independence. Kurds in Iraq have a history of seeking independence, facing challenges from Iraqi governments, Turkey, and Iran. After the 1991 Gulf War, Kurdish self-government developed under the protection of a no-fly zone imposed by the US and UK. In 1992, Iraqi Kurds established a joint administration between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and another political movement. The Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan faced discord and armed conflict between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) from 1994 to 1998. However, they resumed cooperation before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, leading to the recognition of the Kurdistan Regional Government's authority in areas under Kurdish control. Kurdish leaders played key roles in post-2003 Iraqi governance to secure autonomy within emerging constitutional arrangements. The Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan worked towards autonomy within constitutional arrangements, holding elections for the Kurdistan National Assembly (KNA) in 2005, 2009, and 2013. The KNA approved a draft constitution in 2009, but it was not ratified due to objections and political disputes. KDP leader Masoud Barzani became KRG President in 2005, was directly elected in 2009, and had his term extended in 2013. Barzani faced opposition demands to step down after his term expired, leading to delays in parliamentary and presidential elections proposed for November 2017. Elections in the Kurdistan region were delayed for eight months after the 2017 independence referendum. Political movements in the KRG face challenges from internal divisions and external pressures. The KDP, led by the Barzani family, has historical support from Erbil and Dohuk governorates. Masoud Barzani's son, Masrour, serves as Chancellor of the KRG National Security Council. The PUK, associated with the Talabani family, faces leadership questions after Jalal Talabani's death. KDP-PUK rivalries stem from personal leadership, resource control, and Kurdish accommodation in Baghdad. Both factions maintain militia forces and influence over the KRG's Ministry of Peshmerga. The KRG's Ministry of Peshmerga is influenced by the KDP and PUK, with the Gorran movement challenging them for political reform. Gorran selected new leaders after its founder's death in 2017. Former KRG Prime Minister Barham Salih formed the CDJ and called for a transitional administration amid tensions with Baghdad. Smaller Kurdish Islamist movements also have seats in the KNA and national COR. In the 2013 KNA elections, the KDP, Gorran Movement, PUK, Kurdistan Islamic Union, and Kurdistan Islamic Group won seats. The KNA faced challenges due to interparty disputes, including President Barzani's term expiration and disagreements with Baghdad. KRG-Baghdad relations were strained post-referendum, despite positive coordination on security operations against the Islamic State. In the aftermath of the referendum and clashes in disputed territories, Kurds and non-Kurds in Iraq have long disputed territory and resources. Prior to 2003, there were recurrent periods of insurgency by Kurds in northern Iraq, resulting in inconclusive agreements on partial autonomy for Kurdish areas. The pre-2003 Baathist government rearranged administrative boundaries and used violence to reengineer the population. The government rearranged administrative boundaries and used violence to reengineer the population of disputed territories, particularly affecting Iraq's Kurds. The city of Kirkuk and the oil-rich Kirkuk Governorate are strategically significant disputed territories, along with areas in Ninewa, Erbil, and Diyala Governorates. Competing claims over these territories, fueled by natural resources and ethnic/religious minorities, remain unresolved and volatile. The boundaries of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq have not been finalized under post-2003 Iraqi law. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) was recognized as the official government of certain territories in Iraq by the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) in 2004. The 2005 Iraqi constitution also acknowledged Kurdistan as a federal region. The boundaries of the Kurdistan Region have not been finalized, leading to unresolved disputes over territories like Kirkuk. The 2003 Green Line demarcation did not properly return some Kurdish-populated territories to Kurdish control, leading to friction among Iraqis. The constitution outlined a process for resolving disputes over territories like Kirkuk, but the deadline was missed and subsequent attempts failed. Kurdish leaders deferred a constitutional referendum in July 2009 asserting disputed territories as part of Kurdistan. UNAMI made efforts to advance dialogue on disputed territories, but discussions remained open-ended. U.S. military initiatives created de-confliction mechanisms in disputed areas, phased out with U.S. withdrawal. In 2013, Kurdish authorities announced plans for new oil pipeline infrastructure to export oil from disputed territories without Baghdad-controlled infrastructure. In January 2014, Kurdish oil exports to Turkey increased after completing new infrastructure. Baghdad responded by withholding funds for the KRG, leading to a standoff. The rise of ISIS in northwest Iraq shifted focus from the dispute. Kurdish forces advanced, gaining control of disputed territories and oil-rich areas, altering expectations for future negotiations with Baghdad. In mid-2017, Kurdish and Iraqi officials continued to discuss the final status of disputed territories. Kurdish leaders announced a referendum on independence, citing the failure to implement Article 140 and other constitutional elements. This decision raised concerns among Iraqis and outsiders. The Kurdish referendum for independence in September 2017 led to rapid changes in territorial control, with the Iraqi government reasserting authority over disputed territories and oil fields previously held by Kurdish forces. The area near the Syria-Iraq-Turkey tri-border at Faysh Khabour is a focus of concern due to Kurdish oil pipeline infrastructure. U.S. officials urge Kurds and Iraqis to resolve disputes through dialogue, emphasizing that territorial changes do not alter the disputed status. Past efforts provide a basis for consultation on territorial claims. Iraq's territorial claims are based on its significant oil and natural gas reserves, with 143 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, mainly located in southern Iraq and near the disputed city of Kirkuk. The distribution of energy resources increases political sensitivity, leading to ongoing disputes between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad over control of oil-rich areas. The Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) has been trying to independently develop and export oil resources in areas under its control, which has been rejected by Baghdad. The fiscal crises faced by both the national government and the KRG are adding pressure on leaders to address security and political challenges in Iraq. Iraq is facing budget deficits due to lower global oil prices and military campaign costs against the Islamic State. The IMF estimates financing needs at 19% of GDP for 2017-2018. Oil exports contribute 90% of public sector revenue, while non-oil sector growth is hindered by insecurity and corruption. Despite increased oil production and exports in 2016, revenue gains were undermined by oil price fluctuations. Iraq has agreed to manage oil production in line with OPEC limits. In July 2017, Iraq exported 3.2 mbd at an average price of $43.80 per barrel, below budget assumptions. IMF projects modest GDP growth ahead. The IMF approved a $5.34 billion Standby Arrangement for Iraq in July 2016, following assistance provided in 2015. Iraq has financed budget gaps through various measures including spending cuts, currency reserve drawdowns, and borrowing. The IMF arrangement includes commitments to reduce public sector outlays and support for internally displaced persons. Iraq received a $5.34 billion Standby Arrangement from the IMF in July 2016 to address budget gaps. Despite salary cuts and price hikes causing protests in 2015, Iraq attracted foreign financing with U.S. loan guarantees and bond offerings. The IMF noted weak performance but expressed confidence in corrective actions to keep the program on track. The COR amended the 2017 budget to lower spending further. The COR adopted an amendment to the 2017 budget in July, lowering spending further as requested by the IMF. The most recent IMF review emphasized the need for fiscal belt tightening, growth in non-oil revenues, reform of the electricity sector, and improvements in public sector financial management. Iraqi authorities agreed that containing spending is necessary for fiscal and external sustainability, considering the challenges from the war against ISIS, internally displaced population, investment needs, and upcoming parliamentary elections in 2018. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq has faced economic and fiscal pressure despite being an attractive market for investment. In early 2014, then-Prime Minister Maliki responded to the Kurdistan Regional Government's decision to produce and export oil without Baghdad's approval by withholding their share of the Iraqi national budget. Disputes over exports, the 2017 referendum, and security have stalled agreements between the KRG and national government. Oil from Kurdish-controlled areas is transported through pipelines to Turkey and by truck to Iran, impacting the KRI's economic independence. Iraqi government efforts to control border crossings affect the region's infrastructure and potential for independence. The fiscal crisis in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) has led to delays in public sector salaries and increased tensions among Kurdish factions. Baghdad's budget withholdings since 2014 have worsened the economic situation, with billions in unpaid salaries accumulating as arrears. Prime Minister Abadi has offered to pay KRG public sector employees' salaries, but disputes over territories and border control have widened the gap between the parties on fiscal issues. The United States has provided financial assistance to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to support public sector employees' salaries, but concerns remain about the validity of civil service lists. A $480 million agreement was signed in 2016 to support the peshmerga forces, but a follow-on agreement has been delayed due to disagreements between Baghdad and the KRG over the 2017 referendum and disputed territories. The United Nations has designated the situation in Iraq as a Level Three emergency since August 2014. The United Nations has designated the situation in Iraq as a Level Three emergency, indicating a severe humanitarian crisis. Conflict and terrorist violence have led to long-running displacement crises, with over 5.4 million Iraqis displaced since 2014. Displacement was concentrated in northern areas due to military operations against the Islamic State. Approximately 72% of those displaced after the start of operations in Mosul in October 2016 remained displaced in mid-October 2017. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi appealed for U.S. and international aid to help meet Iraq's humanitarian needs and reconstruction costs. The 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan for Iraq sought $984.6 million, with $717 million received by November 2017. The full cost of humanitarian needs for 11 million Iraqis is estimated at over $3 billion. Authorities and organizations are assisting civilians, including refugees and IDPs, across the country. The appeal for the Iraq component of the 2017-2018 Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) in response to the Syria crisis requested $228.1 million, of which $122.3 million had been received as of November 16, 2017. Challenges complicate assistance efforts and the viability of civilians' attempts to return home, including ongoing conflict, lack of security and services, unexploded ordnance, fear of reprisal, and property destruction. Tensions may arise over property disputes, politics, economic opportunities, and accountability for alleged crimes. Local communities can be caught in national and international disputes. Families of Islamic State members face challenges, including isolation, scrutiny, and violence. Concerns have been raised about the treatment of IS family members in rehabilitation camps. Over 925,000 IDPs were present in Dohuk, Erbil, and Suleimaniyah as of October 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, over 925,000 IDPs were in Dohuk, Erbil, and Suleimaniyah Governorates in the KRI. An additional 263,000 IDPs are in Kirkuk Governorate. KRG estimates hosting IDPs and refugees costs $1.4 billion annually. IDPs in the KRI face economic strains, limited services, unemployment, and language barriers. The United States provides humanitarian assistance, with $175 million in FY2016 funding for KRI-based responses. In FY2016, $175 million was allocated for KRI-based humanitarian responses, with comparable funding planned for FY2017. Religious and ethnic minority groups, such as Iraqi Christians and Yezidis, face challenges due to being targeted by the Islamic State since 2014. Some groups have been able to return home, but minorities like Shabak Shia Muslims, Kurdish Yazidis, and Chaldean Christians remain displaced across Iraq. Iraq's national leaders prioritize civilian protection amidst multiple displacements due to the Islamic State conflict. However, reports indicate instances of sectarian violence against minority groups by local or extra-local forces, including militias. Concentration of minorities in disputed areas increases vulnerability to violence and political intimidation. Movements of national and KRG forces in disputed territories raise concerns for minority communities' security. As combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq conclude, officials and observers are monitoring the situation closely. Iraqi officials and foreign donors are supporting stabilization programs to help communities rebuild infrastructure, protect public health, and provide economic opportunities in areas retaken from the Islamic State. The State Department warns of terrorism and crime risks throughout Iraq, identifying Iran-backed militias as a threat to U.S. interests. Fighting has damaged formerly IS-held towns and cities like Ramadi and Mosul. Large areas of key population centers in formerly IS-held towns and cities like Ramadi and Mosul have been destroyed and rendered temporarily uninhabitable. Retreating IS fighters have left behind booby-trapped houses and neighborhoods, mined essential farmland and roads with IEDs, and carried out retaliatory post-withdrawal terrorist attacks. Unexploded ordnance, disrupted water and power infrastructure, and delayed return of displaced civilians are ongoing challenges. Despite some polling suggesting improved security since early 2016, terrorist attacks in Baghdad and other cities have led to criticism of the Iraqi government's performance. The Iraqi government's performance has faced criticism due to security challenges in various cities. Militia groups and criminal organizations have taken advantage of the focus on operations against the Islamic State, causing disruptions in southern Iraq. National elections in early 2018 are heightening the political significance of security incidents. In areas where the Islamic State has receded, Iraqis are dealing with resettlement, reconstruction, and security challenges. Iraqi officials are working to combat IS re-infiltration, repair infrastructure, and address corruption. Recovery progress is uneven, with some local groups' concerns not being addressed. Securing communities and delivering immediate assistance are top priorities. Water, electricity, road, health, and education services were already uneven before IS's advance, raising the importance of improvements. Local reconciliation efforts may be needed where the rate of return lags for political or social reasons. Trust-building among local populations is crucial. Iraq's struggles to build trust among local populations and national groups may be more challenging than the physical battle against IS. Sustained commitment from Iraqis and their leaders is necessary, with limited opportunities for direct foreign involvement. U.S. engagement with Iraq since 2011 aims to reinforce unity and avoid fragmentation, with minimal direct military involvement. The results have been mixed, highlighting the enduring importance of Iraq to U.S. national security policymakers. The collapse of the U.S.-trained Iraqi army in 2014 led to renewed U.S. military intervention in Iraq to support government forces against the Islamic State. The U.S. has increased direct involvement since 2014, favoring working with Iraq's national government and partners like the Kurdish peshmerga and Sunni militia in the fight against the Islamic State. The collapse of the U.S.-trained Iraqi army in 2014 led to renewed U.S. military intervention in Iraq to support government forces against the Islamic State. This has created opportunities for sub-state actors, including Iran-backed Shia militia groups, to become more powerful. Some Iraqis criticize U.S. proposals that undermine Iraq's sovereignty or strengthen sub-state groups. Anti-U.S. Shia figures accuse the U.S. of supporting the rise of the Islamic State to weaken Iraq's ties to Iran. Others oppose U.S. support for Kurdish forces and decentralization initiatives, fearing it may weaken Iraq's national government and territorial integrity. These views reflect competing visions for Iraq's government and relations. The Trump Administration's vision for U.S. engagement in Iraq supports the national government while also providing aid to specific sub-state groups. Congress is overseeing U.S. programs in Iraq and directing the executive branch to report on their plans. U.S. grant assistance to Iraq has increased due to the Islamic State crisis and fiscal challenges since 2014. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requests for Iraq propose a mix of loan and grant assistance, reflecting the belief that Iraq should be financially self-sufficient in the long term. U.S. military operations against Islamic State targets in Iraq continue with the permission of the Iraqi government, and policymakers are considering a redefined U.S.-Iraqi security partnership. The Trump Administration is considering a redefined U.S.-Iraqi security partnership for continued training and assistance to Iraqi forces. Secretary of Defense Mattis has discussed terms for a training presence, and the administration views current military operations in Iraq as authorized by previous legislation. The partnership may involve U.S. forces conducting counterterrorism missions in Iraq. The U.S. is considering a security partnership with Iraq for training and assistance to Iraqi forces, allowing U.S. forces to conduct counterterrorism missions in Iraq. Some Iraqis, including Shia militia groups with ties to Iran, are critical of the U.S. presence in Iraq and may threaten to attack U.S. personnel. The U.S. has protected Kurdish-populated areas in northern Iraq. Since the 1990s, the United States has supported Kurdish-populated areas in northern Iraq, crossing the Turkish border to deter the Iraqi military and establish a no-fly zone. From 2003 to 2011, U.S. diplomats and military personnel helped formalize recognition of the Kurdistan Region in Iraq's constitution and address tensions between Kurds and other Iraqis. Since 2014, the KRG and Kurdish security forces have received U.S. economic and security assistance with Iraqi government approval. The KRG's preparations for the independence referendum raised Iraqi sensitivities about foreign ties. U.S. opposition to the referendum and support for national government security control heightened Kurdish concerns about U.S. commitments. Iraqi officials may express concern about U.S. security assistance to Kurdish forces if relations deteriorate further, potentially leading to restrictions on U.S. assistance or presence in Iraq. The United States has emphasized support for inclusive security forces under central government command in Iraq, including forces affiliated with the KRG. The Trump Administration has not indicated any change in this position. Appropriations legislation for FY2017 includes provisions for security and foreign assistance funding in the KRI and among minority populations in Iraq. The executive branch has secured commitments from Iraq's government to share U.S.-guaranteed loan financing proceeds among all Iraqis, including those in the KRI. Congress authorized potential U.S. security assistance to sub-state forces in Iraq for coalition efforts against ISIL if the Iraqi government fails to promote inclusiveness and address minority grievances. The Obama Administration reported in 2016 that Iraq had made progress in integrating minorities into military and political structures. Iran's government has integrated minorities into military and political structures and governs inclusively. Iran closely monitors Iraq's regional orientation and foreign policies, actively shaping developments for ideological and strategic reasons. Historical and religious ties link southern Iraq with Iran, with important Shia sites and clerics in Najaf. While both countries have Shia majorities, they differ in their associations with religious leaders and governance. Iran's influence in Iraq has grown through new state-to-state ties and patronage relationships with Iraqi Shia parties and leaders, despite historical state-to-state confrontation and a destructive war between the two countries in the 1980s. Iran's influence in Iraq has increased through new state-to-state ties and partnerships with Iraqi politicians and militia groups, some of whom are not Shia. Iran has supported armed groups in post-Saddam Iraq, including those that targeted and killed U.S. personnel. Additionally, Iran has utilized Iraqi fighters and territory to support the Asad government in Syria. Iranian leaders quickly responded to the Islamic State's offensive in 2014 by sending weapons and advisors to Iraq. Senior Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Abadi, commend Iran for its support in the fight against the Islamic State since 2014. Iran has supported Baghdad in its war against the Islamic State since 2014. Iraqi security officials acknowledge the presence of Iranian advisers in Iraq. Some Iraqis oppose what they see as undue Iranian interference. Prime Minister Abadi has rejected requests to pursue the fight against the Islamic State in Syria. The Iraqi government has been supported by Iran in the fight against the Islamic State since 2014. Despite this, Iran-backed Iraqi militias have operated in Syria without permission. Prime Minister Abadi maintains dialogue with Iran but aims for positive relations with neighbors and to reduce regional rivalries. U.S. military personnel in Iraq are training Iraqi forces and providing support, but the Trump Administration has not continued force deployment updates. The force management level for Iraq remains at the Obama Administration-set level, governed by a bilateral exchange of diplomatic notes. Both Trump and Obama Administrations consider Islamic State affiliates as legitimate military targets. U.S. military operations against the Islamic State in Syria began in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, with ongoing advice and assistance to Iraqi combat units. The U.S. military provides assistance to Iraqi combat units down to the brigade level, but does not engage in stabilization or reconstruction activities. Congress has allocated billions of dollars for military operations against ISIS since 2014, with the total cost amounting to $14.3 billion as of June 2017. This includes over 13,300 airstrikes against ISIS forces in Iraq. The United States government provides financial support for security, stabilization, governance, and humanitarian initiatives in Iraq, including funding for airstrikes against IS forces. President Trump requested $347.86 million in foreign assistance and $1.3 billion in defense assistance for Iraq in FY2018, mainly for post-conflict stabilization and military training programs. Congressional provisions reflect concerns about U.S. support for Iraq's national government. Congress has authorized the Iraq train and equip program to support Iraqi Security Forces, police, Kurdish peshmerga, Sunni tribal fighters, and border forces. Over $3.6 billion has been appropriated for the program, with a request for an additional $1.269 billion for FY2018. Congressional concern remains about the inclusivity of U.S. support for Iraq's national government. President Trump requested an additional $1.269 billion for FY2018 for the Counter ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF) in Iraq. The FY2018 NDAA extends the authority for the Iraq program to December 31, 2019 and authorizes the appropriation of the requested CTEF funding level. U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) assistance has subsidized Iraqi loans for defense procurement. In July 2017, the Administration notified Congress of using $250 million in FY2017 FMF to subsidize a $1.85 billion loan. President Trump did not request FMF for Iraq for FY2018. U.S. stabilization assistance in Iraq is channeled through the UNDP-administered Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS), supporting activities like infrastructure rehabilitation, livelihoods, capacity building, and reconciliation programs. Programs have been completed in areas with religious minorities, including the Ninewa Plain. The UNDP and Iraqi government reached an agreement on a new initiative for community reconciliation efforts, including atrocity documentation and support for local peace committees. The UNDP Iraq reported that the FFS had received over $420 million in resources. The executive branch notified Congress of $265.3 million in assistance funding for UNDP FFS programs. $65.3 million was supporting FFIS programs and $50 million was supporting FFES programs. The Trump Administration requested an additional $300 million in FY2018 Economic Support and Development Fund. The Trump Administration requested an additional $300 million in FY2018 Economic Support and Development Fund for Iraq, with a portion allocated for post-IS stabilization programs. House and Senate versions of the foreign operations appropriations bill differ on terms for ESF monies for stabilization in Iraq. USAID oversees the Governance Strengthening Project (GSP)/ Taqadum program and a new $25 million Iraq Governance Performance and Accountability Project to build capacity for Iraqi governance. Technical assistance is also provided to the national government and KRG for managing current challenges. USAID provides technical assistance to the national government and KRG to manage fiscal pressures, secure financing, implement reforms, and meet IMF targets. The Obama Administration requested a $1 billion sovereign loan guarantee for Iraq in FY2017. In January 2017, Iraq offered a $1 billion U.S.-guaranteed sovereign bond. The Trump Administration allocated an additional $264 million for humanitarian programs in Iraq in September 2017. The United States allocated an additional $264 million for humanitarian programs in Iraq in September 2017, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian assistance contributions in Iraq since 2014 to $1.7 billion. This assistance includes funding for programs in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and provides various essential services such as food, water, shelter, health interventions, and protection services. The U.S. government funds programs for de-mining and explosive device removal in heavily contaminated Iraq. Assistance has been provided since 2003 to support Iraq's security forces and counterterrorism units through systems acquisitions, training programs, and advisory missions. The U.S. government has funded programs for de-mining and explosive device removal in Iraq since 2003. The Office of Security Cooperation at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has assisted in implementing Foreign Military Sales cases for Iraq, with Congress authorizing up to $42 million for its activities in FY2018. In the FY2017 NDAA, Congress directed the executive branch to report on plans for the transition of U.S.-funded OSC-I activities. The FY2018 NDAA would prohibit the use of half of the defense funds until the report is submitted. Recent oversight reporting describes U.S. efforts to support Iraqi and KRG security leaders in developing long term force structure plans. The legislative requirement for biannual reporting on OSC-I activities expires in November 2017. In the 115th Congress, concerns about governance and human rights issues in Iraq are reflected in ongoing oversight efforts and legislation such as H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017. Public sector corruption, including in military and security agencies, is acknowledged as a problem in Iraq. Iraqi leaders have pledged to address this issue. Corruption in public services in Iraq is enabled by weak public administration and limited state capacity to manage funds. The State Department notes progress on anti-money laundering issues but highlights a lack of investigations into political corruption. Coordination issues among Iraqi intelligence agencies and other entities contribute to the problem. Personnel and technical capacity problems are prevalent in these entities. Leaders at the governorate level have been forced from office in different areas of the country. In 2017, leaders, including governors, were ousted from office due to corruption charges. KRG enforces Iraq's anti-money laundering law, but coordination with Baghdad is minimal. The State Department report on human rights in Iraq highlighted widespread severe human rights issues, attributing them to terrorist groups, sectarian hostility, corruption, and lack of transparency in government and society. Lack of oversight of security forces in the KRI contributes to human rights violations. Sectarian tensions, corruption, and lack of transparency weaken the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government's ability to address human rights abuses is undermined by corruption and lack of transparency. Reports indicate human rights violations by Iraqi security forces, federal police, peshmerga, and PMF members. Investigations into these abuses have not been made public, and conditions in Iraqi prisons remain harsh. Women also face barriers in attaining positions of power. Minority groups in Iraq face difficulties and security risks, leading some to flee the country or seek shelter in different areas. Those in disputed territories experience interference and exploitation for political, economic, or security reasons. Diverse minority communities have varying territorial claims and administrative preferences. Some prefer alignment with the Kurdistan Region, while others seek alignment with the national government. In 2016, Iraq was designated as having governmental armed forces or government-supported armed groups that recruit and use child soldiers, with President Obama waiving related sanctions. Minority groups in Iraq face internal disputes over alignment with Kurdish or national government entities, potentially leading to tension and violence. The Child Soldiers Protection Act of 2008 designated Iraq in 2016 for training and deploying child soldiers. Despite reports of continued recruitment, Iraq was not included in the 2017 list. Efforts are recommended to stop the use of child soldiers by armed groups in Iraq. Press reports cited objections to this decision by State Department officials. The UN Secretary-General reported on the use of child soldiers by the Islamic State in October 2017. The UN Secretary-General reported in 2017 that the Islamic State and parts of the Popular Mobilization Forces used child soldiers. US support for Iraq's campaign against the Islamic State has improved US-Iraqi relations. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Abadi prefer close bilateral ties to continue beyond the military campaign. Discussions are ongoing to implement the 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement for deeper cooperation. The partnership between Iraq and the United States aims to strengthen Iraqi security forces, prevent the resurgence of extremist groups, and counter Iranian influence. However, there are debates on the extent and conditions of U.S. assistance, with some Iraqis and Iran opposing close ties with the U.S. This partnership is seen as a way for Iraq to enhance its security capabilities and protect against interference from neighboring countries or global powers. The potential risks of closing U.S.-Iraqi ties for some Iraqi leaders include uncertainties about continued international support for the KRG and peshmerga forces post-Islamic State defeat. With elections approaching and the future of relations between Iraq's national government and the Kurdistan region uncertain, U.S. decision-makers must consider how undesirable scenarios could impact bilateral ties and U.S. interests. Iraq's national government could demand the United States cease its support for the KRG in the context of KRG-Baghdad disputes. Confrontation over a continued U.S. presence could lead to new violence, with groups hostile to cooperation attacking U.S. personnel or facilities. The focus is on \"winning the peace\" and avoiding past mistakes in Iraq. Iraqis and U.S. observers are focused on avoiding past mistakes and \"winning the peace\" in Iraq. Challenges include capacity shortfalls, corruption, security force gaps, fiscal constraints, and opposition to reform efforts. Despite recapturing areas from the Islamic State, there are concerns about renewed insurgent violence. Iraqi and coalition forces are preparing to combat insurgent violence from the Islamic State and looking ahead to the 2018 national elections. Military coordination has been successful, but political accommodation among victors remains uncertain. The actions of Iraqi forces and political actors leading up to the elections may impact the country's stability and U.S. interests. Key considerations include integrating forces, resolving Baghdad-KRG disputes, and addressing the needs of displaced Iraqis. The challenges faced by Congress and U.S. officials in developing policy options for Iraq include concerns about empowered militias, Shia Arab rivalries, and the future of U.S. military presence. Debates over military support to Iraqi forces highlight the difficulty of securing U.S. interests without provoking opposition from Iraqi constituencies. U.S. aid to the Kurds has also been a contentious issue. U.S. aid to the Kurds is provided with Baghdad's approval, ensuring responsible use of equipment. Recent confrontations between the national government and Kurdish forces may complicate assistance patterns. Iraqis assess U.S. initiatives based on domestic rivalries and agendas, requiring flexibility and patience to align preferences with evolving politics and security conditions."
