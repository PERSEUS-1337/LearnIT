    "content": "The Act titled \"Medigap Consumer Protection Act of 1995\" eliminates attained age rating for premium increases in Medigap policies. Section 1882(r) of the Social Security Act is amended to ensure that the premium for a Medicare supplemental policy does not increase based on the age of the policyholder after enrollment. The policy must meet certain requirements, and if it doesn't, the issuer must offer the option to replace it with a Medicare supplemental policy that meets the necessary criteria at the next renewal. Additionally, there are specific loss ratio requirements outlined in the subsection. The effective date for the policy is outlined in Section 3. If the NAIC updates the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation to include new requirements from this Act within 6 months, those changes will apply to policies issued after a specified date. If the NAIC does not update the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation within 6 months, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will promulgate a regulation. This regulation will apply to policies issued after a specified date as if the reference to the 1979 Model Regulation is now referring to the updated 1991 NAIC Model Regulation. The 1995 Federal Regulation is defined as the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation changed by the Secretary. States must adopt the 1995 NAIC Model Regulation or the 1995 Federal Regulation within a year of adoption by the NAIC or Secretary. Additional legislative action may be required for compliance. The date specified in this subsection for states without scheduled legislative sessions in 1996 is the first day of the first calendar quarter after the close of the first legislative session starting on or after January 1, 1996. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session."
