    "content": "Certain highway and bridge projects eligible for federal-aid funding must meet standards and requirements at every stage of development, including initial planning, design, environmental review, rights-of-way acquisition, construction, and operation. Each stage is primarily managed at the state or local level, with FHWA overseeing compliance with federal-aid highway requirements. The development stages of federally funded highway projects involve various activities that impact project delivery time. The preliminary design and environmental review stage includes processes to identify and comply with environmental requirements. Recent laws aim to expedite the environmental review process for compliance with National standards. The current legislation focuses on expediting project delivery by streamlining the NEPA process, but evidence suggests other factors contribute more to project delays. This report discusses the complexities in tying the environmental review process to federal-aid highway project delivery time and the difficulties in determining project development time and causes of delays. Various approaches identified by transportation stakeholders are also examined. The report discusses approaches to expedite the environmental review process for transportation projects. It aims to help Congress understand NEPA compliance and additional environmental requirements affected by legislation. The process varies by project and state, involving multiple compliance requirements. The process for federally funded highway projects involves demonstrating compliance with NEPA and other environmental requirements, depending on the project's potential adverse effects on communities, natural/cultural resources, or special status land. Compliance may include obtaining permits, approvals, studies, or analyses. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before proceeding with actions and involve the public in decision-making. Agencies can prioritize other project benefits over environmental concerns if adequately evaluated. The environmental review process, including compliance with NEPA, impacts project development by requiring documentation of compliance before project approval and final design, property acquisition, or construction can proceed. Other federal laws may also influence project decisions by dictating the least impact on resources, prohibiting certain resource use, mandating mitigation measures, or specifying criteria for activities. It is DOT policy to use the NEPA compliance process to balance transportation decision making by considering impacts on the environment and public safety. Some stakeholders find the environmental review process important but challenging and time-consuming. The environmental review process for federally funded transportation projects can cause delays of months or even years. Determining the specific impact of this process on project delivery is challenging due to limited data availability and lack of tracking by states. The environmental review process for federally funded transportation projects can cause significant delays due to local factors, project type variations, and lack of standard measures for completion. Local and state issues, project priority, funding availability, and controversy can influence the speed of project delivery. The environmental review process for federally funded transportation projects can experience delays due to project type variations, local issues, and lack of standard measures for completion. State DOTs implement project delivery processes differently based on their specific needs and requirements, making it challenging to isolate the effects of federal law on environmental compliance. Some states have unique design and contracting processes that expedite project delivery. Time saved is hard to measure, but addressing environmental issues early can speed up project completion. Identifying and addressing adverse impacts early can prevent local opposition. Environmental compliance requirements are a common source of frustration for transportation agencies and project sponsors. Limited data makes it hard to pinpoint specific causes of delays. Identifying distinct root causes of delays in environmental compliance is crucial for finding effective solutions to expedite project delivery. Understanding why a delay occurred helps in addressing the underlying problem. Complex projects may have multiple interrelated factors causing delays. Major construction projects require extensive review and documentation to ensure compliance with regulations like NEPA. The majority of FHWA-approved projects involve no significant environmental impacts and require limited documentation under NEPA. Compliance with DOT's \"NEPA regulations\" goes beyond NEPA requirements, ensuring projects comply with Title 23 regulations for Federal-aid Highways. The NEPA compliance process ensures adherence to environmental review requirements, including public hearings and preservation of parklands. Transportation agency officials often face delays due to compliance requirements for protecting parklands, historic sites, wetlands, and endangered species. Compliance with these requirements can cause project-specific delays. Barriers to efficiently implementing existing NEPA requirements may stem from project-specific factors such as incomplete permit applications, challenges in obtaining approvals, or disagreements with resource agencies. Existing laws and regulations aim to streamline the NEPA process by coordinating agency interaction, reducing paperwork, and integrating environmental compliance considerations early in project planning. Implementing existing requirements for NEPA may be project-specific and challenging to address by amending federal requirements. It is unclear if additional federal requirements could expedite the NEPA process or if eliminating certain NEPA-specific requirements would speed up project delivery. The impact of changes to the NEPA process on project delivery time will depend on factors such as project scope, complexity, and local influences. The environmental review process for highway projects is influenced by various factors, including state funding, project priorities, and compliance requirements beyond NEPA. These requirements stem from past efforts by Congress to minimize adverse impacts from federally funded projects and protect certain communities or resources. The current debate often focuses on the impact of the review process on project delivery, overlooking the reasons behind the enactment of these requirements. The environmental review process for highway projects has evolved over the past 50 years, with requirements enacted between 1966 and 1972 in response to growing public concern about the impacts of human activity on the environment. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized the construction of the Interstate Highway System, which raised particular concerns about its environmental effects. The Interstate Highway System is a network of limited-access roads in the United States, consisting of over 45,000 miles of rural highways, suburban and urban freeways, and bridges. While it brought economic and cultural benefits, its construction also had adverse impacts on the environment, especially in urban areas where freeways were often built in open spaces or areas with low land acquisition costs. The Interstate Highway System construction often targeted available open spaces or areas with low land acquisition costs, impacting historic sites, parks, and urban neighborhoods. Projects like the I-95 segment in Miami's Overtown community disproportionately affected the urban poor. In 1957, the Overtown community was devastated by the construction of I-95 and I-395 freeways, leading to economic and social upheaval. Freeway revolts in various cities resulted in projects being abandoned or scaled back due to public opposition. In the 1960s and 1970s, Congress enacted legislation to address public concerns over federal highway projects and other federal actions impacting communities and resources. This report outlines requirements applicable to federally funded highway projects, including the need for project sponsors to demonstrate compliance before receiving funding. The Federal-aid Highway program requires project sponsors to demonstrate compliance with federal, tribal, and state requirements before receiving funding. Specific requirements for Federal-aid Highways include standards and procedures to address project impacts on the environment. Urban freeway construction activities must consider adverse project impacts according to federal directives. The guidelines under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7109(h) ensure that adverse impacts of highway projects are fully considered, including economic, social, and environmental effects. This includes factors such as air, noise, and water pollution, destruction of resources, community cohesion, and displacement of people. Additionally, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7109(i) directs the establishment of noise standards compatible with different land uses for highway projects. The Department of Transportation (DOT) requires federal-aid projects to comply with noise standards and may require noise impact analysis and abatement measures. Public hearings are mandated for projects passing through cities, towns, or villages, considering economic, social, and environmental impacts. Preservation of parklands, known as \"Section 4(f)\" requirements, prohibits DOT from certain actions. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is prohibited from approving projects that use publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites under Section 4(f) requirements. Approval can only be granted if there is no feasible alternative and all efforts are made to minimize harm to the resource. Preservation of parklands requirements may significantly impact highway project development. Projects using a 4(f) resource must evaluate alternatives to avoid the resource to be approved by FHWA. The \"Overton Park Criteria\" requires showing that alternatives not using a resource would result in significant costs or community disruption. FHWA must also consider the significance of the resource itself. SAFETEA allows for use of a 4(f) resource with minimal impacts, requiring concurrence from the resource's jurisdictional official. For example, FHWA must consult with agencies within the Department of the Interior for projects near parks, recreation areas, or wildlife refuges. Section 4(f) requirements for federal-aid highway projects involve consultation with relevant agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Park Service. A de minimis impacts determination is necessary for historic sites, based on criteria from the National Historic Preservation Act. This determination must be approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer and possibly the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Compared to other environmental regulations, Section 4(f) uniquely limits the use of protected resources. In the 1960s, Congress debated legislative options to address potential adverse impacts associated with federal actions. A project funded under the Federal-aid Highways program would generally be considered a federal action. Two laws applicable specifically to federal actions that significantly affect the environmental review process for highway project development are NEPA and the National Historic Preservation. The NEPA compliance process requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts of a project and provide the public with an opportunity to comment before a final decision is made. If adverse environmental impacts are identified and evaluated, agencies can still move forward with the project if other benefits outweigh the costs. The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) establishes a national policy for preserving historic sites, buildings, and objects. Section 106 requires federal agencies to consider impacts on sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Agencies must also allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to comment on actions affecting these properties. For federally funded highway projects, FHWA consults with the Advisory Council or designated SHPO to assess impacts on historic sites and mitigate them. Section 106 and Section 4(f) have similarities but also key differences in their requirements for considering project impacts on certain resources. Additional federal laws and executive orders apply to federal actions affecting specific resources or communities. The federal actions for projects may involve acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition of real property, affect wetlands, floodplains, convert farmland, cause adverse impacts on minority and low-income populations, or affect human remains and cultural material of Native American and Hawaiian groups. The Grave Protection and Repatriation Act and other federal statutes aim to protect natural, environmental, and cultural resources from human activities. Highway projects must comply with specific requirements to minimize adverse impacts on land, water resources, and water quality. Highway projects must comply with federal, state, or tribal regulations to minimize adverse impacts on land and water resources, including wetlands, aquatic ecosystems, navigable waters, floodplains, and water quality. Compliance may involve consultation, analysis, or approval from relevant agencies. Highway or bridge projects must comply with federal regulations to minimize impacts on land and water resources. Compliance may require permits from agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers or the EPA. Various requirements may apply based on project impacts, such as public hearing or notification obligations. The environmental review process ensures coordination of different public hearing or notification requirements under federal regulations for highway or bridge projects to minimize impacts on land and water resources. DOT policy aims to streamline the investigation, review, and consultation necessary for environmental compliance into a single process, with NEPA compliance serving as the framework for completing the environmental review process. Transportation stakeholders have suggested ways to expedite project delivery in the past. Suggestions from transportation stakeholders and legislative options proposed by some Members of Congress have focused on expediting project delivery by addressing environmental compliance obligations under separate state or federal requirements, rather than just those under NEPA. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) implemented regulations for NEPA, requiring federal agencies to develop their own procedures for typical actions. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has its own procedures for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for federally funded highway projects. These procedures ensure compliance with environmental requirements and have been periodically revised to reflect legislative directives and court decisions. The regulations were recently updated to align with a new environmental review process. The regulations were recently modified to align with a new environmental review process established under SAFETEA for highway projects receiving funding or approval under Federal-aid Highways programs. Compliance with NEPA is demonstrated in the \"NEPA document,\" with requirements defined by CEQ and DOT regulations. NEPA regulations establish three classes of action based on project impacts to determine the appropriate level of environmental review and analysis needed. The NEPA regulations establish three classes of action based on project impacts to determine the appropriate level of environmental review and analysis needed. Projects may require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), an Environmental Assessment (EA), or be categorically excluded (CEs or CATEX) from the requirement for an EIS or EA. Evaluation of environmental impacts is necessary before committing federal resources, with NEPA documents prepared during project planning and completed in the preliminary design and environmental review stage. During project development, the NEPA document must be complete and approved by FHWA before final design activities, property acquisition, or project construction can proceed. Only about 4% of federal-aid highway projects require an EIS, with the majority processed as a CE or with an EA/FONSI. Recent FHWA data show a similar proportion for major new projects and smaller maintenance/rehabilitation projects. In FY2009, approximately 91% of roadway projects receiving federal-aid funds involved reconstruction, restoration, or rehabilitation activities, while only about 9% involved new construction or added capacity. Few projects required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), with some states having no active EIS projects and others preparing only a small number. In FY2009, only a small percentage of roadway projects required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), with a significant number of active EISs being prepared in just five states. These projects are high-profile, complex, and costly, representing a small proportion of total projects but accounting for a larger portion of allocated program funds. In FY2009, only a small percentage of roadway projects required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), with a significant number of active EISs being prepared in just five states. These projects are high-profile, complex, and costly, representing a small proportion of total projects but accounting for a larger portion of allocated program funds. 12% of allocated program funds are used for projects, with no direct relationship between project cost and environmental impacts. For example, projects costing over $1 million may not necessarily require an EIS. Several major projects receiving over $500 million in federal assistance are being processed as CEs or with an approved FONSI, such as the \"Loop 12/State Highway 35E Corridor\" project in Dallas-Fort Worth, TX, estimated at $1.6 billion. The NEPA compliance process evolved over 20 years after NEPA was enacted, with requirements reflected in CEQ and DOT regulations. Each NEPA document must demonstrate consideration of environmental impacts as part of the federal decision-making process. The courts also influenced the evolution of NEPA compliance. The NEPA compliance process, influenced by the courts, determines significant impacts, EIS preparation, and handling of adverse comments. Congress and DOT make changes to NEPA requirements for projects funded under DOT programs. CEs, representing the majority of approved projects, are actions with no significant impact on resources or quality. The NEPA compliance process determines significant impacts, EIS preparation, and handling of adverse comments. CEs are actions with no significant impact on resources or quality, but may involve \"unusual circumstances\" that require FHWA approval. Unusual circumstances include substantial project controversy, impacts on protected properties, or inconsistencies with environmental requirements. DOT identifies two groups of surface transportation projects likely to meet CE criteria. The DOT has identified two groups of surface transportation projects that would likely meet the criteria for Categorical Exclusions (CEs). These projects are expected to have insignificant environmental impacts and may require varying levels of supporting documentation depending on the extent of impacts and necessary analysis. The DOT has identified two groups of surface transportation projects that would likely meet the criteria for Categorical Exclusions (CEs). These projects are expected to have insignificant environmental impacts and may require varying levels of supporting documentation depending on the extent of impacts and necessary analysis. Signals in a historic district may require compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA or Section 4(f). The second group of CEs includes actions with substantial effects but not \"significant.\" Projects must provide documentation to confirm no \"unusual circumstances\" resulting in significant environmental impacts. FHWA may approve a CE designation for any action meeting the regulatory definition. CEs are sometimes mistaken as exempt from NEPA or having no environmental impacts. No significant environmental impact under NEPA does not mean the project has no other regulated environmental impacts. State DOTs gather information on a CE's potential impacts such as highway traffic noise, aquifer proximity, stream flow alteration, right-of-way acquisition, Section 4(f) evaluation, displacement, wetlands work, and county construction regulations. Projects processed as CEs may involve activities that impact the environment but do not reach the level of \"significant\" under NEPA. Compliance with other laws protecting natural or cultural resources may have their own thresholds. FHWA approval may be delayed if compliance requirements beyond NEPA are not realized. FHWA works with state DOTs to establish CE review procedures. \"Listed CEs\" in a state generally refer to specific projects. In a state, \"listed CEs\" require minimal documentation for FHWA approval. For \"documented CEs,\" FHWA reviews NEPA documentation as part of project development or the state DOT does this under a programmatic CE agreement with FHWA oversight. Programmatic approach streamlines environmental requirements for specific project types. A programmatic CE is commonly used for specific project types like bridge maintenance or road resurfacing. It allows for repetitive actions to be considered on a programmatic basis, established on a local, regional, or statewide level. State DOTs are encouraged to take a programmatic approach to CE determinations, and may assume FHWA responsibility for determining CE criteria under certain provisions. This can streamline environmental requirements for highway projects. States can assume FHWA responsibility for determining CE criteria under certain provisions, with legal liability for NEPA determinations. FHWA conducts annual reviews of state processes, with Alaska, California, and Utah currently participating. EIS projects are a small percentage but receive significant attention in NEPA debates. FHWA does not specify actions requiring an EIS, determined case-by-case. Examples of projects needing EIS include new freeways, four-lane highways, and separate bus lanes. EIS process includes filing NOI, scoping environmental issues, drafting EIS, and seeking comments. Compliance requirements evolve based on CEQ and judicial interpretations of NEPA. The NOI announces the project to the public and agencies, determines the scope of the project, identifies potential challenges during the scoping process, and may lead to the identification of alternative routes. During the scoping process, potential routes or alignments are identified to avoid significant historical properties, endangered species habitats, or wetlands, which may require compliance with various environmental regulations. The EIS preparation begins once the scope of the action and its environmental issues are determined. The EIS is prepared in two stages, resulting in a draft and final EIS, with supplemental documents possibly required. The final EIS must identify the preferred project alternative, evaluate all reasonable alternatives, address public and agency comments, and summarize public involvement. Compliance with all applicable environmental requirements should be documented in the final EIS. The final EIS should document compliance with environmental laws, executive orders, and other requirements. FHWA approval of the document includes adoption of findings and determinations. The ROD explains the agency's decision and mitigation measures. Compliance with NEPA and other environmental requirements is necessary for each element of the EIS. Identifying project purpose and need is crucial for meeting various environmental regulations. SAFETEA included provisions for projects requiring an EIS, establishing a new environmental review process for highways, transit, and multi-modal projects. The process requires project sponsors to notify DOT of project details and comply with environmental laws. The proposed project's details, including length and location, are required for federal approvals. A new entity called a \"participating agency\" must be involved in the NEPA process. The lead agency must coordinate public and agency participation in the environmental review process and set deadlines for comments. Judicial review of permits for highway or transit projects must be filed within 180 days. The NEPA process for highway or transit projects requires judicial review to be filed within 180 days after publication of a notice in the Federal Register. DOT has provided guidance for implementing SAFETEA's environmental review process, with generally favorable feedback from state DOTs. Under Section 6005, SAFETEA amended Title 23 to establish a \"Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program\" allowing certain states to assume federal environmental review responsibilities. Survey respondents had concerns about provisions duplicating existing procedures and creating additional requirements that could impact schedules and budgets. Under Section 6005, SAFETEA amended Title 23 to establish a \"Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program\" allowing states to assume federal environmental review responsibilities. Only California has agreed to participate, as other states have concerns about potential liability and DOT requirements. Concerns have been raised by stakeholders in transportation project development regarding DOT requirements for implementing the pilot program under Section 6005. The objections mainly focus on DOT's requirements for rights-of-way acquisitions in states assuming federal authority under NEPA. NEPA aims to ensure that federal agencies consider the impacts of their actions before making decisions, meaning federal funds cannot be used for ROW acquisitions before the NEPA process is complete. States can currently use state funds for ROW acquisitions on an at-risk basis. Some argue that states are hesitant to assume federal authority under NEPA due to concerns about losing the ability to make at-risk rights-of-way acquisitions. This could potentially expose states to federal liability and judicial review if transactions violate NEPA goals. State DOTs may be willing to accept this risk, but the implications remain unclear. The third category of NEPA document is an EA, which is required for actions that do not clearly require an EIS. An EA serves to provide evidence for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). The applicant must consult with interested agencies to determine the project scope and potential impacts. The EA is subject to FHWA approval before being made available to the public. It does not need to be circulated but must be available for public inspection and comment for at least 30 days. A notice of availability must be sent to clearinghouses and published locally. Depending on state procedures, a public hearing may or may not be required. The basis of a request for a FONSI must be clearly documented to show compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws. An approved FONSI serves as the final agency decision on a project, but determining the time it takes to complete an EA is challenging. Local and state transportation officials do not regularly track this time. EAs may require limited environmental review under NEPA, with any analysis needed likely under separate laws. Transportation agency officials have noted that EAs can sometimes be as lengthy as EISs, indicating factors indirectly related to NEPA compliance may come into play. The NEPA document is prepared by a \"lead agency\" and may require input and analysis from \"cooperating\" or \"participating\" agencies. Depending on the environmental impacts of a project, both the lead and cooperating agencies must meet federal requirements, which can cause frustration or project delays. The lead agency is responsible for preparing the NEPA document. The lead agency, typically the DOT for federally funded transportation projects, must collaborate with other federal, state, or local agencies as joint lead agencies. This collaboration includes entities such as toll, port, and turnpike authorities, as well as metropolitan planning organizations. For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security may join as a joint lead agency with DOT and the project sponsor for a transportation improvement at a national border crossing. The FHWA collaborates with the entity seeking federal funds to prepare NEPA documents for transportation projects. FHWA ensures compliance with laws and regulations before project approval and funding by independently evaluating environmental documents and legal sufficiency. This review confirms consistency with legal requirements and assesses compliance efforts. The FHWA collaborates with entities seeking federal funds to prepare NEPA documents for transportation projects. A technical review of the final NEPA/Section 4(f) document is conducted by FHWA for compliance with applicable laws. Lead agencies consult and obtain comments from federal agencies with jurisdiction or special expertise. Cooperating agencies may assume responsibility for developing information and preparing environmental analyses. The lead agency, cooperating agencies, and other relevant entities are required to provide comments on the NEPA document, with specific requirements outlined by CEQ regulations. The lead agency must consider and respond to comments by modifying proposed alternatives, developing new alternatives, supplementing analyses, or making factual corrections. The lead agency must consider and respond to comments on the NEPA document by modifying proposed alternatives, developing new alternatives, supplementing analyses, or making factual corrections. FHWA suggests resolving interagency disagreements before finalizing the EIS, and if significant issues remain, they should be identified in the final EIS. Disagreements on coordinating agencies' involvement in the NEPA process have been seen in some highway projects. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta requested CEQ Chairman James Connaughton to clarify the lead agency's role in developing EIS statements of project purpose and need to avoid delays in highway project development. Chairman Connaughton emphasized the lead agency's authority to define a project's purpose and need, citing CEQ regulations and federal court decisions. The lead agency is responsible for the scope, objectivity, and content of the entire NEPA process, including public participation in federal decision-making. CEQ regulations require agencies to provide public notice of NEPA-related hearings and meetings. DOT procedures go beyond CEQ regulations to reflect Title 23 requirements for public hearings. EAs must be made available to the public through notices in local media. Public hearings may or may not be required based on state procedures approved by FHWA. Compliance with Title 23's public hearing requirements must be documented according to DOT regulations. Stakeholders commenting on surface transportation projects may vary depending on impacts, including individuals, groups, or special interest groups concerned about project effects. For example, a highway project may elicit comments from local businesses, homeowners, or environmental organizations regarding impacts on adjacent areas or sensitive resources. Comments from stakeholders, including local or national environmental organizations, may address various aspects of the NEPA process or related documentation. Disagreements can arise over the project's purpose, alternatives considered, or the significance of its impacts. Legal action may be taken based on issues raised during the public comment period, with some critics using NEPA for litigation to delay or stop projects. Litigation has historically played a role in NEPA implementation, but compliance with NEPA can help prevent legal challenges. The threat of litigation affects the current implementation of NEPA, leading to efforts to create \"litigation-proof\" documents for costly, complex, or controversial projects. Some view this positively as it ensures adherence to NEPA, while others argue it may result in wasteful documentation and slow decision-making. Unlike NEPA, which applies to all federally funded highway projects, additional considerations may arise. Additional environmental requirements for federally funded highway projects depend on site-specific conditions and potential impacts to resources. Compliance requirements that may delay the environmental review process have been identified by transportation stakeholders. The most commonly applicable laws and selected compliance requirements are listed in Table 4. When a federal highway project involves regulated impacts to certain resources, an agency with jurisdiction over that resource may need to provide analysis, consultation, or approval before the project can proceed. This can lengthen the environmental review process if outside agency opinions are required. Project delays may occur depending on factors like anticipated approvals or agency workload. Integration of the NEPA compliance process aims to avoid duplication of effort. CEQ's NEPA regulations require agencies to prepare NEPA documentation concurrently with other environmental requirements to avoid duplication of effort. The documentation must demonstrate compliance with all applicable environmental requirements, including federal permits and approvals. If full compliance is not possible when the final NEPA document is prepared, consultation with appropriate agencies and assurance of meeting requirements are necessary. The environmental review process is crucial for project delivery and involves challenges in measuring each stage of development. Delays in the process can be caused by various factors, but it can also lead to more efficient project development. Federal-aid highway funds are allocated to states by FHWA for highway and bridge projects, with state DOTs deciding how to use the funds. Multiple activities and decisions are involved in this determination process. The project development process for transportation-related needs is primarily carried out at the local, tribal, or state level, with federal approval from FHWA for highway projects. The process includes project planning, design, right-of-way acquisition, and construction, with environmental compliance obligations at each stage. Maintenance activities post-construction are also outlined. The completion of the NEPA compliance process and overall environmental review process are linked by DOT's requirement that a project cannot be approved until compliance is documented. However, estimating the time to complete each stage is difficult due to lack of centralized data tracking and no clear measure of timely delivery. Project development may experience delays if the project sponsor takes longer than expected to complete a stage. Tracking the time for individual activities within a stage, such as environmental review, is challenging due to overlapping elements and difficulty in identifying distinct start and end points. Development may start, stop, and restart for reasons unrelated to environmental compliance, like changes in state priorities or funding availability. The time it takes to complete the environmental review process can be influenced by changes in state priorities, funding availability, and other factors unrelated to NEPA. Differences in state DOT project development processes and tribal or state-specific environmental compliance requirements make it challenging to establish a nationally applicable measure of project development stages. It is difficult to determine the specific time needed for NEPA compliance or agency consultations under the Endangered Species Act, as well as the extent to which completing the process delays project delivery. It is not possible to accurately assert broad, nationally applicable values for the time required to complete the environmental review process. The time to complete the environmental review process varies due to state priorities, funding availability, and project complexity. It is challenging to establish a nationally applicable measure of project development stages, as different states and tribes have specific compliance requirements. Larger, more complex projects typically take longer to complete and require compliance with various regulations. The General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report in 2002 on the time it takes to complete federally funded highway projects. Planning, approval, and construction of major highway projects typically took 9 to 19 years. The preliminary design and environmental review phase took 1 to 5 years, depending on complexity. The environmental review phase for federally funded highway projects can take from one to five years, depending on design complexity and environmental impacts. While the delay caused by the environmental review process is not clearly defined, demonstrating compliance with environmental requirements, especially for projects requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), can be time-consuming. Transportation agencies often focus on resolving environmental issues to improve project completion times. The environmental review process for federally funded highway projects can take one to five years due to design complexity and environmental impacts. Transportation agency officials often cite frustration with delays caused by environmental compliance requirements, particularly for projects needing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Limited studies have examined project delays linked to the environmental review process, with a focus on major construction projects with unique issues. The 2003 FHWA study found that delays in completing Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for federally funded highway projects are often due to project-specific issues and complex design, engineering, and compliance issues. Factors causing delays were not consistently identified, with timing influenced more by external social and economic factors in broad geographic regions rather than specific variables like controversial issues or agency participation. Limited data and anecdotal evidence also suggest various factors affecting project delays. Factors external to environmental reviews, such as local and project-specific issues, are the primary causes of delays in completing environmental reviews. Local issues include project priority, funding changes, local opposition, and project-specific issues like technical complexity, scope changes, lawsuits, consultant work, documentation issues, alignment problems, and land use planning. Efforts to identify causes of delay in transportation projects have found differing perceptions among resource and transportation agency officials. Issues such as poor communication, incorrect information, disagreements among agencies, and environmental problems have been identified as sources of delay. The environmental review process for transportation projects may face delays due to disagreements among agencies and environmental issues. Resource agencies' lack of timely response was identified as a primary problem. Balancing transportation needs with environmental protection and community concerns is crucial, as the process can ultimately save time and reduce project costs by identifying and avoiding problems in later stages. The study highlighted the importance of applying recognized management principles to ensure timely completion of highway construction projects and reduce delays. Adherence to principles like the \"Cost-Time Relationship\" can help in identifying and avoiding problems during the design phase, ultimately saving time and costs in the construction process. In planning and design, reducing time and cost for construction is crucial by avoiding unforeseen conditions, minimizing design errors, and developing efficient construction approaches. Decisions made during the design phase greatly impact project costs, with only about 10% of the budget typically spent. The potential benefits of early identification of issues in the planning stage can lead to accelerated project delivery. A 2009 peer exchange highlighted how the environmental review process can expedite project delivery. Participants from state DOTs and FHWA Division Offices discussed strategies to move environmental documents through the EIS process more effectively. They shared information on projects that had successfully navigated the process quickly, highlighting challenges, methods used, and lessons learned. State DOTs were noted for embracing innovative solutions to balance transportation needs with environmental protection and community concerns in a collaborative and transparent manner. The projects were conducted collaboratively and transparently, involving stakeholders early in the EIS development process. This approach led to faster completion of environmental reviews and better quality projects that meet transportation needs while protecting the environment. An example of efficient environmental compliance was the reconstruction of the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis after its collapse in 2007, completed in just over a year. This event raised the question of why all projects can't be completed as quickly, partially answered by an FHWA study on key elements. The FHWA study examined the environmental review process after a bridge collapse, identifying major causes of project delays such as funding issues, local controversy, and political support. The study highlighted how the absence of these delays can lead to efficient implementation of the environmental review process for emergency projects. The I-35 bridge reconstruction project required environmental permits without waivers or exemptions. The replacement bridge was widened for future transit options but did not increase capacity. Various permits were needed, including from the Corps under the Clean Water Act and the U.S. Coast Guard. An assessment of impacts on endangered species was conducted by a consultation team. The I-35 bridge reconstruction project required environmental permits, including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and MnDOT's Cultural Resources Unit. Efficient interagency coordination was a key factor in expediting the bridge reconstruction. Existing relationships among state and federal agencies involved in the environmental review process facilitated a quick response. The quick response to the bridge collapse was facilitated by efficient interagency coordination and existing relationships among state and federal agencies. The project's scope was limited to expedite the environmental review process, with a focus on completing the project as a state priority. MnDOT's use of a design-build procurement process also contributed to the expedited project completion. Lessons learned and suggested solutions from transportation agency officials emphasize common strategies for quick project completion. Suggested solutions from transportation agency officials for streamlining the environmental review process include efficient interagency communication, early stakeholder engagement, internal process improvements, agency commitment to project schedules, and programmatic compliance approaches. These approaches align with existing standards and regulations for federally funded highway projects. CEQ and DOT provide guidance to federal agencies and state/local agencies to improve efficiency in environmental reviews. DOT's \"Every Day Counts\" program aims to shorten project delivery by evaluating changes in the environmental review process, including improving the link between project planning and environmental review and enhancing legal sufficiency reviews. The curr_chunk discusses problems in NEPA and Section 4(f) document development, root causes, and measures for local and state transportation agencies to avoid these problems. It encourages reviews in the draft stage to reduce the need for multiple legal reviews of a final document and resolve conflicts earlier in the process. It also suggests expanding the use of programmatic agreements and utilizing existing regulatory flexibility to streamline the implementation of requirements. These issues highlight the importance of efficiently implementing existing requirements and identifying barriers. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for efficient implementation of existing requirements in transportation projects to avoid delays and higher costs. It questions specific elements of the environmental review process that cause project delays, particularly focusing on the time it takes to complete the NEPA process. The influence of environmental requirements under Title 23 and other federal laws is also highlighted. The influence of environmental requirements under Title 23 and other federal laws on project delivery time is questioned, with a focus on potential changes to the NEPA process. Delays in the environmental review process are primarily attributed to local or project-specific issues, such as project complexity or changes in state priorities. Regardless of changes to the NEPA process, local factors will strongly influence project delivery time. State or local decision makers will continue to have the most significant influence on project delivery. The success of efforts to expedite the environmental review process for transportation projects is dependent on local and state issues. State and local transportation agencies now consider a project's impact on communities and resources more than during the construction of the Interstate Highway System. Local and state agencies prioritize a project's effects on communities and resources in transportation project planning and development. Decisions are influenced by the project's benefits and adverse effects on the environment and the community it serves. Data from various surveys and studies by FHWA, GAO, universities, and transportation organizations provide information on project development stages, time for environmental review, and causes of delays. The FHWA has conducted various studies and surveys on evaluating the performance of environmental streamlining, reasons for EIS project delays, strategies for moving complex environmental documents through the EIS process, and implementing performance measurement in environmental streamlining. These studies provide valuable insights into improving the efficiency of environmental reviews for highway infrastructure projects.
