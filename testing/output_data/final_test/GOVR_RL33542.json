    "content": "Broadband technology allows users to send and receive data at high speeds, surpassing traditional internet access. Telecommunications companies are working on providing broadband access, while the government aims to ensure fair competition for affordable access. Broadband is seen as crucial for economic growth and can transform internet usage. Broadband technology has the potential to transform the Internet by enabling interactive applications like online classrooms, showrooms, and health clinics. It can also be used for monitoring home security, automation, and remote patient health. Broadband offers high speed and volume for bundled services such as cable television, video on demand, voice, and data over a single line. Multiple transmission media can be used for broadband access. Broadband access can be provided through various transmission media such as cable modem, DSL, satellite, fiber, and wireless technologies. Cable and DSL are the most commonly used technologies, both requiring modifications to existing infrastructure. Each technology competes based on performance, price, quality of service, and user-friendliness. Cable networks, shared by users, can experience decreased access speeds. The cable industry is developing \"next generation\" technology to improve broadband access speeds. DSL technology converts telephone lines into high-speed data conduits, allowing for both voice and data transmission over the same line. Speeds can vary based on the condition of the telephone wire and the distance to the central office. Network sharing in cable networks can lead to decreased speeds during peak usage hours and security concerns about potential eavesdropping by hackers. DSL technology allows customers to use voice service while online, even if the DSL service goes down. Unlike cable broadband, DSL is unshared between the customer and the central office, maintaining data transmission speeds during peak usage. However, DSL deployment is limited to within 18,000 feet of the central office, but providers are working on extending this range with remote terminals. Mobile or fixed wireless systems transmit data over the airwaves to receivers. Wireless systems transmit data over the airwaves to receivers, allowing consumers to access broadband services through cell phones, PDAs, or wireless modem cards. The FCC has auctioned frequencies in the 700 MHZ band for wireless broadband applications, including various technologies in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as upperbands, lowerbands, PCS, and unlicensed spectrum for high-speed wireless access. The development of wireless broadband technologies like WiMax and optical fiber to the home (FTTH) is expanding access to high-speed internet in urban areas. FTTH offers high data capacity and faster transmission speeds compared to cable modem or DSL technology. Despite the high cost of installation, companies like Verizon and AT&T are rolling out fiber-based architectures to provide consumers with voice, video, and high-speed data services. Public utilities are also exploring fiber-based broadband access options. Some public utilities are exploring broadband access via fiber in existing conduits. Companies are also looking into data transmission over power lines. Satellite broadband is offered by Hughes Network Systems, Starband, and WildBlue, providing universal availability but with privacy and performance issues. Satellite Internet is a possible solution for areas without cable or DSL access. Satellite Internet access is a solution for rural or remote areas without other technologies. FCC data shows 100.9 million high-speed lines in the US, with 65.9 million serving residential users. Broadband adoption rate is 58% of households, but availability is higher. 99% of US zip codes have at least one high-speed subscriber. About 20% of consumers with access to advanced telecommunications services subscribe to them. According to FCC data, reasons for the gap in broadband subscribership include lack of computers, high prices, and availability at work. The US ranks 24th globally in broadband penetration and 15th among OECD nations. In 2001, the US ranked 4th in broadband subscribership. Some argue that the declining international rankings are concerning, while others believe that US broadband deployment is undercounted. The OECD and ITU data may underestimate U.S. broadband deployment, making cross-country comparisons problematic. Discrepancies in broadband speeds and prices between the U.S. and other countries are also a concern. Urban and high-income areas are seeing faster broadband deployment than rural and low-income areas. FCC data shows high-speed Internet subscribers are more prevalent in densely populated and high-income zip codes compared to less populated and lower-income areas. Broadband adoption disparities exist between urban, suburban, and rural areas in the U.S. Pew data shows that broadband users are more prevalent in urban and suburban areas compared to rural areas. This could lead to adverse consequences for those without access to high-speed Internet, impacting their ability to engage in e-commerce and utilize advanced Internet applications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 addressed the issue of a \"digital divide\" in broadband access, requiring the FCC to ensure broadband deployment to all Americans. The FCC's Fourth Report in 2004 reiterated the need to accelerate deployment by promoting competition and removing barriers to infrastructure investment. The FCC's Fourth Report in 2004 emphasized the importance of accelerating broadband deployment to all Americans. The FCC's recent report on Section 706 concluded that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed on a reasonable and timely basis. The FCC is considering regulatory activities related to broadband but has not deemed major regulatory intervention necessary at this time. Multiple advanced broadband networks are seen as promising for filling coverage gaps and promoting competition in price and quality. The FCC Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein dissented from the Fourth Report's conclusion on broadband deployment, citing concerns about the outdated definition of broadband, insufficient deployment, and inaccurate zip code data. The Government Accountability Office also raised issues with the FCC's zip code level data. The FCC's broadband data collection capabilities were expanded in March 2008 to improve accuracy, including reporting speed tiers, subscriber numbers by census tract, and mobile wireless deployment information. Concerns were raised about overstating broadband deployment due to reporting in zip codes with only one subscriber, especially in rural areas. The FCC is also seeking feedback on broadband service pricing and availability. The FCC is seeking feedback on broadband service pricing and availability. The Fifth Report to Congress on broadband deployment found that services are being deployed to all Americans in a timely manner. Commissioners Copps and Adelstein dissented, citing issues with data collection and U.S. broadband penetration. The NTIA at the Department of Commerce was tasked with developing the Bush Administration's broadband policy focused on removing regulatory roadblocks to investment. President Bush addressed broadband deployment in a speech at the 21st Century High Tech Forum. President Bush emphasized the importance of broadband deployment in speeches at the 21st Century High Tech Forum and an economic forum in Texas. A formal Administration broadband policy was unveiled in 2004, with goals of universal broadband access by 2007. The policy included initiatives to prohibit broadband taxes, make spectrum available for wireless broadband, and simplify rights-of-way processes for providers. The NTIA released a report in 2008 showing that Administration policies have boosted innovation and competition in the broadband market. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 reshaped regulations to accommodate increased competition. The implementation of the 1996 Act may not be sufficient to address the changing telecommunications environment, leading to calls for a revision of the laws governing the markets. Policymakers are debating issues such as applying regulations to traditional providers entering new markets, imposing regulations on new entrants competing with traditional providers, and establishing a regulatory framework for new technologies. The regulatory treatment of broadband technologies is a major focus in the policy debate, with discussions on the need for laws to ensure competition and consumer benefits. The role of regulators in maintaining an open Internet, known as \"net neutrality,\" is also contentious. Debates also continue on applying social regulations to new technologies. The debate over the role of government in municipal broadband networks and the need to revise traditional policy goals for universal service mandates, including the inclusion of new technologies like broadband, was a focus in the 109th Congress with bills like H.R. 5252 and ATOR. The Telecommunications and Opportunity Reform Act (ATOR) was addressed in the Senate through H.R. 5252, focusing on legacy regulations for traditional and new providers, treatment of new technologies, and municipal broadband networks. H.R. 5252 (COPE) passed the House and was amended in the Senate Commerce Committee but did not reach the Senate floor for consideration. House Commerce Committee Chairman Barton released a draft telecommunications reform proposal in 2006. The subcommittee passed the COPE Act in April 2006, referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce as H.R. 5252. The House passed an amended version in June 2006, including amendments on franchising provisions, fee dispute resolution, income discrimination penalties, and compliance with FCC consumer protection rules. The House passed H.R. 5252, which included provisions on FCC consumer protection rules, VOIP providers contributing to the universal service fund, and network neutrality. Two failed amendments aimed to strengthen net neutrality provisions and reduce fees paid to local franchise authorities. The House passed H.R. 5252, containing provisions for a national cable franchising process, FCC's authority on network neutrality, VoIP 911 interconnection, and prohibiting states from blocking municipalities' broadband networks. Title I establishes a national process for pay TV services, with rules against discrimination based on income. It also sets consumer protection rules and preserves local franchise fees and PEG channels. The bill aims to preserve and support PEG channels, I-Nets, and rights-of-way requirements through a one percent gross revenue fee. It also assists small and rural carriers by allowing video operators to share a headend transmission facility. Title II clarifies FCC's authority on network neutrality principles enforcement and sets fines up to $500,000 per violation. The FCC must resolve complaints within 90 days and conduct a study on broadband policy achievement within 180 days. Title III of the bill establishes 911 and E-911 requirements for VoIP services connecting to the public switched network. Title IV prohibits states from prohibiting municipalities from providing their own broadband networks, but also requires non-discrimination. The FCC must submit a report to Congress on municipal broadband services within one year. Titles V and VI contain additional provisions. Titles V and VI of the comprehensive telecommunications bill, S. 2686, address various provisions such as allowing consumers to purchase standalone broadband service, conducting an FCC study on broadband deployment over power lines, and promoting seamless mobility. The bill also covers universal service reform, streamlining video franchising, annual FCC reporting on net neutrality, public safety communications interoperability, interconnection, and municipal broadband. The bill S. 2686 addresses provisions on public safety communications, broadcast issues, child protection, and FCC rules. Senator Inouye expressed the need for amendments, particularly on video franchising, Internet access, broadband deployment, and net neutrality. The Commerce Committee focused on streamlining video franchising, universal service fund reform, and net neutrality in the hearings for S. 2686. After revisions and amendments, the Senate Commerce Committee approved the \"Advanced Telecommunications and Opportunity Reform Act,\" an amended version of H.R. 5252, with a new title and 70 amendments. S. 2686, referred to as the Senate Committee passed version of H.R. 5252, contains 11 titles. The Senate Committee passed version of H.R. 5252 covers various telecommunications issues including video franchise reform, net neutrality, universal service reform, municipal broadband, broadcast flag, digital television transition, interoperability, illegal transmission of child pornography, and FCC reform. Net neutrality was a major point of contention during the markup, with advocates pushing for a non-discrimination provision. Despite the addition of an \"Internet Consumer Bill of Rights,\" a nondiscrimination amendment was defeated by an 11-11 vote. The Senate version of H.R. 5252 addressed various telecommunications issues, including net neutrality. The House Judiciary Committee also examined competition issues related to Internet access and net neutrality. Senator Stevens expressed confidence in the Senate version of H.R. 5252, but the 109th Congress ended without full Senate consideration of the measure. In the telecommunications sector, a bipartisan bill focusing on Internet access from an antitrust perspective (H.R. 5417) passed the Judiciary Committee. Legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress to provide financial assistance for broadband deployment, including the reauthorization and reform of the Rural Utilities Service broadband loan program in the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-234). The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-234) includes provisions for a National Center for Rural Telecommunications Assessment, a rural broadband strategy by the FCC and RUS, and the Broadband Data Improvement Act (P.L. 110-385) requiring demographic data collection on unserved areas and consumer broadband use. Legislation (H.R. 2054, H.R. 6320, H.R. 6356, H.R. 7000, S. 101, S. 711, S. 3491) aims to reform universal service for increased financial assistance in rural broadband deployment. The 110th Congress introduced broadband-related legislation, including the America COMPETES Act (H.R. 2272) authorizing grants for research in advanced technologies like affordable broadband access. Another bill focused on increasing financial assistance for rural broadband deployment.
