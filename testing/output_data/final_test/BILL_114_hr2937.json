The \"Cuban Military Transparency Act\" includes findings. Congress makes findings regarding the normalization of relations with Cuba, including increasing resources to reach the Cuban people and supporting humanitarian projects, the Cuban private sector, and civil society. President Obama's statements emphasize promoting independence from Cuban authorities. Article 18 of the 1976 Constitution of Cuba states that the State controls foreign commerce. The largest company in Cuba, Grupo Gaesa, is controlled by the Cuban military and overseen by General Raul Castro's son-in-law. The United States House of Representatives voted to prohibit exports to the Cuban military and security services in 2015. The Cuban military operates resort facilities in properties confiscated from US citizens. In 2003, General Ruben Martinez Puente and two Cuban Air Force pilots were indicted for attacking US civilian planes. The 2003 US indictment against Cuban military officials is the only one against senior military officials from a state sponsor of terrorism for the murder of US nationals. In 2014, General Raul Castro admitted to giving the order to shoot down US civilian planes, resulting in the deaths of American citizens. Gerardo Hernandez, a Cuban spy exchanged by President Obama in 2014, was serving a life sentence for conspiracy in the deaths of three US citizens. The Cuban military's involvement in a 2013 trafficking incident with North Korea, violating UN sanctions and refusing to cooperate with investigators, was highlighted in a New York Times article. The incident included heavy weapons like MiG fighter jets and missiles, making it the largest intercepted weapons cache to or from North Korea. In February 2015, Colombian authorities intercepted a Chinese-flagged vessel carrying war materiel disguised as grain products destined for the Cuban military. The shipment included rockets, cannon shells, dynamite, and detonators. The Cuban military has provided military intelligence, weapons training, and security logistics to Venezuela, contributing to the subversion of democratic institutions and violent suppression of protests. The Cuba 2013 Human Rights Report highlights human rights abuses by the military during peaceful protests in Venezuela. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The United States supports the people of Cuba in establishing basic freedoms, a democratic political system, and a government that does not oppress its people or persecute dissidents. Legal travel and trade with Cuba should not enrich the military or security forces run by the Castro family. Officials who commit crimes in Cuba should be brought to justice in the United States. The United States aims to bring Cuban officials involved in the 1996 attack on US civilian aircraft to justice and counter Cuba's efforts to promote repression in the Western Hemisphere, particularly in Venezuela. The US prohibits financial transactions with the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces or the Ministry of the Interior of Cuba.

The Act prohibits US persons from engaging in financial transactions with certain Cuban entities or individuals to avoid funding them, with exceptions for the sale of specific goods to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for specific financial transactions with Cuba, including medical device sales, remittances to family members, payments for Guantanamo Bay maintenance, democracy-building support, and routine financial transactions for the US Interests Section in Havana. The President will use authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement restrictions on financial transactions with Cuba, prohibiting certain activities without issuing general licenses.
