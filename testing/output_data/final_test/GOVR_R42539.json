    "content": "The report discusses the global proliferation of precision strike capabilities, which are weapons that can adjust their trajectory to hit targets accurately. While the United States has had an advantage in this technology, other countries and non-state actors are now acquiring and developing countermeasures against them. This raises concerns about the erosion of the U.S. military's edge in projecting power. The global proliferation of precision strike capabilities poses serious considerations for Members of Congress, as it could leave U.S. forces vulnerable to enemy attacks and impact international trade and commerce. This includes scenarios such as U.S. ground forces facing enemy air forces without air superiority, U.S. naval forces being restricted by anti-access/area denial measures, and the use of Guided Rockets, Artillery, Mortars, and other Missiles against U.S. expeditionary force's Forward Operating Bases. The proliferation of precision strike capabilities poses oversight and authorization issues for Congress regarding the Department of Defense's response to adversary weapons. Congress's decisions could impact capabilities, funding, force levels, technology strategy, basing considerations, support for allies, U.S. influence, and the defense industrial base. Congress may need to legislate requirements for DOD to develop precision strike countermeasures and provide funding for research. Precision strike involves using guided munitions to strike adversaries. Long-range strike capabilities allow for rapid and persistent targeting anywhere in the world. Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) use seekers to guide weapons to their targets. Congress may need to legislate funding for DOD to develop precision strike countermeasures. Guided munitions, including smart bombs and air superiority weapons, have been crucial in U.S. combat operations. These weapons can correct errors and precisely hit targets, minimizing collateral damage. Examples include naval surface-to-air missiles, laser guided bombs, and air-intercept missiles. Air Superiority, Air Supremacy, Anti-Access, and Area Denial are key concepts in military operations. Guided weapons like the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missile were first used by Germany in World War II. Precision weapons, including precision-guided munitions (PGMs) and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), were developed by the United States after Germany's initial use in World War II. These systems date back to the 1960s and 1970s, with many being utilized in the Vietnam War. The history of precision-guided weapons has been detailed in a report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments analyst Barry Watts, covering the past six decades. The development and use of precision-guided weapons, including guided torpedoes and tank weaponry, have evolved over the past six decades since World War II. The impact of precision weapons was seen during Operation Desert Storm, with different military services adopting these weapons at varying rates and to different extents. The military community relies on high-velocity main guns for tank-on-tank engagements, while the Navy has embraced guided munitions due to facing asymmetric threats like German U-boats and Japanese kamikazes. The development of effective precision-guided weapons took time to evolve from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The development of precision-guided weapons from the 1940s to the early 1970s did not lead to a military revolution. It was not until the 1991 Gulf War that PGMs showed their unparalleled accuracy, transforming the traditional notion of running a military campaign. Precision attacks in the Gulf War opened up Iraq for subsequent conventional attackers and destroyed the Iraqi Air Force. The Gulf War demonstrated the effectiveness of precision weapons in destroying key Iraqi bridges and disrupting Iraqi forces. The combination of stealth aircraft and precision-guided munitions led to high effectiveness in military operations. During the Gulf War, F-117s demonstrated high effectiveness with precision-guided munitions, striking key strategic targets with minimal aircraft compared to non-stealth formations. In Kosovo in 1999, a new generation of GPS-guided PGMs further advanced precision strike capabilities. During the Kosovo air campaign in 1999, precision-guided munitions (PGMs) guided by GPS, such as the GBU-31 JDAM, were used to strike Serbian targets with high accuracy from B-2 bombers. Despite their precision, PGMs are reliant on accurate data input, as seen in the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy on May 7, 1999. The accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy on May 7, 1999, highlighted the use of PGMs with faulty targeting. PGMs became a new standard of warfare between 1991 and 2003, growing from a niche capability to representing a significant portion of munitions used in conflicts like Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In Afghanistan, the JDAM became the preferred weapon for U.S. forces, with a significant number being dropped between October 2001 and February 2002. Between October 2001 and February 2002, U.S. forces dropped 6,600 JDAMs, including a hundred bombs in a ten-minute period on October 18, 2001. In Iraq, over 6,500 JDAMs were used in the march on Baghdad. Modern UAVs like the Air Force RQ-1A Predator were utilized for reconnaissance and surveillance during the Kosovo war. These UAVs armed with Hellfire missiles are now extensively used in the war on terror, showcasing their precision-strike capability. An AGM-114A Hellfire missile launched by a Predator destroyed a car carrying terrorists, including Al Qaeda's chief operative in Yemen in November 2002. The use of precision strike in warfare has evolved, allowing military forces to accurately target specific individuals while limiting collateral damage. Recent examples include the successful drone strike on Anwar al-Awlaki, a top Al Qaeda operative in Yemen, and a precision air strike targeting a Taliban subcommander in Afghanistan. In 2010, a precision air strike targeted a Taliban subcommander in Afghanistan, killing 12 insurgents, possibly including Pakistani fighters. The strike was conducted after the commander met with a group of 25 armed insurgents in Deh Bala district to plan an attack. No civilians were harmed in the operation. The use of precision strike technology by major state actors like the United States has been evolving since World War II. During the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, Hezbollah utilized a variety of weapons, including guided missiles like anti-tank and anti-ship cruise missiles, acquired with the help of Tehran and Damascus. Hezbollah has restocked and expanded its arsenal with more advanced rockets and missiles, including the Chinese-designed C-802 ASCM. Analysts warn that Hezbollah's capabilities pose a threat to advanced naval forces, as seen in their successful use of hybrid tactics during the 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah's Anti-Access/Area Denial tactics were successful in the early stages of the war, demonstrating how a non-state actor can challenge a superior military force. China's A2/AD network poses similar challenges to the US military in the western Pacific. The US relies on precision strike for global responsibilities, including unfettered access to protect the global commons. The US military's success with precision strike provides air superiority, allowing ground forces to operate without enemy air attacks for nearly 70 years. This advantage was crucial in conflicts like Desert Storm, where the Iraqi Air Force was decimated by precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Without air superiority, the outcome of the war could have been different, facing a formidable Iraqi force. The US military's precision strike capability, demonstrated in conflicts like Desert Storm, was crucial in maintaining air superiority and neutralizing the Iraqi Air Force. This advantage prevented higher US casualties and prolonged the war. Additionally, freedom of movement, exemplified by strategic maneuvers on land and sea, was facilitated by the Global Positioning System (GPS), enhancing the US military's operational effectiveness. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is maintained by the U.S. government and accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver. Some civilian receivers are controlled by export controls. GPS receivers capable above certain altitudes and speeds are classified as weapons requiring export licenses. Precision strike weapons require more than just the weapon itself, including a guidance system like GPS. The United States has an advantage in precision strike due to its development and implementation of systems like GPS, sensors, command and control, doctrine, and organization. Analysts predict the spread of precision-strike capabilities, accelerated by commercial availability of key supporting capabilities. Free access to these technologies is of significant importance. The United States has an advantage in precision strike capabilities, particularly due to the universal free access to GPS data. The development of precision guidance has cost billions of dollars, but now both state and non-state actors can strike accurately with minimal investment. The U.S. dominance in precision strike capabilities may be attributed to the high cost of building and maintaining the GPS system, originally developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. The GPS satellite system, operated by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, consists of 24 satellites that became fully operational in 1993 at an annual cost of $750 million. Russia's GLONASS system, operated by the Russian Space Forces, is a global positioning system similar to GPS, using radio time signals for location tracking. GLONASS was launched in 1982 by the former USSR and continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. GLONASS, a global positioning system similar to GPS, was launched by the former USSR in 1982 and became fully operational in December 1995. Economic challenges post-Soviet Union led to only 8 satellites in operation by 2002, but by 2004, 11 satellites were operational. The system aims to have 24 satellites, with 21 in orbit and 3 as backup. GLONASS regained full operational capability on December 8, 2011, and is now being promoted for civilian use by the Russian government. GLONASS, a global positioning system, was granted unrestricted access to navigation services in 2007. China launched its regional global positioning system called Beidou in 2011, covering an area from Australia to Russia. With plans to expand to 35 satellites by 2020, Beidou aims to provide global coverage. China's Beidou global navigation system, with plans to expand to 35 satellites by 2020, will give China strategic military advantage, especially in countering foreign naval forces like the United States. This system could potentially be used to guide anti-ship missiles accurately, deterring the US and India from projecting air power in the Asia Pacific Region. China is accelerating its military space program to target U.S. aircraft carriers, catching the attention of the U.S. Secretary of Defense and affecting DOD planning. China launched 12 military satellites in 2010, doubling previous rates and setting a new record. This trend is seen as a new space race with only one participant. China's military space program is rapidly advancing, with multiple satellite systems being networked to support the DF-21D Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile program. These satellites include electro-optical digital imaging cameras, synthetic aperture radar imaging, signal intercept, electronic eavesdropping, and ocean surveillance sensors. Thirteen Yaogan satellites have been launched since 2006. China's military space program includes formation flight and ocean surveillance sensors. Thirteen Yaogan satellites launched since 2006 are engaged in military space activity. China operates many satellites for research, weather monitoring, communications, and reconnaissance purposes, with advanced capabilities in electro-optical and radar imaging. Beijing rarely acknowledges direct military applications of its space program. China's military space program includes advanced capabilities in electro-optical and radar imaging for space-based information, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Recent launches of Yaogan satellites suggest China is developing a dedicated Naval Ocean Surveillance Satellite system to support precision strike capabilities, including the Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) program. Experts believe the September 2010 launch of Yaogan-11A/B/C further enhances China's radar imagery satellite capabilities. Some experts believe the Yaogan-11A/B/C satellites launched in September 2010 have radar imagery capabilities for tracking carrier strike groups. The proliferation of precision strike weaponry is expected to accelerate as more countries develop and purchase such weapons. A chart titled \"The Growth and Spread of the Precision Strike Regime\" shows estimated worldwide precision strike capabilities between 2020 and 2040, indicating uneven growth and spread of this regime. Some countries are categorized based on their capabilities to field precision strike systems, with Category I having full capabilities and Category IV having limited access. Certain countries are developing weapons to counter U.S. precision strike dominance. China's Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) strategy, including the use of precision strike capabilities, poses challenges to U.S. power projection in the western Pacific and the defense of Taiwan. The PLA's aggressive posture in the South China Sea and investments in nuclear submarines indicate China's intent to extend its military reach. China's military modernization focuses on developing anti-access capabilities to deter or delay U.S. intervention in a conflict involving Taiwan. Key elements include Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles, attack submarines, and C4ISR systems. China's military modernization focuses on developing anti-access capabilities to deter or delay U.S. intervention in a conflict involving Taiwan. Key elements include Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles, attack submarines, and C4ISR systems. Additionally, China's new strategy heavily relies on precision guided weapons like ASBMs, ASCMs, LACMs, and torpedoes, with the Beidou satellite positioning system serving as the guidance enabler. Analysts suggest that China's emphasis on precision strike is an asymmetric response to U.S. air and naval superiority in the Western Pacific. China's A2/AD strategy aims to disrupt US freedom of movement and strategic options, focusing on cyber, anti-satellite, anti-air, and anti-ship capabilities. Former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of these threats in 2010. The Chinese DF-21D ballistic missile, part of China's A2/AD strategy, poses a threat to America's power projection capabilities. It is a variant of the CSS-N-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile with a range of 1,450 to 1,550 km, designed for use against ship targets. Some analysts consider it a game changer. The DF-21D ballistic missile is designed for use against ship targets with a range of 1,450 to 1,550 km. It has a maneuverable Re-entry Vehicle (RV) that can fly at low altitudes and has a high precision strike capability. The missile can locate targets supplied by various sensors and has a dangerous capability to attack aircraft carriers and other naval ships. The DF-21D ballistic missile poses a threat to aircraft carriers and other naval ships in the Western Pacific due to its highly accurate ballistic missiles with maneuverable re-entry vehicles. Analysts are concerned about its 1,500+ km range potentially creating a denial area beyond the first and second island chains. Some analysts worry that the DF-21D missile could pose a significant threat to surface warships, particularly aircraft carriers, due to their vulnerability to such a weapon. Skeptics argue that the missile's kill chain can be disrupted at various points, but the navy would need to consistently break this chain to counter the threat. The concept of using ballistic missiles against ships at sea has been discussed before, but the effectiveness of such systems remains uncertain. China has demonstrated precision strike capabilities and anti-satellite weapons development, including a successful satellite intercept in 2007. The People's Republic of China still faces challenges in maintaining real-time targeting data for viable implementation. China's interest in developing high-energy directed weapons, including laser technology, poses a threat to satellites. The U.S. military's space capabilities are crucial for precision strike weapons, but access to space is no longer guaranteed, leading to uncertainty in military dominance. Intelligence satellites are at risk due to potential Chinese development of anti-satellite weapons. China's space program, including civil projects, supports China's ability to deny or degrade potential adversaries' space assets. China operates satellites for various purposes and has tested anti-satellite systems, including jammers and kinetic weapons. Their manned and lunar space programs enhance their ability to track and identify satellites for potential attacks. China's space program in China enhances its ability to track and identify satellites for potential ASAT attacks. Beijing is improving its satellite constellations for space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as navigation and communication services. Some Chinese military commentary emphasizes the importance of controlling space for long-distance targeting. ASAT weapons pose a significant risk to both civilian and military systems, with little protection against ground-based lasers or kinetic-kill vehicles. ASAT weapons pose a significant risk to both civilian and military systems, with little protection against ground-based lasers or kinetic-kill vehicles. China's space program enhances its ability to track and identify satellites for potential ASAT attacks. Beijing is improving its satellite constellations for space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as navigation and communication services. The Internet was constructed with a benign environment in mind, but the progression towards potential sources of system failure, like common software and data repositories, cannot be discounted. ASAT weapons act as counter precision strike tools by taking down satellites through kinetic action or jamming guidance networks. China's ability to deliver precision strike weapons relies on developing an effective stealth fighter aircraft, such as the Chengdu J-20. China conducted its first flight test of the Chengdu J-20 Black Eagle Stealth Fighter in January 2011, surprising experts with its faster-than-expected progress in developing advanced fighter jet technology. The J-20, China's first stealth fighter jet, could enhance its anti-access/area denial strategy, allowing precision strike weapons close to U.S. targets. The aircraft may share Russian technology, potentially originating from the Mikoyan 1.44 stealth jet. The Chinese J-20 fighter jet, believed to have origins in the Russian Mikoyan 1.44 stealth jet, is seen as a significant investment in stealth technology. It is expected to be operational by 2018, showcasing China's advancements in precision strike weapons. Russia aims to start serial production of its prototype craft in the next five to six years, while the United States remains the only country with an operational fifth-generation fighter. The DOD's latest threat assessment of China's military highlights the Chengdu J-20 fighter's focus on air-to-ground missions, enhancing the PLA's precision-strike capabilities to target regional air bases and infrastructure. The J-20 is expected to provide long-range penetrating strikes in complex air defense environments, adding to China's anti-access capabilities. This includes the use of modern precision ordnance like anti-radiation missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles. China's military is modernizing and building defensive arsenals, including advanced ordnance like anti-radiation missiles and bunker buster munitions. These weapons could be used in long-range attacks on regional bases like Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and Guam Air Base, potentially complicating staging and logistical supply. There is concern that China could provide these modern weapons to smaller, non-state actors. Chinese arms brokers held negotiations with the Libyan government for sales of precision strike weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, worth $200 million. Libyan officials expressed outrage over the documents found in Tripoli, confirming the meeting in Beijing in mid-July. Chinese arms brokers attempted to sell precision strike weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, to Libya. The sale raised concerns due to UN sanctions banning military assistance to the Gadhafi government. Reports of missing surface-to-air missiles in Libya added to the uncertainty. Thousands of shoulder-held surface-to-air missiles, including 482 Russian SA-24 missiles, are missing in Libya. Concerns arise over the spread of high-tech weaponry to black markets and terrorist groups. Iran's pursuit of precision strike capabilities is also a worry for the United States. Iran is investing in precision-guided weapons, including long-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, to dominate the Persian Gulf and potentially acquire a nuclear capability. They are also developing ballistic missiles that can target regional adversaries and central Europe, while enhancing their existing missile systems with improved accuracy and new munitions. Iran is advancing its defense industry by developing precision-guided weapons, including anti-tank rockets with a strong warhead capable of destroying targets at a distance of 1,300 meters. This new weapon has high precision for close combat and distant strikes, setting it apart from Iran's other anti-tank rockets. Iran has a history of proliferating weapons to various actors and claims to have developed a precision strike capability. Iran showcased a new cruise missile named \"Ghader\" with a range of 124 miles, capable of targeting warships. The missile, designed for sea-based targets, was displayed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It can travel at low altitudes and has a lighter weight compared to previous Iranian-made cruise missiles. Iran also has short and medium-range ballistic missiles that can reach targets in the region, including Israel and U.S. military bases in the Gulf. In 2012, Iran successfully test-fired the new missile during a naval exercise. Iran successfully test-fired a new missile during a naval exercise in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil transit chokepoint connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman. The UAE forms the southern shoreline of the strait, which plays a crucial role in global oil transportation. Iran successfully test-fired a new missile in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil transit chokepoint where roughly 40% of the world's oil passes daily. The missile, announced during Iran's Islamic revolution anniversary, has a range of 186 miles and high precision targeting capabilities. Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned of closing the strait if threatened. Iran successfully test-fired a new missile with high precision targeting capabilities in the strategic Strait of Hormuz. U.S. defense analysts noted Iran's Navy's mine-laying and missile capabilities to temporarily close the strait. The U.S. Fifth Fleet in Bahrain is monitoring Iranian activity closely and stated any disruption will not be tolerated. Iran's development of precision strike guided missiles could make keeping the strait open more challenging. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has shown battlefield advantages, with Russia joining armed UAV capable nations in 2011. Russia entered the armed UAV arena in 2011 with its first drone, \"Lutch,\" capable of carrying guided weapons for various reconnaissance missions. The drone has a surveillance range of 250-350 kms, extendable to 500 kms, and can stay airborne for up to 18 hours. It is being marketed for potential export to unfriendly actors, but would require integration into a larger battle space for full effectiveness. Additionally, a new cruise missile system is being promoted by a Russian defense company. A Russian defense company is marketing a new cruise missile system that can be concealed in a standard shipping container, blending in with the thousands of containers used daily. Experts fear this system could be used by any merchant vessel to attack an aircraft carrier. Potential customers include Iran and Venezuela, who could pass on the hard-to-detect missiles to terrorist groups. The Club-K system is still primarily a marketing concept, with individual components existing and a mock-up displayed at an air show in Moscow. The Club-K system, showcased at the MAKS 2011 air show in Moscow, incorporates four missile tubes that launch vertically from a transport container. The system requires a combat-management module and energy-supply module, all housed in standardized container modules. The manufacturer is seeking a serious paying customer at the state level due to the estimated cost of $10-20 million. The Club-K ULM can be carried and launched from commercial ships. The Club-K ULM can be carried and launched from various vehicles, giving long-range precision strike capability. However, it requires sophisticated targeting data for effective use, especially against moving sea targets. The seeker can assess target size and type during the terminal phase. The potential sale of up to 2,400 Russian SA-24 \"Igla-S\" or \"Grinch\" missiles to Venezuela has raised concerns due to the missile's improved precision strike capability. The Igla-S system is designed to engage various targets under different conditions and is claimed to outperform its predecessors in effectiveness and reliability. The SA-24 MANPADs purchased by Venezuela are highly sophisticated systems with the capability to down aircraft up to 19,000 feet. Concerns were raised about the large quantity of missiles purchased and the potential leakage to Colombian guerrillas. The Chavez regime in Venezuela has close ties with Hezbollah and Iran, with concerns about Venezuelan arms reaching Colombian guerrillas. Pentagon planners are considering the impact of potential loss of U.S. precision strike dominance on future military operations. The observation that U.S. opponents will use asymmetric capabilities to counter American military superiority has been noted over the past decade. This challenge is not new and has historical parallels in rival nations seeking to compete with British naval power. Many nations, including China and Iran, are developing asymmetric capabilities and advanced conventional missiles to counter U.S. dominance. These new anti-access networks pose a threat to U.S. Navy and joint-force assets from greater ranges than before. The development of advanced conventional missiles by nations like China and Iran poses a threat to U.S. Navy and joint-force assets from greater ranges. This could potentially eliminate the operational sanctuaries enjoyed by the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps and joint team since World War II. As precision strike capabilities grow, forward-deployed troops may become more vulnerable to enemy munitions like rockets and mortars. In response, the Naval Research Advisory Committee was tasked with studying ways to counter precision threats. The Naval Research Advisory Committee is conducting a study on Marine Corps capabilities to counter precision weapon threats. The study aims to identify challenges and recommend solutions to address the potential threat posed by adversaries using precision weapons. The emergence of Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in Afghanistan has increased the risk of precision enemy fire, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures. The Intel community is observing a rise in the proliferation of inexpensive Guided Rockets, Artillery, Mortars, and Missiles (G-RAMM), posing a significant threat to future Marine operations. This threat, similar to improvised explosive devices in recent missions, was exemplified during Hezbollah's 2006 war with Israel when over 4,000 relatively inaccurate RAMM projectiles caused mass evacuations and economic disruption. As guided munitions continue to spread, irregular warfare will undergo a transformation. The proliferation of guided munitions, known as G-RAMM weapons, poses a significant threat to future Marine operations. The use of these weapons could result in higher levels of damage and casualties, especially if targeted at U.S. forward deployed troops and aircraft facilities in Afghanistan. This threat has the potential to transform irregular warfare and surpass the impact of roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The growing threat to carrier operations poses a potential risk to U.S. Navy operations, with experts emphasizing the importance of addressing this issue. Carrier operations play a crucial role in the U.S.'s ability to project power globally, deter aggression, assure allies, and gain operational access into theaters at strategic times and locations. The super carrier era is coming to an end due to technology trends towards precision long-range strike capabilities and sophisticated anti-access and area-denial capabilities. Competitors are focusing on the U.S.'s ability to strike targets with accuracy, hastening the carrier's decline. The development of sensors and weapons aims to deny carrier strike groups access to launch aircraft against shore installations. Future challenges may require U.S. forces to be positioned farther away from shore, necessitating new systems to fight through precision strike networks. The U.S. Marine Corps' amphibious assault capability remains crucial in this evolving landscape. The amphibious assault capability of the U.S. Marine Corps is facing challenges due to the threat of land-based anti-ship cruise missiles, including advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles like the Russian-designed Sizzler. This poses a danger to amphibious ships operating close to shore, making them vulnerable to precision weapons such as Anti-Tank Guided Missiles. The threat to amphibious ships from land-based anti-ship cruise missiles, including advanced ones like the Russian-designed Sizzler, poses a major challenge to the U.S. Marine Corps. Adversaries equipped with various missile systems could target rotary-wing platforms and fixed-wing aircraft, utilizing swarming tactics and urban cover to pose a significant threat. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment analysis highlights the challenges posed by adversary precision strike capabilities against amphibious assaults. Land-based anti-ship cruise missiles could target high signature amphibious assault ships, making it difficult for them to establish a secure beachhead. This poses a significant threat to current U.S. Navy and Marine Corps operational concepts. Some analysts criticize the Navy's amphibious assault requirements against new precision strike challenges. However, others argue that a forcible entry capability is increasingly valuable as precision-guided weapons become more widespread. Deploying forces over an extended period and massing them at a few locations close to a theater of operations may no longer be feasible due to vulnerability to guided munitions. Troops could be dispersed to mitigate risks. In contrast to critics of the Navy's amphibious assault requirements, some argue that an amphibious assault force could quickly assemble and not rely on allies' consent. This force could force an opponent with limited guided weapons to expand their target set, reducing the impact of their weapons. Lieutenant General Richard Mills highlighted these points in a 2011 House Armed Services Committee hearing on Seapower and Projection Forces Outlook. Richard Mills, Deputy Commander for Combat Development and Integration at the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, reaffirmed the importance of USMC amphibious assault capabilities. He discussed the historical feasibility of amphibious warfare, citing its success in World War II despite initial doubts. The viability of amphibious operations has been questioned over the years, but its effectiveness has been proven time and time again. The viability of amphibious operations has been questioned over the years, but the Navy and Marine Corps team has consistently proven its value in a variety of military operations. Those who doubt the ability of amphibious forces today fail to understand the constant study, adaptation, and evolution of these forces to meet current threats. The report highlights the increasing threat of precision strike weapons to U.S. national security. Congress needs to ensure the Department of Defense is prepared to counter these challenges and develop effective doctrine. Potential U.S. military technologies could be used to combat this growing threat. The United States possesses the F-22 Raptor, a stealthy fifth-generation fighter with precision strike capabilities. Originally planned to replace the F-15A-D fleet with 750 aircraft, budget constraints led to a final production target of 187. China and Russia are also developing their own fifth-generation fighters with precision strike capabilities. Some analysts argue for the development of a sixth generation fighter to challenge the F-22 and ensure air superiority. Congress may consider restarting production lines for new threats. This would be costly, as shown by a 2009 study on the F-22 production costs. The Aegis combat system, while effective, may need upgrades for future challenges. The Aegis combat system, designed as a complete system integrating radar and missile systems, may not adequately protect against anti-ship missiles like China's DF-21D. It is vulnerable to this type of threat due to its design limitations. The system is highly integrated and capable of warfare on multiple fronts, including air, surface, subsurface, and strike. Anti-Air Warfare elements of the Aegis Weapon System MK-7 include the Radar System AN/SPY-1B/D, Command and Decision System, and Weapons Control System. The Aegis Combat System is the first fully integrated combat system designed to defend against advanced air, surface, and subsurface threats. It relies on a separate sonar system to track undersea threats like mines, torpedoes, and submarines. The system can simultaneously track land, air, and undersea threats and attacks. The SPY-1 radar classes are designed for cruisers and destroyers, with the letter \"V\" in SPY-1D(V) indicating a variant. The integration of these systems enhances a ship's capability to engage and defeat multiple threats simultaneously. The computer-based command-and-decision element is the core of the Aegis combat system, enabling it to operate against various threats. The Aegis Combat System is being enhanced for Theater Missile Defense against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Congress needs to verify its capabilities, including protection against missiles like the DF-21D and barrage attacks. Experts suggest logistical support may be needed for kinetic action. The Naval Research Advisory Committee is studying Marine Corps capabilities against precision weapons. The panel will review Marine Corps policies, strategies, and capabilities for responding to potential precision weapons. They will identify science and technology areas to detect, track, and engage precision weapons while countering damage. The study will recommend steps for the Marine Corps to address the threat posed by precision weapons, with the Army and Marine Corps being most impacted. Congress is concerned about the proliferation of G-RAMM technology. The issue for Congress is whether the DOD is considering G-RAMM technology in future weapon systems. Congress could request briefings on countering precision G-RAMM weapons. The Secretary of Defense directed the development of an AirSea Battle concept to address the challenge posed by China's anti-access/area denial efforts. The AirSea Battle Concept, developed in response to China's anti-access/area denial efforts, focuses on neutralizing A2/AD threats through networked, integrated attacks across multiple domains. Offensive and defensive tasks are coordinated in real-time to disrupt, destroy, and defeat adversaries' advanced intelligence and weapons systems. The AirSea Battle Concept focuses on coordinating air and naval forces in real-time to disrupt, destroy, and defeat adversary's intelligence and weapons systems. The concept organizes tasks into three lines of effort to achieve integrated effects across multiple domains. The establishment of a new AirSea Battle office was announced by the DOD in November 2011. The AirSea Battle concept, established in November 2011, aims to coordinate military efforts for interoperability and effectiveness in countering A2/AD situations. It emphasizes integrating new weapon systems into the acquisition cycle to improve tactical results and cost-effectiveness. The concept, combined with high-tech weaponry, is designed to disrupt enemy precision strikes and preserve U.S. power projection. The AirSea Battle concept aims to disrupt enemy precision strikes and preserve U.S. power projection. Critics raise concerns about escalation dynamics and the potential reaction of nuclear powers like China to strikes on their mainland. The concept seeks to deter aggression and prevent conflict, but escalation control is also crucial in case deterrence fails. The AirSea Battle concept raises concerns about escalation dynamics and the potential risks associated with it. Congress may need to consider the broad strategic context of the concept and how it accounts for geostrategic factors, including U.S. treaty obligations and the involvement of allies like Japan and Australia. Japan, Australia, and other countries are crucial in maintaining a stable military balance. The AirSea Battle concept faces challenges in countering evolving military threats, particularly from China's A2/AD capabilities. Future U.S. weapon systems may need to adapt to fight through precision strike networks instead of relying on traditional sanctuaries. Advanced, stealthy, long-range precision strike systems may be necessary to counter adversary precision strike weapons like ASBMs and ASCMs. The Pentagon is preparing for a future where airspace access is no longer guaranteed. The Pentagon is developing new precision weapons to penetrate modern air defenses and strike targets from long distances. This includes the next-generation bomber for long-range strikes to counter growing threats and ensure power projection capabilities. The Department of Defense is conducting a study to determine the best combination of surveillance, electronic warfare, and precision-attack capabilities for U.S. power projection until 2040. Long-range strike systems, including the next-generation bomber, are crucial for the AirSea Battle concept to overcome enemy defenses and penetrate contested airspace. The next-generation bomber is seen as a crucial element in the nation's power projection capability, especially in the face of emerging anti-access/area denial threats. The new bomber would have stealth capabilities to penetrate congested airspace and destroy adversary weapons, allowing for quick deployment of U.S. conventional forces. The U.S. must develop a long-range strike bomber to ensure escalation control in conflicts with China. Stealthy manned bombers with recall capability are favored for holding major targets at risk. Critics question the need for manned bombers over unmanned ones. The next-generation bomber program faces criticism for its complexity and configuration choices. The next-generation bomber program is under scrutiny for its cost and configuration choices. Congress must decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the proposed long-range strike system. The focus is on precision strike weapons systems, with questions raised about combating their proliferation and the risks and benefits of targeted technology sharing. The text discusses the benefits and risks of targeted technology proliferation to U.S. allies, the need to increase allied defense capabilities near aggressor states, and the adequacy of U.S. naval assets for economic blockade. It also raises questions about the impact of precision strike capabilities on DOD overseas basing considerations. The text raises questions about the impact of precision strike weapons possessed by China on U.S. ability to support democratic Taiwan and the region's stability. It also questions the implications of a bold U.S. posture towards China and the need to maintain freedom of movement, trade routes, and global commerce for U.S. national security."
