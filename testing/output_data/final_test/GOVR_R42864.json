    "content": "Developing countries were once minor players in the world economy, but their prospects changed in the 1980s with the success of Asian tigers like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. These countries adopted export-led growth strategies, boosting annual per capita incomes by 5-6% over the decade. The success of Asian tigers in the 1980s led to a shift in focus for developing countries towards production for world markets. This shift accelerated in the early 1990s with globalization, economic reforms, and technological advancements. China's rapid economic growth, with average annual GDP growth of nearly 10% from 1979 to 2011, played a significant role in this global economic transformation. The global economy saw significant growth from 1990 to 2010, with developing countries increasing their share of global GDP to 22%. This growth was driven by countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Mexico. By 2030, developing countries are projected to contribute 50% of global output, with China alone contributing 20%. By 2030, developing countries are projected to contribute 50% of global output, with China alone contributing 20%. Long-term projections may be inaccurate due to various factors such as aging populations, rising labor costs, corruption, and infrastructure deficiencies. Despite this, many populous developing countries are expected to continue experiencing faster economic growth than advanced economies, leading to a shift of relative economic wealth. Developing countries are projected to contribute 50% of global output by 2030, with China alone contributing 20%. Despite the potential for catch-up gains in output and productivity, the living standards of rising powers are expected to remain below those of advanced countries due to their large populations and high poverty rates. Rising countries are becoming significant forces in the world economy, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the United States. The rising powers in developing countries are expected to contribute significantly to global output by 2030, with China alone accounting for 20%. This growth offers opportunities for U.S. consumers to access a wider range of products at lower prices, boosting real incomes and living standards. Additionally, the expanding economies of these countries create new markets for U.S. exporters and investors, but also introduce competition from lower-wage labor that may prompt U.S. firms to adopt cost-saving measures or move production overseas. U.S. relations with rising economic powers (REPs) are impacting the country's economic welfare. Efforts to reduce trade barriers and negotiate new trade rules are crucial, but differing views on the role of the state in economic activity make this challenging. The REPs also criticize U.S. policies on trade remedies, high tariffs, and pricing of medicines. The REPs are impacting the world trading system by voicing concerns on trade remedies, tariffs, pricing of medicines, agricultural subsidies, foreign worker entry, and monetary expansion. U.S. trade officials hope REPs will become responsible stakeholders in free and fair trade, but uncertainty remains as China and other developing economies may not fully embrace the liberal economic order. The rise of China and other developing countries has led to a weakening of the WTO-centered multilateral trade order. Bilateral and regional trade agreements have increased, while WTO negotiations have stalled. The 113th Congress should consider how to open up markets in a balanced way and influence REPs to adopt more market-oriented trade policies. The report discusses how the United States can influence the REPs to adopt market-oriented trade policies and become responsible stakeholders in the world trading system. It is organized into four parts, summarizing key observations, discussing characteristics and reform challenges of the REPs, analyzing the relationship between U.S. trade interests and the REPs, and considering U.S. trade policy responses. The REPs are increasingly important trading partners for the U.S., accounting for 47% of exports in 2011. The REPs are significant trading partners for the U.S., representing 47% of exports in 2011 and 36% of imports. To maximize export potential and improve living standards, the U.S. needs better access to REP markets, as trade barriers in these countries are higher than in the U.S. and other advanced nations. These barriers hinder U.S. producers and workers from fully utilizing their comparative advantage in services, foreign investment, intellectual property, and government procurement. The United States faces barriers in accessing REP markets, both in REP markets and third country markets. These barriers are inadequately covered or difficult to enforce under current WTO rules. The ability of the U.S. to persuade REPs to embrace free and fair trade is constrained by differences over the role of the state in economic activity. The 2008 global financial crisis may have weakened the case for free market approaches, leading some countries to entertain market-distorting practices. The United States faces barriers in accessing markets of rapidly emerging economies (REPs) like Brazil, China, and India due to their reluctance to make concessions in multilateral trade negotiations. Persuading these countries to prioritize a strengthened multilateral trading system for their national economic interests remains a challenge. China is seen as a key player in global trade leadership, with India and Brazil also significant players. U.S. trade policymakers must adapt to the changing landscape of global trade dominated by these REPs. In the current global trade landscape, U.S. trade policymakers are facing new challenges as multilateralism weakens and bilateral agreements increase. The focus is on trade expansion to boost U.S. living standards, but concerns arise over job insecurity and income inequality. The rise of rapidly emerging economies (REPs) like China, India, and Brazil presents obstacles in accessing their markets, requiring the U.S. to adapt to this changing trade environment. The current economic concerns include job insecurity and income stagnation, leading to public pressure for reciprocity in U.S. trade relations with rapidly emerging economies (REPs). Trade negotiations and export promotion play a crucial role in achieving U.S. trade policy goals. U.S. trade policymakers may need to consider putting trade barriers on the table when negotiating with the REPs. To ensure the success of the Doha Round, trade liberalization within the WTO may require new approaches. Principles like most-favored-nation and special and differential treatment may need reevaluation. Advanced countries are exploring plurilateral agreements on services, foreign investment, and state-owned enterprises under the WTO umbrella. These agreements could help bridge the gap between developed and developing countries. Strengthening the WTO's dispute settlement understanding is crucial in a time of shifting global economic power and trade leadership. The WTO's dispute settlement understanding (DSU) is crucial for maintaining global economic order, allowing advanced countries to engage developing countries on trade responsibilities. However, the DSU has weaknesses, such as lengthy cases and non-retrospective remedies. U.S. trade policy is increasingly focused on bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs) to address market access barriers and protectionist measures. The United States has focused on bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs) to address trade barriers. While FTAs with smaller partners have been comprehensive, agreements with larger partners like China, India, and Brazil have not been pursued. To move in this direction, deviations from the standard FTA template may be necessary. The ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations and a potential comprehensive FTA with the European Union could encourage higher standard multilateral or bilateral negotiations. Possible unilateral initiatives to encourage REP reforms include using incentives rather than threats, such as strengthening the U.S. economy as an example for the world and proposing measures that align with the REPs' economic self-interest. Congressional actions may also play a role in promoting these initiatives. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. trade policy, especially regarding trade relations with the REPs. The President may seek Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal in 2013, which could enhance U.S. trade leadership. Negotiating with the REPs, who have different economic models, will require resources, flexibility, and leverage. Predictions suggest that certain developing countries will drive global economic growth. The report focuses on identifying up-and-coming countries that are increasingly influential in the global trading system, apart from major developing nations like China, India, and Brazil. Various terms have been used in the past to describe these rising economic powers, driven by different objectives. Most predictions use a simple methodology to map out the growth of specific developing countries. Most predictions on the rise of developing countries use a methodology combining data on labor force and capital stock growth with subjective evaluations of government responses to challenges. Projections are less certain when political and institutional factors are considered, but a small group of developing countries show the greatest potential for economic growth. The uneven rise of developing countries is important for prioritizing U.S. trade interests. The report focuses on large rising economic powers like China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. Other developing countries like Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, and Vietnam could become global economic forces if their challenges are addressed. Additionally, fast-growing countries like Colombia, Poland, and Malaysia offer commercial opportunities for U.S. traders and investors. The report discusses rising economic powers such as China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. These countries have significant differences in political systems, income levels, and trade patterns. While China and Russia are authoritarian, the others are committed to democratic institutions. Mexico stands out due to its economic ties with the United States. All seven countries have large economies and rank among the top 21 in the world based on GDP calculations in 2010. In 2010, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and Indonesia were among the top 21 largest economies based on GDP calculations. A study predicts that by 2050, China will surpass the United States as the largest economy. Turkey is projected to gain the most in rankings, followed by India, Mexico, and Indonesia. Comparisons of national wealth are also made based on purchasing power parity, with China, India, Russia, and Brazil among the top 10 largest economies in 2011. China, India, Russia, and Brazil were among the top 10 largest economies in 2011. By 2020, China is projected to have the largest economy, followed by India. The size of a country's economy, measured by GDP, reflects its impact on the international trading system. The seven primary focus countries have seen a significant increase in world exports, rising from 7% in 1990 to 20.6% in 2011, with a projection to reach nearly 25% by 2016. The REPs, including China, India, Russia, and Brazil, have seen a significant increase in global exports from 7% in 1990 to 20.6% in 2011, projected to reach nearly 25% by 2016. These countries have greater involvement in WTO negotiations, dispute settlement processes, and autonomy in applying WTO rules domestically. They have protested U.S. policies and practices, criticized economic policies post-2008 crisis, and have become more able to deflect U.S. trade demands. Their large populations and growing economies drive their position in global GDP rankings. The REPs, including China, India, Russia, and Brazil, have significantly increased their global exports from 7% in 1990 to 20.6% in 2011, projected to reach nearly 25% by 2016. These countries have a greater involvement in WTO negotiations and dispute settlement processes. In 2011, the seven REPs accounted for 48% of the world's population and 23% of the world's GDP. China, India, and Brazil have the second, third, and eighth-largest economies in the world, respectively. Per capita incomes in the REPs were one-fifth of those in high-income OECD countries, indicating challenges in reaching higher living standards. The REPs, excluding Mexico from 2003 to 2008 and Russia from 2008 to 2011, have shown faster growth compared to advanced high income OECD countries. They grew three times faster than high income OECD countries from 2003 to 2008 and 23 times faster from 2009 to 2011. Robust capital inflows and exports to the United States boosted their growth rates. Some analysts believe that the rapid growth rates of countries like China, India, and Brazil may continue, while others are more cautious. The case for slower growth in advanced countries is based on high consumer and government debt, leading to lower growth rates. The IMF projects that advanced countries will grow at one-third the rate of emerging markets in 2013. As countries become richer, it becomes harder to grow rapidly, with only a small percentage of middle-income countries transitioning to high income over time. Governments must foster private sector development and innovation to transition to high income. Economic history shows that continued high growth for developing countries is not guaranteed. Ongoing efforts and reforms are needed to address economic challenges as countries reach different income levels. The reform challenges for developing countries are highlighted by low rates of openness to business operations. The business climates of Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and India are comparable to countries like Bangladesh, Uganda, and Swaziland. The United States has the fourth-best business environment in the world. To improve their economies, the REPs could undertake trade, regulatory, and structural reforms such as reducing tariffs, quotas, and foreign investment restrictions, and addressing corruption and regulatory barriers. Intensified competition could result from these reforms. The intensified competition resulting from trade, regulatory, and structural reforms in REPs could improve worker productivity, economic growth, and living standards. These reforms are politically sensitive due to their impact on government-business relations and vested interests. Political determination to overcome special interests is crucial for successful implementation. A country's economic future is closely tied to its politics, and growing political will for domestic reforms may lead to increased international negotiations. Unilateral actions in one country can influence others to emulate reforms to stay competitive. China, with a 9% growth rate over the past three decades, faces challenges in transitioning to a more consumption-driven economy. Reforms needed include enhancing competition through public and financial sector reforms, securing private property rights, deregulation, market pricing, and improving social services. Embracing measures to strengthen the private sector over state-owned companies is also crucial. Rebalancing China's economy involves limits on industrial policy activism, enforcing intellectual property rights, and accelerating services liberalization. Resistance from powerful vested interests, including party members, state-owned companies, military, banks, and family clans, is expected. Other risks to stable economic growth include corruption, environmental degradation, and an aging population. Economists project India to rival China's growth rates and become the third-largest economy, but obstacles like bloated government could hinder this growth. India's economic projections face obstacles like corruption, overregulation, poverty, and poor infrastructure. The country ranks poorly in economic freedom due to restrictive trade policies and high levels of corruption. A massive blackout in 2012 highlighted the inefficiencies in India's power sector. Concerns are rising as the economy slows down, with heavy government regulation being blamed for the decline in growth rates. Concerns are rising in India over heavy government regulation impacting economic growth, reminiscent of the \"license Raj\" era. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh faces opposition within his party and coalition partners to push for strong reform. Brazil, once a strong performer, saw a decline in economic growth to 2.7% in 2011, with projections for 1.5%-2% in 2012. To maintain its global influence, Brazil may need to focus on reforms in infrastructure and taxes. Major investments are needed in housing, transportation, telecommunications, and power grids for Brazil to become a world economic power. Brazil's infrastructure ranks 104th globally, with high tax burden affecting business costs. President Dilma Rouseff has taken steps to reduce taxes and involve private firms in infrastructure upgrades. Mexico has the third-highest per capita income among the REPs but faces slow economic growth. Major investments are needed in various sectors for Brazil to regain economic strength. Mexico, with the third-highest per capita income among the REPs, has faced slow economic growth, lagging behind regional rivals Brazil and Chile. Recent growth rates have sparked foreign investor interest, but challenges such as state presence in sectors, education system inadequacies, and high income inequality could hinder future growth. Weak competition in many sectors also impacts efficiency and consumer well-being, with the top 10 business families controlling concentrated sectors. Mexico's top 10 business families control concentrated sectors, hindering growth. President Enrique Pena Nieto could implement structural reforms to boost the economy, such as investing in infrastructure, breaking up monopolies, and opening sectors to foreign investment. Meanwhile, Turkey experienced high growth rates from 2003 to 2011, with a projected GDP growth of 2.9% in 2012. Turkey's steady economic growth requires financing a large current account deficit, with a shift towards more short-term inflows since 2010. To attract more investment, Turkey may need to consider liberalizing its foreign investment regime and address concerns such as labor regulations and intellectual property violations. The World Bank has urged sweeping reforms to address these issues. Bank has urged sweeping reforms to address high severance packages, limitations of temporary work, and high social security costs. Russia's economy experienced significant growth fueled by demand for oil, gas, and commodities before the 2009 financial crisis. Despite a projected growth rate of 3.5% to 4%, Russia's economy is unlikely to reach its potential annual growth rate of 5.5%-6% due to persistent flaws and dependence on natural resources. Russia's economy faces challenges such as a declining population, lack of competitive companies, limited economic diversification, difficult business environment, and increasing public welfare burden. President Putin's reform efforts have been limited, and the economy relies heavily on oil trade surpluses. Indonesia's economy has been growing steadily since its transformation into a democracy in the late 1990s. Projections suggest that its oil-fueled trade surpluses may disappear, prompting the need for reforms to attract foreign investment. With a current GDP of $900 billion, Indonesia is expected to surpass $1 billion by 2013. However, the country faces challenges such as poor infrastructure, with ports, electrical grid, and road networks in need of improvement. Meeting the target of 7%-8% GDP growth by 2014 will require addressing these reform challenges. Indonesia's economy has been growing steadily since its transformation into a democracy in the late 1990s. The country faces challenges such as poor infrastructure, endemic corruption, and lack of high-quality education for its young labor force. Legislation has been introduced to address these issues, but faces uncertainty due to conflicting views on reform within the governing coalition. These challenges impact U.S. exports, jobs, and economic growth. To maximize export potential and boost living standards, exporters and investors need fair access to REP markets. However, trade barriers in these countries are extensive, hindering market access. The United States faces challenges in persuading these countries to reduce barriers due to differences in economic ideologies. With the need to export more, it is crucial to encourage these countries to align with free market norms and WTO obligations. The United States urges rising countries to align with free market norms and WTO obligations to address barriers not covered by current disciplines. Concerns arise that without prompt action, these countries may exploit their economic power for one-sided advantages. Robust agreements between different power centers with varying values pose a significant challenge. The U.S. heavily relies on the global economy for growth and job creation, with trade accounting for a growing share of GDP over the past four decades. Exports have been growing more rapidly than the U.S. economy, contributing significantly to real GDP growth. Economists predict that exports will play a crucial role in future U.S. economic growth due to the high levels of public and private debt limiting government and consumer spending. This shift towards exports could become a key source of economic growth for the U.S. economy. Recent research suggests that there is untapped potential in exporting business services for the U.S. economy. Job growth in non-tradable sectors like healthcare and public sector employment highlights the need for stronger performance in tradable sectors, especially services. U.S. trade ties have shifted towards developing countries in the past decade, growing faster than with advanced countries. Goods exports to developing countries have tripled since 2000. Since 2000, U.S. goods exports to developing countries have grown significantly, outpacing exports to industrial countries. The share of U.S. goods exports to developing countries increased from 45% in 2000 to 55% in 2011, with the seven REPs accounting for 47% of U.S. exports in 2011. Additionally, U.S. imports from developing countries have also increased substantially, with the share of imports from developing countries rising from 49% in 2000 to 61% in 2011. The REPs accounted for 36% of U.S. imports in 2011. U.S. multinationals like Apple and Dell design products in the U.S. and assemble them abroad. U.S. foreign direct investments in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey have decreased from 8% in 1995 to less than 6% in 2010. Europe's share of U.S. direct investment stocks abroad has increased to 55% in 2010. Further liberalization of FDI restrictions in the REPs could reverse this trend. The share of U.S. trade with the REPs is expected to grow if their economies continue to grow. The Obama Administration's National Export Initiative (NEI) aims to double U.S. exports by 2014 and create 2 million jobs by providing greater market access to developing countries like China, India, and Brazil, which have reduced trade barriers. This growth is expected to create new middle-class consumers and increase infrastructure spending, attracting exporters and investors worldwide. The reforms in the 1980s and 1990s reduced trade barriers and non-tariff barriers, leading to increased global trade and investment. Despite these reforms, levels of protection in the REPs remain higher than in other regions. The economic impact of barriers in the REPs on the U.S. economy is significant, limiting opportunities for U.S. companies and workers in various markets. Barriers include tariffs, services, government procurement, foreign investment, and intellectual property rights, among others, hindering market access and the extension of comparative advantage. The REPs impose high tariffs on goods entering their countries, with rates ranging from two to four times higher than the U.S. average tariff of 3.5%. Indonesia has the lowest average applied tariff (6.8%), while Brazil has the highest (13.7%). Bound tariffs in the REPs are even higher, ranging from three times higher (China at 10%) to 14 times higher (India at 48.7%). These barriers create formidable shields in home markets and support national companies. The REPs have high tariffs on goods entering their countries, with rates ranging from two to four times higher than the U.S. average tariff of 3.5%. Brazil recently increased import duties to 25% on some products. Economists believe reducing barriers to U.S. exports of services is crucial for the economy. The U.S. has a comparative advantage in exporting business services, but faces barriers in REP markets. Barriers to services trade in REP markets are high, including market-entry barriers, national treatment barriers, and regulatory barriers. These barriers are estimated to be 7 to 11 times more onerous than U.S. service barriers. The REPs also have larger services tariff equivalents compared to agricultural and non-agricultural tariffs. The U.S. has attempted to expand market access commitments through FTAs. The United States is aiming to expand market access in REP markets through FTAs and the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. Increased spending on infrastructure projects in the next two decades could create demand for U.S. capital goods and services if barriers, like discriminatory government procurement policies, are addressed. This could lead to opportunities in construction, engineering, and financial services. The United States aims to improve market access in REP markets through FTAs and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. The Government Procurement Agreement at the WTO level has opened up government procurement markets of key trading partners to international competition since 1996. However, REP procurement markets remain closed, incomplete, and non-transparent. China has been negotiating to join the GPA for years, but none of the REP countries are signatories. The United States aims to improve market access in REP markets through FTAs and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. However, REP procurement markets remain significantly closed, incomplete, and non-transparent. U.S. high tech companies and workers are innovative, with 19 million Americans employed in intellectual property-intensive industries. Intellectual property rights protection is essential for innovation and economic growth. IPR infringement results in significant losses for U.S. stakeholders, with high piracy rates in countries like Indonesia, China, and Russia. The United States and Europe have lower piracy rates. For example, Indonesia's piracy rate is 86%, while the U.S. rate is 19%. This means that for every $100 of legitimate software sold, $86 worth of unlicensed software enters the market. Piracy also affects industries like film, music, and publishing. The United States has sought increased intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in its free trade agreements (FTAs) beyond what is provided in the WTO TRIPS Agreement. A study estimated losses to U.S. industry from IP infringements in China alone totaled $48 billion in 2009. To combat piracy and counterfeiting, the U.S. government has taken action against China in the WTO and placed several countries on a USTR Priority Watch List for fairer access to intellectual property-intensive products. The United States has pushed for stronger intellectual property rights protection in free trade agreements to address losses from IP infringements in China. Many countries have improved IPR laws but struggle with enforcement. Foreign direct investment is crucial for the U.S. economy, with strong investment protections supporting investments abroad and in the U.S. Restrictions on FDI are higher in developing countries, with China, Russia, Indonesia, Mexico, and India being less hospitable towards FDI. Turkey and Brazil have more open policies towards FDI. The OECD index measures foreign equity restrictions, screening requirements, rules for key personnel, and other restrictions on foreign enterprises. Bilateral agreements govern cross-border investment rules, with the US using FTAs and BITs to protect investments. BIT negotiations with China and India started in 2008, and there is interest in negotiating with other countries. Negotiations for Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) are ongoing with Russia, Brazil, and Indonesia. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are prominent in most of the countries, with companies like Pemex and Vale in Brazil, and key sectors in Indonesia dominated by SOEs. SOEs enjoy competitive advantages over private companies, including subsidies like low-interest loans. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have advantages over private companies, such as direct subsidies like low-interest loans and discounted resources. They can win market share due to their ability to sustain financial losses and secure state contracts. International agreements have limited power to regulate SOEs, leading the United States to address unfair competition through FTAs with countries like Australia and Chile. The United States addresses unfair competition from State-owned enterprises (SOEs) through FTAs with countries like Australia and Chile. Stronger disciplines are being proposed in TPP negotiations to ensure SOEs operate on a commercial basis. Concerns arise from the rapid industrialization of certain countries, impacting global markets for raw materials and U.S. industries reliant on imports for high-tech products. Restrictions on raw material exports from countries like China, Brazil, Russia, and India raise prices for U.S. industries, affecting competitiveness and consumer prices. Examples include China's rare earth metals, Brazil's raw hides, India's cotton, Indonesia's key minerals, and Russia's high export duties on wood and scrap. These restrictions pose challenges as they are not fully regulated by WTO rules. Export restrictions on raw materials from countries like China, Brazil, Russia, and India impact U.S. industries and consumer prices. While export quotas and licenses are regulated by GATT rules, export taxes are generally not covered by multilateral disciplines. The U.S. played a significant role in creating the rules-based GATT/WTO trading system, which aims to limit government intervention in economic activity and promote market competition. There are differing opinions in the U.S. on the government's role in regulating economic activity. Many analysts view the United States as a market-oriented economy with less state involvement compared to REPs. The 2008 financial crisis led to challenges to the belief that the market should be the primary driver of economic expansion, with some arguing for more government intervention. Some governments implement industrial policies and subsidies to promote home companies over foreign ones, using state control and open markets to attract investment and create competition. This approach, known as state capitalism, varies among countries but aims to protect domestic firms. China practices a version of state capitalism with government interventions impacting commercial outcomes. Premier Wen Jiabao emphasized the role of market forces under government regulation. China's economic model combines communist principles with market forces. Russia practices a highly interventionist form of state capitalism, relying on direct government control and intervention in key sectors to further state interests. The country uses its vast oil and gas reserves to promote financial and political independence, while allowing segments of the economy to remain open for private investment. Brazil's economy is market-based with significant state involvement shaping economic activity through industrial policies and ownership of major enterprises. The government provides capital and financing, influencing private companies to invest domestically in strategic sectors. India combines a state-dominated economic model with private enterprise. India's economic model combines state dominance with private enterprise, using five-year plans monitored by a state planning commission. The government plays an active role in managing business activities, similar to Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey. These countries have a larger state involvement in their economies, influencing market outcomes and promoting national power. WTO rules limit policy options for promoting technologically advanced industries, leading to resistance in complying with obligations. The decline of U.S. and European leadership in the global economy has led to uncertainty about the future of the WTO and the world trading system. Developing countries argue for flexibility in using interventionist policies to promote economic growth, while new voices and centers of influence struggle to adapt to the changing global economic power dynamics. There is concern that a leadership vacuum could lead to economic and political conflict in the future if the WTO system is not strengthened. Some observers expected emerging economies to become responsible stakeholders in the global trading system, promoting free and fair trade. However, these expectations have not been met, with countries like China, India, and Brazil preferring the status quo. Observers believe that the REPs, led by China, India, and Brazil, have preferred the status quo over co-leadership of the global trading system and protection of their domestic markets. Other REPs, like Indonesia and Turkey, have been obstructive or defensive in the Doha Round. The gap between world expectations and their own capabilities inhibits the REPs from exercising leadership in global governance. The rise of the G-20 as a global economic forum was seen as a potential opportunity for emerging powers (REPs) like China and India to showcase leadership. However, the effectiveness of the G-20 has waned since its inception in 2008, with cooperation remaining elusive and collective pledges going unimplemented. Soft cooperation may be the best outcome currently achievable. The G-20's efforts to implement policies for global economic rebalancing and crisis prevention have been hindered by deep-seated differences among members. Soft cooperation is currently the best achievable outcome, with a need for greater commitment to WTO principles. China, as the largest population and second-largest economy, is looked to for global responsibilities, but its direction remains uncertain. China's direction towards global leadership responsibilities remains uncertain, but its significant stake in an open multilateral trading system and need for stable rules suggest a potential for increased leadership. As China becomes the largest trading country and economy, its state-owned companies seek opportunities abroad, incentivizing active leadership in strengthening trading system rules. China's movement towards responsible stakeholder status could be strengthened by reducing control over the economy, as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to strain the economy. Government support of unprofitable SOEs diverts resources from more efficient enterprises, highlighting the need for a less directed economy where the private sector gains prominence. China's leaders may believe they can achieve international economic objectives through diplomacy, foreign aid, and trade agreements. Despite critics' predictions, China's state dominance in key sectors continues to drive growth. Genuine integration into the global economic order would require significant changes to China's political economy and governance. China's leaders may need to make significant modifications to the Chinese political economy and governance, potentially weakening the relevance of the Communist Party. It is uncertain which path China will take, but any change is likely to be incremental and gradual. Reflecting Deng Xiaoping's cautious approach in international affairs, China's use of power has been careful. The rise of the REPs has reshaped the global economy, with China accounting for a significant share of global GDP and trade. The rise of the REPs has reshaped the global economy, leading to increased economic influence and bargaining leverage. Questions arise on how to maintain the world trade order, establish new rules, and respond to challenges and opportunities posed by the REPs, prompting a reconsideration of U.S. trade policy goals and objectives. The U.S. trade policy aims to promote high living standards for residents by removing trade barriers. Policymakers have various trade initiatives to consider, which will shape U.S. trade leadership in the future. While freer trade can increase a nation's general welfare, it may not distribute benefits equally. Competitive firms may gain from exports and overseas expansion, but some sectors could suffer from layoffs and closures. Concerns arise from global competition with low-wage workers and automation, leading to income stagnation and job insecurity for American workers. Economists do not advocate halting trade liberalization or technological advances, but acknowledge the need to address these economic challenges. Experts recognize that trade policy alone cannot solve the challenges faced by U.S. companies and workers in a global economy. They argue for better education and training for those displaced by trade to compete globally and improve living standards. U.S. trade policymakers also face public pressure for more reciprocity in trade relations with other countries, as the American public becomes more skeptical of globalization and free trade agreements. The United States faces concerns about its ability to compete for trade and investment, particularly with developing countries known as REPs. These concerns stem from worries about jobs, import competition, and closed markets in the REPs. It is uncertain how the U.S. can persuade REPs to prioritize trade liberalization or support the world trading system. Better understanding of the factors influencing REP trade policies, such as domestic growth priorities, may help U.S. policymakers address these challenges. The United States faces challenges in competing for trade and investment with developing countries known as REPs. Despite concerns about jobs and closed markets, REPs still rely on access to advanced country markets. U.S. policymakers may need to reconsider trade agreement strategies and allocate more resources to these countries. The U.S. government may need to negotiate reductions in trade barriers with developing countries known as REPs, including agricultural subsidies, trade laws, Buy-American policies, and foreign investment restrictions. Reciprocal bargaining could maximize economic welfare and avoid trade conflicts. The rapid growth of REPs presents opportunities for U.S. exports and investments abroad, and various trade negotiating approaches can be used to open up markets for mutually beneficial economic relationships. Approaches to trade negotiations include multilateral and plurilateral talks under the WTO, bilateral and regional FTAs, and unilateral actions to influence REPs' market policies. Multilateral negotiations were prominent in the past but have faced challenges, such as the stalled WTO Doha Round due to differences between the US, Europe, and emerging economies. The United States and Europe have similar interests in encouraging emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil to open their import markets. Developing countries seek reductions in U.S. and European agricultural tariffs and subsidies, non-reciprocal market access for manufacturing sectors, and protection for services sectors. India and Brazil now hold out for deals of their choice, believing they made greater commitments in past negotiations. The rising powers like China, Brazil, India, and South Africa are reluctant to give up protection of their markets in multilateral negotiations. The United States, European Union, and Japan are not willing to accept unbalanced concessions from developing countries to salvage a trade round. Former U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab criticized these countries for hiding behind the WTO's practice of allowing developing countries to have fewer obligations. The rising economic powers like China, Brazil, India, and South Africa are hesitant to support the open trading system despite accruing economic benefits. Brazil and India, along with China, formed a bloc to influence negotiations in the Doha Round, but their efforts did not significantly advance the talks. The United States and other advanced countries are also criticized for their role in the stalled negotiations. The United States and other advanced countries are blamed for the Doha stalemate. They are accused of wanting one-sided concessions while unwilling to reduce their own trade barriers, especially in agriculture. A large and meaningful agreement is unlikely in the near future unless major trading countries like the US, EU, and China make significant offers. Consideration is given to \"harvesting\" already achieved gains or concessions, such as trade facilitation and phasing out farm export subsidies. The REPs influenced the Doha Round, hindering progress on trade liberalization within the WTO. Reexamining principles like unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment may be necessary. Unconditional MFN promotes economic efficiency but allows for \"free riders\" and challenges reciprocity. Plurilateral agreements offer a way to address the issue of \"free riders\" in the trading system by allowing for concessions among some WTO members without extending them to all. This can help prevent countries like Brazil, India, or China from taking advantage of benefits without fulfilling their obligations. Plurilateral agreements aim to prevent countries from gaining benefits without obligations. A group of 47 countries is negotiating an international services agreement, with only Mexico and Turkey participating. Services negotiations are crucial for the United States due to its comparative advantage in various sectors. Liberalization of services trade could bring significant economic benefits, but it is politically challenging due to heavy regulations at national and sub-national levels. Plurilateral agreements could address issues like foreign investment restrictions, currency undervaluation, and state-owned enterprises. China, India, Russia, and Brazil oppose plurilateral agreements in the WTO, preferring the \"single undertaking\" principle. Future multilateral negotiations are uncertain due to disagreements between advanced countries and REPs. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is also a key factor in this context. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism (DSU) is crucial for maintaining global economic order, with the United States, REPs, and the European Union being the largest users. The system has been successful in diffusing conflicts and obtaining compliance with rulings, with many disputes resolved in consultations before a panel is formed. The WTO's DSU is a key tool for managing trade relations, allowing countries to bring laws into conformity with obligations. Despite shortcomings, it remains crucial for the United States and other advanced countries to engage with REPs on upholding multilateral trade rules. The DSU also provides REPs a way to challenge market access barriers. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) serves as a crucial forum for managing trade relations amidst global economic uncertainties. U.S. trade policy is increasingly focused on bilateral and regional negotiations to establish Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which aim to reduce trade barriers and promote economic growth through trade expansion. FTAs typically remove tariff barriers, liberalize services trade, enhance intellectual property protection, open government procurement markets, ease foreign investment restrictions, and ensure enforcement mechanisms. Since the NAFTA in 1994, the US has signed 12 FTAs with 17 countries, including DR-CAFTA, addressing various trade barriers and enforcing core worker rights. These agreements have eliminated tariffs, covered intellectual property, and promoted economic growth through trade expansion. The US has signed FTAs with various countries since NAFTA, covering tariffs, intellectual property, and other trade issues. However, major trading partners like China, India, and Brazil have not negotiated FTAs with the US due to differing interests and priorities. The United States may need to deviate from its FTA template and consider putting remaining trade barriers, especially in agriculture, on the negotiating table to secure advantages with larger countries. The Obama Administration is making progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with various countries, aiming for a comprehensive and high-standard FTA. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to liberalize trade in goods and services beyond current WTO obligations, with a focus on improving regional supply chains and establishing rules on state-owned enterprises and foreign investment. The inclusion of Vietnam and Malaysia in the negotiations could influence China and other non-participating countries to offer similar rules and opportunities. China may feel pressure to liberalize its economy or join negotiations for greater access to the U.S. market. A possible U.S.-EU FTA could establish international standards and incentivize non-parties to participate in multilateral agreements. The U.S. has various trade and diplomatic tools to engage with non-parties to trade agreements, such as TIFAs and high-level dialogues. Diplomatic approaches could include official exchanges and investments in education. Export promotion measures, including export finance, could be strengthened to support U.S. exporters and investors. Export finance and other trade tools could be reinforced to ensure U.S. exporters and investors are not disadvantaged by competitors. Unilateral sanctions, once used primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, are now largely unavailable due to WTO agreements. The focus has shifted to a dispute resolution system based on binding rulings on violations of WTO trade obligations. In today's global economy, unilateral initiatives are more about incentives than penalties. Strengthening the U.S. economy can set an example for the world and align with other countries' economic interests. Reinvigorating the U.S. economy could have a positive impact on trade reform efforts. The focus has shifted from unilateral sanctions to binding WTO rulings on trade violations. Some observers believe the United States is close to strengthening its economic fundamentals through a budget agreement, which could boost its global economic position. A stronger U.S. economy driven by market forces may reduce the need for a more interventionist state role and inspire others to liberalize their markets. BRIC countries aim to enhance their global political influence and modernize their economies based on their own policies, not dictated by the U.S. In the long run, the U.S. market-based capitalism or state-centered capitalism may prevail based on economic performance. The U.S. is likely to continue efforts to open markets via negotiations, prioritizing private sector involvement while other countries may push for more government discretion. The appropriate role of government in trade disputes has been a key issue, with U.S. negotiators targeting foreign government-directed practices that discriminate against foreign firms. In the past, negotiations with Japan focused on measures protecting its market from U.S. exports, limiting opportunities for American firms in sectors like insurance and banking. In future negotiations with the REPs, appealing to middle-class consumers and reaching out to the European Union for support can help in urging for a quicker opening of markets. Congress, based on its powers in the U.S. Constitution, plays a significant role in shaping U.S. trade policies. In shaping U.S. trade policies, Congress, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution, holds a major role. This includes setting trade negotiating objectives, approving agreements, and overseeing trade relations. The 113th Congress may address future U.S. trade policy direction, especially regarding the potential renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2013. TPA allows the President to negotiate trade agreements aligned with Congress's objectives, with Congress committing to expedited legislative procedures for implementing these agreements. President Obama may request to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to open new trade negotiations or complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Congress could examine trade policy questions affecting U.S. relations with trading partners, including initiatives to engage them, open markets, and revitalize the WTO. The adequacy of U.S. export promotion efforts and whether trade policy should prioritize trading partners are key considerations. U.S. trade leadership is seen to benefit when the President has TPA. Efforts to maintain U.S. trade leadership with Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and a mandate from Congress to negotiate new agreements may require resources, flexibility, and leverage. Previous attempts to identify rising developing countries like China, India, and Brazil have been made to strengthen the market-oriented WTO system. The BEM Initiative selected 10 countries, including Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, Turkey, and South Korea, based on economic progress, political ambitions, and foreign policy concerns. The initiative aimed to strengthen commercial ties with these countries. The World Bank's Global Economic Prospects Report also identified Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Indonesia as rising developing countries. The \"Big 5\" report by Goldman Sachs projected that Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Indonesia would increase their influence on global resource allocation, production, and trade by 2020. In 2005, Goldman Sachs also identified the \"Next Eleven\" group of developing countries with the potential to play a larger role in the global economy. The CIVETS group of countries, including Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa, were identified as the next generation of emerging economies with large, young populations and sophisticated financial systems. In 2011, President Obama's National Export Initiative aimed to double U.S. exports, focusing on emerging markets like Colombia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnam. Jim O'Neil of Goldman Sachs highlighted the importance of emerging markets in global trade. O'Neil, head of Goldman Sachs research, redefined \"emerging markets\" as \"Growth Markets\" for countries like Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, and Turkey. Citibank identified 11 promising countries as \"3G\" or Global Growth Generators based on various factors. Oxford Analytica rejected a purely quantitative approach in 2012. In 2012, Oxford Analytica identified six countries as Pivotal Powers with significant economic potential: Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Mexico. The German Marshall Fund and Center for New American Security released a report on Global Swing States, focusing on Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the future of the international order. The report discussed how the US and Europe can collaborate with these countries to shape a new global order. The selection criteria for rising economic powers include population size, capital stock, and total factor productivity. Projections emphasize demographics and political factors influencing economic rankings. The global population is expected to reach 9.2 billion by 2050, with a significant increase in the labor force. Developing regions will see workforce expansion. The global population is expected to reach 9.2 billion by 2050, with developing regions seeing a significant increase in the labor force. Developing Africa and Asia will contribute the most to the increase, adding 1.4 billion workers to the global labor force. Europe's working-age population will decline by more than 110 million. Countries with large populations are playing an increasingly large role in the world economy. Countries with large populations are becoming major players in the global economy, displacing 20th-century powers in GDP rankings. Demographics play a crucial role in economic power, enabling countries to project power and set agendas. Worker productivity and physical capital stocks are key drivers of growth, with high savings rates financing future investments. Total factor productivity (TFP) is also a significant driver of economic growth. Total factor productivity (TFP) is a crucial driver of economic growth, influenced by factors like political stability, good governance, exposure to new technologies, and sound economic policies. Policies promoting free flow of goods, money, and people, encouraging savings and productive investments, and maintaining economic stability are key for growth. Protection of property rights, quality education, and training systems are also essential for attracting technology transfers and innovation. Top quality education and training systems are crucial components for economic growth. However, there is no magic formula for success, as various factors like policies and institutions play a significant role. Long-term forecasts of economic growth are uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of factors underlying Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Countries like China and India face challenges such as internal imbalances, aging populations, and corruption, which could hinder their economic potential. Conversely, countries like Iran and Nigeria may struggle to play a significant role in the global economy. Countries like Iran and Nigeria, previously seen as long-shots in the global economy, could potentially address internal challenges, implement economic reforms, engage globally, and achieve sustained growth. Other countries with similar potential include Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan, Philippines, and Vietnam. These nations, along with nine fast-growing developing countries, have the capacity to play a larger role in the global economy if they overcome political and institutional constraints. The group of nine fast-growing developing countries includes Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and Venezuela. On the other hand, countries like Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, and Vietnam have the potential to improve their economic situation with better governance and reforms. These nations have large populations but face political and economic obstacles. Some developing countries like Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Pakistan have large populations but weak economies with low GDP and per capita incomes. Egypt has the potential to become an economic power due to its large population, educated elite, and strategic location, but faces challenges like political instability and legal uncertainties. Iran, with a population of 75 million, has significant economic potential due to its well-educated middle class and high labor participation rates. Expatriates of Iranian descent hold an estimated $1 trillion in assets and could facilitate global capital and trade mediation if geopolitical conditions improve. Iran has the potential for economic growth if geopolitical conditions improve. Nigeria aims to become Africa's most powerful economy by 2020, with a growing middle class and a large domestic market. Nigeria is Africa's largest domestic market with a youthful middle class and economic potential, but faces challenges like high unemployment, low development indicators, political conflict, and slow progress in key sectors. Other developing countries also offer trade and investment opportunities with outward-looking policies. Emerging markets like Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and Venezuela have adopted outward-looking trade and economic policies. These countries have GDPs ranging from $215 billion to $577 billion, with populations generally under 50 million. Thailand, with a per capita income of $4,972, shows potential for growth among these emerging markets. Emerging markets like Argentina, Colombia, Malaysia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand have shown significant growth potential, outpacing advanced countries. From 2009 to 2011, these countries experienced growth rates averaging 3.3% to 6.3%, surpassing advanced countries by wide margins. Only the Czech Republic and Venezuela performed similarly or worse due to external factors."
