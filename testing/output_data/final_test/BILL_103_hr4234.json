    "content": "Hate crime prevention. The Secretary of Education may grant funds to local educational agencies and community-based organizations to assist areas affected by hate crimes. Funds can be used for developing educational programs to prevent hate crimes, improving conflict resolution skills, and acquiring necessary equipment and materials. The Secretary of Education grants funds to local educational agencies and community-based organizations for hate crime prevention programs, conflict resolution training, and professional development for teachers and administrators. To be eligible for a grant, applicants must submit an application containing specific information as required by the office. Each application for grants must include a description of the schools and communities to be served, assurances that funds will supplement non-Federal funds, and a comprehensive plan addressing hate crime or conflict issues, program development, and proper administration. The Secretary of Education may allocate funds for programs addressing hate crimes and conflicts motivated by bias in schools and communities. Grants will be awarded based on the incidence of such crimes and an attempt will be made to achieve an equitable geographic distribution of awards. The Secretary will disseminate information on successful hate crime prevention programs funded by grants. Reports to Congress every 2 years will detail grant activities and program evaluations. Definitions for \"hate crime\" and \"local educational agency\" are provided. A local educational agency is an entity within a State that oversees public schools, while a community-based organization is a nonprofit that provides educational services to a community."
