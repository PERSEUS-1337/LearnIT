    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11320.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to specify the sequence of employment-related activities required for recipients of aid under this chapter. Recipients must undergo orientation, appraisal, job search, job club participation, family stabilization, high school equivalency program, or substance abuse, mental health, or domestic violence services as determined by the county. Following orientation, appraisal, and job search, if employment is not found or deemed unlikely, the recipient will be referred to assessment for the development of a welfare-to-work plan specifying assigned activities and supportive services. The welfare-to-work plan developed by the county welfare department and the participant shall include work activities such as unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, and subsidized public sector employment. The welfare-to-work plan includes work activities like subsidized private sector employment, subsidized public sector employment, work experience, on-the-job training, and unpaid work experience limited to 12 months. The county welfare department reviews and revises work experience assignments to prepare participants for employment. Grant-based on-the-job training allows for cash grants or aid grant savings to be diverted to the employer as a wage subsidy, as long as it does not exceed the family's maximum aid payment. Participants must voluntarily agree to participate and a form outlining job termination protections must be signed. The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and increased CalFresh benefits can be obtained to boost earned income. Financial supports should increase current income and future social security income. Grant-based on-the-job training includes community service positions. Wages funded by cash grant diversion are not exempt from income calculations. Supported work or transitional employment includes grant-based on-the-job training where cash grants are diverted to offset wages. Other options include workstudy, self-employment, community service, adult basic education, and job skills training. The curr_chunk discusses job skills training, vocational education, job search assistance, education related to employment, and progress in secondary school or high school equivalency programs. The curr_chunk discusses mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence services necessary for employment, other activities for obtaining unsubsidized employment, and limited educational assignments for employment purposes. The curr_chunk explains that recipients can engage in activities listed in Section 11322.6 for up to 24 months to meet welfare-to-work requirements, which do not have to be consecutive. Any month meeting requirements in Section 11322.8 does not count towards the 24-month limit. After 24 months of welfare-to-work activities, aided adults can participate in various employment programs such as unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, public sector employment, work experience, on-the-job training, job search assistance, community service, and vocational training for up to 12 months. The curr_chunk discusses various activities that can be counted towards welfare-to-work participation, including vocational training, job skills training, education related to employment, and child care services. Any month where specific conditions exist will not be counted towards the 24 months of participation allowed. The recipient's participation in job search, assessment, appraisal, or welfare-to-work plan is considered for welfare-to-work participation. Exemptions include no longer receiving aid, good cause, or family stabilization activities for up to six months. The recipient must participate in a high school equivalency program for at least six months to obtain a certificate. County welfare departments must notify recipients of the 24-month time limit and process for exemptions and extensions. The notice must be provided to individuals applying for aid, during annual redetermination, and after 18 months of participation towards the 24-month limit. It includes information on remaining eligibility months, requirements to meet, dispute process, and the option to modify welfare-to-work plans. The 24-month time limitation for individuals receiving aid may be exempted or extended. The Department will convene a workgroup to determine noticing and engagement requirements within 18 months of the effective date. The workgroup may recommend refining procedures and due process requirements for individuals receiving assistance. An assistance unit with an eligible adult can continue in a welfare-to-work plan for up to 24 months, starting from January 1, 2013, unless they exceed the 48-month time limit. Section 11325.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows recipients without a high school diploma to participate in a high school equivalency program. Participation is optional, and recipients can also choose to engage in job-related activities instead. Recipients eligible under this section are not required to undergo an assessment before participating in a high school equivalency program."
