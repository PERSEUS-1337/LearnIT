    "content": "Rising competition for energy in China, Japan, and South Korea is a concern for U.S. policymakers due to its impact on world oil prices, potential strain on relations with Asian allies, and geopolitical shifts in the region. Energy insecurity has historical significance, as seen in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. foreign and energy policy. In 1975, Congress passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, authorizing U.S. participation in the International Energy Agency, creating a strategic petroleum reserve, and promoting energy efficiency. The United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission was established in 2000 to assess the national security implications of trade with China, including energy needs. Congressional opposition arose in 2005 when China's CNOOC tried to acquire U.S. energy company Unocal for $18.5 billion in cash. In June 2005, Congressional opposition led to the withdrawal of CNOOC's $18.5 billion bid for Unocal. Japan, heavily reliant on external energy sources, has focused on diversifying suppliers and energy forms since the 1970s to ensure energy security. Japan has heavily invested in energy diversification and conservation, including strategic oil reserves and alternative energy sources. The country is a member of the International Energy Agency and has reduced its reliance on petroleum from over 70% in 1970 to under 50% in 2004. Japan has increasingly turned to nuclear power to reduce oil dependence and carbon emissions, despite safety concerns affecting public confidence in the industry. Japan remains the third-largest user of nuclear energy in the world, with 55 light-water nuclear power reactors and plans to build 13 more. The country relies on nuclear reactors for over one third of its electricity. Additionally, Japan imports liquified natural gas (LNG) primarily from Southeast Asia, with a major project underway to develop natural gas and oil on the Russian island of Sakhalin to provide about 8.5% of Japan's LNG by 2009. Japan has invested in energy conservation programs and renewable energy sources to reduce per capita energy consumption. Japanese automakers are leading in producing hybrid cars to decrease dependency on petroleum. The country aims to enhance energy security and meet environmental goals, including emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The \"New National Energy Strategy\" in Japan aims to increase conservation, lower oil dependence, develop nuclear energy, and secure more equity oil overseas. Japanese oil firms have sought energy supplies globally to reduce reliance on the Middle East, focusing on regions like the Caspian and Russian Far East. Imports from China and Vietnam decreased after 2000 as those countries became net importers themselves. In 2006, Japan imported 2% of its crude oil from Sudan and still imports close to 90% of its oil from the Middle East. Japan's dependence on Middle Eastern oil has driven its foreign policy in the region, leading to diplomatic confrontations with China and seeking supplies from OPEC nations for four decades. After the 1973 oil crisis, Japan shifted its policy towards the Middle East, supporting Palestinians and developing relationships with regional countries. Japan's foreign policy in the Middle East focuses on supporting Palestinians, engaging with Iran through trade, and providing economic development assistance. Japanese trading companies heavily invest in the region with government support. Japan also plays a role in the Israel-Palestinian peace process and faces conflicts with U.S. security interests, particularly regarding Iran's oil production. In 2000, Japan turned to a $3 billion deal with Iran for the Azadegan oilfield after losing drilling rights in Saudi Arabia. Despite US concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the deal was signed in 2004. Iran's defiance of IAEA demands led to tensions with the UN Security Council. In October 2006, Japan's Inpex firm reduced its stake in the Azadegan oilfield project from 75% to 10% and transferred operational authority to a national Iranian oil company. This move was prompted by demands for facility inspections and UN sanctions on Iran. China and India have increased their energy deals with Iran since Japan's reduced involvement, while South Korea, a major oil importer, has a similar energy portfolio but is less efficient and environmentally-advanced than Japan. South Korea, like Japan, relies on oil for half of its energy consumption. Energy imports must arrive by boat due to the division of the Korean peninsula. The government has a strategic oil reserve managed by the Korea National Oil Corporation. Korean chaebol are active in the Middle East energy sector. President Lee Myung-bak aims to focus on energy diplomacy. Restructuring of the energy industry faces opposition from labor unions. South Korea has increased nuclear power generation. South Korea has increased its nuclear power generation, facing challenges in finding suitable sites for new plants due to limited land availability. The government plans to introduce up to twelve new nuclear plants before 2015, with little focus on renewable energy resources. To diversify its energy sources, South Korea seeks equity stakes in energy exploration globally, including in South America, the Middle East, and Asia. It has increased imports of oil and gas from Russia and turned to natural gas for its power needs. South Korea has increased its reliance on natural gas for power needs, importing LNG from Qatar, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Oman. The government promotes natural gas usage through tax incentives. Kogas has secured a long-term LNG deal from the Sakhalin-2 project and aims to import gas from Siberia via pipeline, despite slow progress on Russian pipeline projects. This shift is crucial as coal prices from China have surged due to increased domestic demand. The uncertainty of the Korean peninsula's future complicates South Korea's long-term energy security strategies. North Korea's energy deficit and reliance on coal pose challenges. Energy plays a key role in the Six-Party Talks regarding North Korea's nuclear programs. Previous agreements aimed to provide North Korea with light water reactors in exchange for shutting down nuclear facilities. North Korea is receiving heavy fuel oil from Russia, South Korea, China, and the United States in exchange for disabling key nuclear facilities. Some suggest building gas pipelines through North Korea to provide energy and foreign exchange without relying on its nuclear program. Energy is seen as a potential platform for region-wide cooperation in the Six-Party Talks, especially with China's growing energy demand due to rapid economic growth. China's energy consumption has doubled between 2000 and 2007, with a shift towards oil to meet the rising demand. Despite coal still accounting for 70% of energy consumption, China has become the world's second-largest oil consumer after the United States. By 2030, China is projected to demand over 16 million barrels per day. With a 60% increase in electricity and coal consumption since 2000, China is a major player in global energy markets and is expected to surpass the United States as the largest energy consumer by 2010. The electricity crisis in China in 2003-2004 led to the formation of the Energy Leading Group and the State Energy Office in 2005 to address energy security issues. However, China's energy strategy still faces challenges due to inter-agency conflicts and tensions with national oil companies. Beijing's 11th Five-Year Plan aims for a 20% reduction in energy intensity by 2020. China aims for a 20% reduction in energy intensity by 2020, shifting focus to demand moderation. Strategic petroleum reserve creation has been slow due to high oil prices, with debates on market forces vs. equity oil and global cooperation. China is actively involved in global and regional initiatives for oil cooperation, despite some distrust of the United States. Economic nationalism is seen as a threat to energy security, leading to diversification efforts beyond oil. While China is exploring alternatives like nuclear power, renewables, and natural gas, these are expected to remain a small part of the energy mix. Major initiatives include expanding the national gas infrastructure and developing gas-fired power plants using liquefied natural gas. Natural gas is a promising long-term alternative for China due to its abundance and environmental benefits. Despite ongoing development of domestic reserves and overseas exploration, high costs and the availability of cheap coal may limit its extensive use in the short term. China is also expanding its nuclear power program with plans to increase reactors by 2020. The US and Japan have relaxed restrictions on supplying parts to Chinese plants for safe operations. China has approved numerous new electricity projects to address past shortages and minimize blackouts. China has approved numerous new electricity projects to address past shortages and minimize blackouts. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydropower project with the world's largest electric generation capacity. Beijing is restructuring electric power production and allowing foreign investment in the energy sector. China is the world's top producer and consumer of coal, becoming a net importer in 2007. Critics note the lack of a national electric grid leads to surplus power in some areas despite a national shortage of generating capacity. China is the world's top producer and consumer of coal, with experts predicting a potential doubling or tripling of coal use by 2020. Despite efforts to improve safety standards in coal mines, thousands of miners still die annually. Severe air pollution in Chinese cities has led to international pressure to reduce emissions. Winter weather in 2007 exposed China's strained rail capacity, causing widespread blackouts when coal couldn't reach power stations. Rail expansion struggles to keep up with the demand for coal transit. China's rail capacity struggles to meet the demand for coal transit, leading to blackouts in power stations. China heavily relies on the Middle East for oil imports, with Saudi Arabia being the largest provider. Beijing has aggressively invested in foreign oilfields in over 30 countries, focusing on Africa and Russia for growth opportunities. Chinese companies have acquired oil concessions in various regions, but China does not participate in multilateral energy coordination fora. Political leaders are promoting cooperation through energy deals, often combined with financial incentives and high-level talks. China's national oil companies pursue profit-driven deals, gaining influence in energy policymaking. Analysts note their competitiveness comes from accepting higher risks and lower returns. Significant progress has been made in the Caspian region, notably with a China-Kazakhstan agreement giving CNPC a 60% stake in Kazakh state. China's national oil companies, particularly CNPC, have secured a 60% stake in Kazakhstan's Aktobemunaigaz through a landmark accord. This deal, along with the completion of an oil pipeline for Kazakh oil delivery to China, has increased Beijing's presence in Central Asia. Additionally, strategic acquisitions in Azerbaijan and preferential rights in Turkmenistan have further solidified China's influence in the region. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which includes China, Russia, and Central Asian countries, has also been strengthened through these energy deals. China's energy relationship with Sudan has raised concern among U.S. officials due to atrocities in Darfur. CNPC invested $8 billion in Sudan's oil sector and received 5% of its oil imports from Sudan in 2005. Increased international pressure on Sudan is causing Beijing to reconsider its investment for fear of losing global \"soft power.\" China values its energy ties with Iran for security reasons, with a rise in energy deals and overall trade between the two countries. Beijing has provided Tehran with military equipment since the 1980s. China's military equipment support for Iran began in the 1980s, including technology for weapons of mass destruction and missile programs. Reports suggest China stopped sending dual-use technology in 1997, but conflicting claims exist. The US has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies for exporting WMD and advanced conventional weapons to Iran. Energy issues are discussed in the Strategic Economic Dialogue, initiated in 2005, marking the first regular exchange between senior US and Chinese officials. The Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) has led to increased engagement on cooperative energy agreements between the U.S. and China. Efforts include protocols on fossil energy, renewables, and energy efficiency, a Memorandum of Understanding for technology export, and the Oil and Gas Industry Forum. The Asia-Pacific Partnership (APP) focuses on clean energy technologies deployment with private sector partners from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, India, China, and Australia. As China and Japan compete for energy resources in Siberia to reduce reliance on the Middle East, Russia's Far East holds significant untapped reserves. Despite doubts on commercial viability, China and Japan engage in a bidding war for Russian projects. Moscow plays the two countries against each other to maximize concessions, despite frustrations with Russia's opaque policies. The focus is on a pipeline originating in an eastern Siberian oilfield. The pipeline originating in eastern Siberia was initially planned to go from Angarsk to Daqing, China, but stalled due to the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2005, Moscow changed the route to Taishet to Nakhodka, near Vladivostok, to satisfy Japan's demands. The Kremlin is delaying the final decision on the pipeline's destination. The Nakhodka option for the pipeline is more expensive and ambitious, covering over 2,580 miles and costing up to $18 billion. Japan's proposal offers full financing through JBIC, aiming to reduce dependence on the Middle East by importing a million barrels a day from Russia. Russia has not committed to either project yet. In September 2005, Putin announced the pipeline would be built from Taishet to Skovorodino, then on to Daqing, with plans to extend it to Nakhodka for the Asia-Pacific market. Initial phase capacity is estimated at 300,000 barrels per day, with final capacity at 1.6 million barrels per day. Construction on the first stage began in April 2006, with doubts arising due to rising costs. Oil analysts are skeptical about whether reserves can meet pipeline projections. Moscow has strategic reasons for the pipeline, with concerns about dependence on the Chinese market. Relations between Beijing and Moscow have improved, with joint military exercises and Russia supplying arms to China. Both countries are wary of US military presence in Central Asia. Russia has promised to increase oil supply to China by rail. Through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russia and China successfully pushed for a US forces withdrawal from Uzbekistan in 2005. A pipeline to China would strengthen ties between the two countries. Russia is considering building a pipeline into China to solidify their partnership, but expanding economic ties with Japan is also attractive. Russia, as the world's largest exporter of natural gas, is poised to be a natural gas superpower. Projects in Sakhalin and the Kovykta gas field indicate potential markets in China, Japan, and South Korea. East Asian governments are negotiating with Gazprom for gas exports. Natural gas is seen as an attractive alternative to oil due to its proximity and milder environmental impact. Gas pipeline politics in East Asia are evolving, with China focusing on the Kovykta field and Japan on Sakhalin for gas supplies. Uncertainty remains on whether gas will be transported via pipeline or LNG. Gazprom is exploring various export options, including pipelines to China, South Korea, and potentially Japan. Competition for natural gas reserves in the region continues. The Russian island of Sakhalin is set to become a major gas supplier to the region and an important oil producer. Sakhalin I, led by ExxonMobil, is providing oil to Asian markets and natural gas to Russia. Sakhalin II, under the Gazprom/Shell/Mitsubishi/Mitsui consortium, will be Russia's first LNG facility in 2008, supplying natural gas to the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Chinese and Indian firms are competing for a stake in the projects. Several Sakhalin projects are in preliminary stages, with Chinese and Indian firms competing for a stake in the development. The question of gas transportation method (pipeline vs. liquefaction) is tied to national energy security concerns. Japan prefers the pipeline option for exclusive supply diversification away from the Middle East. LNG producers are eyeing markets in South Korea, China, and the United States. Sakhalin energy projects, especially Sakhalin II, test the feasibility of foreign direct investment in Russia. Sakhalin II's consortium agreed to cede in late 2006. In late 2006, Sakhalin II's consortium agreed to cede a majority stake to Gazprom, Russia's national natural gas monopoly, after facing environmental concerns. This move by Moscow reflects a desire to expand control over energy projects and assert \"resource nationalism.\" The United States, as the world's largest energy consumer, prioritizes free trade and open markets to ensure a steady energy supply. U.S. policymakers are cautious about China's growing economic and political power and its impact on energy security in the region. There is a competition between China and Japan over pipeline routes from Russia, with analysts divided on which route serves U.S. interests better. Reducing China's reliance on the Middle East could enhance energy security and stability, but closer ties between China and Russia could potentially exclude the United States from the region. Some analysts view a strong Moscow-Beijing partnership as unfavorable to the United States, potentially leading to a regional bloc excluding the U.S. Rising energy competition in East Asia could result in military conflict or regional cooperation. Energy security concerns for Japan and South Korea, key American allies in Asia, may strain U.S. alliances as China's demand intensifies. Maintaining stability for open trade and investment has been crucial for U.S. alliances in securing access to energy sources, particularly in the Middle East. Japan and South Korea's energy dependence and potential threats to their energy supplies may impact their support for U.S. policies, especially in the Middle East. Tensions between Tokyo and Washington over the Azadegan deal in Iran could lead to diplomatic challenges. However, concerns about energy access could also strengthen alliance cooperation. Japanese leaders believe that energy and security are interconnected, with stability in the Middle East being crucial for Japan's national interest due to its reliance on the region's oil. Japan's gradual shift towards a more active military role could lead to a departure from its passive approach in the Middle East, as seen in its deployment of Self Defense Forces to Iraq. Japan's deployment of Self Defense Forces to Iraq and encouragement of Southeast Asian nations to join the Proliferation Security Initiative indicate a trend towards increased cooperation in the region. Resolving North Korea's nuclear weapons program is crucial for the U.S.-South Korean alliance, with a diplomatic solution through the Six-Party Talks requiring attention to the peninsula's energy needs. Analysts suggest potential for enhanced energy security cooperation among Asian countries, as seen in various regional groupings like ASEAN Plus Three, APEC, and the East Asia Summit introducing programs for energy cooperation amidst high oil prices. Leaders at the 2007 East Asia Summit emphasized the need for concerted efforts in this regard. At the 2007 East Asia Summit, leaders advocated for exploring nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel alternatives due to high oil prices. Developing shared infrastructure and information institutions could benefit East Asia in various political, economic, and security issues. This could reduce dependence on the United States for stability, potentially impacting U.S. influence in the region. The strategic importance of the South China Sea transit routes, especially the Strait of Malacca, is increasing as Asian reliance on Middle Eastern oil grows. China and Japan receive a significant portion of their oil supplies from the Middle East through this route, which faces piracy and military blockades. In the event of a US-China confrontation, the Strait of Malacca is a potential flashpoint due to piracy and military blockades. China aims to protect its sea lanes to the Middle East as it lacks naval power to prevent an economic blockade. Russia could gain leverage in the Asia-Pacific if Asian consumers shift to natural gas. Russia's untapped reserves position it as a potential gas superpower, enhancing its strategic economic power. Russia's untapped reserves and non-OPEC status are increasing its influence in the oil markets, particularly in East Asia. Moscow may use the energy sector to regain power in the region, where its influence has waned since the Soviet Union's collapse. China's oil demand has led to new partnerships in Central Asia, a region of historical power struggles. Russia, China, and the US are closely monitoring pipeline construction in the area. Moscow retains control over the Caspian region through existing pipelines, but is wary of China's growing presence in the Russian Far East. Moscow and Beijing are cooperating to counter U.S. influence in Central Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has been strengthened, and energy cooperation between China, Central Asia, and Russia is reducing U.S. strategic leverage. Central Asian republics are leaning towards Beijing and Moscow, potentially hindering democratic and market reforms. Some energy experts suggest that China's quest for energy security will lead it to aggressively seek new sources of supply in the Middle East. Rising China may cultivate relationships with U.S. adversaries for energy contracts, potentially marginalizing U.S. power. There are concerns about a possible U.S.-China struggle over oil leading to a close China-Saudi Arabia relationship and even a world war-level conflict. Some analysts suggest that China's focus on economic development may prevent it from initiating military action solely for energy resources. Beijing is unlikely to challenge the United States for energy supplies due to its reliance on American investment and markets. The U.S., as the world's superpower, has an energy policy that ensures access for other energy-consuming states. A policy of locking up energy resources for the United States alone is justified, especially with China and other economies increasing their energy demands. This could involve diversifying away from the Middle East to prevent other nations, including U.S. allies, from benefiting without contributing. Transparency and reform in the energy sector could help ease tensions in East Asia. Encouraging allies like Japan and South Korea to create independent regulatory bodies could help reduce barriers to market competition. Some specialists suggest that U.S. officials could collaborate with Japan and South Korea to restore public confidence in nuclear energy by sharing technology and expertise for safer operation of reactors. This cooperation could also lead to advancements in energy research, promoting a market-based approach to energy security and reducing global dependency on oil. The Department of Energy has taken steps to enhance energy efficiency cooperation with Asian nations, including research on fuel cell technology with Japan, cleaner air initiatives with China, and promoting cleaner-burning fuels in the Philippines. The debate over how the United States should deal with a rising China in the energy sector includes concerns about energy competition and security. Some policymakers view Chinese growth as a security risk, while others see potential for cooperation due to shared interests in stability in oil-producing regions. China is labeled as a \"free-rider\" benefiting from American power in the Middle East and Asia. Allowing China to continue as a \"free rider\" could reduce conflict risks and prevent price spikes in the global oil market, which would harm U.S. interests. Positive bilateral relationships and regional stability could enhance overall security. China could benefit from U.S. assistance in developing alternatives to oil, such as bio-fuels or coal-based fuels, hydrogen, and natural gas. Japan could also help China with energy conservation strategies. Providing technical assistance to China in expanding its strategic oil reserve could help them cope with disruptions in the global oil supply. The campaign to pressure Beijing to be a responsible stakeholder in the world includes energy considerations. The campaign to pressure Beijing to be a \"responsible stakeholder\" in the world involves energy cooperation with the United States and the international energy community. Enhanced funding and attention to energy cooperation programs under the Strategic Economic Dialogue could support this approach. Strong leadership is crucial to coordinate cooperation between actors in the energy market to reduce potential conflicts and instability. The United States is seen as a key player in setting and enforcing rules through economic organizations, military cooperation, technical expertise, international development assistance, and promoting common standards and shared infrastructure for energy security. Some energy specialists suggest inviting China to join the International Energy Agency (IEA) to manage China's surging energy demand and maintain stability in world oil prices. Engaging China in the IEA mechanism could lessen Beijing's strategic vulnerability and discourage actions like hoarding oil. A multilateral safety net could deter China from hoarding oil, but there are concerns about admitting China to the IEA due to its political system. Suggestions include creating a mechanism for emerging markets, sponsoring oil stockpiles in regions of concern, or forming a regional energy coordination body. Some analysts propose an Asian version of the IEA to enhance energy cooperation in the region through information sharing, technology transfer, and strategic stockpile coordination. APEC could serve as a coordinating institution for developing energy security measures. Improved energy cooperation in northeast Asia could boost regional trade and economic growth with potential U.S. and international leadership required for shared infrastructure development. Under the Iran Sanctions Act, non-U.S. companies investing over $20 million annually in Iran or Libya could face sanctions, but ILSA has rarely been enforced. Billions have been invested in Iran's oil and gas sector without sanctions, mostly by European companies. The U.S. has the option to impose sanctions on companies involved in ongoing deals with Iran, but the Bush Administration is unlikely to do so."
