    "content": "The Act titled \"Incentivizing Offshore Wind Power Act\" introduces a new credit for qualifying offshore wind facilities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit aims to promote the development of offshore wind energy projects. The qualifying offshore wind facility credit under the Act is 30% of the qualified investment for eligible property placed in service during the taxable year. Definitions for this credit are provided in the section. The term 'qualifying offshore wind facility' refers to an offshore facility using wind to produce electricity in the inland navigable waters or coastal waters of the United States. Eligible property is defined as any property meeting specific criteria. Eligible property for the Qualifying Credit for Offshore Wind Facilities Program includes tangible personal property or other tangible property (excluding buildings) integral to the offshore wind facility, eligible for depreciation or amortization. The program must be established within 180 days of the enactment of the section by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and the Interior. The Qualifying Credit for Offshore Wind Facilities Program will be established by the Secretary of the Interior to award certifications for qualified investments eligible for credits. The total capacity for offshore facilities eligible for credits is limited to 3,000 megawatts. Applicants must submit required information for certification during the application period set by the Secretary. The Secretary establishes a program to certify qualifying offshore wind facilities. Applicants have 5 years from certification issuance to place the facility in service. Selection criteria include early service placement and technology that reduces costs or expands access to offshore wind. The Secretary may review and redistribute credits allocated for offshore wind facilities if there are insufficient qualifying applications or significant delays in facility completion. The Secretary can reallocate credits for offshore wind facilities if there are delays or insufficient applications. Upon certification, the applicant's identity and credit amount will be publicly disclosed. Double benefits are not allowed for the same facility. The Internal Revenue Code allows credits for facilities under certain conditions, including previous credits or grants. Amendments have been made to ensure compliance with the code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new item related to qualifying offshore wind facilities under section 48E. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new credit for offshore wind facilities, effective after the enactment of the Act."
