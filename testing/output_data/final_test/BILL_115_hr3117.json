    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act of 2017\". Congress finds that the social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide represent the hypothetical cost of 1 incremental ton of emissions in a given year. Circular A-4 guides Federal agencies on regulatory impact analysis. The social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, developed in 2009 by an interagency working group, fails to comply with the 3- and 7-percent discount rates prescribed by regulatory guidelines. The social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, developed in 2009, does not comply with the discount rates prescribed by regulatory guidelines. The evaluation of global effects should be reported separately from domestic costs and benefits. The estimates for social costs are used in Department of Energy rulemakings. The social cost of methane was used by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior in rulemakings without proper peer review or public comment. The Council on Environmental Quality issued final guidance directing Federal agencies to include the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analyses. Regulations from various departments are costing US families billions annually, largely due to the social cost of carbon. The social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide is used to justify regulations, but some argue it ignores sound science and hinders domestic fossil fuel energy production. Executive Orders aim to reduce regulatory burdens on the US population. The Executive Order dated March 31, 2017 disbands the interagency working group, withdraws the social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, and directs Federal agencies to follow Circular A-4 for evaluating only domestic effects of regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions. The Executive Order dated March 31, 2017 disbands the interagency working group, withdraws the social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, and directs Federal agencies to follow Circular A-4 for evaluating only domestic effects of regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions. Definitions are outlined in Section 3. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"social cost of carbon\" is defined as the estimated cost of carbon emissions as outlined in specific government documents. The social cost of carbon and methane are estimates of the monetized damages associated with carbon and methane emissions, as outlined in specific government documents. The social cost of methane refers to the estimated monetary damages associated with methane emissions, as detailed in specific government rules and regulatory impact analyses. The document provides standards for new, reconstructed, and modified sources, as well as an addendum on the social cost of methane and nitrous oxide published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases in August 2016. The social cost of nitrous oxide is the estimate of the damages associated with an increase in nitrous oxide emissions in a given year, as described in a specific document. The social cost of nitrous oxide is the estimate of damages linked to an increase in nitrous oxide emissions in a specific document, such as \"Methane and the Social Cost of Nitrous Oxide\" published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases in August 2016 or any related successor document. It also includes any other estimate of monetized damages from a rise in nitrous oxide emissions in a given year. PROHIBITION ON CONSIDERING THE SOCIAL COST OF GREENHOUSE GAS, INCLUDING CARBON, METHANE, AND NITROUS OXIDE. The Secretary of Energy, Administrator, Secretary of the Interior, and Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality are prohibited from considering the social cost of carbon, methane, or nitrous oxide in various actions, including cost-benefit analysis, rulemaking, guidance issuance, and other agency actions. The Secretary of Energy, Administrator, Secretary of the Interior, and Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality are restricted from using the social cost of carbon, methane, or nitrous oxide in any agency action unless explicitly authorized by law or using compliant estimates. The social cost of carbon, methane, or nitrous oxide cannot be used in agency actions unless authorized by law or using compliant estimates that meet specific requirements outlined in Circular A-4, including using discount rates of 3 and 7 percent, considering only domestic costs and benefits, and using up-to-date climate sensitivity distributions and realistic time horizons. SEC. 5. REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. The Administrator must submit a report within 120 days of the Act's enactment, detailing the use of social cost of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide in rulemakings and agency actions since January 2009."
