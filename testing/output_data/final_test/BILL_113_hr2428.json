    "content": "The Act titled \"Strengthen And Fortify Existing Bridges Act of 2013\" or \"SAFE Bridges Act of 2013\" provides assistance to states for rehabilitating or replacing certain bridges. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a program to assist States in rehabilitating or replacing eligible bridges within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Funds for the program will be apportioned to each State based on the total cost of rehabilitating or replacing structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges in that State compared to all States. The Secretary will categorize each structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridge. The Secretary of Transportation will categorize structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges into four categories for rehabilitation or replacement. The calculation will involve multiplying the deck area of bridges in each category by the respective unit. The Secretary determines total cost to rehabilitate or replace bridges in each State based on unit prices and latest available data, using existing inventories when possible. Funds apportioned to States must be used for rehabilitation and replacement. The program established for bridge rehabilitation and replacement must adhere to specific requirements, including not being transferable, following MAP-21 guidelines, and not being subject to limitations on obligations for Federal-aid highways. Additionally, bridges rehabilitated or replaced under this program must not be structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, or fracture critical upon completion. The Federal share of the cost for bridge rehabilitation and replacement projects is 100 percent. Unobligated funds after three fiscal years will be withdrawn and reapportioned to other states. Funding for the program should supplement, not supplant existing funds. The program supplements federal funding for bridge rehabilitation and replacement projects, ensuring it does not replace existing funds or obligations of states. The Secretary must report annually on funds obligated by each state for program projects. Definitions include a bridge on a public road, regardless of federal aid. An eligible bridge is defined as structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, or fracture critical. Fracture critical refers to a bridge with a steel member in tension that could cause collapse if failed. Functionally obsolete means a bridge no longer meeting current design standards for traffic demands. The curr_chunk defines terms related to bridge rehabilitation and replacement, including public road, rehabilitation, replacement, state, and structurally deficient. The term \"structurally deficient\" refers to a bridge with load-carrying elements in poor condition, low load capacity, or waterway issues causing traffic interruptions. $2,750,000,000 is authorized for bridge maintenance in fiscal years 2013 and 2014."
