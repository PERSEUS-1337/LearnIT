The Congress acknowledges the energy challenges facing the United States, emphasizing the importance of investing in research in physical science, engineering, and life sciences to meet national needs. The Department of Energy lacks mechanisms to quickly translate research results into practical technology. The Department of Defense has used DARPA since 1958 to address defense problems through research and technology development. The National Academy of Sciences recommends creating a new agency within the Department of Energy for transformative energy research. A new agency within the Department of Energy is recommended for transformative energy research to decrease dependence on foreign energy through targeted research and technology development. A new agency called Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy is proposed within the Department of Energy for transformative energy research and technology development. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) is established within the Department of Energy with the goal of reducing U.S. energy imports by 20% in the next 10 years through promoting revolutionary technologies, converting science into energy applications, and accelerating innovation in energy efficiency. ARPA-E will be led by a Director appointed by the Secretary of Energy. The Director of ARPA-E, appointed by the Secretary of Energy, is responsible for administering the Fund to award grants for energy-related research, development, testing, and commercial application of technologies. Program managers are designated for each program. Program managers are responsible for establishing research goals, soliciting applications, and selecting research projects for support under the program. The Secretary of ARPA-E is responsible for evaluating project proposals based on their novelty, scientific merit, and the capabilities of the applicants. They are also tasked with monitoring project progress. In terms of hiring, the Secretary has the authority to hire personnel for ARPA-E with appointments not exceeding 5 years. The Director of ARPA-E ensures coordination with other research agencies and may collaborate on projects. Employee appointments cannot exceed 5 years without an extension. The Energy Independence Acceleration Fund (referred to as the \"Fund\") is established in the Treasury and administered by the Director of ARPA-E. Appropriations of $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 up to $915,000,000 for fiscal year 2012 are authorized for the Fund. Recoupment is addressed in Section 4. The Secretary must establish procedures for recouping the Federal share of projects supported under the Act within 20 years of project completion. The Secretary can waive or defer recoupment if necessary for project viability. Revenue from recoupment is deposited into the Fund. Revenue generated from projects supported under this Act will be deposited into the Fund for future grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements as authorized by the Director. Definitions for terms like \"for-profit entity\" and \"product or invention supported by funding\" are provided in this section. The revenue from the sale or licensing of patents or rights related to a product or invention is included in the definition of \"product or invention.\" SEC. 5. ADVICE. The Director may seek advice from existing Department of Energy advisory committees or new advisory committees for ARPA-E programs. Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to ARPA-E advisory committees. The Director may also seek advice from the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy for Engineering, and other professional organizations. SEC. 6. ARPA-E EVALUATION. After 54 months of operation, the President's Committee on Science and Technology will evaluate ARPA-E to determine its effectiveness in achieving goals. The evaluation will recommend whether ARPA-E should continue or be terminated, and will share lessons learned with Congress and the public."
