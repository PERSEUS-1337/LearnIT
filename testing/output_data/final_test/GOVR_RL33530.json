The freeze excluded certain projects like housing units under construction, schools, synagogues, and infrastructure for national security. Secretary Clinton supported the proposal as a step towards peace through negotiations for a two-state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed a ten-month freeze on new permits and construction in Judea and Samaria (West Bank) in 2009 to aid in negotiations. Special Middle East Envoy George Mitchell noted that while the Israeli step falls short of a full settlement freeze, it is more than any Israeli government has done before. He mentioned that the number of buildings under construction will decline with the moratorium in place. Mitchell expressed a desire for a resolution on borders to address settlement construction issues. The Palestinians criticized Israel for not freezing all settlement activity or including Jerusalem. President Abbas criticized Israel for not freezing all settlement activity or including Jerusalem, describing it as \"insufficient\" and \"unacceptable.\" Israel announced plans to build 692 new housing units in East Jerusalem, which the White House opposed, stating that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through negotiations. The United States urged both parties to return to negotiations without preconditions to reach a mutually agreeable outcome for Jerusalem. President Abbas pledges to prevent a new intifadah and calls for international pressure on Israel. The Obama Administration aims to restart negotiations based on 1967 borders with demographic changes taken into account. Secretary Clinton works towards relaunching negotiations without preconditions for a two-state solution. The Palestinian goal is an independent state based on 1967 lines with agreed swaps, while the Israeli goal is a Jewish state with secure borders. Mitchell expressed hope for progress in political negotiations, security, and Palestinian economic growth. Netanyahu's 10-month settlement moratorium was seen as significant for Israeli security and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Mitchell emphasized the mutual reinforcement between Israeli security and the establishment of a Palestinian state. He proposed that negotiations should last no more than two years and mentioned a \"parallel process\" involving regional issues. He discouraged an Israeli-Hamas prisoner exchange, stating it would not build confidence in the Palestinian Authority. The United States can use its authority to influence Hamas's tactics by withholding support on loan guarantees to Israel. Mitchell clarified that this was not a threat but a way to persuade parties to act in their self-interest. Palestinian ideas for peace negotiations include a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital based on 1967 borders and a halt to Israeli settlement activity. President Abbas stated that negotiations could resume if Israel froze settlement expansions for a fixed period. He emphasized the need for a complete freeze on settlements before talks could proceed. Netanyahu proposed an Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley to prevent weapon infiltration, but Abbas insisted on a sovereign Palestinian state on all territories. Mitchell reiterated the Palestinian demand for a completely sovereign state on all territories with its own borders, resources, and airspace, without any Israeli presence. He continued to encourage negotiations and support Palestinian economic development. Netanyahu found Mitchell's ideas for restarting negotiations interesting, including confidence-building measures like Israeli forces withdrawal from more West Bank territory. Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel's commitment to settlements in the West Bank, declaring them as integral parts of the state and emphasizing their permanence. Abbas insisted on a complete halt to settlement activity before resuming negotiations at any level. President Obama reflected on the challenges in the Israel-Palestinian peace process, acknowledging the difficulty in getting both sides to engage in meaningful conversations due to political obstacles. He mentioned that raising expectations too high may have been a mistake. President Abbas also emphasized the importance of settlements in the West Bank for Israel's future arrangements. President Abbas stated that Jerusalem should not be divided and there should be free passage for people of various faiths. He emphasized the need to clarify ownership between Palestinians and Israel. Abbas mentioned he could only recognize Israel as a Jewish state in a conclusive peace agreement leading to a Palestinian state. He expressed reluctance to resume negotiations while construction in West Bank settlements and East Jerusalem continues. Abbas highlighted the importance of discussing Jerusalem, refugees, and the 1967 borders. He reported that the US had asked Israel to make gestures to Palestinians, such as transferring territories, halting military incursions, and releasing prisoners. Israel has not yet responded to Palestinian control demands in the West Bank, including halting military incursions, releasing prisoners, dismantling checkpoints, and allowing building materials into Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu is open to France mediating, criticizing Turkey's role. Syrian President Asad calls for France to support Turkey as mediator, rejecting direct talks with Israel. He urges an \"action plan\" from the United States to renew negotiations. On November 4, Israeli naval commandos seized a cargo vessel near Cyprus, claiming it was carrying weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. The ship was taken to Ashdod for inspection. Syria accused Israel of piracy, while Hezbollah denied any link to the weapons. On November 25, Lebanon's new cabinet recognized Hezbollah's right to engage in armed conflict with Israel. Arab-Israeli conflict has been a recurring issue since Israel's founding. The Arab-Israeli conflict has been ongoing since the founding of Israel in 1948, leading to multiple clashes and issues between the parties. The 1967 war resulted in Israel occupying territory from Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, while the 1973 war was fought by Egypt and Syria to regain their lands. In 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon to prevent terrorist attacks, leading to a withdrawal in 1985 but retaining a \"security zone\" that Lebanon wanted back. Middle East peace has been a diplomatic goal for the U.S. and international community throughout the years of conflict. Throughout the years of conflict, efforts have been made to achieve peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The 1978 Camp David talks led to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush outlined a peace framework based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The Oslo process began in 1991 and continued under President Clinton, who mediated various agreements. The United States played a significant role in Israeli-Palestinian talks, with Clinton leading negotiations at Camp David in 2000. The George W. Bush Administration initially had a less prominent role in the peace process, focusing on it mainly as part of the war on terrorism after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did not appoint a special envoy but personally mediated an accord in 2005 to reopen the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. In 2007, she engaged to garner support from moderate Sunni Arab governments against Iranian influence, viewing resolution of the Palestinian issue as crucial for regional stability. The United States took on a new role as a \"judge\" of parties' commitments to the two-state solution at the Annapolis Conference in 2007. Lt. Gen. William Fraser III was appointed to monitor compliance with commitments, but the trilateral mechanism barely functioned. Secretary of State-designate Hillary Rodham was confirmed in January 2009. At her January 13, 2009 confirmation hearing, Secretary of State-designate Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasized the importance of seeking a just and lasting peace agreement in the Gaza conflict. She stated that the United States would not negotiate with Hamas until it recognizes Israel, renounces violence, and abides by previous agreements. President Obama also reached out to key leaders in the region on his first day in office. President Obama, along with Secretary Clinton, appointed George Mitchell as Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, empowering him to speak for the White House and State Department. In his first TV interview with Al Arabiyah television, Obama expressed support for a contiguous Palestinian state with freedom of movement and economic opportunities. Mitchell's visit to Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia marked the beginning of active engagement in Arab-Israeli peace efforts. Senator Mitchell visited Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in January to listen to the region's leaders' views on an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. He expressed support for Egyptian efforts to form a Palestinian unity government with Fatah and Hamas, but noted that Hamas would need to meet certain demands. Secretary Clinton, during her visit to Israel and Ramallah, acknowledged Israel's concerns about rocket attacks and criticized Israel's plans to demolish 88 Palestinian homes in East. Secretary Clinton, during her visit to Ramallah, criticized Israel's plans to demolish 88 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem as \"unhelpful\" and emphasized the Administration's commitment to the two-state solution. President Obama expressed hope for gestures of good faith from all sides and described the U.S. role in facilitating an agreement. Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of Israel engaging in peace efforts with the Palestinians to receive strong support against Iran. Vice President Biden urged Israel to work towards a two-state solution and halt settlement construction. Senator Kerry highlighted the negative impact of settlements on a future Palestinian state and Israeli defense. The disagreement between Israeli and U.S. officials over a settlement freeze agreement reached in 2003 is causing tension. Israeli officials claim the agreement included no new communities, no appropriation of Palestinian lands for settlements, no building beyond existing community outlines, and no settlement incentives. Netanyahu's advisor, Dov Weissglas, insists on the existence of an oral agreement, but also acknowledges that settlements were to be restricted. Weissglas claims an oral agreement was recorded regarding settlements, but no joint U.S.-Israeli survey was conducted to demarcate a construction line. Secretary Clinton stated that informal agreements were not part of the official U.S. position, contradicting Israel's obligations under the Road Map. Abrams responded that Israel had withdrawn from Gaza and some West Bank settlements in exchange for U.S. agreement. President Obama stated that Israeli settlements violate agreements and hinder peace efforts. He emphasized the need for two states for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace. Senator Mitchell emphasized the intolerable situation for Palestinians and America's support for their aspirations. He addressed the controversy over settlements in Israel, highlighting the need for negotiations to resume promptly. The peace conference in 1991 had 14-member delegations representing parties, including a combined Jordanian/Palestinian delegation and an unofficial Palestinian advisory team. The goal was to create conditions for diplomatic progress. In November 1991, Israel and the Jordanian/Palestinian delegation agreed to separate negotiating tracks for interim Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Secret talks in Oslo produced a Declaration of Principles (DOP) signed by Israel and the PLO in September 1993, leading to incremental advances in the peace process. In July 2000, President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Barak, and PA Chairman Arafat held a summit at Camp David to reach a framework accord on final status issues. The major obstacle was Jerusalem, with Israel proposing to remain united under its sovereignty while offering control, not sovereignty, over East Jerusalem to Palestinians. Israel was willing to cede over 90% of the West Bank but wanted to annex settlements where 130,000 settlers lived. No final agreement was reached. In September 2000, Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount/Haram al Sharif, leading to Palestinian protests and the start of the second Palestinian intifadah. Barak resigned in December, triggering an early election for Prime Minister. President Clinton proposed a peace plan on December 23, suggesting Israel cede territory in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. Barak accepted the plan as a basis for further talks, while Arafat sought clarifications on key issues. The Israeli-Palestinian talks at Taba, Egypt addressed the division of East Jerusalem and refugees' right of return. Ariel Sharon, elected Prime Minister in 2001, vowed to retain united Jerusalem as Israel's capital and sought an interim agreement excluding Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, and a Palestinian state. Sharon proposed a disarmed Palestinian state on 42% of the West Bank. Sharon declared Israel's willingness to give Palestinians the possibility of a state, while President Bush mentioned the idea of a Palestinian state for the first time. President Bush acknowledged the idea of a Palestinian state, emphasizing Israel's right to exist. Efforts for peace were hindered by violence, with Israel blaming Arafat for attacks. Hamas carried out bombings, leading to doubts about reaching an accord. Israeli forces seized a Palestinian-commanded ship on January 3, 2002. On January 3, 2002, Israeli forces seized the Karine A, a Palestinian-commanded freighter, carrying 50 tons of Iranian-supplied arms. Secretary Powell stated that Arafat \"cannot engage with us and others in the pursuit of peace, and at the same time permit or tolerate continued violence and terror.\" Sharon believed pressure should be put on Arafat for an alternative Palestinian leadership to emerge. Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah called for \"full withdrawal from all occupied territories, in accord with U.N. resolutions, including Jerusalem, in exchange for full normalization of relations.\" The Arab League endorsed the idea with revisions on March 28, known as the \"Arab Peace Initiative.\" Sharon was willing to explore the idea but emphasized the importance of U.N. resolutions affirming Israel's right to \"secure and recognized borders.\" On March 27, Hamas carried out a deadly suicide bombing in Netanya, leading Israel to besiege Arafat's compound in Ramallah and take control of major Palestinian cities. President Bush called for new Palestinian leaders untainted by terror to establish a provisional state with pre-1967 borders. Israeli forces were urged to withdraw and settlement activity halted for progress towards peace. On April 14, Prime Minister Sharon acknowledged Israel's need to part with some historical Jewish sites, insisting on Palestinian recognition of the Jewish people's homeland rights and the abandonment of refugee return claims. Israel submitted 14 reservations on the Road Map, which was officially presented by the Quartet on April 30. Abbas accepted the Road Map, and on May 23, the Bush Administration supported Israel's concerns. On May 25, Sharon and his cabinet accepted steps in the Road Map with reservations after the United States acknowledged Israel's concerns. The next day, Sharon acknowledged the occupation of 3.5 million people is detrimental. On June 4, President Bush met Abbas and Sharon in Aqaba, where Abbas pledged peaceful means to achieve Palestinian goals and Sharon promised to remove unauthorized outposts in the West Bank. Hamas, PIJ, and Fatah declared suspensions of military operations against Israel in June. Israel and Palestinian factions declared truces, but both failed to fulfill each other's requests. Israel released prisoners, but a Hamas suicide bomber killed 22 in Jerusalem. Abbas cut ties with Hamas and sought Arafat's support against terrorists. Israel suspended talks, resumed targeted killings, and halted city transfers to Palestinian control. On September 6, Abbas resigned due to lack of support from Arafat, the United States, and Israel. On October 15, a bomb exploded under a U.S. vehicle in Gaza, killing three security guards. Palestinian authorities arrested members of Popular Resistance Committees, who were later released in April 2004. Discontent with government policy in Israel led to the signing of the Geneva Accord on December 1. Sharon announced on December 18 that Israel would unilaterally disengage from the Palestinians by redeploying forces and relocating settlements in Gaza. On February 13, 2004, the White House mentioned that an Israeli pullback could reduce friction, but a final settlement must be achieved through negotiations. Israeli missiles killed Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmed Yassin on March 22. President Bush and Sharon met on April 14, where the President welcomed Israel's plan to disengage from Gaza and reiterated the U.S. commitment to the Road Map. The President emphasized the need to consider existing major Israeli settlements and stated that a full return to the 1949 armistice lines is unrealistic. He also proposed settling Palestinian refugees in a Palestinian state instead of Israel. Sharon's disengagement plan involves settling Palestinian refugees in a Palestinian state, not in Israel, rejecting the \"right of return.\" He aims for a viable, contiguous, sovereign, and independent Palestinian state, independent of the Road Map. The security fence in the West Bank is deemed temporary and will not affect final status issues. Sharon intends to retain and strengthen certain West Bank settlements, which has been criticized by Palestinians. Israel committed to dismantling illegal settlement outposts, but some new outposts have since appeared. Israel's cabinet approved a compromise disengagement plan in 2004 to evacuate settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. The Israeli High Court upheld the right to build a security fence but ordered changes to protect Palestinian rights. The International Court of Justice deemed the wall illegal, and disengagement was seen as a way to freeze the political process. Yasir Arafat died on November 11, Mahmud Abbas became Chairman of the PLO and President of the PA on January 9, 2005. Secretary Rice visited Israel and the PA on February 7, praising Israel's disengagement decision and emphasizing the importance of Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation. Israel's cabinet adopted a plan on February 20. On February 20, Israel's cabinet adopted a revised route for the security fence closer to the pre-1967 border, taking about 7% to 8% of the West Bank including major settlement blocs. Israel's defense minister approved the building of 3,500 new housing units between Ma'ale Adumim and East Jerusalem, sparking criticism for potentially cutting off East Jerusalem from Palestinian territory and hindering a contiguous Palestinian state. President Bush expressed concern to Sharon about activities that could undermine final status negotiations. Sharon reiterated Israel's stance on major population centers remaining under Israeli control in any final status agreement, emphasizing the importance of contiguity between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem. President Bush emphasized the need for mutually agreed changes to the 1949 armistice lines and stressed the necessity of a viable two-state solution with contiguity in the West Bank and meaningful linkages between the West Bank and Gaza. He also stated that the barrier being built by Israel should serve as a security measure, not a political one. Abbas advocated for the pre-1967 war boundaries for a future state and criticized the construction of the wall. Palestine Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Netanya, killing 5 and injuring over 90. Hamas increased rocket attacks to show responsibility for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz stated Israel would keep certain settlement blocs and the Jordan Rift Valley. Israel evacuated settlements in Gaza and the northern West Bank. Sharon declared no further withdrawals. On August 29, Sharon announced no more disengagements and emphasized negotiations under the Road Map. Large settlement blocs would stay with Israel, but not all West Bank settlements. Hamas claimed responsibility for kidnapping and killing an Israeli settler on September 27, leading to Israeli airstrikes and arrests. President Bush urged Abbas to address armed gangs in Palestine on October 20. On October 26, a PIJ suicide bomber killed 6 and wounded more than 20 in Hadera, Israel. Sharon announced an offensive against terrorism and ruled out talks with Abbas until he takes \"serious action\" against armed groups. Secretary Rice visited Israel and the PA on November 14-15, where Sharon stated that Israel would not interfere if Hamas participated in the January 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, but warned that an armed terrorist organization in the Palestinian administration could end the Road Map. Rice vowed not to have contacts with an armed Hamas, even if it were part of the Palestinian administration. After Hamas's victories in December 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, speculation increased about possible effects on the peace process if Hamas were similarly successful in January 25, 2006, parliamentary elections. On December 28, the Quartet stated that a future Palestinian cabinet \"should include no member who has not committed to the principles of Israel's right to exist in peace and security and an unequivocal end to violence and terrorism.\" On January 11, 2006, Secretary Rice declared, \"It remains the view of the United States that there should be no place in the political. On January 4, 2006, Prime Minister Sharon suffered a stroke, and Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert became Acting Prime Minister. Olmert told President Bush that peace efforts couldn't progress if Hamas joined the Palestinian government. Hamas won the January 25 Palestinian parliamentary elections and is a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Olmert declared that Israel wouldn't negotiate with a Palestinian administration including an armed Hamas. President Bush declared that Israel would not negotiate with a Palestinian administration that included Hamas unless the organization disarmed, annulled its Covenant calling for Israel's destruction, and accepted previous agreements. The Quartet also stated that future assistance to any new Palestinian government would depend on its commitment to non-violence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas, in response, stated it would never recognize Israel but might consider a long-term truce under certain conditions. On February 8, Olmert mentioned Israel's move towards separation from Palestinians, aiming for permanent borders with a united Jerusalem, major settlement blocs, and the Jordan Valley. Hamas leaders vowed to strengthen the Authority on liberated land and continue resistance alongside politics. Olmert, after winning the March 28 elections, aimed for negotiations based on mutual agreements for a Jewish state with permanent borders. Haniyah called for negotiations based on mutual recognition, the Road Map principles, and a halt to violence. Hamas would not object to Abbas negotiating with Israel. Israeli security cabinet recommended severing ties with Hamas-led PA after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv. A suicide bombing in Tel Aviv killed 11 and wounded 60, including an American teenager. Abbas condemned the attack, while Hamas officials called it an act of \"self-defense.\" Abbas called for an immediate international peace conference with himself as the Palestinian negotiator. A new Israeli government took office with guidelines to shape the permanent borders of Israel as a democratic state with a Jewish majority. The PLO rejected the plan as undermining Palestinian rights to a state on all territories. Olmert's plan aimed to undermine Palestinian rights to a state on 1967 territories with Jerusalem as its capital. A \"National Accord Document\" was drafted by imprisoned Fatah, Hamas, and other officials, calling for a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, right of return for refugees, and release of prisoners. President Bush accepted Olmert's ideas for removing Israeli settlements as a potential pathway to a two-state solution. Hamas rejected the document due to implied recognition of pre-1967 Israel. Olmert presented ideas for a \"realignment\" in the West Bank to reduce friction between Israelis and Palestinians, ensure territorial contiguity for Palestinians, and guarantee Israel's security. Violence escalated between Gaza and Israel, with Hamas calling off its truce after civilian deaths from Israeli artillery fire. Olmert stated that Israel would never agree to withdraw from the entire West Bank. Israel will withdraw from approximately 90% of the West Bank and not all of Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods will be part of the future Jewish capital. Palestinian factions agreed on a revised National Accord Document on June 28, stating that negotiations for a state on territories occupied by Israel in 1967 will be led by the PLO and the President of the PA. The document also emphasized resistance in territories occupied in 1967 alongside political action, with a focus on establishing a national unity government. PIJ rejected the document, while Hamas officials clarified that it did not require them to recognize Israel or accept two states. Israel's Foreign Ministry noted the absence of mention regarding recognizing Israel's right to exist or ending. The Ministry criticized the Document for not acknowledging Israel's right to exist or resolving the conflict. Hamas, Popular Resistance Committees, and Army of Islam attacked Israeli forces, leading to the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit. Israel launched a rescue operation to retrieve him and weaken the Hamas-led government. On June 29, Israel arrested 64 Hamas officials in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Kidnappers demanded 1,000 prisoners for an Israeli soldier. Israeli forces targeted Hamas offices and tunnels in Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas fired rockets at Ashkelon, leading to prolonged Israeli actions. Diplomatic efforts were made to resolve the crisis. Hamas called for a prisoner swap, but Olmert rejected negotiations with Hamas, stating it would undermine moderates like President Abbas. The White House condemned Hamas for violence, Israel defended itself with an incursion into Beit Hanoun, resulting in casualties. An artillery barrage by Israel caused international outcry. A cease-fire agreement was reached between Olmert and Abbas in Gaza, reducing rocket fire. Olmert proposed a new Palestinian government to implement the Quartet's principles and release a kidnapped soldier. On January 9, 2007, the Egyptian Foreign Minister asserted the need for an agreement on the \"end game\" before resuming the Road Map. Secretary Rice planned to discuss this broad issue. Secretary Rice planned to discuss \"the broad issues on the horizon\" with Olmert and Abbas before resuming the Road Map. Abbas designated Haniyah to form a new unity government, calling on him to respect international resolutions and agreements. The Mecca Accord aimed to unite Palestinian factions and did not refer to Israel or the Quartet's demands. Olmert stated Israel's boycott of the Palestinian government until it met Quartet's demands, stopped rocket attacks, and released Shalit. Contact with moderates was conditional, while negotiations with Abbas were rejected to prevent freeing Hamas from recognizing Israel. Olmert acknowledged some positivity in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative and expressed readiness for the Saudi Initiative. The Palestinian unity government formed on March 15 confirmed the people's right of resistance, respect for international resolutions, and readiness to negotiate with Israel. Prime Minister Haniyah pledged to establish an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, while Hamas refused to recognize Israel's right to exist alongside it. The Israeli cabinet voted to shun the new Palestinian government until it met the Quartet's demands, while the Bush Administration decided to deal with individuals in the PA government on a case-by-case basis. The Arab summit reiterated adherence to the Arab Peace Initiative and called for direct negotiations on all tracks. Israel expressed interest in pursuing dialogue with Arab states for peace. In response to the Arab League's working group designating Egypt and Jordan to contact Israel, Prime Minister Olmert welcomed the Arabs' change in outlook towards recognizing Israel. Factional fighting in Gaza between Fatah and Hamas escalated, leading to Hamas gaining control of the Gaza Strip by June 14, 2007. President Abbas declared a state of emergency, dissolved the unity government, and appointed Salam Fayyad as prime minister, while Hamas disputed the legitimacy of these actions. On June 18, President Bush expressed willingness to restart peace talks with Abbas, supported by Israeli officials. On June 25, Olmert, Abbas, Mubarak, and Abdullah II met in Egypt. Abbas urged Olmert to begin serious negotiations, but Olmert only agreed to biweekly meetings to discuss a Palestinian state. On June 27, the Quartet appointed Tony Blair as their Representative to assist Palestinians in building institutions and the economy. On July 16, Olmert and Abbas met in Jerusalem to work on an \"agreement on principles\" for a Palestinian state. Olmert favored leaving final status issues for later, while Abbas wanted to address them first. Olmert warned against a Fatah-Hamas unity government, and new Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad presented a program for statehood without armed struggle. President Bush promised to support PA reforms to pave the way for serious negotiations for a Palestinian state, calling for an international meeting of nations supporting a two-state solution. Olmert and Abbas attempted to establish principles for a two-state solution but failed to do so before a U.S.-initiated international meeting in Annapolis. They agreed to set up negotiating teams for a two-state solution on September 10. On September 10, negotiating teams were set up for a two-state solution and ministerial committees for security, communications, economic cooperation, water rights, and environmental issues. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and former Prime Minister Ahmad Quray were appointed to head the teams. Secretary Rice described Annapolis as a meeting to rally around a two-state solution and support Palestinian institutions and economic development, excluding Hamas from the process. Olmert called Annapolis a short international meeting to encourage the peace process with the Palestinians. On October 15, Olmert suggested questioning Israel retaining outlying Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem, preparing for concessions and raising the sensitive issue of \"dividing\" Jerusalem. He stated that a freeze on all building in the West Bank was not required by the Road Map but Israel would not build new settlements or expropriate land, adhering to a policy of allowing settlers to build within existing settlement borders. At the Annapolis Conference, President Bush outlined a plan for negotiations between Olmert and Abbas to reach a peace treaty by the end of 2008. The parties committed to implementing the Road Map and continuing negotiations until a peace treaty is reached, with the United States monitoring progress. The United States would monitor and judge fulfillment of Road Map commitments and lead a tripartite U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian mechanism to follow up on implementation. Israel succeeded in making implementation of any peace treaty dependent upon the Road Map and avoiding a rigid timetable. Palestinians obtained a one-year target date for final status negotiations and involved the United States as a \"judge\" of commitments. General James L. Jones (Ret.) was appointed as special envoy for Middle East security to oversee security issues for Israelis and Palestinians. He was tasked with creating a new U.S. security assistance plan for the PA. Israel's decision to build 307 new housing units in Har Homa, East Jerusalem, sparked controversy, with the PA condemning it and Secretary Rice criticizing the move. On December 30, Prime Minister Olmert directed his ministers to seek authorization for settlement activities in the West Bank. The order excluded construction already approved, Jerusalem, and major settlement blocs. Israeli Housing Minister unveiled plans to build 1,120 new apartments in East Jerusalem, which was condemned by Palestinians. President Bush visited Israel and the PA, stating that any peace agreement would require adjustments to the armistice lines of 1949. President Bush visited Israel and the PA, stating that adjustments to the armistice lines of 1949 are necessary for a viable Palestinian state. New international mechanisms, including compensation, are needed to resolve the refugee issue. Jerusalem remains a challenging issue for peace. Olmert emphasized the difficulty of reaching peace while facing terror from Gaza and opposed the idea of two separate Palestinian states. On January 3, 2008, militants fired a Katyusha rocket from Gaza into Ashkelon. Israeli forces killed 19 Palestinians in Gaza on January 15, leading to international condemnation. Defense Minister Barak closed border crossings into Gaza, causing a major electricity shortage. Despite pressure, Hamas continued to launch rockets into Israel. On January 23, thousands of Palestinians crossed into Egypt from Gaza after Hamas militants breached the border wall. Israeli officials were concerned about weapons entering Gaza and called for Egypt to regain control. Egypt aimed to restore the 2005 agreement for the Rafah crossing. Abbas offered his guards for border control, but Hamas wanted a new Palestinian-Egyptian arrangement without Israeli involvement. Talks between Abbas and Hamas were stalled over control of Gaza and early elections. Egypt resealed the border on February 3 after refusing to hand over control to Hamas. On February 4, a suicide bombing in Dimona by Hamas militants led to one death and 23 injuries. Israel retaliated with airstrikes killing nine Hamas militants. Olmert suggested negotiating over borders to avoid an impasse, delaying talks on Jerusalem. Hamas breached the border with Egypt on January 23, leading to concerns about weapons entering Gaza. Egypt resealed the border on February 3. On March 6, an Arab resident of East Jerusalem killed eight students and wounded nine at a rabbinical seminary in West Jerusalem.

A rocket landed in Ashkelon, injuring over 30 people, with PIJ and Popular Resistance Committees claiming responsibility. Negotiations on core issues were ongoing between Abbas and Olmert. On April 18, Olmert mentioned minor gaps with Abbas except for Jerusalem, deferred for later. On May 6, PLO claimed wide gaps on all issues. On May 14, Olmert emphasized the need for an \"understanding\" on borders, refugees, and security, with Jerusalem to be addressed later. Egypt mediated talks for a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas regarding Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza. On June 19, a six-month cease-fire took effect between Israel and Hamas, with negotiations on a prisoner exchange stalling. The truce was breached on June 24 when the PIJ fired rockets into Israel, leading to temporary closures of commercial crossings by Israel in response. On July 28, Olmert stated that reaching a comprehensive agreement in 2008 was impossible due to difficulties with negotiations on Jerusalem. He mentioned that agreement on other issues was possible, suggesting a clause for dealing with Jerusalem in 2009. Abbas rejected any agreement excluding Jerusalem. Olmert later admitted that Israel would need to give up most of the West Bank and divide Jerusalem for peace. Abbas disclosed that Israel offered a 6.8% land swap for 5.5% but rejected offers leading to fragmented land areas and loss of water resources. On October 26, Tzipi Livni reported inability to form a new coalition government, leading to early national elections in Israel on February 10, 2009. Israeli troops entered Gaza on November 4 to eliminate a tunnel threat, killing seven Palestinian militants. Hamas responded with rocket attacks, leading to the expiration of a truce on December 19. Israel launched Operation Cast Lead on December 27 with an air offensive.

The campaign expanded to include various Hamas support sites like mosques, universities, and weapons caches, with a focus on destroying tunnels used for smuggling arms. Prime Minister Olmert outlined conditions for a ceasefire on January 4, including an end to rocket attacks and Hamas's military buildup. Israel initiated Operation Cast Lead on December 27 to target Hamas facilities in Gaza and dismantle their terrorist infrastructure. Prime Minister Olmert outlined conditions for a ceasefire on January 4, including an end to rocket attacks and Hamas's military buildup. Hamas demanded a halt to Israel's aggression, withdrawal of forces from Gaza, lifting of the siege, and opening of all crossings. The Bush Administration supported Israel's actions, with Secretary Rice holding Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and President Bush calling the rocket attacks an act of terror. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1860 on January 8, with the U.S. abstaining. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1860 on January 8, calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Despite the resolution, Prime Minister Olmert stated that Israel would continue its operation due to the ongoing rocket attacks from Palestinian groups.

The Senate agreed to the Conference Report on February 13, 2008, by a vote of 51-45, clearing the bill for the White House. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, CIA Director Michael Hayden, and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell presented evidence to congressional committees about a nuclear reactor in Syria built with North Korea's assistance. They expressed concerns about the reactor's potential to produce nuclear material for weapons. Experts suggested that the inability to identify a source of fuel raised questions about the operational status of the reactor and whether it was part of a weapons program. Damascus denied U.S. involvement in a strike on the site and has restricted access to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Inspectors found traces of man-made uranium at the facility, raising concerns about its nuclear activities. The Human Rights Council's Gaza Fact-Finding Mission, led by Judge Richard Goldstone, reported serious violations of international law by Israel and Hamas during the 2008-2009 conflict. The report accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, while also finding evidence of war crimes by Palestinian armed groups. The Mission called for credible investigations by Israel and Hamas, with potential referral to the International Criminal Court if no action is taken within six months. Israel is not a member of the ICC. Israel rejected the idea of a special investigation by the International Criminal Court prosecutor in the Hague, criticizing the report for ignoring its right to self-defense and making unsubstantiated claims. They also accused the report of ignoring Hamas's strategy of operating within civilian populations and stated that allowing the report to set a precedent would threaten countries' ability to defend against terrorism. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to prevent Israeli officials from going to the Hague in response to criticism from the U.S. State Department regarding the focus on Israel in a recent report. PA President Abbas faced backlash for initially delaying action on the report, leading to accusations of betrayal. The U.N. Human Rights Council and General Assembly adopted the report, with the U.S. voting against the recommendation. The United States voted against condemning Israel in U.N. bodies, criticizing the focus on Israel over Hamas. Security Council unlikely to get involved due to opposition from permanent members. U.S. State Department criticized the Report's bias towards Israel. Ambassador Rice expressed concerns about the unbalanced mandate. Assistant Secretary Posner encouraged Israel to conduct domestic reviews. The United States criticized the Goldstone Report as biased and unworthy of consideration. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu warned that the report could halt the peace process. The House of Representatives passed a resolution supporting Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza. H.Res. 130, introduced in 2009, supports Israel's right to defend itself and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and backs the appointment of George Mitchell as Special Envoy for Middle East Peace."
