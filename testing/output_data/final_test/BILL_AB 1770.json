    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Department of Social Services will establish a Food Assistance Program using federal SNAP coupons for eligible individuals. Those already receiving CalFresh and CalWORKs benefits by September 1, 1998, will have their eligibility determined without a new application by November 1, 1998. Noncitizens eligible for the Food Assistance Program must meet federal SNAP criteria from August 21, 1996, but are ineligible for benefits due to their immigration status under Public Law 104-193 and subsequent amendments. Noncitizens eligible for the Food Assistance Program must meet federal SNAP criteria from August 21, 1996, but are ineligible for benefits due to their immigration status under Public Law 104-193 and subsequent amendments. A noncitizen can qualify for aid if they are a battered immigrant spouse or child, a Cuban or Haitian entrant, or lawfully present in the US. Applicants who entered the US after August 22, 1996, can receive aid if their sponsor has died or is disabled. Noncitizens eligible for the Food Assistance Program must meet federal SNAP criteria from August 21, 1996, but are ineligible for benefits due to their immigration status under Public Law 104-193 and subsequent amendments. An applicant who entered the US on or after August 22, 1996, can receive aid under certain conditions, including being a victim of abuse by the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse. Verification of meeting specific conditions is required for eligibility. Abuse for eligibility under the Food Assistance Program is defined as in Section 11495.1 and Section 11495.12. A victim's sworn statement of abuse, supported by additional evidence like police records or physical evidence, is sufficient to establish abuse. Physical evidence of abuse is required for eligibility under the Food Assistance Program. If the victim cannot provide additional evidence, a sworn statement may suffice if the county deems the applicant credible. In approved counties, the same benefit issuance system applies. Income, resources, and expenses of certain individuals are excluded when calculating CalFresh benefits. The household cannot receive more benefits if a member is ineligible under Title IV of Public Law 104-193. Reimbursement for mandated costs in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts by the Commission on State Mandates according to the Government Code."
