    "content": "Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, concerns were raised about the 19 terrorists who entered the US on temporary visas. The 9/11 Commission recommended revisions to visa policy and immigration control to enhance national security. The State Department's consular officers were not fully involved in counterterrorism efforts before 9/11, highlighting the need for changes in border security measures. The urgency of implementing legislative provisions on visa policy and immigration control enacted by Congress several years ago has led to concerns about visa processing delays. Visa applicants often face extensive wait times for interviews, raising questions about the sufficiency of resources and staff to manage visa issuances in the post-September 11 world. Foreign nationals wishing to come to the United States generally need to obtain a visa for admission, with the Department of State (DOS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Justice (DOJ) playing key roles in administering the law and policies on alien admission. DOS's Bureau of Consular Affairs (Consular Affairs) is the agency responsible for visa issuance. The Department of State (DOS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Justice (DOJ) play key roles in administering laws and policies on alien admission. DOS's Bureau of Consular Affairs issues visas, DHS's Citizenship and Immigration Services approves immigrant petitions, and DHS's Bureau of Customs and Border Protection inspects people entering the United States. DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review makes adjudicatory decisions on immigration cases. The report discusses visa issuances, procedures for aliens living permanently or temporarily in the US, visa screening policies, inadmissibility, databases, visa refusals, biometric visas, and other major visa policy procedures. Selected issues in the 110th Congress are also analyzed, including new technologies, impact on travel and commerce. The 110th Congress addressed issues such as new technologies, travel and commerce impact, and security concerns. Visa policies for immigrants and nonimmigrants, as well as humanitarian admissions, asylum, and refugee status are covered under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Illegal aliens are those who entered the US without inspection or violated visa terms. Visa requirements are outlined in \u00a7222 of the INA. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines visa requirements in \u00a7222, with detailed application processes for permanent residents compared to visitors. The visa application process is similar to IRS tax forms, with simpler cases requiring fewer forms. There are over 70 USCIS and DOS forms related to visa issuance. Aliens wishing to live permanently in the United States must meet specific criteria outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). They must qualify based on various relationships or exceptional abilities, and petitions for immigrant status are filed with USCIS by sponsoring relatives or employers. If the immigrant is already in the U.S., USCIS handles the process known as \"adjustment of status.\" The USCIS manages the \"adjustment of status\" process for aliens residing in the United States. If the alien is abroad, the petition is sent to Consular Affairs. LPRs often adjust status within the U.S. rather than getting visas from Consular Affairs. A personal interview is required, and the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for the visa type. Aliens seeking to come to the United States temporarily are known as nonimmigrants and are admitted for a specific reason. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories with 70 specific types currently issued. Most visa categories are defined in the INA and referred to by a letter and numeral, such as B-2 for tourists or E-2 for treaty investors. Nonimmigrants must prove eligibility for specific visa types, like B-2 tourists or H-1B workers. They must show they are not coming to live permanently in the US. Consular officers and CBP inspectors verify nonimmigrant status. The law exempts certain nonimmigrant visa holders from proving they are not coming to live permanently in the US. USCIS and CBP determine eligibility for H and L visas. Changing nonimmigrant categories requires filing a change of status application with USCIS. Personal interviews are usually required for nonimmigrant visa applicants, but waivers may be granted in some cases. After September 11, 2001, personal interviews for B visitor visas increased significantly for national security reasons. The requirements for personal interviews were officially tightened in July 2003, narrowing the class of nonimmigrants eligible for waivers. Waivers were previously granted to children under 16, individuals over 60, diplomats, visa renewals within 12 months, and special cases. Nonimmigrant visas issued abroad decreased to 4.9 million in FY2003 from a peak of 7.6 million in FY2001, with 5.4 million visas issued in FY2005. Immigrant visas remained steady at about 0.4 million annually. The growth in nonimmigrant visas in the late 1990s was due to border crossing cards for Canada and Mexico residents and temporary worker visa increases. Tourism and business visitors made up the largest group of nonimmigrant visas in FY2005, totaling 3.7 million. In FY2005, nonimmigrant visas decreased to 3.7 million from 5.7 million in FY2000. Temporary workers accounted for 17% and students/cultural exchange for 9.4% of visas. USCIS reported 33.7 million nonimmigrant entries in FY2000, 27.9 million in FY2002, and 32.0 million in FY2005. Most visitors enter the US without visas through the Visa Waiver Program for 27 countries. The Visa Waiver Program allows aliens to enter the US without visas, with CBP inspectors responsible for background checks. Exceptions to visa requirements can be made in certain cases. All aliens must undergo reviews by DOS consular officers and CBP inspectors to ensure eligibility for visas or admission. To ensure eligibility for visas or admission, aliens must meet criteria outlined in the INA, including health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, labor certification, and immigration violations. Family-based and employment-based immigrants need affidavits of support. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants, with records dating back to the mid-1990s. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) stores photographs and fingerprints of visa applicants since 2001. It links with other databases to flag potential issues and consular officers check backgrounds in lookout databases like CLASS and TIPOFF. The Terrorist Exclusion List (TEL) includes names of individuals associated with terrorist organizations. Suspect names are sent to the FBI for a name check program called Visa Condor. Visa Condor is a name-check program part of the Security Advisory Opinion system that refers selected visa cases for further review by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. It screens visa applicants for access to controlled technologies and refers foreign nationals from countries of concern like China, India, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, and Syria as part of Visa Mantis to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems. The Visa Mantis program aims to prevent the transfer of arms and sensitive items to terrorist states and maintain U.S. advantages in critical military technologies. Checks are conducted by the Bureau of Nonproliferation in coordination with the FBI and other agencies. Efforts have shifted towards an interoperable system for checking suspect names, with plans for seamless electronic transmission of visa data among Foreign Service posts and Washington agencies. The Consular Consolidated Database will improve data integrity and accountability in processing immigrant petitions. In FY2000, FY2002, and FY2005, a total of 67,269, 40,606, and 38,434 immigrant petitioners were refused on exclusionary grounds. Reasons for refusal included public charge concerns, lack of proper labor certification, and prior violations of immigration law. In FY2005, 270,615 immigrant petitions were rejected by DOS due to visa application noncompliance, with \u00a7221(g) noncompliance being a common reason. Nonimmigrant petitions had refusals mainly for previous immigration law violations and criminal law violations. Orders of removal from the United States were also a leading ground for refusals. The primary reason for denying nonimmigrant visas was the alien not being qualified for the visa. The DOS data presented above understate the number and distribution of aliens denied admission to the United States. Biometric identifiers are now used in all visas issued by the United States for entry-exit system purposes. The US-VISIT system scans fingerprint images of aliens upon arrival in the United States. Consular officers and the Secretary of State have the authority to revoke visas if the alien is ineligible or has violated visa conditions. The Foreign Affairs Manual instructs consular officers to seek advisory opinions when new information arises after visa issuance. The Foreign Affairs Manual instructs consular officers to seek advisory opinions for findings of ineligibility under certain categories. The Department of State may prudentially revoke visas as a safety precaution with a low threshold of national security information. The U.S. General Accounting Office identified problems in visa revocations post-9/11. The GAO found issues with visa revocations post-9/11, including lack of communication between FBI and INS, failure to post \"lookouts\" for suspected terrorists, and foreign nationals entering the US with revoked visas. DOS argued not all revoked visas were related to terrorism, citing mistaken identity or clarifiable information. The Department of State (DOS) has implemented a revocation code to address issues with visa revocations post-9/11. Consular officers re-issue visas and remove names from the lookout system when necessary. The revocation code, established in December 2002, ensures proper coding and entry into relevant systems for law enforcement access. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau disputed GAO's findings, stating that follow-up investigations were conducted for all visa revocations related to national security. The GAO conducted follow-up investigations in all 10 cases related to visa revocations for national security reasons. They found weaknesses in the visa revocation process, especially in the timely transmission of information among federal agencies. The Department of State's current visa revocation certificate only becomes effective upon the alien's departure from the United States, hindering immediate action by DHS officials for removal proceedings. The Senate debated comprehensive immigration reform in 2007, with amendments limiting judicial review of visa revocation. The legislation implementing 9/11 Commission recommendations focused on technology improvements for document authentication and detecting potential terrorists. Since 9/11, concerns have been raised about terrorists entering the US legally on temporary visas. Congress has enacted laws to improve information sharing among DHS, DOS, and DOJ databases to combat terrorist travel. The integration of these databases into the US-VISIT system is crucial for detecting potential threats. Some argue that effective implementation of provisions for sharing intelligence and coordinating activities among agencies involved in admitting aliens is crucial for U.S. immigration policy to enhance homeland security. Concerns have been raised about the inadequacy of visa applicant checks in non-interoperable databases, emphasizing the need for a real-time interagency database accessible to consular officers, immigration inspectors, and law enforcement officials. However, others highlight the challenges of developing interoperable databases, citing cost, time, and complexity as barriers. Some argue that the success of an interoperable database for screening aliens depends on 100% inclusion of visa applicants, but the complexity and cost of developing such a system pose implementation challenges. Concerns also exist about the potential breach of national security if intelligence data becomes too accessible across agencies. The Visa and Passport Security Program, established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, aims to target and disrupt individuals involved in fraudulent visa and passport activities. Oversight and integration with other federal agencies remain issues, with a 2005 GAO report highlighting vulnerabilities in the Department of State's consular processes. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security substantiated 28 visa malfeasance cases between 2001 and 2004. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security confirmed 28 visa malfeasance cases involving U.S. employees between 2001 and 2004. Concerns have been raised about a perceived slowdown in visa issuances, with estimates suggesting that visa problems have cost U.S. exporters $30.7 billion since July 2002. Business representatives are worried about delays caused by security checks like the Visa Mantis and Visa Condor programs, which could strain international business relationships. The alleged problem of visa issues affecting international business relationships extends beyond bringing foreign workers to the U.S. It also impacts companies employing nonimmigrants renewing visas, foreign customers visiting for business purposes, and attendees of conferences and trade shows. Some argue that the impact of stricter visa policies on business has been exaggerated. The impact of stricter visa policies on business has been exaggerated, with problems arising due to new screening procedures and databases not being fully operational. Visa reforms are deemed essential for national security, and business-related travel is expected to normalize once everyone is familiar with the new procedures. Speculation suggests that travel concerns post-9/11 and the U.S. economic slowdown were key factors in the reduction of nonimmigrant visas issued in FY2002 and FY2003, with an upturn seen in visas issued over FY2004 and FY2005. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visas Services Tony Edson addressed these concerns during a 2006 hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Governmental Reform, emphasizing the commitment to meeting security needs while maintaining openness. The Department of State recognizes the economic benefits of international visitors, with travel and tourism contributing $104.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2005. International students also contributed $13 billion in revenues. However, there were significant delays in visa processing reported by the GAO, with 97 out of 211 visa-issuing posts experiencing wait times of 30 days or more from September 2005 to February 2006. In 2006, visa processing delays were reported at 97 out of 211 posts, with wait times exceeding 30 days for the entire 6-month period. Deputy Assistant Secretary Edson addressed Congress, noting the impact of post-9/11 visa security requirements on consular workloads. Progress was reported in managing visa demand in India and China through increased staffing and space. Congressional oversight remains ongoing, with plenary authority over immigration policy vested in the legislative branch. The 107th Congress enacted major laws with significant revisions to visa policy administration and issuances, including the USA PATRIOT Act which expanded the definition of terrorism and improved the visa issuance process by mandating data sharing for consular officers. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 aimed to improve visa issuance procedures, including the requirement for machine-readable passports for aliens applying under the Visa Waiver Program. The Border Security and Visa Reform Act also mandated the development of an electronic data system for sharing information on alien admissibility and removability. The Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 required biometric identifiers on visas issued by October 2004 and expanded training for consular officers. It also mandated VWP countries to certify the issuance of tamper-resistant, machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers. Additionally, VWP countries must report theft of blank passports to avoid removal from the program. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the DHS to oversee visa issuances and border security. A memorandum of understanding between DOS and DHS was signed in 2003 to define their working relationship. Legislation in the 108th Congress addressed 9/11 Commission findings and recommendations. The 9/11 Commission report highlighted failures in visa and immigration inspections that contributed to the terrorist attacks. It emphasized missed opportunities to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities, including watchlisting known operatives, detecting fraudulent passports, and identifying suspicious indicators of extremism. Border security was not considered a national security matter before 9/11. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized the importance of implementing legislative provisions on visa policy and immigration control to enhance national security. It recommended targeting terrorist travel as a powerful weapon and integrating the U.S. border security system into a larger network of screening points. The Department of Homeland Security, with support from Congress, should quickly implement a biometric entry-exit screening system to prevent terrorists from entering the country. Collaboration with other governments is essential for meeting this obligation. Other 9/11 Commission recommendations, particularly regarding intelligence policy, have received attention. The Commission also addressed immigration issues in a separate report. Legislation implementing these recommendations is being considered. The 9/11 Commission recommendations led to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which included provisions on visa issuances. The Act expanded terror-related grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, such as receiving military training from a designated terrorist organization. Other provisions included acquiring technologies like biometrics to detect potential terrorist indicators on travel documents. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included provisions to establish an Office of Visa and Passport Security to target fraudulent production and use of visas and passports. It also clarified that all nonimmigrant visa applications are reviewed by consular officers and assigned anti-fraud specialists to high-risk posts. The Visa and Passport Security Program was established to combat fraudulent documents, with provisions for increased consular officers and improved training to detect terrorist indicators. Concerns were raised about the lack of personal interviews for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Some advocate for efficiency in visa processing through limited personal interviews, while critics argue it compromises national security. The Department of State's regulations on increasing interview requirements have raised concerns about visa wait times. Proposed bills aimed to mandate interviews for all visa applicants. The personal interview requirement for nonimmigrant visas applies to certain age groups and specific cases, with provisions to ensure all applications are reviewed by a consular officer. Additionally, anti-fraud specialists are stationed at diplomatic and consular offices. The legal process for removing aliens with revoked visas is a contentious issue. Some argue for immediate deportation upon visa revocation, while others suggest amending the grounds for removal to include visa revocation. There are differing opinions on whether aliens with revoked visas should have a hearing before an immigration judge. Legislation was introduced to make visa revocation unreviewable and grounds for deportation. Anecdotal cases suggest alien screening databases are not precise enough for removal without a hearing. The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2003 aimed to broaden security and terrorism grounds for inadmissibility, excluding aliens involved in torture or extrajudicial killings abroad. It also allowed for the removal of aliens already in the US on these grounds. Limited judicial review of removal was permitted if visa revocation was the sole basis for removal. The Bush Administration sought extensions for installing biometric readers/scanners required by the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. The 108th Congress enacted P.L. 108-299 to extend deadlines for equipment capable of processing machine-readable, tamper-resistant entry and exit documents. Legislation in the 109th Congress revisited immigration and document-security issues, including the REAL ID Act of 2005 and the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611) aimed to revise visa policies, while the REAL ID Act (P.L. 109-13, Division B) expanded terrorism-related grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportation. The REAL ID Act expanded terrorism-related grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportation, giving authority to waive certain provisions. H.R. 4437 aimed to authorize denial of admission to nationals of countries that delay accepting their citizens ordered removed. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 proposed changes to immigration policies, including denying admission to nationals of uncooperative countries and expanding grounds for inadmissibility and deportation. S. 2611 proposed expanding terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility to include any incitement or advocacy of terrorist activity."
