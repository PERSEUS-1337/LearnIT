    "content": "The development of high-dimensional generative models, like variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial neural networks, has sparked interest. A focus is on generating samples of objects from different views using structured latent spaces. The model considers two independent latent factors: content and view. This disentangled latent space approach allows for realistic sample generation across various object views. Unlike many multi-view approaches, this model offers unique capabilities. Our model for multi-view learning does not require supervision on views, only on content. It can handle problems with a large number of categories and has been tested on four image datasets, showing effectiveness and generalization ability. The model aims to develop predictive models for multiple views of the same object using deep learning approaches. Recent research in multi-view learning has focused on identifying factors of variations from multiview datasets. The approach involves considering data samples as a mix of content information (e.g. class label) and view information (e.g. exposure, viewpoint). Various methods have been proposed to disentangle content from view in deep learning architectures. Various models have been proposed to disentangle content from view in deep learning architectures, allowing for applications like predicting object appearance under different viewpoints and image editing while preserving content. Existing generative approaches often have limitations in considering discrete views with binary/categorical attributes. In this paper, the focus is on learning generative models that utilize a disentangled latent space where content and view are encoded separately. The proposed approach involves learning from multi-view datasets without view information, allowing for the generation of diverse views. The paper focuses on generative models that learn from multi-view datasets without view information. It introduces a Generative Multi-view Model (GMV) and a conditional extension (C-GMV) to generate objects under various views and a large number of views for any input object, respectively. The paper introduces a new generative model based on GANs for conditional multi-view generation. It focuses on generating data with diverse content and views, showcasing realistic samples and view diversity across different image datasets. The paper presents a generative multiview model inspired by GANs and their conditional variant. It details the proposal for the model and its conditional extension, along with experimental results on generative tasks. The model generates samples on 3DChairs and CelebA datasets with diverse content and views. A GAN uses a generator function G to create a distribution pG on X from a latent space Rn with prior distribution pz(z). It also employs a discriminator function D to differentiate between real and fake inputs, both implemented with neural networks. The objective function minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence between pG* and the empirical data distribution px, allowing GAN to estimate complex continuous data distributions. A conditional version of GAN (CGAN) has been proposed to implement a conditional distribution p(x|y) using pairs of inputs/conditions (x, y) where x is a target and y is the condition. The generator function G takes noise vector z and condition y to generate a target x. The discriminator in a CGAN distinguishes between fake and real input/target pairs based on the empirical distribution. The objective function minimizes the difference between the generated distribution and the empirical data distribution. In a conditional GAN (CGAN), the distribution p * G fits the true empirical conditional distribution of input/target pairs. However, CGAN tends to collapse data distribution modes in high-dimensional spaces, often generating x based solely on condition y. This results in a lack of diversity in produced targets. The multi-view setting considers data samples driven by content factor c and view factor v. In a multi-view setting, the focus is on controlling intrinsic features (c) and transient features (v) independently to generate different views of the same object or the same view of different objects. This involves sampling over X by estimating p(x|c, v) from a training set. Another objective is conditional multi-view generation, where diverse views of a given object can be sampled. The objective is to sample different views of an object by learning generative models that encode content and view factors separately. This allows for control over sampling on both axes. The novelty lies in learning these models without using view labeling information. The objective is to learn a generator that can sample different views of an object by encoding content and view factors separately. This involves using prior distributions over content and view factors, and a generator G that implements a distribution over samples x. The goal is for the generator to produce samples where the first input corresponds to the content and the second input captures the view. The objective is to control the output sample of the generator by tuning its content or view factors. Learning G using a standard GAN approach may not accurately disentangle the latent space. A novel approach focuses on pairs of inputs rather than individual samples to achieve this desired feature. When no view supervision is available, valuable pairs of samples consist of two samples of an object under different views. A generator is used to create pairs of the same object to fool a discriminator, achieving three goals: realistic appearance, same object generation, and different view factors. The Generative Multiview Model (GMV) aims to encode invariant features into the content vector to generate diverse pairs of the same object under different views. The discriminator should distinguish between pairs of samples with the same object under different views and the same view. The architecture is detailed in FIG1 and optimized using an adversarial loss function. The Generative Multiview Model (GMV) aims to encode invariant features into the content vector to generate diverse pairs of the same object under different views. The global minimum of the learning criterion is obtained when the model samples pairs of views over a similar object. The Model at inference uses the discriminator trained on pairs of samples to introduce constraints on generating samples. The generator G generates single samples by sampling c and v, then computing G(c, v). Content vectors are induced from real inputs in the conditional generative model C-GMV, allowing for generating samples corresponding to multiple views or contents. Interpolations between views or contents are also possible. The GMV model uses an encoder to generate content vectors from real inputs, allowing for diverse object views. The discriminator is trained on pairs of samples to ensure generated samples match real ones. The model can sample objects with different views but cannot change the view of a given object. This limitation may be relevant for applications like image editing. The section discusses extending the generative model to extract content factors from inputs for generating new object views. An encoder function is added to map inputs to a content space, inspired by the CGAN model. The encoder generates a content vector that, combined with a randomly sampled view, creates artificial examples for training the model. The section discusses the use of encoder and generator models to generate new views of objects based on input samples. Experiments were conducted on four image datasets to evaluate the models' quality. The experiments involved using two models on four image datasets, with dataset statistics provided in Table 1. Supervision was not used for learning the models, except for determining if two samples correspond to the same object. The model architecture used the same design for all datasets, with images rescaled to 3 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 tensors. The generator and discriminator followed the DCGAN implementation, and learning utilized classical GAN techniques with an Adam optimizer and batch size of 128. The GMV model was trained using classical GAN techniques with an Adam optimizer and batch size of 128. Different learning rates were used for the generator/encoder and discriminator. The model was compared with state-of-the-art techniques and baselines, including a model from BID19. The study compares their models with a model from BID19, using two implementations: one based on Mathieu et al. and the other inspired by DCGAN. They also compare their generative model with standard GANs trained on pairs, quadruplets, and eight views. The DCGANx2 generator outputs 2 images, while the discriminator distinguishes these pairs as negative samples. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of their approach with CGAN models and variants of the model from Mathieu et al. for conditional generation. They evaluate the ability of their model to generate a variety of objects and views, showing examples of generated images. The main difference with GMV is that GAN-based methods do not explicitly distinguish content and view factors. The GMV model accurately generates multiple views of objects or a single object by using sampled content and view factors. Results on different datasets show the effectiveness of the approach in generating high-quality images through interpolation on content or view factors. The GMV model can generate high-quality images by using sampled content and view factors, showing diversity in generated views. Comparing to GAN-based models, DCGANx2 can produce similar quality outputs but is limited to generating only two views per object due to not distinguishing content and view factors. The GMV model can generate high-quality images by using sampled content and view factors, showing diversity in generated views. DCGANx4 or DCGANx8 could potentially generate more views for each object, but face challenges due to the high-dimensionality of the observation space. Interpolation between different view and content factors in generated samples illustrates the independent handling of content and view factors by the generator. The C-GMV model demonstrates its ability to generate diverse views of the same object, unlike the CGAN model which suffers from mode collapse and lacks view diversity. The results are compared with models from BID19, showing the effectiveness of C-GMV in capturing and generating multiple views from a single input sample. The C-GMV model outperforms the CGAN model in generating diverse views of objects. Comparison with BID19 models shows that C-GMV produces higher quality and more diverse images. Mode collapse is observed in CGAN, limiting its ability to generate varied views. The C-GMV model is trained on objects from subset S1 and tested on subset S2, generating new views and content vectors. Two classifiers are evaluated, one on content vectors and the other on real and generated images. Results show close accuracy between classifiers operating on true images and content latent factors, indicating successful category information capture in the model. The C-GMV model successfully captures category information in generated samples, with slightly lower accuracy compared to real images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset evaluate the model's ability to preserve identity, generate realistic samples, maintain diversity, and capture view distributions. Features extracted using VGG Face are used to assess the model's capability to generate multiple views of the same image. The VGG Face descriptor is used to extract features for evaluating if two images belong to the same person. AUC scores are computed using positive and negative pairs to assess model quality. Additional AUC scores are calculated by comparing generated pairs with dataset pairs to improve model evaluation. The classifier achieves an AUC of 93.3% when using pairs directly from the dataset, serving as an upper bound for model performance. The GMV model outperforms other generative models with an AUC of 76.3%. Comparing real and generated pairs helps evaluate model identity preservation. The GMV model outperforms other generative models with an AUC of 76.3% when comparing real and generated pairs to evaluate model identity preservation. The ability to generate new views while preserving the input person's identity is measured by the AUC. The CGMV model is compared to BID19's implementations, showing that FORMULA0 is better. However, the CGAN model achieves a 100% AUC due to generating identical images, impacting diversity. Evaluation of output quality and diversity is crucial for generative models on the Celeba dataset. A good generative model should generate samples with attributes close to the training set. The quality of generated samples is measured based on the blurry attribute of the CelebA dataset. A blurry-detection classifier evaluates the quantity of blurry generated images, aiming to match the proportion of blurry images in the dataset. The evaluation of generated images shows that CGMV and GMV models produce less blurry images compared to GAN/CGAN/Mathieu et al. models, indicating a higher level of realism in the generated images. The evaluation method favors CGMV and GMV models for generating interesting outputs. Samples were generated to analyze distribution across 40 attributes of the CelebA dataset using classifiers. The distribution of generated samples was estimated using these classifiers and data from 3800 test samples. The evaluation method favors CGMV and GMV models for generating interesting outputs. Models like BID19, CGAN, and GANx8 sometimes ignore rare attributes and over-generate common attributes like Young. GMV and CGMV models seem to better capture the attributes. The evaluation method favors GMV and CGMV models for generating diverse outputs, as they better capture the dataset distribution. The Bhattacharyya distance between the true distribution and these models is very low, below 0.1. In contrast, other models like Mathieu et al. FORMULA0 and BID19 (DCGAN), CGAN, and GANx have higher distances. GMV and CGMV models are considered the best trade-off in this set of experiments. The GMV and CGMV models are considered the best trade-off between identity preservation and diversity in generated views. They outperform state-of-the-art methods like Mathieu et al. and CGAN in capturing dataset distribution and generating diverse samples. The experiment evaluates diversity by counting unique combinations of attributes in generated samples. Our attribute classifiers labeled sample images according to 40 attributes. GMV and CGMV models showed the highest diversity in generated images, with about 47% unique combinations observed in the test samples. The experiment involved generating samples using content and view vectors, and evaluating the diversity by counting unique attribute combinations. The results compare the behavior of CGAN and Mathieu et al. models, which ignore rare attributes. Generative models using latent variables have been proposed before, known as inter-battery factor analysis. These methods are related to Canonical Correlation Analysis and have been used for multiview data inference and classification system improvement. Our approach is based on generating views from a common latent factor describing the object's content. Our model simplifies the IBFA approach by using a discriminator function to capture common and specific information based on a pair of observations. Different views are treated as different domains in a domain transfer task, with the goal of projecting images from a source domain to a target domain. Adversarial loss is used to enforce good visual quality, as seen in BID8. The models discussed focus on aligning unpaired datasets using discriminators and cycle consistent auto-encoding loss. They also address image editing by manipulating attributes and disentangling content from view using labeled information at a latent level. The model proposed in BID10 revisits the cycle approach by learning to generate output images with a given set of attribute values and then returning to the initial image. Unlike other approaches, this method does not rely on limited domain assumptions and instead focuses on handling continuous view and content latent spaces. The Info-GAN and beta-VAE models aim to disentangle content and view/style without supervision, by maximizing mutual information between generated images and codes. These models force latent dimensions to be independent, allowing for the separation of factors in the outputs. Our proposed generative model operates on a disentangled latent space learned from multiview data without supervision. It allows for generating realistic data with diverse views and a conditional version can generate new views of an input image without supervision. Our proposed generative model can generate new views of an input image without supervision, capturing content and view factors. Experimental results demonstrate the quality of outputs and the ability to generate diverse and realistic samples. Future plans include exploring data augmentation using this approach in semi-supervised and one-shot/few-shot learning settings. The GMV model generates samples with different attributes, such as \"Eyeglasses\" present in 3.8% of the samples."
