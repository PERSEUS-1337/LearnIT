    "content": "The \"New Options Petroleum Energy Conservation Act of 2007\" introduces the Climate Neutral Combustion Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote energy conservation. The Climate Neutral Combustion Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a 20 percent credit on qualified investments in climate neutral combustion facilities, which includes property placed in service by the taxpayer with allowable depreciation or amortization. The Climate Neutral Combustion Credit allows for a 20 percent credit on qualified investments in climate neutral combustion facilities. Special rules apply for certain subsidized property, and qualified progress expenditures rules are made applicable. A climate neutral combustion facility burns matter to produce electricity, captures carbon dioxide for fuel recovery, and produces no atmospheric emissions of mercury. The Climate Neutral Combustion Credit provides a 20 percent credit on qualified investments in facilities that produce no atmospheric emissions of mercury or greenhouse gases. Additionally, the credit cannot be claimed if a credit is already allowed under section 48A or 48B. Conforming amendments are made to the tax code to include the basis of property in a qualifying climate neutral combustion facility. The tax code is amended to include a new item after section 48B, providing a 20 percent credit for investments in facilities with no atmospheric emissions of mercury or greenhouse gases. The tax code is amended to include a new section 48C for a climate neutral combustion credit. The amendments made by this section apply to periods after the enactment of the Act, with rules similar to section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Additionally, the energy credit for solar energy property is extended until 2013, with amendments applying to taxable years ending after December 31, 2008. SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENT PROPERTY.\n\nAmends section 25D of the Internal Revenue Code to extend the credit until 2012 for property placed in service after December 31, 2008.\n\nSEC. 5. PRIZE PROGRAM.\n\nEstablishes a $1 billion prize program for the first U.S. automobile manufacturer to produce and sell 60,000 midsized sedans in the U.S. that run on gasoline and achieve 100 miles per gallon.\n\nSEC. 6. LITHIUM ION BATTERY TECHNOLOGY.\n\nAppropriates $30 million in fiscal year 2007 for the development of advanced lithium ion battery technology. SEC. 7. EXPENSING OF PROPERTY USED IN THE REFINING OF ETHANOL, METHANOL, AND BIODIESEL. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the expensing of certain property used in the refining of ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel. Taxpayers can elect to treat the cost of qualified biofuel property as an expense, deductible in the year the property is placed in service. The election must be made on the tax return and cannot be revoked without the Secretary's consent. Qualified biofuel property is defined as property used for biofuel refining, with original use starting with the taxpayer. The term 'biofuel' includes qualified methanol or ethanol fuel and biodiesel. Dual use property used for biofuel refining and other purposes has its cost reduced. Section 179C does not apply to property under subsection (a). Recapture rules apply to property no longer qualified as biofuel property. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code to allow deductions for expenditures related to biofuel property under section 179F. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include inserting a new item after section 179E for biofuel property deductions under section 179F. The amendments made by this section allow for the election to expense certain property used in refining ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel. This applies to property placed in service after the enactment of the Act."
