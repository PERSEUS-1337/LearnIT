    "content": "On August 24, 2006, the FDA approved Plan B, an emergency contraceptive, to be sold over-the-counter for women 18 and older. It will still require a prescription for those 17 and younger. Both men and women can purchase it with proof of age. Barr Pharmaceuticals started shipping the OTC version in November 2006, sparking controversy. Critics of Plan B believe initial policy decisions were politically motivated, while conservative groups fear increased unsafe sexual activity. They argue that Plan B may prevent embryo implantation, constituting abortion. However, the medical community disagrees, stating it likely prevents ovulation or fertilization. FDA does not classify Plan B as an abortion drug. The FDA approval of Plan B as a prescription drug and its controversial OTC approval are discussed, along with legal issues and state policies affecting access to emergency contraceptives. The report also addresses Department of Justice guidelines for sexual assault victims and the impact of the FDA's OTC decision on emergency contraception. Emergency contraception is a method to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. It can be done through insertion of an IUD or by taking a pill containing hormones. Reasons for using emergency contraception include contraceptive failure, sexual assault, or exposure to harmful agents. The approach to emergency contraception dates back to the 1920s when estrogen was found to prevent pregnancy in mammals. During the 1960s and 1970s, high-dose estrogen was used as emergency contraception. The Yuzpe method, developed in the early 1970s, involved taking conventional birth control pills in two doses 12 hours apart. In 1984, the UK approved a combination pill regimen for emergency contraception. By 2001, the UK allowed pharmacies to dispense emergency contraception without a prescription. In 2005, Canada approved Plan B, a progestin-only pill, for use without a prescription in all women. Emergency contraceptive pills are now used in over 100 countries, with over 40 countries selling them without a prescription. Emergency contraceptive pills are used in over 100 countries, with more than 40 countries selling them without a prescription. The Yuzpe method, developed in the 1970s, involves taking conventional birth control pills in two doses 12 hours apart. In 1998, FDA approved Preven for use as an emergency contraceptive, utilizing the Yuzpe method. A 1993 study found that progestin alone was somewhat more effective for emergency contraception. In a study of 800 women in Hong Kong, progestin alone was found to be more effective for emergency contraception than the Yuzpe method, with fewer side effects. A larger international trial by the World Health Organization in 1998 confirmed that progestin alone was significantly more effective at preventing pregnancy and had fewer side effects compared to the Yuzpe method. The earlier the pill is taken, the better it works, with the progestin-alone regimen reducing the risk of pregnancy by 85% when taken within 72 hours of intercourse. Yuzpe emergency contraceptive reduced pregnancy risk by 57% within 72 hours. It prevented 77% of pregnancies within 24 hours, 36% within 25-48 hours, and 31% within 49-72 hours. Yuzpe had more side effects than progestin alone, with higher rates of nausea (50% vs. 23%) and vomiting (19% vs. 6%). FDA approved Plan B, a progestin-only emergency contraceptive, which is 89% effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Plan B emergency contraceptive is 89% effective within 72 hours of unprotected sex, with increased effectiveness (95%) if taken within 24 hours. It works by preventing ovulation or fertilization, not implantation. The active ingredient, levonorgestrel, has been used in birth control pills for over 35 years. While emergency contraception is not as effective as regular oral contraceptives, Plan B's higher dose of levonorgestrel functions similarly to a birth control pill. Plan B emergency contraceptive with a higher dose of levonorgestrel works like a birth control pill to prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation and possibly interfering with fertilization. Studies show it may reduce sperm in the uterus, alter uterine fluid pH, increase cervical mucus viscosity, and potentially inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium. Studies have found alterations in the endometrium with Plan B emergency contraceptive, but the impact on implantation is uncertain. Levonorgestrel, the active ingredient, does not disrupt post-fertilization events like implantation. Plan B is used before a pregnancy can be diagnosed and does not interfere with an established pregnancy. It does not contain the same active ingredient as Mifeprex, which is used to terminate early pregnancies. Plan B is used after a positive pregnancy test to terminate an early pregnancy (up through seven weeks). The FDA-approved OTC labeling lists known pregnancy and hypersensitivity as contraindications. Relative contraindications include clotting problems, stroke, and migraine related to estrogen presence in the combination pill. Since the Yuzpe regimen was approved in 1984, it has been used over 4 million times with only six serious stroke or blood clot events reported. The incidence of such events for Plan B should be even lower without estrogen. Common adverse reactions to Plan B include nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and headache. Less common side effects include menstrual changes, dizziness, breast tenderness, vomiting, and diarrhea. There is no evidence that Plan B harms a developing fetus if taken accidentally while pregnant. Plan B, an emergency contraception, may harm a developing fetus if taken accidentally during pregnancy. Studies show that its availability does not increase unprotected sex. In 2003, Women's Capital Corporation requested FDA approval to switch Plan B from prescription to over-the-counter. Requiring a prescription creates barriers to access, as women must find a prescribing physician, pay for a visit, and locate a pharmacy with the product. Switching to OTC could benefit women by improving timely access. FDA formalized the process for switching prescription drugs to OTC. The FDA formalized the process of switching prescription drugs to OTC status in 1975, with over 90 applications approved. Requirements for the switch include ensuring the drug is safe for self-medication and easy to use without healthcare provider intervention. The OTC applications are reviewed by FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), with Plan B being a \"first in class\" drug reviewed by two CDER offices. After extensive review by two FDA committees, Plan B was deemed safe for nonprescription use, with a majority vote supporting its switch to OTC status. Despite this, the FDA rejected the recommendation citing concerns about unsupervised use, particularly among minors. Studies have shown no link between wider access to emergency contraception and risky sexual behavior among teenagers. The FDA rejected the recommendation to make Plan B available over the counter only to women 17 years and older due to concerns about unsupervised use, particularly among minors. FDA Commissioner Lester M. Crawford mentioned \"novel regulatory issues,\" \"profound\" policy questions, and specific concerns over how the drug could be available OTC for older women while remaining prescription. The FDA rejected the recommendation to make Plan B available over the counter only to women 17 years and older due to concerns about unsupervised use, particularly among minors. A 60-day \"public comment\" period was opened to help decide these issues, leading to the resignation of the director of the FDA's Office of Women's Health in protest. FDA Commissioner Crawford resigned abruptly on September 23, 2005. Senators Clinton and Murray delivered a petition urging the agency to make a decision based on scientific evidence. Congress asked the GAO to investigate political interference in the FDA decision process. The GAO report in November 2005 found the FDA decision process for Plan B to be \"unusual\" and possibly influenced by political interference. Three high-level FDA officials refused to sign the letter denying approval, which went against typical procedures. The GAO recommended that future decisions be based on science rather than ideology. The FDA approved the switch of Plan B to over-the-counter status in August 2006, with an age restriction of 18. Compliance with the age restriction was tested using anonymous shoppers, and a booklet explaining proper use of the drug was distributed. Sales were restricted to individuals 18 and over, similar to nicotine replacement treatments. Three lawsuits have been filed regarding the FDA's approval of Plan B. In Tummino v. von Eschenbach, reproductive health organizations sued FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach over emergency contraception. The plaintiffs, including some as young as 13, argue that the FDA did not follow proper procedures in mandating age and point-of-sale restrictions for Plan B. They seek approval for all ages and removal of restrictions on sales. The plaintiffs in the lawsuits against the FDA's approval of Plan B argue that the agency engaged in sex discrimination by imposing age and point-of-sale restrictions. They also claim violations of their Fifth Amendment rights to privacy and informational privacy, as well as alleging that the FDA ignored requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs argue that the FDA violated the Administrative Procedure Act by imposing age and point-of-sale restrictions on Plan B. They claim the agency required more information for Plan B approval than for other OTC medications and had enough data to make it available without restrictions. The FDA also allegedly ignored recommendations to approve Plan B without age limits and overstepped its statutory mandate. The FDA's denial of Plan B was influenced by factors other than scientific evidence, according to sworn depositions. The plaintiffs argue that the FDA lacked the authority to restrict the sale of OTC drugs. The FDA denied Plan B due to various reasons, including lack of jurisdiction, plaintiffs' standing, failure to state a claim, moot claims, and lack of authority for relief. The FDA also received citizens petitions on Plan B and acknowledged past practices regarding OTC status approvals. The FDA denied Plan B for various reasons, including lack of jurisdiction and plaintiffs' standing. The agency also received citizens' petitions on Plan B and acknowledged past practices regarding OTC status approvals. Additionally, the FDA included information on teen use of prescription drugs when requesting OTC status for Plan B. The agency denied creating a behind-the-counter \"regime\" for Plan B and mandated that it be kept behind the counter. Scientific data reviewed by the FDA determined that Plan B could be safely used by women age 17 and older. The plaintiffs filed a suit before FDA approval to switch Plan B to OTC status for women 18 and older, now pursuing the case for women under 18. They requested summary judgment, claiming no material issues exist. Judicial Watch sued FDA for violating the Freedom of Information Act regarding communications with Congress members about Plan B. The Act requires a response within 20 business days to record requests. Judicial Watch sought communications between FDA and Senators Clinton, Murray, and Enzi on Plan B. The FDA filed a motion to dismiss the case regarding Plan B, stating that all responsive records have been produced. They also moved for summary judgment on the adequacy of their communication records with Senators Clinton, Murray, and Enzi. The case is pending in federal court. In another lawsuit, a not-for-profit organization and three conservative women's health groups are seeking to overturn the FDA's approval of Plan B as an OTC drug. The plaintiffs argue that Plan B is unsafe for OTC distribution due to inadequate labeling and lack of FDA approval for both OTC and prescription use. They also claim the FDA cannot enforce age restrictions or bifurcate a drug's status based on age under the FFDCA. The plaintiffs argue that the FDA lacks the power to create a new class of drugs and did not follow necessary rulemaking procedures when approving Plan B as an OTC drug. They also claim the FDA unlawfully approved Plan B under pressure from Senators Clinton and Murray, leading to arbitrary and capricious decision-making. The FDA moved to dismiss the lawsuit on five grounds, including lack of standing, jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, incorrect allegations, and improper naming of defendants. The case has not yet gone to trial. Several states have passed pharmacy access laws allowing women to obtain emergency contraception directly from a pharmacy without a doctor's visit. The FDA's decision now limits these measures to minors. Plan B is available without a prescription in nine states: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Vermont, and Washington. Pharmacists in these states can sell emergency contraception after assessing the woman's needs. Access is still limited by the number of participating pharmacies. In several states, laws require hospital emergency rooms to provide emergency contraceptives to sexual assault victims upon request. Some states also mandate that hospitals offer information about emergency contraception. Governor Jodi Rell signed a law in Connecticut requiring all hospitals, including Catholic ones, to provide emergency contraception to rape victims. In various states, laws mandate hospital emergency rooms to offer emergency contraceptives to sexual assault victims. Some states also require hospitals to provide information on emergency contraception. In New York, Texas, and Washington, laws address pharmacists who refuse to dispense birth control and emergency contraception, with enforcement mechanisms varying. States like Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Dakota explicitly allow pharmacists to refuse dispensing contraceptives, while others like Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maine, and Tennessee have broadly worded refusal policies that may apply to pharmacists or pharmacies. In Illinois, pharmacies stocking contraceptives must dispense emergency contraceptives, and in Washington, a recent rule by the Board of Pharmacy mandates pharmacy owners to ensure patients receive lawfully prescribed drugs even if one pharmacist refuses. The Washington State regulations require pharmacy owners to ensure patients receive lawfully prescribed drugs, even if one pharmacist refuses. Wal-Mart pharmacies began stocking and filling prescriptions for Plan B in all locations due to the expectation of more states requiring its availability. Wal-Mart pharmacies changed their policy to sell Plan B due to the expectation of more states requiring its availability. The company will maintain its \"conscientious objection\" policy for pharmacists. Connecticut Attorney General announced that state health plans will not cover prescriptions from pharmacies that do not stock Plan B until every pharmacy dispenses it where medically prescribed. There is significant variation among states in emergency contraception coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries. 16 states have policies addressing coverage of emergency contraception as an OTC drug post the August 2006 FDA decision. Most states had existing policies before August 2006, which remain in effect. Low-income women may need a prescription or pay $40 out-of-pocket for emergency contraception due to billing procedures. Nine states require prior authorization for reimbursement. Disparities in coverage exist due to Plan B's dual status as OTC for women 18 and over, prescription-only for women under 18. The Georgia Medicaid program has coverage disparities for emergency contraception, with different policies for women over 18 and under 18. Some states like North Carolina require a doctor's prescription for coverage, while others like Hawaii and New York cover Plan B as an OTC drug for women over 18 without a prescription. Mississippi does not cover emergency contraception under Medicaid. The National Violence Against Women Survey estimated 300,000 women were raped in a year. In 1998, an estimated 300,000 women were raped, resulting in around 25,000 pregnancies. Emergency contraceptive treatment could have prevented 22,000 of these pregnancies. The DOJ developed guidelines for treating sexual assault victims, but the 141-page document released in 2004 was criticized for not mentioning offering emergency contraception. The DOJ Protocol for treating sexual assault victims does not mention offering emergency contraception to female rape victims. It recommends discussing the probability of pregnancy, conducting pregnancy tests, and discussing treatment options with patients. An early draft of the document did include mention of emergency contraception. The Protocol for treating sexual assault victims recommends discussing pregnancy probability, conducting tests, and discussing treatment options. Various medical organizations support offering emergency contraception to rape victims at risk of pregnancy. A letter signed by 277 organizations urged the DOJ to include routine offering of emergency contraception to sexual assault victims. The letter signed by 97 Members of Congress expressed concern over the lack of emergency contraception provision for sexual assault victims in hospitals. S. 21, the Prevention First Act, aims to expand access to preventive health care services, including emergency contraception, to reduce unintended pregnancies and improve women's health care access. S. 21, the Prevention First Act, would require hospitals receiving federal funds to offer emergency contraception to sexual assault victims. It is similar to S. 20 and H.R. 819, with companion bills introduced in the House. H.R. 464, the Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act, would prohibit federal funds to hospitals unless certain conditions are met for providing emergency contraception to victims. H.R. 464 and S. 1240 require accurate information and offer emergency contraception to women. S. 1240 also includes risk assessment and treatment for STIs. H.R. 2064 mandates emergency contraception on the formulary for the Department of Defense's pharmacy benefits program. H.R. 2064, S. 1800, H.R. 2503, and H.R. 2596/S. 1555 are bills related to emergency contraception and access to birth control. H.R. 2064 mandates emergency contraception in the Department of Defense's pharmacy benefits program. S. 1800 and H.R. 2503 address scientific evaluation of emergency contraceptives, while H.R. 2596/S. 1555 focus on ensuring pharmacies provide FDA-approved contraceptives. The bill H.R. 2596/S. 1555 aims to ensure pharmacies provide FDA-approved contraceptives, including emergency contraception, with a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per day for violations. Critics believe the delayed FDA decision on Plan B was politically motivated, rather than based on scientific evidence. Critics believe the FDA delayed the decision on Plan B to appease conservative religious and pro-life groups supporting President Bush. This decision angered these groups, leading to calls for the withdrawal of the FDA commissioner's nomination and legal actions to overturn the decision. They argue that Plan B should only be used under healthcare professional supervision. The use of emergency contraception like Plan B should be supervised by a healthcare professional. Studies have shown that easier access to emergency contraception does not lead to an increase in unsafe sexual activity or sexually transmitted infections. Adolescents under 16 years old did not exhibit riskier behavior with increased access to emergency contraception. The Society for Adolescent Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support unrestricted access to emergency contraception for adolescents, as studies show that adolescents under 16 can use it correctly without physician supervision. ACOG supports unrestricted access to Plan B for all ages, stating that the FDA's age restriction is unnecessary and misses the opportunity to prevent teenage pregnancies. They emphasize that emergency contraception is safe for over-the-counter use by women of all ages, including young adolescents. The FDA advisory panel supports unrestricted access to Plan B for all ages, emphasizing that emergency contraception is safe for over-the-counter use by women of all ages, including young adolescents. The side effects of Plan B may lead women to seek alternative methods of birth control, and OTC availability would benefit rape victims who do not seek immediate medical care. Plan B will only be sold in pharmacies or health clinics under the FDA approval agreement with Barr. The availability of Plan B will be restricted to pharmacies and health clinics, not gas stations or convenience stores. Conservative religious and pro-life groups are concerned that Plan B may prevent embryo implantation, which they consider to be an abortion. However, the medical community does not view prevention of implantation as an abortion, as pregnancy begins with implantation, not fertilization. The medical community and federal government agree that pregnancy begins with implantation, not fertilization. Plan B is not classified as an abortion drug by the FDA. Research shows that making emergency contraception available without a prescription increases its use. Experts estimate that emergency contraception could prevent 1 million abortions and 2 million unintended pregnancies annually. The FDA decision to make Plan B available over the counter is seen as a step in the right direction by pro-choice groups, who believe it will reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States. However, studies have shown that increased access to emergency contraception pills may not necessarily reduce overall pregnancy rates. Pro-choice groups support OTC status for Plan B for all women, not just those 18 and older, to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Age restriction may limit access for those who need it most. About 3.5 million unwanted pregnancies occur annually, with one third involving teenagers. Prior to OTC status, Plan B was prescribed 1.5 million times per year in the US. Switching to OTC may increase costs for insured consumers. Sales of Plan B in the United States have doubled since August 2006, reaching close to $80 million for 2007. During its first month as an OTC drug, Plan B was available in Pennsylvania for $20 through Planned Parenthood clinics and for $39.99 to $44.99 at various retail pharmacies."
