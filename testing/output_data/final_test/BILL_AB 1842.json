    "title": "AB 1842",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5650.1 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to impose a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for violating Section 5650. The penalty is separate from any other civil penalties imposed under this section or other laws. The court considers various factors when determining civil penalties, including the nature and gravity of the violation, toxicity and volume of discharge, harm caused, ability to pay, prior violations, and economic benefit. In civil actions under this section, the Attorney General or district/city attorney can bring complaints on behalf of the State of California. In such actions seeking injunctions, there is no need to prove irreparable damage or inadequate legal remedy. After meeting the burden of proof, the court will decide on issuing a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction without requiring the defendant to prove harm. Factors considered include the nature of the violation, substance involved, environmental harm, defendant's remedial actions, likelihood of substance entering state waters, and harm to the defendant. The court aims to tailor injunctions narrowly to address violations while allowing the defendant to continue lawful business operations. Civil penalties collected are distributed with fifty percent going to the county treasurer for the fish and wildlife propagation fund. The court aims to tailor injunctions narrowly to address violations while allowing the defendant to continue lawful business operations. Fifty percent of civil penalties collected are distributed to the department for deposit in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund. Violators of Section 5650 may face a civil penalty of up to ten dollars per gallon or pound of material discharged, with reductions for recovered and properly disposed material. Civil penalties under this section do not overlap with penalties imposed under Article 9 of the Government Code. Section 8670.61 of the Government Code is amended to state that civil and criminal penalties in this chapter and Division 7.8 of the Public Resources Code are separate from and in addition to other remedies, except as specified in the Fish and Game Code."
