    "content": "The \"Temporary Investment Tax Credit Restoration Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. This Act includes an investment credit for manufacturing and other productive equipment. The \"Temporary Investment Tax Credit Restoration Act of 1993\" includes a manufacturing and other productive equipment credit of 10 percent of the excess aggregate bases of qualified properties. The \"Temporary Investment Tax Credit Restoration Act of 1993\" offers a 10 percent credit for manufacturing and productive equipment properties placed in service during the taxable year, exceeding the base amount. Qualified manufacturing and productive equipment property refers to tangible property used in manufacturing, production, or farming, subject to section 168 and classified as section 1245 property. The \"Temporary Investment Tax Credit Restoration Act of 1993\" provides a 10 percent credit for manufacturing and productive equipment properties exceeding the base amount. Computer software used for manufacturing or production processes qualifies as manufacturing equipment. The base amount is calculated based on the fixed-base percentage and the taxpayer's average annual gross receipts for the previous 4 years. The base amount for the credit year cannot be less than 50 percent of the amount calculated based on the taxpayer's average annual gross receipts for the 4 taxable years preceding the credit year. The fixed-base percentage is determined by the aggregate amounts for specific taxable years in relation to the taxpayer's gross receipts for those years. The reduction required by section 50(c) for any taxable year shall be allocated among the qualified manufacturing and productive equipment property placed in service by the taxpayer during that year in proportion to the respective bases of such property. Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (4) and (5) of section 41(c) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph. The credit for equipment property is 10 percent of the excess referred to in paragraph (1) or the basis of the property. Controlled groups rules apply, and the subsection does not apply if the energy or rehabilitation credit would apply unless waived by the taxpayer. Certain progress expenditure rules are made applicable. Certain progress expenditure rules from subsection (c)(4) and (d) of section 46 apply for this subsection. This subsection applies to periods after December 31, 1992, and before January 1, 1995. Technical amendments include adding \"qualified manufacturing and productive equipment property\" after \"energy property\" in section 49(a)(1)(C) and amending section 50(a)(2) of the Code. In amending section 50(a)(2) of the Code, subparagraph (E) is modified by adding \"or 48(c)(5)\" before the period. Additionally, paragraph (5) of section 50(a) introduces special rules for qualified manufacturing and productive equipment property, specifying percentages for different clauses in the table. The section heading for section 48 of the Code is amended to exclude clauses (iv) and (v) from the table. The table of sections for subpart E of part IV of the tax code is amended to exclude section 48 and replace it with \"Other credits.\" These changes apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1992."
