    "content": "The diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education, stemming from the Supreme Court ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, remains a controversial topic. Colleges and universities use affirmative action policies to achieve a diverse student body or faculty, as stated by Justice Powell in the Bakke Court. However, federal courts have begun to question this rationale in recent years. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Hopwood v. Texas ruled that using race in admissions was unconstitutional. Subsequent cases voided race-conscious policies in education. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Johnson v. Board of Regents rejected diversity as constitutional. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Hopwood by rejecting diversity as a constitutional justification for a \"racial bonus\" awarded to minority freshman applicants at the University of Georgia. This decision created a circuit court conflict with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld an affirmative action admissions policy at the University of Washington Law School. The judicial divide over Bakke's legacy was highlighted by conflicting trial court decisions regarding race-based admissions policies at the University of Michigan. The Supreme Court brought clarity to the issue in its 2002 term. In its 2002 term, the Supreme Court ruled on the Michigan cases regarding race in admissions. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Court upheld the law school's consideration of race to achieve a diverse student body. However, in Gratz v. Bollinger, the Court found the university's policy of awarding racial bonus points to be unconstitutional. The Court also agreed to review cases involving the use of race to maintain diversity in public schools. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, striking down school plans that violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court's decision in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin in 2013 reaffirmed the importance of diversity in higher education. The appellate court upheld the University of Texas at Austin's admissions program for a second time, leading the Supreme Court to agree to review the case during its 2015 term. In 2014, the Court upheld Michigan's Proposal 2, which bans racial preferences in higher education. The report traces the evolution of race-based affirmative action in public education and discusses major rulings on race-conscious admissions challenges, highlighting the future implications of affirmative action law. The Supreme Court addressed racial segregation in public schools, imposing an \"affirmative duty\" on school boards to desegregate and eliminate state-enforced segregation. This led to a two-decade era of massive desegregation, with federal orders requiring significant changes in school attendance and transportation. School districts sought compliance with constitutional requirements to end federal intervention. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 established a framework for affirmative action in employment and education, with Title VII regulations applying to employers with 15 or more employees. The Act allows for judicial power to order monetary damages and affirmative action to remedy discrimination, but there is no general requirement for affirmative action unless mandated by court order. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has guidelines to protect employers and unions from charges of \"reverse discrimination\" when they voluntarily take action to correct past discrimination. Federal regulations under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act require affirmative action to overcome past discrimination in federally assisted programs, including education. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights interprets Title VI to encourage voluntary affirmative action for a diverse student body. Affirmative action in higher education allows colleges and universities to consider race or national origin for financial aid to address past discrimination. The Bakke ruling in 1978 sparked a constitutional debate on affirmative action, with a lack of consensus among Justices. One plurality in Bakke struck down a special admissions program at a medical school for minority students, despite no evidence of past discrimination by the institution. The Supreme Court debated the use of racial classifications in college admissions, with Justice Powell ultimately condemning the use of quotas but supporting the consideration of race for diversity. He believed promoting a diverse student body was a valid goal for higher education institutions. The Supreme Court debated the use of racial classifications in college admissions, with Justice Powell ultimately condemning quotas but supporting race consideration for diversity in higher education. Bakke case affirmed admission but rejected racial quotas, while Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education ruled against protecting minority teachers from layoffs. The Supreme Court debated the use of racial classifications in college admissions, with Justice Powell condemning quotas but supporting race consideration for diversity in higher education. In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, the Court ruled against protecting minority teachers from layoffs, while also discussing governmental affirmative action to remedy past discrimination. The Justices failed to reach a consensus on most issues in these cases. In the mid-1980s, the Supreme Court approved the temporary use of race- or gender-conscious selection criteria by private employers under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to address racial imbalance or discrimination in job categories. Proof of remedial justification rooted in the employer's past discrimination and persistent effects was required for preferential affirmative action. The Supreme Court approved temporary race- or gender-conscious selection criteria for private employers under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to address job category imbalance or discrimination. Affirmative action preferences had to be flexible, temporary, and narrowly tailored to avoid rigid quotas. Race or gender as a \"plus\" factor in employment decisions was accepted if it didn't hinder non-minority employees' expectations. In 1989, the Justices resolved the constitutional standard for reviewing challenges to governmental classifications by race for remedial purposes. In 1989, the Supreme Court settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate a 30% set-aside of city contracts for minority-owned businesses in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson. Race-conscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination, but racial balancing without specific evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible. In Croson v. City of Richmond, the Supreme Court found that racial balancing without evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible. However, the Court suggested that a more tolerant standard of racial line-drawing may apply to Congress due to its unique equal protection enforcement authority. This idea was reinforced in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, where the Court upheld minority broadcast licensing schemes approved by Congress to promote broadcast diversity. The two-tiered approach to equal protection analysis of governmental affirmative action was short-lived, as seen in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, where the Court applied strict scrutiny to a federal transportation program favoring firms owned by designated racial minorities. The Court in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena determined that all racial classifications by government must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored. The majority opinion acknowledged Congress's role in addressing discrimination but did not provide clear guidance on the scope of remedial power. Adarand suggests that racial preferences in federal law or policy are subject to strict scrutiny. Adarand emphasizes that racial preferences in federal law must be justified and narrowly drawn. The Supreme Court has addressed affirmative action in various educational contexts, including challenges to race-conscious admissions plans. The concept of diversity as a compelling interest in education emerged from Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke. Interest in promoting diversity in education originated from Justice Powell's opinion in the Bakke case, where he emphasized the importance of a diverse student body for the exchange of ideas. Justice Powell found a state medical school's admissions quota unconstitutional and ordered Bakke's admission, bridging the gap between two opposing views on the issue. Justice Powell found the dual admissions procedure unconstitutional in the Bakke case, ordering Bakke's admission. He believed in the state's interest in educational diversity, where race could be a \"plus\" factor among other considerations for a diverse student body. This theory did not rely solely on race but encompassed various factors for a robust exchange of ideas and academic freedom. Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke ruled the program unconstitutional and the white male plaintiff entitled to admission. Four other Justices reached the same result on statutory grounds. Only Justice Powell believed in the compelling state interest of attaining a diverse student body, which colleges and universities relied on for race-conscious student diversity policies until challenged in Hopwood v. State of Texas. The Hopwood v. State of Texas case challenged the Powell diversity rationale by voiding a special admission program at the University of Texas law school. Unlike Bakke, the Texas program did not have explicit racial quotas but still had a dual-track system with lower cutoff scores for minorities. The Hopwood panel ruled that race could only be considered in admissions to remedy past discrimination by the law school itself. Other federal circuit courts also examined race-based college admissions post-Bakke, such as Johnson v. Board of Regents striking down the award of \"racial bonus\" points to minority students. Johnson v. Board of Regents invalidated the award of \"racial bonus\" points to minority students in freshman admissions at the University of Georgia. The Eleventh Circuit found the program failed strict scrutiny as it was not narrowly tailored, mechanically granting a diversity bonus to non-white applicants. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit upheld a minority law school admissions program at the University of Washington based on Bakke. The appeals court in Smith v. University of Washington Law School concluded that Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke became the \"narrowest footing\" for approval of race in admissions, guided by Marks v. United States. Post-Bakke, appeals courts used the Powell opinion as the controlling rationale for approving race as a plus factor in admissions. The Supreme Court review of the University of Michigan cases led to a deepening judicial divide over student diversity policies. The Sixth Circuit reversed a decision and allowed the law school to consider race in admissions, based on the Bakke case. The Supreme Court reviewed University of Michigan cases regarding student diversity policies. The Sixth Circuit allowed the law school to consider race in admissions, based on the Bakke case. Undergraduate admissions at the University of Michigan were based on a point system, with academic factors accounting for up to 110 points. Membership in an underrepresented minority group, socioeconomic disadvantage, or athletics could earn applicants 20 points. Other factors like alumni relationships, personal essay, community leadership, and residency also contributed points. The University of Michigan's admissions policies considered various factors for student diversity. The district court in Gratz upheld the policy, stating that racial diversity was important for the freshman class composition. The award of 20 points for minority status was seen as a plus factor, not a quota system like in Bakke. The court found that the policy satisfied the constitutional demand for narrow tailoring. The University of Michigan's admissions policy aimed to achieve racial and ethnic diversity by enrolling a critical mass of minority students. Admission officers considered various factors, including talents, interests, experiences, and underrepresented minority status, to create a diverse student body. The University of Michigan's admissions policy aimed to achieve racial and ethnic diversity by enrolling a critical mass of minority students. The 1992 policy replaced an earlier special admissions program with lower academic requirements for minority groups. The district court in Grutter found a heavy emphasis on race in the admissions process, with minorities ranging from 11% to 17% of each incoming class. Judge Martin adopted the Powell position in Bakke, stating the law school had a compelling interest in a diverse student body and a narrowly tailored admissions policy. The University of Michigan's admissions policy aimed to achieve diversity by enrolling a critical mass of minority students. The law school's policy was designed to ensure a \"meaningful number\" of minority students could contribute to classroom dialogue without feeling isolated. The admissions program was flexible, without fixed goals or quotas, and did not use separate tracks for minority and nonminority candidates. The Supreme Court agreed to review the Gratz undergraduate admissions case alongside the Sixth Circuit ruling in Grutter. The Supreme Court rulings in Grutter and Gratz in 2003 upheld the law school admissions policy but struck down the university's undergraduate racial admissions program. Justice O'Connor echoed the Powell rationale from Bakke in the Grutter majority opinion, settling the doctrinal imbroglio on race-conscious admissions. Justice O'Connor's opinion in the Grutter case emphasized the importance of context in reviewing race-based governmental actions for equal protection purposes. She also highlighted the deference given to educational decisionmakers in defining the scope of their academic mission. In the Grutter case, Justice O'Connor emphasized the deference given to educational decisionmakers in defining their academic mission, particularly in matters of racial diversity. Justice Thomas's dissent criticized the idea of contextualizing racial discrimination and allowing deference to the Law School's conclusions on educational benefits. The Court found the Law School's admissions program to be narrowly tailored to achieve a racially diverse student body, following the concept of \"critical mass\" as necessary for educational benefits. Justice O'Connor referenced Justice Powell's standards in Bakke for individualized consideration of race. The Supreme Court ruled that universities cannot use fixed quotas or separate admissions tracks based on race. Instead, race can be considered as a \"plus\" factor in individualized applicant evaluations. Justice O'Connor distinguished between forbidden quotas and permitted goals, allowing universities to strive for a critical mass of minority students through good-faith efforts. The Supreme Court ruled that universities cannot use fixed quotas or separate admissions tracks based on race. Instead, race can be considered as a \"plus\" factor in individualized applicant evaluations. Justice O'Connor noted that minority law school enrollment varied from 13.5% to 20.1%, which was inconsistent with a quota. The Court found that the law school admissions process was narrowly tailored by avoiding racial or ethnic bonuses and considering all pertinent elements of diversity in a holistic review of each applicant's file. Race neutral alternatives were also considered by the law school. The Supreme Court ruled that universities can consider race as a \"plus\" factor in individualized applicant evaluations, without requiring fixed quotas or separate admissions tracks based on race. The law school was not mandated to exhaust all alternatives, only to consider serious good faith race-neutral options for achieving diversity. Justice O'Connor emphasized the importance of reasonable time limits and periodic reviews for institutions implementing such programs. The dissenting opinion by Justice Kennedy raised concerns about the consistency of minority admissions over the years and the use of daily reports near the end of the process. He argued that the law school needed to rebut suspicions of racial balancing under strict scrutiny. The dissenting opinion by Justice Kennedy raised concerns about the shift in focus from individualized review to institutional numerical objectives in minority admissions. Justices O'Conner and Breyer also struck down the racial bonus system for undergraduate admissions in Gratz. The companion case focused on why the automatic award of 20 admission points to minority applicants failed the narrow tailoring aspect of strict scrutiny analysis. The policy in question was found to be more than a plus factor, as it denied individualized consideration to underrepresented minority applicants. The procedure for flagging applications for additional review was deemed insufficient, as it only occurred after the bulk of admission decisions were made based on a point system. The university's argument that implementing a more individualized review was impractical due to the volume of applications was rejected by the Chief Justice. The majority ruling in Gratz applies to private colleges receiving federal funds under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Justice O'Connor highlighted the automatic nature of the selection index scoring, which prevented nuanced judgments on candidates. The Admissions Review Committee was criticized for lacking transparency in its decision-making process. The dissenting opinions in the case lacked evidence on the operation and decision-making process. Justices Stevens and Souter argued on technical grounds and the merits of the Michigan undergraduate admission program. Justice Ginsburg also had a separate opinion. Justice Souter suggested remanding the case for further review of the admissions process. Justice Ginsburg believed that the Michigan program was constitutional as it did not limit admissions based on race or ethnicity. She stated that government decision-makers can differentiate between policies of inclusion and exclusion to uphold individual equality. The case in question, Fisher, focused on the University of Texas at Austin's admissions plan that considers race as one factor to increase diversity. The University of Texas at Austin had a history of using race-conscious admissions until the Hopwood v. Texas decision in 1996. After that, they implemented the Top Ten Percent (TTP) plan, admitting 80% of students from the top 10% of their high school class. The remaining students were selected based on various race-neutral criteria like academic and personal achievements. The University of Texas at Austin implemented a race-neutral admissions approach after the Hopwood v. Texas decision in 1996, which increased minority enrollment. However, disparities persisted in certain majors and classrooms. Following the Grutter case, UT reintroduced race as a factor in admissions evaluations. Abigail Fisher, a white student, sued UT for considering race in admissions, claiming it was unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit upheld UT's admissions plan, but Fisher appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Fisher emphasized the validity of previous affirmative action precedents in higher education. The Supreme Court ruled that the Fifth Circuit did not sufficiently scrutinize UT's admissions program, vacating and remanding the case. The Court criticized the Fifth Circuit for applying an overly deferential form of strict scrutiny, stating that while deference is warranted in determining a compelling governmental interest, it should not be overly deferential. The Court emphasized the importance of racial diversity in higher education but called for a more rigorous evaluation of UT's admissions program. The Supreme Court criticized the Fifth Circuit for being overly deferential to UT's admissions program, stating that UT must prove its program is narrowly tailored for diversity. The Court vacated the lower court's decision and remanded the case for reconsideration under the correct standard. Justice Kennedy's opinion was supported by Justices Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, Breyer, Alito. Justice Kennedy, along with Justices Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, supported the opinion that UT's admissions plan needed to prove it was narrowly tailored for diversity. Justice Ginsburg dissented, arguing that programs like UT's are constitutional. The Fifth Circuit upheld UT's plan despite the Supreme Court's more demanding standard of review. The court found that UT's limited use of race in admissions was narrowly tailored to meet diversity goals, enabling access to students with personal achievements and higher test scores. The Supreme Court agreed to review the Fisher decision, indicating potential disagreement with the Fifth Circuit's ruling. The Supreme Court's potential disagreement with the Fifth Circuit's ruling on affirmative action programs remains unclear. The limited use of race-conscious measures in higher education is constitutionally permissible for now, pending a successful legal challenge. The Schuette case presents a unique perspective on the constitutionality of affirmative action programs compared to previous cases like Bakke, Grutter/Gratz, and Fisher. In Schuette, the constitutionality of banning all consideration of race in higher education was questioned after opponents of affirmative action in Michigan successfully passed Proposal 2. The Sixth Circuit ruled that Proposal 2's ban on racial preferences in public education violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court reversed a Sixth Circuit ruling that upheld a measure requiring extra steps for housing laws protecting racial minorities. The measure was invalidated as it disadvantaged individuals based on race. The Supreme Court invalidated a two-tiered system that placed burdens on racial minorities in the governmental process. In another case, the Court struck down a constitutional amendment that prohibited local school boards from establishing student busing plans, as it imposed a disproportionate burden on the basis of race. The Court emphasized that the equal protection clause prohibits political structures that subtly distort governmental processes. The Supreme Court invalidated a two-tiered system that burdened racial minorities in the governmental process. In a fractured decision, the Court upheld Michigan's law by a vote of 6-2, with Justice Kennedy distinguishing it from previous cases involving racial minorities. Kennedy and other Justices expressed concerns about judicial interference in the political process and the viability of the political process doctrine. Justice Kennedy and other Justices upheld Michigan's law in a 6-2 decision, expressing concerns about judicial interference in the political process and the viability of the political process doctrine. Justice Scalia argued for overturning political process cases entirely, while Justice Breyer agreed that Michigan's law is constitutional. Justice Sotomayor strongly dissented, emphasizing the nation's history of racial inequality and the importance of considering race in policy decisions. The Supreme Court ruling in Schuette upheld Michigan's ban on the use of racial preferences in public education and other contexts. This decision could lead to a decrease in minority enrollment at public colleges and universities. Affirmative action in public schools has also been a topic of debate, with the Court previously addressing the issue before 2007. Prior to 2007, the Supreme Court had never addressed the constitutionality of race-conscious programs in public schools, leading to split opinions in lower courts. Post-Grutter and Gratz decisions saw federal appeals courts mostly upholding the use of race-conscious measures, conflicting with earlier rulings. Significant cases like MacFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools upheld voluntary race considerations for student assignments to achieve integration. Jefferson County Public Schools were ordered by judicial decree to implement these measures. Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) were ordered to desegregate in 1975, with a plan to maintain racial diversity through busing. In 2000, federal courts ended supervision, but JCPS continued integrated schools voluntarily. A managed choice plan was challenged in a lawsuit, with the court finding it served compelling state interests similar to Grutter. The school board argued that the student assignment plan improved the educational experience and produced benefits for students of all races over 25 years. The court agreed, stating that integrated schools, better academic performance, and appreciation for diversity align with American values. The plan was found narrowly tailored except for its use of separate racial categories, which needed revision. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the decision without a detailed opinion, requiring the district to adjust its admissions policies for the following school year. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Ninth Circuit approved a school district's plan to maintain racially diverse schools by using a racial tie-breaker for oversubscribed schools. The plan aimed to achieve diversity and limit segregation. The Seattle plan, with a racial tie-breaker, aimed to maintain diversity in schools. The Ninth Circuit ruled in favor, stating the district had a compelling interest in diversity and avoiding racial isolation. Seattle's plan was deemed narrowly tailored and not a quota system. The Supreme Court reversed a decision regarding a school district's plan to maintain racially diverse schools, ruling that the plan was narrowly tailored and imposed a minimal burden on students. The case raised questions about public school districts' ability to promote racial diversity in education. The Supreme Court ruled that public school district plans to maintain racial diversity violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Roberts led a plurality of four Justices in concluding that the plans were unconstitutional because they did not serve a compelling governmental interest. Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment but disagreed with the plurality's reasoning. The Supreme Court found public school diversity plans unconstitutional as they were not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Chief Justice Roberts led the plurality in this decision, with Justice Thomas concurring and Justices Stevens and Breyer dissenting. The Court rejected a challenge to the standing of the plaintiff organization and emphasized that governmental racial classifications must undergo strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court found public school diversity plans unconstitutional as they were not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Chief Justice Roberts noted that the Court has recognized two interests as compelling in the school context: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity in higher education. However, the Court found that neither of these interests was advanced by the school plans at issue. Seattle schools were never intentionally segregated, and Louisville schools had successfully remediated past discrimination, so neither district could assert a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination. The Court also argued that the Grutter precedent did not govern the current situation. The Supreme Court found public school diversity plans unconstitutional as they were not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Chief Justice Roberts argued that the plans did not provide individualized review of applicants and only considered race, which did not reflect a broader spectrum of diverse qualifications and characteristics. The Court rejected the Grutter precedent, stating that the plans viewed race in limited terms and did not meet the standard for compelling interest in promoting diversity. The Supreme Court found public school diversity plans unconstitutional for not being narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. Chief Justice Roberts criticized the plans for lacking individualized review and only considering race, which limited diversity. The Court rejected the Grutter precedent, stating that the plans did not meet the standard for promoting diversity. The Supreme Court struck down public school diversity plans for not being narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. Chief Justice Roberts faulted the plans for tying diversity goals to specific racial demographics instead of educational benefits. The Supreme Court ruled against public school diversity plans, stating they were unconstitutional for focusing on racial balancing rather than educational benefits. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the importance of treating citizens as individuals, not based on their race. The Supreme Court ruled against public school diversity plans, stating they were unconstitutional for focusing on racial balancing rather than educational benefits. Chief Justice Roberts criticized Justice Breyer's dissent for misapplying precedents on compelling interest in remedying past discrimination. The Court recognized a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination caused by governmental action, not by other factors like social or economic pressures. The Chief Justice argued that the Seattle and Louisville school districts had no state segregation, therefore race-conscious school integration was not justified. The Supreme Court ruled against public school diversity plans, stating they were unconstitutional for focusing on racial balancing rather than educational benefits. The plurality opinion referenced Brown v. Board of Education and emphasized the need to stop discriminating on the basis of race. Justice Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion providing insight into how future cases involving race in education might be handled. Justice Kennedy disagreed with the implication that diversity in elementary and secondary education does not serve a compelling governmental interest. He criticized the opinion for suggesting that race cannot be a factor in certain instances, stating that it may be taken into account in public school administration. In public school administration, it is permissible to consider racial makeup and adopt policies for a diverse student body, including strategic site selection, altering attendance zones, providing resources for special programs, and recruiting students and faculty. Justice Kennedy believes these measures can be constitutional as long as they do not treat individuals differently based on race. He also suggests that racial classifications may be allowed for a more nuanced evaluation of school needs and student characteristics. Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the case emphasizes the importance of considering individual school needs and student characteristics when using racial classifications in education. Justice Thomas, while joining the plurality opinion, disagreed with the dissent's argument that school plans were necessary to combat resegregation, stating that intentional state action to separate races was not present in Seattle or Louisville. Justice Thomas disagreed with the dissent's argument that a less strict standard of review should apply to racial classifications used for benign purposes. He believed that school plans based on race may exacerbate racial tension and that relying on the good intentions of public officials is not enough. Thomas warned against elites promoting racial theories, questioning the longevity of their intentions. Both Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented from the Court's decision. In dissent, Justices Stevens and Breyer criticized the Court's decision to strike down school plans, with Justice Breyer arguing that it distorts precedent and undermines efforts to deal with school resegregation. The Michigan cases resolved a long-standing issue regarding race-based decision-making in education. The Court's decision to strike down school assignment plans in Seattle and Louisville has raised concerns about promoting racial diversity in elementary and secondary education. The Parents Involved in Community Schools case impacted school assignment plans nationwide, but left room for districts to pursue measures to prevent racial isolation and promote diversity. Justice Kennedy's suggestions for race-neutral methods may be more likely to withstand legal challenges, while the fate of other race-conscious plans remains uncertain. Legal developments over time will determine the viability of such plans. Some school districts are moving away from race-based school assignment plans to ones based on socioeconomic status. Colleges and universities are also making similar changes in anticipation of restrictions on using race in higher education. Future controversies may arise from unanswered questions about racially exclusive diversity policies in areas like scholarships, financial aid, and recruitment. The Court's latest rulings have left unanswered questions about whether schools and universities can avoid constitutional issues by implementing race-neutral plans to increase diversity. Alternative actions such as percentage plans in Texas, Florida, and California guarantee college admission to top graduates from all high schools regardless of race. Other strategies like class-based affirmative action consider socioeconomic status or family educational background for promoting diversity. Efforts to improve education include need-based financial aid, services for low-performing schools, and diversity considerations in admissions. Avoiding explicit racial classifications reduces legal challenges, while policies using nonracial factors as proxies for race may still face scrutiny. The Supreme Court has ruled that race-neutral laws with a discriminatory purpose can be subject to strict scrutiny. Efforts to achieve racial diversity in education face legal challenges, as strict scrutiny is triggered by evidence of racially discriminatory intent. This scrutiny applies to both traditional racial diversity policies and alternatives. Private institutions are also subject to limitations under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The implications of recent court cases on racial diversity efforts extend beyond education to other social and economic spheres. The legal challenges in achieving racial diversity in education involve the debate over race-conscious hiring criteria by private employers under Title VII. While some courts have allowed consideration of race in hiring and promotion decisions to address past discrimination, the issue remains contentious, especially regarding layoff policies based on faculty diversity. Lower courts are divided on the matter, with some recognizing the importance of police force diversity for effective mission execution. Federal civil rights laws generally permit race consideration in hiring and promotion decisions only in response to proven past discrimination. Federal civil rights laws generally permit race consideration in hiring and promotion decisions only in response to proven past discrimination, without a rule of deference like that extended to educational institutions."
