    "content": "Recent changes in federal law expanded Medicaid eligibility to include poor non-elderly, childless adults who do not fit into traditional categories. To qualify for Medicaid, applicants must meet income and sometimes asset requirements tied to federal poverty levels. Medicaid beneficiaries receive services based on their eligibility classification, with the majority falling under the \"categorical needy\" group. The ACA requires a newly established group of poor nonelderly, non-pregnant adults with income below 133% FPL to receive Medicaid benchmark benefits. The Supreme Court ruled that states can refuse to expand Medicaid without losing current federal matching funds. States can refuse to participate in Medicaid expansion without losing current matching funds. Medically needy individuals may have higher income but still qualify for coverage. States can offer a more restrictive benefit package for the medically needy. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows states to tailor benefits for specific subpopulations through negotiated waivers with CMS. Medicaid benefits vary by eligibility classifications, with mandatory services including hospital and physician services, while optional benefits may include prescribed drugs and clinic services. Different subpopulations may have access to varied benefit packages under traditional Medicaid. Medicaid benefits for various groups include prescribed drugs, clinic services, services from licensed practitioners, nursing facility services for individuals under 21, physical therapy, and prosthetic devices. Coverage can vary by state, even for mandatory benefits, with federal guidelines ensuring services are sufficient and beneficiaries have provider choice. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to modify Medicaid rules through waivers. States can enroll specific groups in benchmark benefit packages instead of traditional Medicaid, with options for sub-state areas and specific subpopulations. Full benefit eligibles may be required to enroll in Medicaid benchmark benefits. Eligibility for Medicaid benchmark benefit packages is based on a reduction of countable income for medical or remedial care costs. Certain groups, such as those with special health care needs, are exempt from mandatory enrollment in benchmark plans. These exempted populations may receive traditional Medicaid benefits or have the option to enroll voluntarily in benchmark plans. Benchmark benefit packages may cover fewer benefits than traditional Medicaid but must include certain requirements like EPSDT and transportation to medical providers. The benchmark options for Medicaid coverage must have the same actuarial value as specified plans and include essential services like hospital care, physician services, emergency care, and preventive care. Additionally, coverage must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of the benchmark plan. Starting in 2014, benchmark and benchmark-equivalent Medicaid coverage must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of the applicable benchmark plan for vision care and hearing services. Coverage for children under 21 must include EPSDT, and beneficiaries must have access to services from rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. Additionally, both benchmark packages must cover essential health benefits such as ambulatory patient services, emergency care, hospitalization, maternity care, mental health services, prescription drugs, and rehabilitative services. The federal mental health parity requirements, established in the Public Health Service Act, mandate that mental health services coverage should be on par with medical and surgical services in terms of treatment limitations, financial requirements, and covered benefits under insurance plans. Managed care plans in traditional Medicaid and benchmark packages must comply with these requirements. Benchmark packages in traditional Medicaid must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, including parity in treatment limitations and financial requirements. States have had the authority to implement benchmark benefit packages in their Medicaid programs since 2005. As of December 2012, 12 states and one territory (Guam) had approved benchmark plans, with some states offering more than one benchmark plan. In 10 states and Guam, benchmark plans tailored to specific populations were used. Missouri's plan was similar to FEHBP Blue Cross/Blue Shield PPO. Kentucky had a plan equivalent to a state employee health plan. Wisconsin offered coverage through United Health Care Choice Plus Plan for pregnant women and infants. Benchmark plans were available statewide in eight states and Guam. In some states, benchmark plans were limited to specific sub-state areas, while in others, they were available statewide. Covered services varied by state, including preventive and primary care services, support services for individuals with disabilities and the elderly, and other plan characteristics. Across 18 state/plan combinations, there was an even split between mandatory and voluntary enrollment in benchmark programs. Fee-for-service or a combination of fee-for-service and managed care were the most common service delivery systems. It is uncertain how these state experiences will impact the design of Medicaid benchmark plans in 2014 for non-elderly, non-pregnant adults with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. States without experience may look to those that have implemented benchmark packages for guidance.
