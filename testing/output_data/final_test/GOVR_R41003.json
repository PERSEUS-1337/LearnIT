    "content": "Congress uses conference committees and amendments between the houses to resolve differences in legislation. Conference committees are formed by the House and Senate, with appointed conferees negotiating compromise legislation. This method is used for major bills with complex policy issues. Exchanging amendments between the houses is more common for smaller differences. In recent Congresses, the use of conference committees to resolve differences has decreased. Regardless of the formal parliamentary mechanism chosen, the chambers generally arrive at a resolution of substantive differences through informal, bicameral discussions. This process may resemble conference committee negotiations, even if no conferees have been officially appointed. Once a compromise is negotiated, it can be embodied in an amendment between the houses or a conference report. The difference lies in the formal appointment of conferees. The report explains procedural options for resolving differences through amendments between the houses as an alternative to a conference committee. It discusses key procedural differences and lists them in tables for the Senate and House. The report outlines procedural options for resolving differences between the House and Senate through amendments, highlighting key details in separate text boxes. It describes a complex case of amendment exchange from the 110th Congress to illustrate possible actions. Both chambers must agree on the same legislative language in the same bill or resolution before it can be sent to the President. Only one legislative vehicle, either with a Senate (S. or S.J.Res.) or House (H.R. or H.J.Res.) designation, is presented to the President after passage by both chambers. When one chamber passes a bill, it sends it to the other chamber, which refers it to committee. Both chambers must pass the same bill with the same text for it to become law. If the second chamber agrees to the bill without amendment, it is sent to the President. This process is common, with many bills passing without amendment, especially those of lesser significance. When major legislation is passed without amendment by the second-acting chamber, it reflects negotiations between chambers beforehand. Most major legislation is not passed without amendment. Both the House and Senate often initiate legislation on major policy topics. The House and Senate must select a single measure with identical text for it to become law. When major legislation is passed, the House and Senate must select a single measure with identical text for it to become law. The selection of the measure does not restrict either chamber from acting on its preferred legislative language. The bill that passes a chamber first and is sent to the other chamber is normally the one selected as the vehicle for resolution. Both chambers can amend the legislation sent by the other chamber. The Constitution requires revenue provisions to originate in the House, including appropriations measures. The House bill number is assigned to measures raising revenues or providing for appropriations. Committees from both chambers consider legislation independently, but eventually, one bill is selected as the vehicle sent to the President. The selection of the vehicle sent to the President is either done at the start of floor consideration or at the very end. It can be done at the beginning if one chamber has passed a bill on the subject, in which case the other chamber might choose to take up that bill instead of crafting its own legislation. This can be done by presenting a full-text substitute amendment or by taking up a bill reported from its own committee. At the conclusion of floor consideration, the chambers can fulfill the requirement by selecting the same bill. The chambers fulfill the first requirement by selecting the same bill. The second step involves agreeing on the same legislative language, which can be achieved through an amendment exchange or a conference committee to resolve differences. The report discusses parliamentary procedures for resolving differences between chambers through amendment exchange before resorting to a conference committee. It focuses on the steps leading up to the stage of disagreement when both chambers usually form a conference committee. When the House amends a bill passed by the Senate, it sends the amendments back with a message to the Senate. The Senate can choose to hold the amendments for full Senate action without referring them to committee. Majority leader typically handles motions regarding House amendments. Senate Rule VII, paragraph 3, deems House amendments \"privileged for consideration\" in the Senate. House amendments are \"privileged for consideration\" in the Senate, allowing a Senator to request their presentation. The majority leader usually requests the House amendments to be laid before the Senate, followed by a motion to dispose of them. Unlike House bills, House amendments can be called up in the Senate without debate. House amendments, unlike House bills, can be called up in the Senate without debate. The Senate can end debate on the main question by invoking cloture, which requires a three-fifths vote and can take up to 30 additional hours for consideration. This process can be time-consuming if there is opposition to calling up a bill. The Senate may need to go through the cloture process twice, once on the motion to proceed to a bill and a second time on the bill itself. When a legislative proposal is called up as a House amendment, the process can be expedited as cloture would only need to be invoked on the question of disposing of the House amendment. The Senate has several options when dealing with House amendments, including laying them on the table, concurring with amendments, concurring without amendments, or disagreeing. The Senate has several options when dealing with House amendments, including laying them on the table, concurring with amendments, concurring without amendments, or disagreeing. If the chambers have reached a stage of disagreement, a motion to recede might be considered to reverse a chamber's previous stance on an amendment and bring them closer to agreement. The Senate has options for dealing with House amendments, including laying them on the table, concurring with amendments, or disagreeing. If there is a stage of disagreement, a motion to recede can be considered to reverse a chamber's previous stance on an amendment. The procedures for handling House amendments depend on whether a single full substitute or separate amendments have been proposed. When the Senate receives an amendment from the House, they can choose to lay it on the table, concur with it, or disagree. If there is disagreement, a motion to recede can be used to reverse a chamber's previous stance. The procedures for handling House amendments vary depending on whether a full substitute or separate amendments are proposed. In the Senate, when faced with a House amendment, options include laying it on the table, agreeing, or disagreeing. If the House amendment is not a result of negotiations, the majority leader may propose to disagree or lay it on the table, which does not require a three-fifths majority vote. This action returns the papers to the House. When the Senate tables a House amendment, it sends a message of disagreement to the House. The majority leader may choose to table the amendment for an immediate vote, avoiding a lengthy disagreement process. Alternatively, the Senate may concur with a House amendment by proposing a further amendment, often the result of bicameral negotiations. This further amendment could be a compromise between the two chambers. The Senate has the option to propose amendments to House amendments, which are required to be read out loud but can be waived by unanimous consent. There is a limit to the number of times amendments can be proposed as the bill shuttles back and forth between chambers. The chamber that acts second on the bill determines the text subject to further amendment in two degrees. The Senate can propose amendments to House amendments, with a limit on the number of rounds of exchanges. The number of rounds can be waived by unanimous consent in the Senate. If the House has already extended the rounds past four, the limitation does not apply. If the Senate receives a House amendment in the second or third degree, a motion to concur with an amendment would require unanimous consent. When a motion to concur with an amendment is made in the Senate, a Senator can offer a second-degree amendment to the original motion. This amendment is not part of the regular amendment exchange but is a Senate floor amendment proposed to a House amendment. The Senate may agree to multiple floor amendments before voting on the motion to concur with an amendment. If passed, the Senate sends a single amended Senate amendment to the House. If the Senate agrees to a motion, it sends a single Senate amendment to the House incorporating all changes agreed upon during floor consideration. The Senate must consider House amendments in order and can dispose of multiple amendments with one motion if they are to be handled the same way. For example, the majority leader could propose a single, debatable motion to concur in multiple House amendments. The Senate can consider multiple House amendments with one motion to concur, but if they wish to disagree to one amendment, separate motions are needed. Cloture can only be filed on a pending question under Senate Rule XXII, requiring multiple cloture filings for each House amendment. The Senate does not cast a final vote on a package of House amendments but only on remaining disagreements after passing the bill. The Senate can consider multiple House amendments with one motion to concur, but separate motions are needed to disagree with an amendment. Cloture can only be filed on a pending question under Senate Rule XXII, requiring multiple filings for each House amendment. The Senate does not cast a final vote on a package of House amendments but only on remaining disagreements after passing the bill. In situations where the Senate must dispose of multiple House amendments, the limitation on the number of rounds of amendment still applies. The Senate cannot change text that both chambers have agreed to, which can complicate the process. The Senate can consider multiple House amendments with one motion to concur, but separate motions are needed to disagree with an amendment. In situations where the Senate must dispose of multiple House amendments, the limitation on the number of rounds of amendment still applies. The Senate cannot change text that both chambers have agreed to, which can complicate the process, requiring unanimous consent in the Senate for any changes to be made. The Senate operates on a system of precedence for motions, where certain motions take priority over others. This system dictates the order in which motions can be offered and voted on, with motions to concur with an amendment, to concur, and to disagree being the available options. Once a motion is pending, motions of lower precedence cannot be offered until the pending motion is dealt with. The Senate majority leader has utilized this system in recent Congresses. The Senate majority leader has used his preferential recognition to offer all available motions to dispose of a House amendment, a process known as \"filling the tree.\" This prevents other Senators from proposing alternative methods until one of the pending motions is dealt with. Filling the tree does not impact the right to debate but can block other proposals unless a coalition of at least 60 Senators is formed to invoke cloture. The Senate majority leader can \"fill the tree\" to block other Senators from proposing alternative methods to dispose of House amendments. This process involves offering all available motions, such as the motion to concur with an amendment, with the goal of preventing other Senators from offering amendments. The Senate majority leader can \"fill the tree\" to block other Senators from proposing alternative methods to dispose of House amendments by offering motions like the motion to concur with an amendment. This allows the majority leader to prevent other Senators from offering amendments. The Senate majority leader can \"fill the tree\" to block alternative methods for disposing of House amendments by offering motions like the motion to concur with an amendment. This prevents other Senators from proposing amendments. Senators can also offer motions to refer House amendments to a Senate committee, with non-binding instructions for further examination. If agreed to, the committee decides on further action. The Senate majority leader can limit opportunities for Senators to bring policy subjects before the Senate by offering motions to dispose of House amendments and filling the tree to prevent additional motions. Once cloture is invoked, any pending motion to refer would be dropped. It is not necessary to file cloture on each pending motion separately to end consideration of the motions. The Senate can invoke cloture on the motion of lowest precedence, causing higher precedence motions to fall. If cloture is invoked on a motion to concur, higher-precedence motions remain pending. At the end of 30 hours of debate, votes would occur on the remaining motions. The Senate can invoke cloture on the motion of lowest precedence, causing higher precedence motions to fall. If cloture is invoked on a motion to concur, higher-precedence motions remain pending. Votes would occur on the remaining motions after 30 hours of debate. If the Senate has multiple House amendments to consider, the majority leader might fill the tree to preclude other Senators from proposing alternative actions. The Senate can invoke cloture on motions, potentially causing time-consuming consideration of House amendments. Conference reports and House amendments are debatable and may require 60 Senators to end debate. Procedural distinctions exist between the two. The Senate can invoke cloture on motions, potentially causing time-consuming consideration of House amendments. Conference committees require formal action to initiate creation, generally by unanimous consent or expedited cloture with three-fifths Senate support. Prior to rule change, objections to unanimous consent requests led to resolving differences through amendments between houses instead of conference committees. Amendments between houses have fewer constraints on content compared to conference reports. In bicameral compromise situations, amendments between houses may not be subject to points of order that would apply to conference reports. Senate rules allow matters in a conference report to be considered within the scope of differences between House and Senate versions of a bill. Senate Rule XXVIII does not restrict the content of bicameral compromises. In the 110th Congress, the Senate changed how points of order raised under amendments between houses are handled. In the 110th Congress, the Senate changed the process for handling points of order raised under amendments between houses, allowing for a separate vote on waiving the rule. Bicameral meetings can result in compromises embodied in either an amendment or a conference report, with the House requiring at least one public meeting. The House requires at least one public meeting for bicameral negotiations, where Senators and Representatives discuss disagreements. Unlike conference committees, negotiators are not formally identified, and discussions leading to compromises are not public. Senate rules mandate a joint explanatory statement for every conference report. The Senate rules require a majority of conferees from both chambers to sign the conference report and joint explanatory statement. The report must be made available to Members and the public 48 hours before the vote, with the option to waive this requirement with a three-fifths majority vote or joint agreement. Senate Rule XXVIII, paragraph 1 states that a conference report must be available on each Senator's desk before the Senate may consider it. Some requirements apply to amendment exchange procedures but not to conference reports. Conference reports are not required to be read if available in the Senate, and the text of a House amendment is also not read under Senate precedents. The Senate Rule XXVIII requires a conference report to be available on each Senator's desk before consideration. Unlike conference reports, House amendments are not required to be read under Senate precedents. If a Senator proposes the chamber concur in the House amendment with an amendment, the further amendment must be read unless waived by unanimous consent. A standing order allows for a nondebatable motion to waive the reading of an amendment submitted at least 72 hours before the motion. Amendment exchange may involve multiple questions, and conference committee reports usually result in full agreement, leading to a single action by the Senate: approval or disapproval. The Senate takes a single action of approval or disapproval of the conference report. When the House sends multiple amendments, the Senate may not be able to resolve differences with a single action. Procedural differences are not the only factors influencing decisions on resolving chamber differences. Timing, policy disagreements, and negotiators' roles are also considered. Amendments from the Senate are usually held at the Speaker's table for later consideration. When the House receives amendments from the Senate, they are held at the Speaker's table for later consideration. The House can take various actions on the amendments, such as proposing changes, agreeing, or disagreeing. The options mirror those available to the Senate on House amendments. The House can agree, disagree, or recede from positions on Senate amendments. There is a limit on the number of times the bill can be passed back and forth between chambers. The House can override this limit with a majority vote. The House can dispose of Senate amendments through expedited processes like a special rule, motion to suspend the rules, or unanimous consent. A privileged resolution reported by the Rules Committee can set the terms for consideration of a Senate amendment. The Rules Committee may report a special rule allowing the House to take up a Senate amendment and dispose of it by agreeing to a motion to concur or concur with an amendment. The House can dispose of Senate amendments through expedited processes like a special rule, motion to suspend the rules, or unanimous consent. A special rule reported by the Rules Committee may allow the House to consider a Senate amendment by agreeing to a motion to concur or concur with an amendment. Typically, the House first considers the special rule and then the motion to dispose of the Senate amendment. The Rules Committee may report a special rule allowing for the consideration of a motion to dispose of Senate amendments. These \"self-executing\" rules eliminate the need for separate consideration of the motion. They often include provisions for the formation of a conference committee and the submission of explanatory statements. The Rules Committee has the authority to submit a statement explaining House amendments to Senate amendments for printing in the Congressional Record. This statement resembles a joint explanatory statement and can be inserted with unanimous consent if not included in the special rule. Unlike initial consideration of a bill, consideration of Senate amendments does not typically allow for a motion to recommit from a minority party member. The Rules Committee can report a special rule for the disposition of Senate amendments without allowing a motion to recommit. Separate votes may be held on each House amendment when considering a motion to concur with Senate amendments. The House only needs to agree to any changes at this stage. The House agreed to multiple separate amendments to Senate amendments on various bills, providing flexibility in structuring votes. In one case, amendments were related to different committee jurisdictions and a bipartisan proposal on housing foreclosure laws. In another case, different committees worked on amendments to the Senate amendment. The House agreed to multiple separate amendments to Senate amendments on various bills, providing flexibility in structuring votes. One amendment was the text of the consolidated appropriations act, while another extended and modified tax credits. In another example, the House agreed to two separate amendments to an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, providing funding for government agencies and programs, as well as funding for the Iraq War and Gulf Coast recovery. The House passed two separate amendments to Senate-approved legislation, allowing for separate votes on key issues related to the Iraqi government. Special rules were implemented to limit debate time and ensure separate votes on each amendment. In the 111th Congress, special rules allowed the House to hold separate votes on portions of a single amendment, ensuring the Senate received one consolidated amendment for consideration. This streamlined the process by avoiding multiple motions for separate House amendments. In the 111th Congress, special rules allowed separate votes on different portions of a House amendment, ensuring the Senate received a single consolidated amendment. In the 114th Congress, the House took separate votes on different titles of a Senate amendment, with failure to pass any part resulting in no disposition of the Senate amendment. The House can agree to suspend the rules to dispose of Senate amendments with a two-thirds vote. This procedural option is used when a large majority of the House supports the proposed action. The House casts one vote to suspend the rules and agree to a motion for disposing of the Senate amendment, debated for up to 40 minutes. No further motions are allowed once the rules are suspended. The House can suspend rules on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays to consider Senate amendments. It may also agree to suspend rules and concur in a Senate amendment with an amendment. If used for this purpose, the House might agree to a resolution stating the Senate amendment be agreed to with the amendment printed in the resolution. The House can agree to Senate amendments by unanimous consent, especially at the end of a session when time is limited. The chair of the committee may request unanimous consent to take the bill and Senate amendments from the Speaker's table, followed by a motion to concur in the amendments. Alternatively, the floor manager may make a single unanimous consent request to take the bill and concur in the Senate amendments. The House may also enter into a unanimous consent agreement setting a total time for debate on the motion to concur. The House can agree to Senate amendments by unanimous consent, especially at the end of a session when time is limited. The chair of the committee or their designee typically makes the unanimous consent request to dispose of Senate amendments, after clearing it with relevant leadership. This process is distinct from the initial passage of the measure. The House may not necessarily have a single vote on Senate amendments, as they could be considered as separate amendments. Conference committee reports are typically considered under a special rule that waives points of order, making the process similar to considering amendments between the houses. Bicameral compromises must stay within the scope of differences between the House and Senate. The special rule for considering conference reports can protect them from points of order, and waivers can modify how amendments between the houses are handled. Procedural distinctions exist between conference committee procedures and amendments between the House and Senate. Procedural distinctions exist between conference committee procedures and amendments between the House and Senate. In the House, a motion to instruct conferees can be offered by a minority party member, directing the House conferees on a specific issue. This motion is not binding, but allows minority party members to present their views. If differences are resolved through amendment exchange instead of a conference committee, there is no opportunity to offer a motion to instruct conferees. Under House Rule XXII, conference committee meetings must be open to the public, with at least one public meeting required after conferees are appointed. The chair should ensure all members are notified of meetings and that disagreements are discussed. Managers must have access to the conference agreement for signatures. While these requirements can be waived, conference committees typically follow these guidelines. Negotiation meetings leading to a compromise do not have the same requirements. The Speaker can appoint conferees for a limited purpose, especially when matters in conference involve multiple standing committees. A conference committee may form subconferences to consider specific issues, but negotiations among conferees are generally less structured. The House requires that a majority of conferees be appointed for each portion of the conference report. The House appoints conferees for specific purposes, with a majority required to sign the report. This structured process guides negotiators in their responsibilities. In contrast, informal bicameral negotiations lack such requirements. House rules mandate a joint explanatory statement with every conference report. The joint explanatory statement, or managers' statement, is required for every conference report in the House. This document explains each chamber's position and the conference committee's recommendations on disagreements. Special rules can allow for additional explanatory material to be included in the Congressional Record. Clause 9 of House Rule XXI mandates disclosure of congressional earmarks, tax benefits, and tariff benefits in conference reports. This rule can be waived by a special rule, but a point of order can be raised against the waiver. The point of order leads to a debatable question on considering the conference report. This rule does not apply to amendments between houses. The consideration of a conference report allows for a motion to recommit by the minority party, which is not debatable. In one case in the 110th Congress, the Senate passed H.R. 3221 with amendments and sent it to the House for further consideration. In May, the House passed three separate amendments to the Senate full-text substitute, addressing different titles within the jurisdiction of House committees. House Amendment No. 1 focused on a \"housing package\" based on bills from the House Financial Services Committee. House Amendment No. 2 included text from a housing assistance tax bill from the House Ways and Means Committee. House Amendment No. 3 proposed a new section regarding state laws regulating foreclosure. The Senate considered House amendments that affected the Senate text, reorganizing them into nine separate amendments. The amendments included striking and inserting various titles related to housing and tax laws. On June 19, 2008, the majority leader proposed a bipartisan Senate amendment to replace the \"housing package\" of the other chamber. The Senate required that all amendments offered that day be on the subject of housing, with no other motions allowed except to table and reconsider. On July 19, Senators offered six amendments to the Senate amendment offered by the majority leader to the first House amendment. Senators asked for unanimous consent to set aside pending amendments to offer their own amendments, but this was not always granted. The majority leader filed cloture on the motion to concur with an amendment on June 20, 2008, and the Senate agreed to invoke cloture on June 24 by a vote of 83-9. The Senate agreed to three of the six amendments offered to the proposed amendment by a vote of 83-9. These amendments were incorporated into the Senate amendment to the first House amendment before the Senate agreed to the motion to concur in the first House amendment with an amendment on June 25. On June 26, the majority leader moved for the Senate to concur in the next six House amendments as reorganized by the Senate. Each House amendment proposed to strike a title of the Senate substitute for H.R. 3221. The House amendments proposed to strike a title of the Senate substitute for H.R. 3221. The majority leader filed cloture on the motion to concur, which took precedence over other motions. No motions to disagree or amend were allowed as the House amendments were simple motions to strike. The Senate had agreed that no further motions to refer would be allowed during consideration of the House message. On July 8, 2008, the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendments. The majority leader made a motion for the Senate to disagree with two House amendments and filed cloture on the motion. He then filled the tree with a motion to concur in the House amendment adding a new title with amendments. The Senate agreed to a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to disagree with the final two House amendments, leading to the motion to concur with an amendment and the amendment falling when cloture was invoked. The Senate invoked cloture on the motion to disagree with House amendments, leading to the amendment falling. The Senate then agreed to the motion to disagree and sent a message to the House outlining its actions. The Senate combined the matters in disagreement into a single large amendment. The Senate combined matters in disagreement into a single large amendment, sending a message to the House outlining their actions on the housing bill. The House agreed to the Senate amendment with an amendment, proposing changes to the bill. The House amended the Senate amendment to the housing bill, resulting from bicameral negotiations. The House was able to offer a further amendment due to a special rule, despite precedents limiting amendments to two degrees. The majority leader proposed that the Senate agree with the final bicameral compromise. The majority leader proposed that the Senate agree with the final bicameral compromise on the housing bill. He made tree-filling motions to prevent other Senators from making additional motions, including a motion to concur in the House amendment and amendments to it. After filing cloture on the motion to concur, he asked for unanimous consent to limit further amendments, but a Senator reserved the right to offer one. The Senate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to concur with a House amendment by a vote of 80-13. The Senate then voted to concur in the House amendment, clearing the measure to be sent to the President. Data on resolving differences were collected for recent Congresses from the House Final Calendars for measures that became public law. The data on conference committees presented in Table A-1 excludes committees on measures that do not become law or were vetoed after going through conference committee."
