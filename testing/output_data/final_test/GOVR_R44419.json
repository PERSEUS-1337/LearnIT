    "content": "Nearly thirty years ago, at Justice Scalia's swearing-in ceremony, President Reagan quoted Justice Frankfurter on the importance of subordinating personal views to the law. Reagan believed Scalia's commitment to judicial restraint and deference to democratic institutions justified his nomination to the Supreme Court. Scalia's jurisprudence was influenced by his concerns about the judiciary's role in a democratic society. Justice Scalia's dissenting opinions criticized the majority's view of the federal judiciary's role in a democratic society. He warned against unelected judges imposing their own beliefs as law, undermining democracy. Justice Scalia advocated for originalism in constitutional interpretation to prevent judges from imposing their own political values on the Constitution, which he believed undermined the American democratic system. Justice Scalia advocated for originalism in constitutional interpretation to prevent judges from imposing their own political values on the Constitution. He believed this approach constrained judicial discretion by establishing historical criteria separate from personal preferences. Scalia's originalism was evident in the 2008 decision on the Second Amendment, where the Court recognized an individual right to possess firearms. Scalia also emphasized the importance of creating specific rules over broad principles to limit judicial discretion in legal matters. Justice Scalia advocated for originalism in constitutional interpretation to prevent judges from imposing their own political values on the Constitution. He established bright-line rules in areas of constitutional law and defended the judicial branch's role as a check on democratic institutions. In recent years, he criticized the Roberts Court for shirking its job. Justice Scalia criticized the Roberts Court for avoiding constitutional questions and diverging from originalism. He prioritized textual and rules-based statutory interpretation, emphasizing his views over legal precedents and stare decisis. While advocating for judicial restraint, he believed in an active judiciary. Justice Scalia was known for his textualist approach to statutory interpretation, focusing on construing statutes based on their text, context, and structure rather than extrinsic evidence of Congress' intent. He also advocated for clear criteria and canons of statutory interpretation, reflecting his beliefs on the proper role of the courts in the constitutional framework. These aspects of his jurisprudence can be seen as reactions to prevailing approaches since the New Deal era. Justice Scalia's textualist approach to statutory interpretation focused on the ordinary meaning of words and skepticism of legislative history materials, influencing his colleagues and others in approaching statutory text. His emphasis on clear criteria and canons of interpretation reflected his views on the courts' role in the constitutional framework. In MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Justice Scalia emphasized that the language in the Federal Communications Act did not permit \"basic and fundamental changes\" to the statute, highlighting the original meaning of \"modify\" as incremental or limiting. He rejected concerns about rigid literalism depriving the FCC of flexibility in implementing core policies, stating that interpretations cannot change the Act's meaning. Justice Scalia emphasized that the Federal Communications Act establishes a rate-regulation system and the Commission cannot alter the statutory filed rate requirements based on its desire to increase competition. He believed that the statute's purpose should be ascertained from its text, and legislative history materials should not be considered in statutory interpretation. Textualism, as advocated by Justice Scalia, involves refusing to consider legislative history materials when interpreting statutory text. He believed that only the text of the enacted statute is relevant, citing constitutional reasons and questioning the legitimacy of using materials not drafted or considered by legislators. Justice Scalia opposed the use of legislative history materials in interpreting statutes, fearing judges could cherry-pick materials to support their own views. He believed using such materials provided a false lesson in the law and disrupted the interpretation of unambiguous statutes. However, he was open to considering legislative history to understand the context in which specific words were used. Justice Scalia's opinions on administrative law reflect his text-based approach to statutory interpretation and commitment to bright-line rules. In FCC v. Fox Television Stations, the Supreme Court ruled that the APA did not authorize heightened review in situations where an agency changed its policy. In FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Justice Scalia reversed a lower court practice that imposed judicially created standards on agencies beyond the text of the APA. He rejected the idea of heightened scrutiny for independent agencies, emphasizing the importance of not allowing Article III judges to expropriate power from the Executive branch. Scalia also resisted modifying the doctrine of judicial deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Justice Scalia supported the Chevron deference doctrine as a background principle for Congress to legislate, but disagreed with limitations imposed by the Court in United States v. Mead. He believed that the Court's failure to provide clear rules on when Chevron deference applied would lead to confusion. Justice Scalia criticized the Court for not establishing clear rules on when Chevron deference applies, arguing that Skidmore deference is impractical. He also objected to the Court's opinion in National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Service, stating that it would cause confusion for lower courts. Justice Scalia criticized the Court for not establishing clear rules on when Chevron deference applies, arguing that Skidmore deference is impractical. He also objected to the Court's opinion in National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Service, stating that it would cause confusion for lower courts. Chevron applies even to an agency's interpretation of a statute that is ambiguous concerning the agency's jurisdiction, as Justice Scalia reasoned that almost any question concerning an agency's authority could be framed as jurisdictional. Justice Scalia had a significant impact on modern jurisprudence regarding \"standing\" in federal courts, emphasizing the importance of separation of powers and preventing judicial overreach. He argued that the doctrine of standing is crucial in maintaining self-governance and preventing courts from intruding on issues better left to the political branches. Justice Scalia had a significant impact on modern jurisprudence regarding \"standing\" in federal courts, emphasizing the importance of separation of powers and preventing judicial overreach. He authored key opinions, including in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, which set the foundation for modern standing law by denying standing to organizations challenging environmental regulations. Scalia's approach restricted access to courts for those challenging administrative agency actions and he rigorously dissented in cases where the Court relaxed its standing requirements. Justice Scalia's absence from the Court could impact the standing doctrine and plaintiffs' ability to challenge administrative agencies. He was not present for the landmark death penalty ruling in Furman v. Georgia, which initially prohibited capital punishment in many states. The Court later reversed this decision in Gregg v. Georgia. The Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia initially banned capital punishment in many states, but this was later reversed in Gregg v. Georgia. Justice Scalia disagreed with the Court's recent capital punishment jurisprudence, arguing that it was not grounded in the original meaning of the Constitution. Justice Scalia consistently dissented in cases restricting the use of capital punishment for specific groups of defendants, such as minors and the cognitively disabled, arguing that the Eighth Amendment should evolve with society's standards of decency. Justice Scalia disagreed with his fellow Justices on the Constitution's stance on capital punishment, particularly in cases like Baze v. Rees where lethal injection protocols were challenged. He argued that the Constitution leaves such decisions to elected legislatures, not the courts. In a later case in 2015, the Court upheld Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol with Justice Scalia in the majority. Justice Breyer dissented in the case upholding Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol, arguing that the death penalty likely violates the Eighth Amendment. Justice Scalia, in a concurrence, emphasized that the decision on the death penalty should be left to the people, not the courts. Scalia's views on capital punishment and the Eighth Amendment may play a significant role if the Court reconsiders previous rulings. The Roberts Court has been noted for favoring business interests, especially in limiting civil liability. The Roberts Court has been favoring business interests by limiting civil liability, especially in cases involving faulty products, discriminatory practices, or fraudulent activity. Justice Scalia supported reducing businesses' exposure to civil suits, diverging from his colleagues on the Court. This stance is part of a broader debate on civil liability reform, with business groups arguing against frivolous lawsuits and plaintiffs' bar advocating for access to courts for legitimate claimants. Justice Scalia, favoring textualism, interpreted federal law to limit state tort remedies, preempting common-law tort claims and positively enacted laws, reducing civil defendants' monetary liability. In cases like Cipollone v. Liggett Group and Medtronic v. Lohr, the Court debated the displacement of state laws by federal statutes, with Justice Scalia often dissenting. In his later years on the Court, Justice Scalia began garnering majorities for his views on preemption and state tort claims. For example, in 2008, in Riegel v. Medtronic, Justice Scalia authored an opinion on behalf of a seven-member majority holding that a provision of the federal Medical Device Act preempts state common-law claims challenging the safety or effectiveness of medical devices that received premarket approval from the FDA. In Riegel v. Medtronic, Justice Scalia's opinion established that the term \"requirements\" in a statute includes common-law duties. This reflected a trend in the Roberts Court to interpret federal laws broadly, displacing state tort claims against product manufacturers and limiting civil liability exposure. Scalia also influenced restrictions on class action lawsuits. In 2011, Justice Scalia ruled in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts California's doctrine on class action arbitration waivers. Two years later, in American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant, he held that courts cannot invalidate contractual waivers of class arbitration. Scalia also authored opinions that raised the evidentiary bar for proving claims under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Justice Scalia's recent opinions on class action litigation have made class certification increasingly challenging for plaintiffs. His absence could affect the outcome of cases on the Supreme Court's docket, as seen with Dow Chemical settling a pending class action for $835 million after his death. Scalia's importance for civil liability issues on the Court is highlighted, especially in the realm of class action litigation. Justice Scalia's dissenting opinions on gay rights cases were well-known, including his opposition to rulings on Colorado's anti-discrimination amendment, privacy rights for gay individuals, federal marriage laws, and same-sex marriage legalization. Justice Scalia's dissenting opinions on gay rights cases, including same-sex marriage legalization, reflect his view that such decisions should be left to the democratic process, not based on constitutional principles like equal protection or due process. He also opposed affirmative action, voting against policies that establish racial preferences in admissions to schools. Justice Scalia questioned the constitutionality of affirmative action in various contexts, including minority contracting and employment, due to his belief that racial preferences violate the equal protection guarantee of the Constitution. In employment cases, his opinions sometimes favored employers, such as rejecting class action status for female employees suing for pay discrimination and dissenting on a pregnancy discrimination claim. Justice Scalia's approach to constitutional interpretation relied on originalism and bright-line rules, leading to decisions that protected the individual rights of criminal suspects and defendants. He ruled in favor of employees in cases involving same-sex sexual harassment, retaliation claims by third parties, and religious discrimination claims. Justice Scalia's approach to constitutional interpretation focused on originalism and bright-line rules, leading to decisions that protected the individual rights of criminal suspects and defendants, particularly in cases involving the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the Confrontation Clause right of criminal defendants at trial, and the rule of lenity derived from the Due Process Clause. In the 2012 GPS tracking case, United States v. Jones, Scalia showed solicitude for defendants' rights by ruling against the government's warrantless surveillance. In United States v. Jones, Justice Scalia focused on whether a physical intrusion on a car would constitute a trespass at common law, expanding the definition of a Fourth Amendment search. This decision favored the criminal defendant and set a precedent for future cases involving criminal suspects' rights. Justice Scalia applied the physical trespass test in Florida v. Jardines to invalidate the warrantless use of a drug-sniffing dog on a residence's porch. He emphasized that an officer's authority to gather information is limited when entering protected areas like a person's house. Additionally, Justice Scalia ruled in favor of criminal defendants in Sixth Amendment cases, particularly in Crawford v. Washington where he emphasized the right to confrontation over the reliability of witness statements. Justice Scalia, a proponent of jury trial rights, emphasized the Confrontation Clause's requirement for cross-examination to assess reliability. He defended the Clause's protections vigorously, objecting to limitations in a 2015 decision. With his absence, the future of cases like Crawford applying his trial-based approach is uncertain. The continuing vitality of Justice Scalia's trial-based approach in cases like Crawford is in question. His emphasis on jury rights led to landmark rulings in Apprendi v. New Jersey and Blakely v. Washington, shifting how criminal prosecutions operate. Scalia's stance favored defendants when laws were too vague, ensuring notice of their actions. In Johnson v. United States, Justice Scalia invalidated the \"residual clause\" of the Armed Career Criminal Act due to its vague language, which imposed a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a firearm after three previous convictions for \"violent felonies.\" Scalia emphasized the need for clarity in criminal statutes to avoid ambiguity and ensure notice of prohibited conduct. Justice Scalia relied on the rule of lenity to invalidate the ACCA's residual clause, emphasizing the need for clear laws to ensure due process. His influence on environmental law, shaped by his views on federalism and statutory interpretation, will continue through his impact on standing in cases like Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife. Scalia clarified limits on standing for environmental groups in federal court, requiring specific allegations of injury. He also defined regulatory takings in relation to property rights under the Fifth Amendment. Justice Scalia's decisions narrowed federal environmental regulatory efforts, particularly in cases like Rapanos v. United States, where he set a test for federal jurisdiction over wetlands and streams under the Clean Water Act. His rulings clarified limits on standing for environmental groups and defined regulatory takings in relation to property rights under the Fifth Amendment. Since Rapanos, lower courts have primarily used the \"significant nexus\" test from Justice Kennedy's concurrence to determine Clean Water Act jurisdiction. Justice Scalia rejected an environmental group's interpretation in Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper but agreed with environmental plaintiffs in cases like City of Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund regarding hazardous waste regulation. Scalia expressed skepticism of EPA regulation on air and climate issues. In 2001, Justice Scalia supported EPA's interpretation in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations regarding Clean Air Act regulations. However, he disagreed with EPA in cases like Michigan v. EPA on Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants. Scalia also dissented in Massachusetts v. EPA on greenhouse gases but later joined the majority in American Electric. In American Electric Power v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA's authority to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions displaced common-law nuisance lawsuits. In Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, Justice Scalia upheld EPA's authority to regulate GHGs but struck down part of its stationary source permitting rule, showing skepticism towards agencies claiming unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy without clear congressional authorization. Justice Scalia's passing has raised skepticism towards the Clean Power Plan, with his language from previous cases being used in challenges against the rule. The Supreme Court's stay on the plan was seen as a sign of doubt, but with Scalia gone, the rule's prospects are uncertain. Scalia's contribution to federalism jurisprudence was significant, particularly in Printz v. United States where he emphasized the Tenth Amendment's role in limiting federal power over states. This marked a shift in the Court's interpretation, striking down provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Justice Scalia solidified the anti-commandeering principles of the Tenth Amendment, stating that the federal government cannot compel state officials to enforce federal regulations. While he supported limiting the scope of Congress's commerce power in some cases, he did not find a violation of federalism principles in Gonzales v. Raich. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Court upheld Congress's power to regulate marijuana cultivation despite state laws permitting it. Justice Scalia also discussed anti-commandeering principles in Branch v. Smith and rejected \"faux federalism\" arguments in City of Arlington v. FCC. Justice Scalia's interpretation of the dormant Commerce Clause and the Eleventh Amendment's provisions regarding state sovereign immunity sheds light on his views on federalism. He criticized the dormant Commerce Clause as a \"judicial fraud\" and a \"judge-invented rule,\" advocating for a strict textualist interpretation. This was evident in his dissenting opinion in Comptroller of the Treasury v. Wynne. Justice Scalia's interpretation of the dormant Commerce Clause and the Eleventh Amendment's provisions sheds light on his views on federalism. He criticized the dormant Commerce Clause as a \"judicial fraud\" and advocated for a strict textualist interpretation. Scalia suggested that the Eleventh Amendment should be understood based on the presupposition of the constitutional structure it confirms, immunizing states from a wide array of lawsuits. Justice Scalia joined in limiting Congress's ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity and defended the principle that states generally cannot be sued without consent. He wrote opinions on religious freedom, emphasizing the role of religion in US history and advocating for the separation of church and state. Justice Scalia's interpretation of the Establishment Clause prohibited the government from establishing an official church or mandating church attendance and financial support. However, he believed that references to religion in public life were permissible, and the government could favor religious practices. This view was evident in his opinions on various cases, including school prayer and public displays of religious symbols. Scalia's significant contribution to constitutional religious freedom was seen in the case of Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith. The landmark decision in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith clarified the standard of the Free Exercise Clause, lowering the constitutional barrier to rational basis review and barring religious objection as a basis for exemption from neutral laws of general applicability. The majority opinion authored by Justice Scalia explained that an individual's religious beliefs do not excuse them from complying with valid laws, leading to the enactment of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to provide heightened protection for religious exercise. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) prohibits the federal government from burdening religious exercise unless it has a compelling interest and uses the least restrictive means. In the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., closely held corporations were allowed to seek accommodation under RFRA. This decision contrasted with Justice Scalia's explanation in Smith that religious objections to generally applicable laws are not protected by the First Amendment. Hobby Lobby's case under RFRA reignited debates on religious freedom exemptions from neutral laws. The pending Zubik v. Burwell case may further clarify the \"substantial burden\" on religious exercise and exemptions under RFRA. The pending Zubik v. Burwell case is expected to clarify protections for religious exercise under RFRA and the legacy of Justice Scalia's opinion in Smith, particularly in relation to freedom of speech rights expanded by previous Courts. Justice Scalia believed that free speech interests should not be subordinate to the government's interests in national security, social order, and public morality. He was skeptical of speech restrictions that could be seen as the government favoring certain ideas, and his view has gained support on the Court, leading to the striking down of laws on free speech grounds by the Roberts Court. Amendment to strike down federal and state laws on free speech grounds, illustrated by Justice Scalia's concerns with regulating speech based on governmental disapproval of its message. In R.A.V. v. St. Paul, the Court invalidated a city ordinance prohibiting certain fighting words based on race, religion, or gender, objecting to singling out specific messages for prohibition. Justice Scalia's approach to free speech issues rejects most government regulations as violative of the First Amendment, particularly in campaign finance where regulations are based on the identity of the speaker or limit political speech without serving the interest of avoiding corruption. He warns against the government imposing ideological orthodoxy, as seen in his concerns with regulating speech based on disapproval of its message. In Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, Justice Scalia dissented from the Supreme Court's decision upholding a state law restricting corporate campaign expenditures, arguing that government censorship of political speech is incompatible with the First Amendment's central truth. In a concurrence to a pivotal case narrowing the scope of a federal law restricting corporate campaign expenditures, Justice Scalia criticized the decision in Austin as \"wrongly decided\" and rejected the principle of restricting political speech based on the corporate identity of the speaker. The Court's 2010 ruling in Citizens United overturned Austin, with Justice Scalia's influence evident in the majority opinion. Despite his general disapproval of campaign finance regulation, Justice Scalia supported disclosure requirements in certain cases. Justice Scalia supported disclosure requirements in certain cases, emphasizing the importance of accountability in electoral politics. In Doe v. Reed, he upheld a state law mandating public inspection of referendum petition signatures, stating that civic courage is essential for democracy. Justice Scalia's support for disclosure requirements in elections emphasized accountability in politics. He upheld a state law in Doe v. Reed, highlighting the importance of civic courage for democracy. Despite his approval of disclosure requirements, Scalia's interpretation of the First Amendment's freedom of speech clause made him wary of speech restrictions, even if they conflicted with his personal beliefs. Notably, he voted in favor of striking down a law prohibiting flag burning in Texas v. Johnson. Justice Scalia's support for disclosure requirements in elections emphasized accountability in politics. He upheld a state law in Doe v. Reed, highlighting the importance of civic courage for democracy. Despite his approval of disclosure requirements, Scalia's interpretation of the First Amendment's freedom of speech clause made him wary of speech restrictions. He voted in favor of striking down a law prohibiting flag burning in Texas v. Johnson, expressing his belief in the protection of freedom of speech, even for those critical of the government. In his most recent opinion on freedom of speech in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, Scalia rejected government attempts to restrict disfavored content, such as violent video games, showing his skepticism towards such regulations. Justice Scalia recognized limits to First Amendment protections, such as not protecting commercial Internet pornography or public displays of nudity. He highlighted the danger of government proscribing speech based on the ideas expressed, like violence or racism, rather than its objective effects. Despite not being a First Amendment absolutist, Scalia emphasized the importance of freedom of speech and was skeptical of government regulations on disfavored content like violent video games. Justice Scalia recognized limits to First Amendment protections, such as not protecting commercial Internet pornography or public displays of nudity. He also acknowledged the government's authority to regulate commercial speech more easily. Scalia defended the government's ability to decide what speech to fund and supported broad powers to control speech within public institutions. His views on freedom of speech were influential and complex, including criticism of using contemporary foreign law. Justice Scalia believed that while English common law could help interpret the Constitution, contemporary foreign practices were irrelevant and should be rejected as an interpretative aid. He argued that the U.S. legal system is distinct from foreign systems, making comparative analysis unhelpful and inappropriate for U.S. courts. Justice Scalia believed U.S. courts should consider decisions of other signatories when interpreting treaties, and federal statutes should align with international law. He disagreed with using foreign practices in U.S. legal interpretation. Justice Scalia disagreed with the majority's interpretation of an antitrust statute, arguing that applying the statute to conduct within a foreign state's jurisdiction would conflict with international legal principles of comity. He believed that statutes should not regulate foreign persons or conduct if it conflicts with international law, and that ratified treaties do not give Congress the power to legislate beyond its enumerated powers under the Constitution. Justice Scalia disagreed with the interpretation that ratified treaties give Congress the power to legislate beyond its enumerated powers under the Constitution. He believed that the Necessary and Proper Clause only allows Congress to assist in implementing the President's power to make treaties, not to enact legislation beyond that scope. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense. Justice Scalia's majority opinion emphasized an originalist interpretation of the Amendment's clauses. The Supreme Court's ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008 affirmed an individual's right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Justice Scalia's opinion highlighted the historical context and limitations of this right, stating that it does not extend to felons, the mentally ill, or certain sensitive locations. The Supreme Court's ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008 affirmed an individual's right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Heller is significant for its embrace of originalism and paving the way for more constitutional challenges to firearms laws. Lower courts have been left to address unresolved questions in Second Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's Heller decision affirmed the individual's right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. However, questions remain regarding the standard of judicial review and the nature of rights protected. Justices Scalia and Thomas have expressed concerns over lower courts' interpretation of firearms laws. The aim of constitutional separation of powers is to protect liberty, not ensure efficient government. Clarification and reexamination of the Second Amendment's contours are needed. The formalist and functionalist interpretations of separation of powers focus on structural divisions and core functions of government branches. Justice Scalia, a formalist, believed in strict adherence to constitutional rules to maintain liberty and prevent overlap in branch functions. Justice Scalia believed in the doctrine of separation of powers as a structural safeguard, emphasizing high walls and clear distinctions between the three branches of government. He rejected resolving interbranch disputes through deference to political branches, advocating for strict rules and structural safeguards to maintain equilibrium. The Constitution, in his view, does not allow any branch to cede its authority. Justice Scalia emphasized the separation of powers and rejected the idea of any branch ceding its authority. He believed in strict rules to maintain equilibrium between the branches and opposed shifting responsibilities between them. Scalia also rejected the notion of presidential acquisition of Senate turf and emphasized the importance of clear distinctions in the separation of powers. Justice Scalia emphasized the importance of determining whether the powers of a newly created government body are legislative, judicial, or executive to place it within the constitutional structure. He believed that the Constitution should dictate the permission to commingle powers, rather than a case-by-case analysis. Scalia acknowledged that some powers can be shared among branches based on the type of power, not on different divisions of authority. Justice Scalia objected to the Court's \"gerrymandering\" in defining presidential power in foreign affairs based on functional considerations and historical evidence, rather than the Constitution's separation of powers. He believed that congressional acts affecting executive power could be authorized by the Necessary and Proper Clause if necessary and proper, rejecting exclusive presidential authority. Justice Scalia criticized his colleagues for their \"Mr. Fix-It Mentality\" in overstepping judicial powers to ensure outcomes align with constitutional mandates. He believed the Court should not recognize informal arrangements between branches or rewrite policies to fit within constitutional bounds, emphasizing the importance of separation of powers principles in the Constitution. During his tenure on the Court, Justice Scalia criticized the substantive due process doctrine, which protects certain unenumerated liberty interests subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. The Court ruled in cases like Roe v. Wade that legislative restrictions on freedoms like marriage and contraceptives could not withstand this scrutiny. Scalia believed in upholding separation of powers principles and criticized judicial overreach in aligning outcomes with constitutional mandates. Justice Scalia's views on substantive due process were influenced by his concerns about judicial competency in determining protected rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. He believed that the Due Process Clause does not guarantee unspecified liberties but rather certain procedures to prevent deprivation of liberty. Scalia criticized the picking and choosing of rights for substantive due process protection, as it involves policymaking rather than neutral legal analysis. Justice Scalia believed that \"liberty\" interests protected under the Fourteenth Amendment should be determined by referencing relevant traditions. He often dissented on cases involving the criminalization of homosexual sodomy, restrictions on same-sex marriage, and abortion procedures, criticizing the Court's interpretation of the Due Process Clause. Justice Scalia criticized the Court's handling of abortion cases, arguing that the issue should be decided through the political process, not judicial intervention. He maintained that there is no constitutional right to abortion and that it distorts the public perception of the Court's role. Justice Scalia criticized the Court's handling of abortion cases, arguing that the issue should be decided through the political process, not judicial intervention. He maintained that there is no constitutional right to abortion and called for overturning the decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. Justice Scalia believed that the issue of abortion should be decided by the people, not the courts. He would likely have supported state requirements for abortion providers and strengthened private property rights during his tenure on the Court. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits government action by requiring just compensation for private property taken for public use. Courts initially interpreted this as only applying to physical takings, but later expanded to include regulatory takings. Justice Scalia authored opinions favoring landowners and restricting government devaluation of property without compensation. In Nollan v. Coastal California Commission, the Supreme Court ruled that conditioning a construction permit on granting an easement across private property constitutes a taking without just compensation, as per the Fifth Amendment. Justice Scalia's opinion set a concise test for such cases. Justice Scalia's opinion in Nollan established a test that new conditions on property must be \"reasonably related to the public need or burden.\" This decision influenced subsequent takings cases, including the \"rough proportionality\" test in Dolan v. City of Tigard, requiring the government to show a nexus and rough proportionality between the exaction and harm for it to stand. In Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, Justice Scalia established that government action depriving a property owner of all economically beneficial use of the property amounted to a taking requiring just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. Justice Scalia rejected previous Court decisions allowing government regulation without compensation for \"harmful or noxious uses\" of private property. He established a test in cases of \"total regulatory taking,\" stating that compensation is required if the regulation deprives the land of all economically beneficial use. This test involves examining the nature of the owner's estate and relevant property law principles to determine if the loss of use could have been achieved through other means. The Nollan and Lucas decisions by Justice Scalia expanded protection of private property rights under the Takings Clause, requiring just compensation if a taking occurs. Scalia's stance in takings cases continued with his dissent in Kelo v. City of New London, where the majority upheld eminent domain for economic development as a valid \"public use\" under the Fifth Amendment. Justice Scalia's dissent in Kelo v. City of New London upheld private property rights under the Takings Clause, invalidating a regulatory scheme for raisin growers."
