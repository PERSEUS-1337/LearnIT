    "content": "The Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes the Short-Term Energy and Winter Fuels Outlook (STEWFO) annually in October to estimate average annual heating fuel expenditures. Factors affecting expenses include regional differences, energy sources, home size, efficiency, temperature preferences, market size, and weather conditions. Main heating fuels in the US include natural gas, heating oil, propane, electricity, and wood products. Expenditures also depend on fuel prices, quantity used, and weather conditions measured by heating degree-days. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides heating degree-day estimates to the EIA for the STEWFO, which is a projection based on assumed values of key variables. Actual average heating expenditures will reflect differences if fuel price estimates or weather conditions vary from forecast trends. NOAA forecasts a 0.3% reduction in heating degree-days for the 2013-2014 season compared to the previous year for the US as a whole, with regional variations causing expenditure projections to differ. In the Northeast, heating degree-days are expected to increase by 3.4%, while in the West they are expected to decrease by 3.1%. The EIA projects U.S. household expenditure on heating fuel for the 2013-2014 season to rise for natural gas, electricity, and propane users, while those using heating oil will see a decline. Expenditures on natural gas are expected to increase the most in the Northeast, while expenditures on heating oil are expected to decline. Expenditures on propane are expected to increase by 10.6% in the Northeast and 9% in the Midwest, while electricity expenditures are expected to increase by 4% in the Northeast, 1.6% in the Midwest, 2.1% in the South, and 1.5% in the West. Price volatility in the world oil market can directly affect the cost of heating oil and propane, while variations in natural gas prices can impact households using that fuel and indirectly affect electricity prices. Consumption levels may be influenced by weather variations and changes in consumer habits. The U.S. natural gas market is part of a North American regional market, with over 90% of imports arriving by pipeline from Canada. Consumers include households, commercial customers, electric power generators, and industrial consumers. Winter conditions can affect consumption levels, especially for households, commercial users, and electric power generators. Winter conditions can impact natural gas consumption, particularly for households. Data shows stable winter gas consumption and prices from 2009-2013, with a slight increase projected for 2013-2014. The price-consumption relationship suggests inelastic demand in the household sector due to the necessity of home heating and lack of real-time information for consumers. The STEWFO projects a slight increase in total natural gas consumption for 2013-2014, with most of the growth expected in the industrial sector. U.S. natural gas production is also projected to increase slightly for 2014 compared to 2013. The relative weakness of wellhead natural gas prices from 2010 to 2013 reflects increased production from shale gas and other non-conventional sources, shifting exploration towards liquid deposits. Imports of natural gas are expected to decline by about 3% from 2012 to 2013, with the United States preparing to become an exporter of liquefied natural gas. Natural gas demand peaks in winter for households and commercial customers. At the beginning of the winter heating season in October 1, 2013, natural gas in storage was high at 3.5 trillion cubic feet, above the five-year average. Home heating oil prices are closely linked to crude oil and diesel fuel prices. Approximately 5.8% of U.S. households use oil for heating, mostly in the Northeast. The EIA predicts a small decline of $46, or 2%, in average home heating oil expenditures per household for the winter 2013-2014. Oil is the highest winter fuel expenditure at $2,046 per household, three times higher than natural gas at $679. Diesel fuel is pricier than gasoline, with a $0.30 per gallon difference. Home heating oil has a $0.10 per gallon premium over gasoline due to U.S. refiners focusing on gasoline production. Gasoline, diesel fuel, and home heating oil prices are linked to crude oil prices. Refiner's acquisition cost of crude oil is projected to fall to $101.70 per barrel in 2014. The refiner's acquisition cost of crude oil is projected to decrease to $101.70 per barrel in 2014 from $103.95 in 2013. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate averaged over $98 per barrel for the first three quarters of 2013. Oil prices can be volatile, with the key risk factor for home heating oil consumers being the price of crude oil. Overall liquid fuels consumption in the United States is expected to remain constant in 2014 compared to 2013, with gasoline consumption declining by 0.4% and distillate consumption increasing by 2.4%. Propane consumption for home heating is projected to increase by 9% in the 2013-2014 winter season, making it the second most expensive fuel. The number of households using propane has been declining for the past five years, with a further 2.1% decrease expected. Heating expenses for propane users are expected to rise by 9% in the Midwest and 10.6% in other regions. The EIA projects a 9% increase in propane expenditures for the 2013-2014 winter season, with prices varying between regions. Propane is a by-product of gasoline and natural gas production, leading to indirect price influences from factors affecting natural gas and home heating oil prices. Propane prices are indirectly influenced by factors such as distance and dispersion of consumers due to the high-cost delivery process. Electricity prices are linked to natural gas, coal, nuclear, and alternative fuel generating capacity. Approximately 40% of U.S. households use electricity as their primary heating source, with regional variations in usage. The number of households using electricity for space heating is expected to grow by 3% annually, driven by market expansion in the South. Propane and heating oil customers are declining by 2.1% and 3% respectively. Natural gas customers are expected to increase by 0.6% in 2014. Expenditures for electricity heating are projected to increase in different regions, with wood and wood pellets being primary heating sources for 2.6 million households. The number of households using wood as a heating source has steadily increased over the past five years, with about 8.8 million households using wood in 2009. The STEWFO projected a slight increase in residential wood biomass between 2013 and 2014. The primary risk factors for wood heating are weather and economic conditions. Total household expenditures on home heating depend on the price and quantity of the fuel consumed. The quantity of fuel consumed for home heating is largely determined by weather, specifically heating degree-days. Conservation through reduced temperatures also plays a role. The 2013-2014 winter season is expected to be colder in the Northeast and South, and milder in the Midwest and West. Fuel prices are influenced by various economic factors. The relationship between economic growth and fuel prices, particularly natural gas and crude oil, impacts home heating costs. Natural gas prices are expected to increase by 11% for consumers this heating season. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides federal funding to supplement home heating expenditures. The Administration has proposed $2.8 billion for LIHEAP regular funds and $150 million for emergency contingency funds for FY2014. CITGO operates a Low Cost Heating Oil Program with a nonprofit, benefiting 1.7 million households since 2005. The program discounts home heating oil by almost 40%. It is uncertain if the program will continue in the 2013-2014 winter heating season. Americans are expected to face increased heating costs during that winter. Increased heating costs are expected for the winter of 2013-2014 due to higher fuel prices and colder temperatures in key regions. Economic activity, fuel prices, and actual winter weather could impact expenditure projections. Uncertainty surrounding LIHEAP funding and the continuation of the CITGO program may burden lower-income Americans with high heating costs."
