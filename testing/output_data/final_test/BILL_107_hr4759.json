Between 1800 and 1811, Castle Williams and Fort Jay were constructed on Governors Island to defend New York Harbor during the War of 1812, preventing a direct British attack on New York City. Governors Island, with Castle Williams and Fort Jay, played key roles in the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. The island served the US Army until 1966 and then the US Coast Guard until 1997. Castle Williams was built by Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams and Fort Jay, named after John Jay, complements Fort Wood on Liberty Island. In 2001, President Clinton established the Governors Island National Monument. The National Monument on Governors Island, comprising Castle Williams and Fort Jay, could be at risk of being sold and ceasing to exist if the rest of the island is conveyed to a party other than the United States. This would result in the loss of over 200 years of historical significance and educational opportunities that the monuments represent. The purpose of the Act is to prevent the deterioration of these historic military sites.
