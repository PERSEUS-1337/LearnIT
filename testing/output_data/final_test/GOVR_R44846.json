A study by the National Academy of Sciences reveals that male workers in the top earnings quintile can live up to 82 years, while those in the bottom quintile only live to 77. The gap in life expectancy by income has garnered attention from recent studies. Recent studies by the NAS, GAO, Brookings Institution, and Stanford economist Raj Chetty highlight the growing gap in life expectancy by income. Policymakers are concerned about the widening differentials in longevity despite overall increases in life expectancy. The growing gap in life expectancy by income is a concern for policymakers, as it may impact federal expenditures on programs like Social Security. Social Security, a redistributive program, faces challenges with widening life expectancy gaps. Proposed reforms, such as increasing the retirement age, could disproportionately affect low earners' benefits. The report discusses the impact of the growing gap in life expectancy by income on Social Security reform proposals, particularly raising the retirement age. It highlights the need to protect the interests of lower-earning, shorter-lived workers in light of this disparity. Life expectancy is influenced by mortality rates and can vary across demographic subgroups. It is commonly presented as life expectancy at birth or at age 65, reflecting the average lifespan. Differential mortality rates among groups like age, sex, or race result in different life expectancy estimates. Life expectancy can vary across demographic subgroups and is often presented as life expectancy at birth or at age 65. In the United States in 2014, life expectancy at age 65 was estimated to be 19.3 years, while life expectancy at birth was 78.8 years. Variations in life expectancy by sex and race were observed, with men having a life expectancy of 76.4 years at birth compared to 81.2 years for women. Blacks had a life expectancy of 75.6 years at birth, while whites had 79.0 years. In 2014, life expectancy at age 65 in the United States was estimated to be 18.0 years for men and 20.5 years for women. For blacks, life expectancy at age 65 was 18.2 years, and for whites, it was 19.3 years. The recent research uses life expectancy estimates calculated at various ages for comparison. Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide CDC's recent estimates of period life expectancy. Life expectancy in the United States has increased over time for all groups due to decreases in mortality rates. Improvements in chronic disease prevention, medical technology, and public health measures have contributed to reduced adult mortality rates. Improvements in chronic disease prevention, medical technology, and public health measures have contributed to mortality declines. Gaps in life expectancy across sex and race persist, with women generally living longer than men and whites outliving blacks in the United States. Researchers attribute these differences to biological, behavioral, and social factors. Disparities in life expectancy exist among different groups due to factors like socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and environmental surroundings. Researchers focus on gaps in life expectancy by socioeconomic status, which policymakers can address through interventions. The gap in life expectancy by SES has been growing over recent decades, unlike sex and race where the gaps have narrowed. The report discusses the measurement of socioeconomic status (SES) in relation to life expectancy, commonly using education or income. Studies show a positive correlation between education and life expectancy, with a growing gap over time. However, using education as a measure of SES has drawbacks such as reporting errors and being a broad indicator. The report discusses using income as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) in relation to life expectancy, highlighting the limitations of using education as a measure. Income is chosen due to its ability to be measured accurately and its relevance in understanding disparities in life expectancy. Income is selected as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) for its detailed measurability and relative comparison within a population distribution. It can address issues of reverse causality by considering income over a period of time, capturing adult SES. Additionally, income, particularly lifetime earnings, is directly linked to Social Security benefits calculation. This choice is supported by research on life expectancy disparities among socioeconomic groups in the United States. Recent studies in the United States have shown a growing gap in life expectancy based on income levels. Hilary Waldron's 2007 research on life expectancy by earnings utilized a large longitudinal dataset, including Social Security administrative data on taxable wages and official death records. Waldron analyzed earnings for males aged 60 or older across 30 birth year cohorts (1912-1941), revealing consistent evidence of disparities in life expectancy by income. Hilary Waldron's research analyzed life expectancy disparities based on income levels using Social Security data on earnings from ages 45-55 for individuals in birth year cohorts 1912-1941. Men with zero earnings were excluded, and cohort life expectancy at age 65 was estimated for different earnings segments. The study did not address significant income changes. The research analyzed life expectancy disparities based on income levels from birth year cohorts 1912-1941. The widening variance in life expectancy is shown in the box-and-whisker plot, with those in the top half living longer than those in the bottom half. For men born in 1912, the top half could expect to live about a year longer than the bottom half, while for men born in 1941, the gap increased to 5.3 years. The research by Waldron analyzed life expectancy disparities based on income levels from birth year cohorts 1912-1941. The top half of the income distribution saw a larger improvement in life expectancy (6.0 years) compared to the bottom half (1.3 years). Waldron's findings highlight that a wide swath of the earnings distribution, not just the extreme low end, is experiencing small gains in life expectancy. This disaggregation into two broad groups reveals the stark disparities in life expectancy gains. The study by Waldron reveals a gap in life expectancy based on earnings, with limitations such as sample representativeness and income group comparisons. Waldron's assumptions in life expectancy projections may not accurately reflect recent mortality patterns. Cristia's 2009 study further analyzes lifetime earnings. Julian Cristia's 2009 study examines lifetime earnings of men and women aged 35-75 from 1983-2003. Using data from various sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau and IRS, Cristia finds a significant increase in life expectancy differentials between top and bottom lifetime earnings quintiles. The study by Julian Cristia in 2009 analyzed the lifetime earnings of men and women aged 35-75 from 1983-2003. It found a notable increase in life expectancy gaps between the top and bottom lifetime earnings quintiles. For men, the gap increased by 30% to 3.6 years, and for women, it doubled to 1.5 years. Cristia raised concerns about the exclusion of unhealthy individuals from the labor force, which could bias the relationship between lifetime earnings and life expectancy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) studied the life expectancy income gap using the CBOLT microsimulation model, which predicts demographic and economic outcomes based on data from various sources. The model suggests that period life expectancy at age 65 will increase more for individuals with higher lifetime earnings. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that life expectancy continues to increase, especially for those with higher lifetime earnings. In 2014, a 65-year-old man in the upper earnings quintile is expected to live over three years longer than someone in the lowest quintile. A similar trend is seen for women. By 2039, projections show that high-earning individuals will live significantly longer than those in lower income brackets. A 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) confirms a growing life expectancy gap between men and women in the United States. The study compares the life expectancy of those born in 1930 and 1960 using Social Security-reported household earnings data. Projections are used to estimate life expectancy beyond 2008 for the cohorts studied. The 1960 birth cohort study shows that life expectancy for men increased with income, but the gap between bottom and top income quintiles doubled compared to the 1930 cohort. Men in the bottom income quintile born in 1960 have not seen a gain in life expectancy at age 50, while those in the top income quintile have experienced increases. The life expectancy gap between men in the lowest and highest income quintiles has increased from 5.1 years for the 1930 cohort to 12.7 years for the 1960 cohort. This growth is driven by longevity gains among men in the top income quintile, with a small decline in longevity among men in the bottom quintile. For women, the life expectancy gap between the bottom and top income quintiles also expanded, with evidence of a decline in life expectancy for the lowest two income quintiles. The study analyzed income inequality and longevity gap among different income groups, focusing on women's expanding life expectancy from 3.9 years in the 1930 cohort to 13.6 years in the 1960 cohort. The findings for women are more pronounced than for men, but less reliable due to changes in women's labor force participation affecting the sample composition. The study used demographic data from HRS and SIPP surveys matched with Social Security data to calculate cohort life expectancy based on mortality risk projections. Simplifying assumptions about future mortality risks were also noted. The study on income inequality and longevity gap analyzed data from HRS and SIPP surveys, using simplifying assumptions about future mortality risks. Figure 5 displays life expectancy by income decile, showing a growing gap in life expectancy between the lowest and highest income deciles for both men and women. For men born in 1920, the gap was 5 years, increasing to 12 years for those born in 1940. Women's life expectancy gap also widened over cohorts, from 3.9 years in the 1930 cohort to 13.6 years in the 1960 cohort. The Brookings study shows that life expectancy gaps between income deciles have widened over time. Women in the lowest income decile born in 1920 had a life expectancy of 80.4, while those in the highest income decile could expect to live to 84.1. For the 1940 cohort, women in the lowest income decile showed no gains in life expectancy, while those in the top income decile could expect to live to 90.5, gaining 6.4 years. Results confirm that higher income individuals have seen greater gains in life expectancy. The authors analyzed federal income tax data matched with SSA records for individuals aged 40-76 from 1999-2014. They found that higher income is associated with higher life expectancy. For the 2001-2014 period, there was a life expectancy gap between the bottom 1% and top 1% of 14.6 years for men and 10.1 years for women, which increased over time. The study analyzed income tax data matched with SSA records for individuals aged 40-76 from 1999-2014. It found that higher income is linked to higher life expectancy. The life expectancy gap between the top 5% and bottom 5% increased over the 2001-2014 period, with men in the top 5% gaining 2.34 years (2.91 for women) compared to 0.32 years (0.04 for women) for those in the bottom 5%. The authors noted limitations in the study, including assumptions about future mortality patterns and the potential confounding factors affecting the relationship between income and life expectancy. The Social Security program provides inflation-adjusted benefits to retired workers, their dependents, disabled workers, and survivors of workers. Approximately 94% of workers are covered by Social Security, with earnings subject to payroll tax. Beneficiaries can claim benefits after meeting eligibility requirements. In February 2017, 61 million beneficiaries received $76 billion in total benefit payments, with an average monthly benefit of $1,250. Life expectancy impacts the number of years of tax payments and benefit receipt. Disparities in life expectancy by income affect lifetime receipt of Social Security retirement benefits. Retired worker benefits are available at full retirement age (FRA), which is age 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954 and will rise to 67 for later cohorts. Individuals need 10 years of covered earnings to be eligible. Benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, with a reduction if claimed before FRA and an increase if claimed after FRA up to age 70. There is no additional increase in benefits past age 70. For example, claiming at age 62 results in a 30% reduction, while claiming at age 70 increases benefits by 24%. The Social Security program aims to provide actuarially equivalent benefits before and after full retirement age for those with average life expectancy. It also focuses on social adequacy by offering basic income support to all covered workers and their dependents. Additionally, the program aims for progressivity by awarding higher replacement rates to low-earning workers and individual equity by considering other retirement savings options for higher earners. The Social Security program aims for individual equity by tying benefits to a worker's earnings history and providing higher benefits to higher earners. The benefit formula is progressive, replacing less of lifetime earnings for higher earners. The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is calculated based on past earnings indexed to wages, with a progressive formula converting Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) into PIA. The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is calculated using a formula that converts Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) into PIA. The formula consists of three bend points, with lower earners receiving a higher percentage of their career-average earnings replaced compared to higher earners. The bend points are adjusted annually to the average wage index. As AIME increases, the replacement rate decreases, with benefits replacing 90% of earnings for AIME of $885, 32% for earnings between $885 and $5,336, and 15% for earnings above $5,336. Redistribution in Social Security occurs due to declining rate of return on lifetime contributions, with a cap on earnings subject to tax. The replacement rates for workers born in 1950 who retire at full retirement age range from 76% to 27%, reflecting progressivity in benefit formula design. The Social Security program measures progressivity by comparing lifetime benefits to lifetime payroll taxes through various metrics like the benefit to tax ratio, net present value, and internal rate of return. If these measures favor lower earners, the program is considered progressive. Life expectancy variations can impact the program's progressivity by affecting the number of years a person receives benefits. The number of years a person receives Social Security benefits varies significantly based on individual life expectancy, impacting the value of lifetime benefits received. Social Security does not currently adjust its initial benefit formula for variations in life expectancy, which can affect the rate of return on contributions and the overall progressivity of the program. The value of lifetime Social Security benefits is impacted by variations in individual life expectancy, especially if life expectancy varies by income. Research suggests that a growing life expectancy gap by income undermines the redistributive nature of the current benefit formula. Higher life expectancy for higher-income individuals reduces progressivity but does not reverse the overall conclusion. Adjustments for mortality in Social Security benefits impact the progressivity of the system. Despite limitations, newer evidence shows widening mortality differentials affecting benefit receipt. Studies make specific assumptions about earnings, life expectancy, and other variables, influencing benefit estimates. Higher earners can expect to collect higher monthly benefits over a longer period compared to lower-earning individuals, as shown in studies on Social Security benefits distribution. Lifetime income quintiles are determined based on midcareer earnings, with adjustments for married couples. Lifetime income for married couples is adjusted by dividing earnings by an equivalence scale. A study compares outcomes for the 1930 and 1960 birth cohorts, simulating Social Security benefits and estimating their present values at age 50. Mortality projections are used for life expectancy adjustments. Figure 6 displays the present value of Social Security benefits at age 50, adjusted for life expectancy by earnings quintiles. Adjusted for life expectancy, Social Security benefits increase with earnings for males and females in the 1930 and 1960 cohorts. Males in the bottom earnings quintile receive $126,000 in lifetime benefits, compared to $229,000 for males in the highest quintile. The lowest earners in the 1960 cohort see their benefits stay flat at about $122,000, similar to the 1930 cohort. In the 1960 cohort, individuals can expect to live longer and receive higher Social Security benefits based on their earnings quintile. The difference in benefits between the top and bottom quintiles has increased, with gains seen across various income levels for both men and women. The NAS figures show that Social Security retirement benefit differentials by earnings have grown between the 1930 and 1960 cohorts for both men and women, driven by gains in life expectancy skewed to those with higher earnings. The increased differential is observed at all but the bottom two-fifths of the earnings distribution, with females in the top quintile seeing benefits increase from $208,000 to $235,000. The study analyzed data from the Census Bureau's SIPP matched with Social Security records to determine the relationship between midcareer earnings and life expectancy. Males in the top earnings decile in 1940 gained 8.7 years in life expectancy compared to the 1920 cohort, while those in the lowest decile gained only 1.7 years. There is a strong positive correlation between life expectancy gains and expected lifetime Social Security retirement benefits, with benefits increasing by 10% for the bottom decile and 24% for the sixth decile when comparing males born in 1940 to those born in 1920. In 1940, life expectancy increased for males in the top earnings decile by 8.7 years compared to the 1920 cohort, while those in the lowest decile only gained 1.7 years. Females in the top earnings decile gained about six years compared to the 1920 cohort. Social Security benefits increased by 10% for the bottom earnings decile, 24% for the sixth decile, and 40% for the top decile for males. For females, benefits increased by 12% for the sixth decile and 26% for the top decile. The highest earnings decile in the 1940 cohort receives 3.3 times the benefits of the lowest decile for males, and 1.9 times for females. The disparity in Social Security lifetime retirement benefits by earnings widened between the 1920 and 1940 cohorts. A 2016 GAO study found that lower-income males could see an 11% reduction in lifetime benefits. Lower-income males may experience an 11% reduction in lifetime Social Security benefits, while higher-income males could see an increase of 16% to 18%. Differential life expectancy leads to varying estimated benefits for different income groups. The authors analyzed Social Security cash inflow and outflow using a \"safe\" rate of return, finding that women generally have higher internal rates of return (IRRs) and net present values (NPVs) than men due to longer life expectancies and lower earnings. Later cohorts have higher IRRs and NPVs than earlier cohorts. Differential mortality has a larger effect on younger cohorts, potentially reversing progressivity. The study shows that Social Security is no longer progressive for later birth cohorts of men due to increases in mortality inequality, while remaining progressive for women. Uneven gains in life expectancy impact lifetime Social Security retirement benefits, widening the gap between low and high earners. Lifetime retirement benefits will continue to increase if the life expectancy gap by income grows. The total value of lifetime retirement benefits will continue to increase for high earners, eroding progressivity that considers both benefits and contributions. Disability and survivor benefits remain strongly progressive. Increasing longevity poses a policy challenge in funding additional years. Increased longevity poses a policy challenge in funding additional years of retirement. The shift in age distribution between 2010 and 2030 is a key factor driving up Social Security program costs. Various options exist to address financing challenges, including slowing benefit expenditure growth and increasing program revenue through changes in taxation. The report discusses options to increase the early or full retirement age as a response to the fiscal pressures of a population living longer. One proposed option is to raise the Full Retirement Age beyond 67, considering that people may be able to work longer in the future. Increasing the Full Retirement Age results in fewer months of benefits and reduces the total amount of lifetime Social Security benefits received. The report discusses proposals to increase the Full Retirement Age (FRA) and Early Eligibility Age (EEA) in response to the fiscal pressures of a longer-living population. Various entities have suggested raising the FRA and/or EEA, with examples such as the Bipartisan Policy Center Commission recommending gradual increases in both ages. In previous Congresses, bills like the Dollar for Dollar Act and the Fiscal Sustainability Act proposed raising the FRA to 69 and the EEA to 64. The Social Security Reform Act of 2016 proposed increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 69 and the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) to 64. The Simpson-Bowles Commission also suggested raising both ages, with the EEA reaching 64 and the FRA reaching 69 by 2070. Research examines the impact of increasing retirement ages due to the growing gap in life expectancy. The 2015 NAS study simulates the policy impact of increasing Social Security's EEA and FRA, considering both direct and behavioral effects on benefits. The first simulation raises the EEA from 62 to 64, leading to reduced monthly benefits for those claiming early. Raising the EEA from 62 to 64 results in a 30% reduction in monthly benefits for individuals claiming early. This policy change would cause those who would have claimed at ages 62 or 63 to now claim at age 64, receiving higher monthly benefits for fewer years. Raising the EEA from 62 to 64 results in a 30% reduction in monthly benefits for individuals claiming early. After the policy change, the average lifetime Social Security benefit for the lowest income quintile rises by a modest amount and is close to being actuarially fair. Higher earners receive higher lifetime benefits due to their higher life expectancy. Increasing the EEA from age 62 to 64 results in higher monthly benefits for higher earners, skewing the distribution of Social Security benefits in their favor. This policy change also widens the gap between the lowest and highest earners, as shown in a simulation using 2008 SSA data. Waldron's 2013 study discusses the effects of this policy change on individuals born between 1937 and 1945. Waldron's study focuses on policy proposals related to income thresholds for individuals born between 1937 and 1945. She rejects the income threshold model, finding a strong link between income and mortality even above these thresholds. Waldron estimates mortality differentials by lifetime earnings decile, showing that higher earnings are associated with lower mortality risk for at least the bottom 80% of the male earnings distribution. The link between mortality and earnings weakens only in the top 20% of the income distribution. An income threshold must protect individuals with modest gains in life expectancy. A graduated income threshold may be a potential remedy. Increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) is another policy proposal to address increasing life expectancy. In a study by NAS, an increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 70 resulted in a reduction of benefits for retirees. For the 1930 cohort, benefits decreased by 25% for the lowest income quintile and 22% for the highest. For the 1960 cohort, benefits fell by 25% for the lowest income quintile and 20% for the highest. Higher earners were able to delay claiming benefits longer, resulting in a smaller drop in lifetime benefits. An increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) leads to a decrease in benefits for retirees, with higher earners experiencing a smaller drop in lifetime benefits due to the ability to delay claiming benefits. Chetty et al.'s 2016 analysis shows a continuous increase in life expectancy with income, with no clear threshold where higher income is not associated with higher life expectancy. Increasing income by a dollar amount has a positive but smaller impact on life expectancy. Policy proposals raising the retirement age may benefit higher earners more. Women, who live longer on average, have lower lifetime earnings than men. A simple hardship threshold based on low earnings in policy proposals may not protect all individuals effectively. One potential solution to address the uneven gains in life expectancy is to implement a graduated income threshold in retirement age policy proposals. The Bipartisan Policy Center's 2016 report on retirement security suggests various Social Security reform proposals, including increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA). Research shows a growing gap in life expectancy by income, with cohorts born later experiencing disparities. Recent studies show that Americans born more recently are facing wider gaps in life expectancy based on their income. Those with lower lifetime earnings are living shorter lives compared to higher earners, and this gap has been increasing over the years. Higher earners can expect to collect Social Security benefits for a longer period due to their higher gains in life expectancy, while lower-earning groups have seen little to no increase in years lived. This disparity has significant implications for Social Security. Public policy proposals often suggest raising the retirement age in response to increasing life expectancy and improving Social Security's financing. However, this could reduce the progressivity of retirement benefits, which aim to provide higher returns for low lifetime earners. Life expectancy is found to increase with income, with no clear cutoff point where gains stop. Recommendations for a hardship income threshold in retirement age increase proposals may need careful consideration. Life expectancy gains do not increase with income, suggesting that other policies may be needed to address the impact of a higher retirement age on low lifetime earners."
