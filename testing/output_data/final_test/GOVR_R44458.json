Congress has taken steps to support CSOs through legislation and may consider further actions to address these challenges. Restrictions on funding and registration requirements are putting pressure on NGOs and civil society groups globally. Governments, including democratic allies like India and major U.S. aid recipients like Egypt, are imposing these measures. The United States is a significant financial supporter of civil society worldwide, investing over $3.2 billion since 2010 to strengthen these organizations. Since 2010, over $3.2 billion has been invested to support civil society through training, technical assistance, and direct funding. The Obama Administration launched the Stand with Civil Society initiative in 2013 to strengthen U.S. support for civil society abroad, but there is debate on whether actions have matched rhetoric. This report provides an overview of the \"closing space\" challenge, outlines current Administration programs addressing the problem, and discusses potential areas of engagement for Congress. Support for democratic governance abroad has been a key element of U.S. foreign policy, with civil society playing a fundamental role in ensuring governments serve their people. Civil society amplifies voices to influence governments for the common good, including building schools and protecting the environment. It also contributes to global economic growth and development by ensuring a positive business environment. The presence of a robust civil society sector strengthens the rule of law, transparency, and reduces corruption in markets. The presence of a critical civil society is important for businesses looking to invest their money, as it reflects a State's confidence and stability. Congress has emphasized the promotion of vibrant civil societies abroad as a key element of U.S. foreign policy. Restrictions on civil society not only impact democracies abroad but also have direct impacts on U.S. interests in crisis situations. If countries impose laws restricting NGOs and foreign funding, it could hinder their ability to respond to crises like the Ebola virus or famine. Crackdowns on civil society groups abroad can also affect U.S. government-funded organizations and even U.S. citizens affiliated with them. Institute sought refuge at U.S. Embassy in Cairo; 16 Americans convicted in absentia for receiving foreign funding. Amnesty International official warns of increasing global restrictions on civil society work, citing new legislation weekly. NGOs facing significant attacks on civil society rights in 96 countries in 2014. In 2014, free expression faced significant attacks in 96 countries. Freedom House noted a decline in space for civil society, with authoritarian regimes closing spaces for dissent and debate. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law highlighted the introduction of laws restricting civil society activity in 50 countries between 2012 and 2014. Over 120 laws limiting freedoms of association or assembly have been proposed or enacted in 60 countries since 2012, with a focus on restricting foreign funding for civil society groups. Restrictions on foreign funding for civil society groups have grown rapidly, with laws requiring government approval for bank accounts and disclosures as \"foreign agents.\" The U.S. Agency for International Development's Civil Society Sustainability Index tracks these restrictions, noting increasing challenges for advocacy and human rights organizations in Africa. Russia, for example, banned the National Endowment for Democracy in 2015, the first group to face such a ban. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was banned from operating in Russia under a law targeting \"undesirable\" NGOs in May 2015. This law allows Russian authorities to shut down such groups without a court order. President Putin claimed that western intelligence agencies use NGOs to destabilize Russia. Other international donors, including governments and charities, are also affected by these measures. Similar actions have been taken by the Hungarian government against NGOs receiving foreign funding. Experts warn that targeting foreign funding can be particularly harmful. Experts at the Carnegie Endowment suggest that foreign funding can have significant impacts on civil society organizations, especially those working on sensitive issues like human rights and anticorruption. Limiting access to external support weakens their capacity for action and threatens their existence. Repressive measures against civil society are not limited to authoritarian countries like Russia and China but are seen worldwide across different political systems and cultures. Restrictions on civil society organizations can target a wide range of groups, including human rights defenders, democracy advocates, humanitarian actors, civic coalitions, watchdog groups, and economic cooperatives. Repressive regimes often apply different standards to NGOs based on their activities, creating divisions within civil society. This issue is seen globally across various political systems and cultures. Restrictions on foreign-funded organizations in various countries, such as India, Ethiopia, Angola, and Bangladesh, have increased, limiting their activities and imposing strict registration requirements. Cambodia has also implemented new regulations on NGOs. Several countries have imposed strict registration requirements and restrictions on NGOs, including Cambodia, Egypt, Hungary, and Uganda. These measures aim to control foreign-funded organizations and limit their activities, with penalties such as life imprisonment for receiving funds from abroad. In 2016, Uganda implemented a law to control NGO registration and activities deemed against the country's interests. Concerns arise that the law may target organizations working on LGBTI issues. Pakistan expelled Save the Children in 2015, part of a crackdown on foreign-funded groups. Ecuador imposed new regulations on NGOs in 2013, leading to the cessation of USAID operations in 2014. Sudan expelled international NGOs in 2009 for alleged collaboration with foreign powers. In response to NGO activities, South Sudan enacted a law in 2016 requiring registration and government oversight, potentially hindering aid efforts. Various countries, including Israel, Jordan, and Nigeria, are also considering laws restricting NGO operations. Experts predict a continued trend of authoritarian regimes limiting civil society space globally. Civil society actors in restrictive environments may face repression, including intimidation, arrest, physical attacks, and online harassment. In Burundi, groups opposing the president's mandate extension in 2015 were harassed and jailed, leading to ongoing unrest. Impunity for violence may cause self-censorship or force activists to flee, as seen in Honduras where environmental activists were killed, prompting some to leave the country for safety concerns. Civil society actors in Honduras have fled due to security concerns, impacting donors' ability to work with CSOs abroad. This could hinder the United States' engagement with local organizations on freedoms of assembly, association, and expression, as well as security and development efforts. The closing space phenomenon has complex origins, with various drivers accelerating the problem. Scholars suggest that the end of the cold war led to a shift away from democracy and human rights support. As the cold war ended, western governments shifted towards funding nongovernmental organizations directly, leading to increased wariness of civil society sectors in semi-authoritarian regimes. Russia and China have challenged the universality of liberal democratic values, offering alternative models of governance. This acceleration has been facilitated by governments learning from each other to inhibit civil society groups. Groups like Russia, China, India, and Ethiopia have influenced other countries to adopt restrictive legislative measures. The post 9/11 focus on counterterrorism has also contributed to limiting space for civil society, despite recognition of their role in combating terrorism. According to the Carnegie report, governments in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have used the war on terror to restrict freedoms. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has been criticized for disproportionately impacting legitimate CSOs and philanthropic organizations with its counter-terrorism focus. Critics argue that FATF's approach has led to governments with no civic space being rated highly for preventing illicit funding flows. Over 120 nonprofit organizations have called on FATF to amend its approach to support civil society. Over 120 nonprofit organizations have urged FATF to revise its approach to prevent over-regulation of the civil society sector, a recommendation also backed by a UN Special Rapporteur. The Obama administration has implemented additional measures to address the growing challenges faced by civil society, emphasizing collaboration among various government departments to promote freedom and support grassroots organizations. The Society 2.0 Initiative aimed to empower grassroots organizations with digital tools. The State Department initiated a Strategic Dialogue with Civil Society in 2011, holding summits in 2011 and 2012 to support and protect civil society globally. An Interagency Policy Committee for civil society was established in 2013, and a Senior Advisor for Civil Society and Emerging Democracies was appointed in 2010. In 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry integrated civil society and democracy agendas. In 2013, the President launched the Stand with Civil Society initiative to support civil society globally through partnerships with governments, NGOs, and multilateral initiatives. This initiative focuses on positive engagement between governments and civil society, developing new assistance tools, and coordinating diplomatic pressure to push back against restrictions on civil society. President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum on Deepening U.S. involvement in civil society one year later. President Obama emphasized the importance of civil society in holding governments accountable and promoting economic growth. He directed executive departments to collaborate with civil society representatives, even in restrictive environments, and oppose undue restrictions on civil society by foreign governments. This initiative is part of American leadership to support civil society globally. The Stand with Civil Society initiative aims to support civil society globally by promoting economic growth, accountability, and opposing undue restrictions by foreign governments. Key lessons learned include the need for long-term efforts, early action during democratic transitions, identifying champions in government, expanding consultations, and supporting self-regulation and transparency. USAID and the State Department's Bureau of Democracy Human Rights, and Labor are primary implementers of U.S. support to civil society abroad. The Office of Global Programming and USAID's DRG Center lead efforts to support civil society globally, including in challenging environments. USAID funds civil society through its in-country presence and operates in states transitioning from crisis or conflict, repressive countries, and even where the U.S. has no diplomatic presence. DRL also plays a role in supporting civil society. The State Department and USAID support civil society globally, even in challenging environments where the U.S. has no diplomatic presence. Programs aim to protect beneficiaries' identities and avoid aiding authoritarian governments. Various activities focus on emergency responses, protection, and addressing root causes of restrictions on civil society. The State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund (HRDF) provides assistance to promote civil society, including aiding embattled NGOs and countering cyber-attacks. The Fund has grown from $8 million in FY1998 to $78.5 million in FY2015. DRL also receives $65 million in Economic Support Funds to support activities in eight countries. In FY2015, DRL is providing $138 million in funding to benefit civil society and activists globally. Additionally, the Lifeline Fund offers emergency grants to civil society organizations. The Lifeline Fund, managed by DRL, provides emergency grants to civil society organizations globally. Supported by international NGOs and governments, it has assisted over 814 CSOs in 98 countries since 2011. Grants address various needs like security, legal representation, and advocacy efforts to protect human rights and civic space. The Legal Enabling Environment Program (LEEP) is a USAID initiative implemented by ICNL to oppose government restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association. It provides technical assistance and capacity building for legal reform in countries like El Salvador, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kenya, and others. The U.S. government, along with partners like Sweden, is establishing Civil Society Innovation Initiative (CSII) Hubs to promote cooperation and innovation among civil society groups. The U.S. government, along with partners like Sweden, is establishing Civil Society Innovation Initiative (CSII) Hubs to promote cooperation and innovation among civil society groups. These hubs will receive funding from USAID's DRG Center, as well as other sources such as the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the Aga Khan Foundation. Additionally, the U.S. administration is actively advocating for civil society at the United Nations, the Community of Democracies, and the Open Government Partnership. The CD Presidency assumed in July 2015 provides the US with a platform to promote civic space and counter restrictions on civil society. The CD's Working Group on Enabling and Protecting Civil Society fosters collaboration to address closing space. The US committed $3 million in core funding to CD and provided $400,000 for small grants to assist civil society. The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a multilateral initiative launched in 2011 by the United States and seven other founding governments. It aims to promote transparency, civic participation, fight corruption, and make government more open and accountable. The United States, as a founding member, coordinates with government partners and civil society chairs on international open government priorities. OGP has expanded to include 69 countries and hundreds of civil society organizations since its inception. Since its launch in 2011, the Open Government Partnership (OGP) has grown to include 69 countries and numerous civil society organizations. The United States has been a significant donor to OGP, with USAID providing around $1 million in support to the secretariat since 2014. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) now incorporate governance issues, with U.S. officials suggesting their influence on this development. The SDGs offer an international platform for civil society to participate as a key stakeholder. While the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights touch on civic and political rights, they do not specifically address challenges faced by civil society. These reports may highlight instances of abuse and restrictive laws affecting civil society organizations. The Civil Society Organizations Sustainability Index (CSOSI) assesses the strength of civil society by scoring dimensions like legal environment, financial viability, and advocacy. It was first published in 1997 for Europe and Eurasia, expanding to cover Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Reports track developments in the sector, funded by USAID's Bureau for Europe and Eurasia. The DRG Center partners with other bureaus to expand the Index to different regions. The U.S. government has expanded the Civil Society Organizations Sustainability Index to other regions through partnerships with various organizations. They have also promoted their own regulation of domestic NGO space as a positive framework. The State Department produced a factsheet in 2012 outlining the U.S. government's definition of civil society and approach to regulating NGOs. The Department of Treasury has been consulting with the nonprofit sector as part of the Financial Action Task Force. The U.S. government has been consulting with the nonprofit sector as part of the Financial Action Task Force to address concerns about terrorist abuse of funding to civil society. Efforts have been made to facilitate global philanthropy by private U.S. foundations through amending tax rules. The United States has provided over $3 billion in foreign assistance since FY2009 to promote civil society, with a focus on a small number of countries. In 2015, only 12 countries received U.S. investments of over $100,000 per year for civil society legal reform. $396 million was allocated in FY2015 to support the enabling environment for civil society globally, representing about 20% of the total funding for democracy promotion and good governance. The funding under NED and GJD objectives supports democracy promotion, good governance, human rights, and rule of law. Funding for civil society assistance declined between FY2012 and FY2014 but increased significantly in FY2016. The Administration requested over $3 billion for these activities in FY2016, with $602 million allocated for civil society. Congress appropriated at least $2.3 billion for democracy programs, resulting in an 11% funding increase for GJD. For FY2017, the Administration requested $2.8 billion for GJD and NED, with $652 million allocated for civil society. The Obama administration is credited with recognizing the closing of civil society space and taking steps to support it, including initiatives like Stand with Civil Society and Lifeline. Funding for civil society accounted for 1% of U.S. foreign assistance in FY2015, with $652 million allocated for civil society out of $2.8 billion for GJD and NED. Experts emphasized the need for increased financial assistance to civil society organizations (CSOs), especially those under threat, with even small amounts of funding ($5,000 to $10,000) having a significant impact. However, the comprehensive tracking of U.S. support to CSOs is challenging due to some assistance being less visible or unwanted. Concerns over retaliation and safety also contribute to the incomplete public record of U.S. government support to civil society. Some interventions in support of persecuted civil society actors are best done quietly or through non-U.S. actors. The United States has shown leadership in understanding the issue of closing space for civil society, but policy responses are complicated by competing interests and concerns about undermining credibility. Former and current officials have expressed concern that civil society issues do not often reach high-level decision-making. Critics argue that recent reductions in U.S. funding for promoting democratic space and good governance, coupled with increased support for security sectors, may send mixed messages to host countries about U.S. priorities. Some experts suggest that more efforts should be made to institutionalize the Administration's support for civil society in U.S. foreign policy amidst competing policy priorities. Some experts suggest institutionalizing support for civil society in U.S. foreign policy amidst competing priorities. The SACSED position highlighted U.S. engagement with civil society as key, but caution is advised against relying solely on special envoys. Advocates recommend enhancing institutional capacity and elevating the focus on civil society across all U.S. officials and programs. Some experts recommend institutionalizing support for civil society in U.S. foreign policy, emphasizing the need to evaluate officials and programs based on their engagement with civil society issues. Legislation like the Brownback amendment is seen as crucial in protecting U.S. support for civil society, especially in repressive environments. Multilateral tools like the CD and OGP offer new partnerships and opportunities, but may face challenges due to including countries with mixed records on civil rights. Some question the effectiveness of multilateral organizations like the OGP in including countries with mixed records on civil rights. The OGP is currently reviewing Azerbaijan's membership status after international CSOs filed a complaint in 2015. Observers are interested in assessing the OGP's effectiveness in promoting transparent governance through cooperation between governments and civil society. Additionally, there are doubts about the United States' presentation of NGO regulation as a model for other governments. Some suggest that the United States has sent mixed signals about its support to civil society organizations (CSOs) in countering terrorism financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), where the U.S. is a leading member, has been criticized for disproportionately impacting legitimate CSOs and philanthropic organizations compared to the private sector. Critics argue that the focus on counter-terrorism has led to high ratings for despotic regimes that restrict civic space. There are calls for U.S. policy and institutions like the Treasury Department to address concerns about NGOs being used for illicit activities while supporting civil society operations. Experts caution that restrictions on civil society impact governments and donors. Calls are made for civil society to develop membership models and philanthropy culture as alternatives to foreign funding. The underlying issues of free expression, assembly, and association are not just concerns for NGOs but also for repressive actors benefitting from separating civil society space from fundamental freedoms. Congress shows sustained interest in promoting vibrant civil society abroad for democracy, development, and security. Recent key examples of U.S. efforts to promote democracy globally include provisions in appropriations measures supporting civil society's role in international programs. The House committee report emphasizes the importance of American leadership during political changes worldwide and expresses concerns about the increasing repression of civil society in many countries. The Committee emphasizes the need for new approaches to promote democracy globally, increasing funding for democracy programs and supporting civil society's role. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress highlights key measures such as the Global Food Security Act, Resolution Supporting International Women's Day, Vietnam Human Rights Act, and Genocide Prevention Act. The \"Brownback amendment\" in the annual appropriations legislation allows for democracy and governance activities without prior approval from any foreign government. Fact-finding missions and publications support democracy promotion efforts globally. Members and staff of the U.S. government regularly meet with civil society groups during international travels to gather information and show support. Hearings and briefings, such as those by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, discuss threats to civil society worldwide. Participation in organizations like the U.S. Helsinki Commission aims to promote human rights, democracy, and security cooperation in the OSCE region. The U.S. government engages with civil society groups globally to gather information and show support. The Congress, through hearings and statements by Congressional Co-Chairs, highlights challenges to civil society in the Eurasian region. Congress is likely to continue overseeing democracy assistance programs and promoting the role of civil society abroad through various means, including legislation and funding directives. Congress could mandate high-profile reporting from the executive branch on civil society challenges, including a public rating system for political and civil rights based on diplomatic assessments and NGO reports. Rankings could influence engagement, assistance, and Congressional oversight, similar to the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Reports. The Trafficking in Persons Reports ranks governments on efforts to address human trafficking, encouraging improved behavior. Congress may examine the design and effectiveness of U.S. programs assisting civil society abroad, including monitoring and evaluation provisions. Investigating the efficacy of current programs on a global scale and developing metrics to measure effectiveness are key areas of interest. Additional measures for addressing civil society challenges could include high-profile reporting and public rating systems based on diplomatic assessments and NGO reports. Congress could explore additional measures to limit or reverse restrictions on civil society globally, including smaller targeted programs and broader systemic approaches. Funding for these programs can range from thousands to millions of dollars. The effectiveness of U.S. government programs supporting civil society may also be of interest to Congress, including the National Security Council-led interagency efforts. Congress could examine the effectiveness of National Security Council-led interagency efforts in considering civil society support and counter-terrorism imperatives. This includes assessing funding streams and priorities under the Obama administration, as well as potential impacts from changes in personnel or administration. Congress could consider various aspects of U.S. funding for civil society organizations, including the role of private sources like foundations, debates on accountability, potential labeling of organizations as foreign entities, and best practices for working with civil society as a donor. Congress could direct increased funding levels for programs that support civil society through activities like capacity building, legal aid, and public diplomacy. Minimum funding levels could be explored to address rapid response efforts and improvements in civil society. Flexible funding for multilateral coalitions or U.S. programs providing emergency assistance to civil society could be a focus. Congress could increase funding for programs like Governing Justly and Democratically and direct bilateral funds towards civil society support. Congress could explore expanding legislative restrictions on foreign assistance and civil society, including reviewing aid to countries that repress civil society. They may also assess if U.S. assistance could be used by foreign governments to undermine civil society and consider additional restrictions or authorities for assistance implementers to benefit civil society groups abroad. President Obama's 2015 visit to Kenya and Ethiopia highlighted differences in the U.S. approach to supporting civil society. In Kenya, he publicly engaged with civil society activists, while in Ethiopia, concerns about government control over NGOs were addressed privately. Some argue that the visit to Ethiopia did not strongly signal support for civil society. Congress could explore cases of lack of support for civil society or countering repression with senior Administration officials. Advocates suggest engaging directly with legislatures considering repressive CSO legislation, bilaterally or through multilateral groups. Members could issue statements of concern, invite foreign legislators for dialogue, and engage through congressional travel to support at-risk CSOs amidst a global \"new normal\" of civil society repression. Many experts fear that civil society in various countries may represent a \"new normal,\" posing challenges to democratic governance promotion abroad. U.S. policymakers, including Congress, may need to consider how to support civil society abroad while balancing cooperation with foreign governments on critical issues. Effective coordination with various actors is crucial, and advocates are concerned about the Administration's approach to this issue. Some experts worry that the Administration's efforts to support civil society abroad may not be effectively mobilizing resources. Concerns also exist about the sustainability of this priority post-Obama. Congress is likely to continue examining civil society developments and exploring ways to assist, despite challenges in foreign relations oversight."
