    "content": "The \"Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act\" is the short title of this Act. Medicare payment for drugs and biologicals is addressed in this legislation. The \"Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act\" addresses Medicare payment for drugs and biologicals. It amends sections of the Social Security Act to specify payment amounts and reporting requirements for drug manufacturers. The \"Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act\" defines terms like 'manufacturer' and 'average sales price' for drugs and biologicals based on National Drug Code. Sales prices are calculated excluding certain discounts and rebates. The \"Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act\" defines terms like 'manufacturer' and 'average sales price' for drugs and biologicals based on National Drug Code. Sales prices are calculated excluding discounts, rebates, and price concessions that reduce the ultimate cost to the purchaser. The \"Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act\" requires manufacturers to submit quarterly reports to the Secretary with sales prices to various entities, including governmental entities and charitable organizations. Failure to report timely may result in a civil monetary penalty imposed by the Secretary. The Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $100,000 on a manufacturer for failing to provide required information in a timely manner or for knowingly providing false information. The provisions of section 1128A apply to the imposition of civil monetary penalties. The Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty on a manufacturer for failing to provide required information or providing false information. Information disclosed by manufacturers is confidential. The payment amount for a drug shall be 120 percent of the average sales price. The Secretary may determine payment amounts for drugs based on average sales prices, using specific drug data or cumulative averages for therapeutically equivalent drugs. Additional costs may be reflected in the payment amount. The payment amount for drugs may be increased to account for state and local taxes paid on the drug. If the price paid for a drug exceeds the determined payment amount, the actual amount paid will be substituted. The Secretary may increase the payment amount to cover uncollectible deductibles, coinsurance, and procurement costs for drugs and biologicals furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. SEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR DRUG ADMINISTRATION SERVICES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will revise practice expense values for drug administration services starting in 2005. This includes chemotherapy, infusions, injections, and other specified services. Costs for nursing staff, supplies, and equipment will be estimated based on clinical expert panel data. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will estimate costs for drug administration services based on staff salary, supply, and equipment costs. Direct costs for each service will be assumed to be 33.2 percent of total practice expenses. These expenses will be converted to practice expense relative value units. The practice expense relative value units for drug administration services are determined by dividing expenses by the conversion factor for the physician fee schedule. These values will be used to calculate fee schedule amounts under the Social Security Act. Updates will be made to these values as needed to maintain accuracy. Payment amounts for intravenous chemotherapy administration will be based on the administration of a single drug. The Secretary will make the same payment for each additional drug administered by push technique during the same encounter, unless the cost of administering additional drugs is lower than the first drug. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS FOR CHEMOTHERAPY SUPPORT SERVICES. Beginning in 2005, the Secretary will make payments for chemotherapy support services provided by physicians' staff to cancer patients. These services include social worker, nutrition counseling, and psychosocial services. The Secretary will estimate the cost of staff salaries and benefits based on high-quality care standards. The Secretary will estimate total practice expenses for chemotherapy support services by assuming direct costs are 33.2 percent. These expenses will be converted to practice expense relative value units for fee schedule payments. Updates will be made as necessary to maintain their effectiveness after 2005. The Secretary will revise the methodology for maintaining accuracy of practice expense relative value units for fee schedule payments. SEC. 5. The Secretary will establish payment amounts for cancer therapy management services to account for the additional work involved in treating cancer patients. Payment may vary based on the type and level of visit or consultation. SEC. 6. Other services without physician work relative value units. The Secretary will develop a revised methodology for determining payment amounts for services without physician work relative value units, including radiation oncology services, to ensure full cost coverage. These services will be protected from further payment cuts until the revised methodology is implemented. SEC. 7. PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION OF SERVICES: The Secretary may require direct supervision of a service by a physician, which can be fulfilled by a different physician than the one who ordered the service. The ordering physician can still bill for the service if the supervising physician is different, as long as the medical records identify the supervising physician.\n\nSEC. 8. REPORT TO CONGRESS: By April 1, 2004, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress on projected payment amounts under sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE STUDY. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will request the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the Medicare payment system for cancer patients, including services provided and practice standards necessary. The Institute of Medicine will conduct a study on the Medicare payment system for cancer patients, focusing on practice standards, payment system support for nurses, and assessing the impact of amendments on care provision. The Institute of Medicine will consult with various stakeholders in the cancer community to conduct a study on the Medicare payment system for cancer patients. The study must be submitted to Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services by specific deadlines. SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATES. The Act applies to drugs, biologicals, and services from January 1, 2005. Manufacturers must submit reports by October 30, 2004. Supervision of services is effective upon enactment, and other service requirements by January 1, 2005."
