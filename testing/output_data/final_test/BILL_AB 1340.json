    "title": "AB 1340",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 35400 of the Vehicle Code is amended to restrict vehicle length to 40 feet, with exceptions for certain vehicles like those with auxiliary parts or necessary compliance with fender regulations. Additionally, articulated buses or trolley coaches are allowed up to 60 feet in length. An articulated bus or trolley coach up to 60 feet in length may have a folding device for transporting bicycles. The device must not affect vehicle safety equipment, extend more than 36 inches from the front, and keep bicycle handlebars within 42 inches from the bus front. (4) A semitrailer towed by a motortruck or truck tractor must not exceed 40 feet from the kingpin to the rearmost axle for two or more axles, or 38 feet for one axle. (5) A bus or house car can exceed the legal length limit by one foot in the front and one foot in the rear due to safety bumpers designed to absorb energy upon impact. A schoolbus can have excess length due to a crossing control arm, which should not extend while the bus is in motion. The arm can only add up to 10 inches to the bus's length, including the front safety bumper. However, using the arm does not absolve the operator of their responsibility to ensure student safety while crossing roads. A bus can have excess length due to devices for lifting wheelchairs or transporting bicycles. The front device can extend the bus by up to 18 inches, while the rear device for bicycles can add up to 10 feet, as long as the total bus length does not exceed 50 feet. A bus used in transit system service can have excess length due to a folding device attached to the front for transporting bicycles. The device must not extend more than 40 inches from the front of the bus and handlebars of the bicycle should not extend more than 46 inches. The device cannot be used on a bus exceeding 40 feet in length or with a rear device attached. A bus up to 45 feet in length is allowed access on specified highways for loading and unloading passengers, as mandated by federal law. A 45-foot bus operated by a public agency on specified highways may have a front-mounted folding device for transporting bicycles. The device must not extend more than 36 inches from the front of the bus and the handlebars of the bicycles must not extend more than 42 inches. The total length of the bus with the device or load should not exceed 48.5 feet. A Route Review Committee will assess routes for buses with front-mounted bicycle racks. The Route Review Committee is comprised of members appointed by the public agency, a traffic engineer, and a labor organization representing bus drivers. They are selected within 30 days of a proposal to equip a 45-foot bus with a front-mounted bicycle rack. The committee conducts a field review of proposed routes to ensure safe operation of the bus. The Route Review Committee, through a unanimous vote, determines suitable routes for safe operation of a 45-foot bus with a front-mounted bicycle rack, in consultation with traffic engineers from relevant public agencies to ensure coordination with all affected state and local road agencies. A house car up to 45 feet can operate on specified highways for access to fuel, food, and lodging within one road mile of designated points. (C) \"Reasonable access\" for house cars up to 45 feet is defined as access similar to that for vehicle combinations under Section 35401.5. (D) Local authorities can establish access routes for house cars up to 45 feet, and may deny access only for safety reasons. They can also provide signage or maps for designated routes. The Legislature increased the maximum kingpin to rearmost axle distance to 40 feet in 1987, not setting a precedent for future truck size increases. Transit buses with folding devices installed after 1999 must have indicator lights or mechanisms to alert the driver when the device is extended. The City of Montebello may sell its water utility as per Section 10051.5 of the Public Utilities Code. A person must not improperly mount a bicycle on a transit bus, and the passenger is liable for any violations related to loading the bicycle. Section 10051.5 of the Public Utilities Code allows the City of Montebello to sell its water utility property under certain conditions, including selling it for fair market value and obtaining approval from the city's governing body. The City of Montebello can sell its water utility property if approved by the governing body and the buyer is a public utility authorized by the commission to provide water service in the city. As a condition of acquiring the city's water system, the acquiring public utility must submit a revised service area map to the commission. This map should include the area previously served by the city's water utility system. The acquiring public utility will be authorized to provide water service to all customers in this area under the same terms and rates approved by the commission. This section will be in effect until July 1, 2017, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The City of Montebello needs a special law to sell its water utility due to conflicting statutes and urgent financial requirements. A general law cannot apply, so a special statute is necessary. The City of Montebello requires a special statute to sell its water utility urgently due to conflicting laws and financial needs. This act is deemed urgent for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. The City of Montebello's aging water utility infrastructure is causing leaks and equipment failures, impacting safety and reliability. Despite recent rate increases, the utility is losing money and the city cannot afford necessary upgrades. Montebello is considering selling the water utility to a public entity, but faces challenges due to conflicting statutes governing municipal property sales. The City of Montebello is facing challenges due to conflicting statutes governing the sale of its water utility. To address this issue and provide clear statutory authority to sell the utility without an election, immediate action is necessary."
