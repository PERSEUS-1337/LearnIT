    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"HIV Emergency Local Partnership Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that since the first reported AIDS cases over 25 years ago, 1.7 million people in the US have been diagnosed with HIV, with 500,000 deaths. Racial minorities are disproportionately affected, with 500,000 African-Americans and 200,000 Latinos living with the disease. African Americans make up 50% of AIDS patients, Latinos 19%. Ten States and Puerto Rico account for 71% of the Nation's AIDS cases. Within the top 10 States with the highest concentration of people living with HIV/AIDS, large Latino and African-American populations reside in New York, California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Maryland, District of Columbia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Puerto Rico. Programs funded through title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act are essential for HIV/AIDS positive individuals, especially those who are low income or from ethnic minorities. People living with HIV/AIDS, particularly those from low-income or minority communities, require holistic support including physical care, education on disease consequences, and prevention strategies. Non-profit organizations play a crucial role in providing comprehensive assistance to individuals in high-risk neighborhoods. The Act aims to establish a pilot grant program within the Minority AIDS Initiative to fund community health entities collaborating to provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS services for racial and ethnic minorities in high-risk local communities. The Act prioritizes HIV/AIDS services for minorities at the local level. The Public Health Service Act is amended to increase funding for HIV/AIDS services and prioritize funding for minorities at the local level. The Public Health Service Act is amended to provide grants to eligible entities in communities serving racial and ethnic minorities for comprehensive HIV/AIDS services, with specific requirements for types of services offered. The Public Health Service Act is amended to provide grants to eligible nonprofit private entities in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas for comprehensive services, including minority capacity staff building. The Public Health Service Act is amended to provide grants to eligible nonprofit private entities in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas for comprehensive services, with a preference for entities located in communities where racial and ethnic minorities make up the majority of the population. Grants will be distributed in at least 5 states and territories, with a focus on entities located within these areas. The Public Health Service Act is amended to provide grants to eligible nonprofit private entities in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas for comprehensive services. Eligible entities must partner with local entities in the community, use the grant for innovative approaches to HIV testing, prevention, and treatment, and have staff and governing body members reflective of the community served. The Secretary of Human and Health Services must submit a report by January 1, 2009. The Secretary of Human and Health Services is required to submit a report to Congress on the status of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the nation. The report will focus on the 10 states and territories with the highest concentration of people living with HIV/AIDS, analyze the effectiveness of a grant program, and recommend improvements for the program. The Secretary will seek comments from the public and grant recipients for the report on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. SEC. 4.
