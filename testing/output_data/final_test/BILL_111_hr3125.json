The Spectrum Inventory Act mandates the NTIA and the Commission to create an inventory of radio spectrum bands from 225 megahertz to 10 gigahertz, listing authorized radio services and users. The Spectrum Inventory Act requires the NTIA and the Commission to compile a list of radio spectrum bands from 225 MHz to 10 GHz, detailing authorized services, users, activities, capabilities, functions, missions, spectrum allocation, and geographic coverage. The Spectrum Inventory Act mandates the NTIA and the Commission to compile a list of radio spectrum bands from 225 MHz to 10 GHz, detailing authorized services, users, activities, capabilities, functions, missions, spectrum allocation, and geographic coverage. This includes characterizing the extent of use of each radio service in each frequency band, approximating the extent of usage by Federal and non-Federal users geographically, and providing contour maps or other information illustrating coverage areas and receiver performance for spectrum availability assessment. The Spectrum Inventory Act requires the NTIA and the Commission to compile a list of radio spectrum bands from 225 MHz to 10 GHz, detailing authorized services, users, activities, capabilities, functions, missions, spectrum allocation, and geographic coverage. This includes assessing the availability of spectrum in each band, identifying entities offering unlicensed services, and listing commercial names under which facilities-based service is offered to the public. The Spectrum Inventory Act mandates the creation of a centralized portal for public access to a list of radio spectrum bands. The NTIA and the Commission are required to utilize agency resources first and submit biennial reports to relevant Senate committees. The Spectrum Inventory Act requires the NTIA and the Commission to submit biennial reports to Senate and House committees, detailing inventory results, necessary information, and any missing data from users. The NTIA and the Commission must submit a report to Senate and House committees every 2 years, recommending spectrum reallocation or shared access, with an explanation. If an inventory has not been conducted up to 10 gigahertz 90 days before the third report, an inventory report is required. After creating the required inventory, the NTIA and the Commission must regularly update the information on a quarterly basis. Any changes in licenses or assignments must be promptly reflected. Additionally, national security and public safety information may be withheld by the executive head if necessary. The executive agency head can withhold certain information if it poses a threat to national security, homeland security, or public safety, and must notify the NTIA of this decision. Descriptions of the activities, capabilities, functions, or missions supported by the withheld information must be provided. The agency head must provide NTIA with publicly releasable information, a summary description of classified national security information, and a classified annex containing the classified information for which there is a legal basis for nondisclosure. Licensees of non-Federal spectrum can request exemptions from public disclosure of certain information if it would be detrimental to public safety or if prohibited by law. They can petition the Commission for partial or total exemption from inclusion on the centralized portal or website. Licensees seeking exemptions from public disclosure must provide clear and convincing evidence to justify the exemption. If granted, they must submit required information to the Commission, including a summary description suitable for public release. Licensees seeking exemptions from public disclosure must provide clear and convincing evidence to justify the exemption. If granted, they must submit required information to the Commission, including an annex with details withheld from public disclosure. The annexes will be provided to congressional committees but not disclosed to the public or unauthorized persons. Prior to releasing the inventory, consultation with the National Security Council is required. The NTIA and the Commission must consult with the National Security Council for up to 30 days to determine any additional information to withhold from the public regarding the release of inventory updates or reports. They must also adhere to rules on handling confidential and proprietary information. The House of Representatives passed the document on April 14, 2010, with Lorraine C. Miller as the Clerk."
