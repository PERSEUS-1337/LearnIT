    "content": "Since the late 1970s, Vietnam-era veterans have raised concerns about the health effects of exposure to Agent Orange, seeking disability compensation and healthcare. Congress has passed legislation to research the long-term effects and provide benefits to those exposed. This report provides an overview of how Congress and the judiciary have addressed the concerns of Vietnam-era veterans regarding Agent Orange exposure. It discusses legislative efforts, litigation, and current issues related to health care and disability compensation for these veterans. The report should be read in conjunction with CRS Report R41405. The U.S. military sprayed herbicides in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971, including nearly 19 million gallons of Agent Orange. Tables list diseases presumptively service-connected and not connected to Agent Orange exposure. Agent Orange, a mixture of herbicides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, was contaminated with toxic dioxins during manufacturing. Its effects on humans are not fully understood. Spraying occurred in various locations in Vietnam. The Department of Defense initially denied widespread exposure among U.S. military personnel. The 1979 General Accounting Office report revealed ground troop exposure to Agent Orange in South Vietnam. The Department of Veterans Affairs hesitated to compensate veterans due to uncertainty about long-term effects and scientific evidence linking Agent Orange to illnesses. The VA's authority to allow Agent Orange claims is limited until scientific evidence of its effects is documented. Congress directed the VA to investigate dioxin exposure in Vietnam War veterans, but no protocol was designed. The VA never established a protocol for studying Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam veterans. Responsibility was transferred to the CDC, but no study was produced. Despite efforts by veterans, a lack of scientific consensus hindered policies for health care and compensation. Disability compensation and health care for affected veterans have progressed through legislation and the judicial system since the late 1970s. Since the late 1970s, disability compensation and health care for Vietnam-era veterans exposed to Agent Orange have progressed through legislation and the judicial system. Congress has addressed specific health concerns, including adverse reproductive effects for male and female veterans, such as spina bifida for males and a range of birth defects for females. Special legislation has been passed to provide medical care for veterans and their offspring who may have been exposed to Agent Orange. Special legislation has been established to provide health care for Vietnam-era veterans and their children, despite the lack of definitive scientific evidence linking disorders to Agent Orange exposure. Congress and the VA rely on scientific evidence for disability compensation related to Agent Orange exposure and associated diseases. Two major laws since the 1980s have impacted disability compensation policies for Vietnam-era veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-542) required the VA to develop regulations for disability compensation to Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The Act authorized disability compensation payments for chloracne and in 1991, the Agent Orange Act (P.L. 102-4) established a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with herbicide exposure. The Agent Orange Act (P.L. 102-4) established a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with herbicide exposure by reviewing scientific evidence through the Institute of Medicine. The VA must consider a presumption of service connection for diseases linked to herbicide exposure in Vietnam within 60 days of receiving a report from the Institute of Medicine. Proposed regulations must be issued within 60 days of making a determination, and final regulations within 90 days, based on scientific evidence of a positive association. The VA establishes a presumption of service connection for diseases linked to herbicide exposure in Vietnam, granting service connection for certain conditions for veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam. New presumptions are not established based on the most recent IOM report. Table B-1 lists diseases presumptively service-connected. The VA's authority to establish additional presumptions of service connection for diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure will expire on September 30, 2015. A notice was issued in April 2014 stating that certain diseases and conditions are not presumptively service-connected. Litigation on Agent Orange exposure and disability compensation focuses on which diseases are presumed to be caused by exposure and which veterans have been presumptively exposed. In 1986, Vietnam veterans sued the VA for denying compensation claims related to disabilities from Agent Orange exposure. The VA had only recognized chloracne as linked to Agent Orange, using a strict test for disease causation. This led to Nehmer and Haas cases determining diseases caused by Agent Orange and which veterans were exposed. In 1989, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the VA must use a \"significant statistical association\" standard, not the previous \"cause and effect\" test, to determine diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure. This decision led to the enactment of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which established actions for the VA to take in response to the court ruling. The VA was required to issue new regulations regarding diseases associated with exposure to dioxin under the Agent Orange Act of 1991. Benefits awarded upon readjudication would be paid retroactively, with the effective date based on the date the claim was filed or the date the disability arose. The VA began readjudicating voided Agent Orange claims, focusing on cases where veterans specifically alleged exposure. The court clarified in 1999 that the VA's policy on readjudicating claims related to Agent Orange was voided. The 1989 decision voided all VA decisions where diseases were later found to be associated with Agent Orange, regardless of veteran's specific allegations. Congress extended the sunset date of the Agent Orange Act in 2001. In 2001, Congress extended the sunset date of the Agent Orange Act to September 30, 2015, requiring the Secretary to continue designating service-connected diseases. The VA found Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) linked to Agent Orange in 2003 but did not pay retroactive benefits to Vietnam veterans with CLL. A dispute arose in 2004 over the interpretation of the Final Stipulation regarding disease determinations made after September 30, 2002. The court sided with veterans in 2005, rejecting the VA's stance. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2007 upheld the decision requiring the VA to reajudicate all prior claims related to CLL and provide retroactive benefits. In 2009, the VA announced three additional conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. In 2010, B-cell leukemias, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic heart disease were officially added to the list. The VA is required to re-adjudicate claims for conditions like hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic heart disease due to exposure to dioxin under the Agent Orange Act. Veterans of Vietnam are presumptively exposed to Agent Orange, relieving them of the burden of proving exposure for disability compensation. If a veteran served in Vietnam between 1962 and 1975, diseases associated with Agent Orange are considered service-related. The VA's interpretation of the Agent Orange Act only includes veterans who set foot on the landmass of Vietnam or served in the inland waterways. Blue Water Navy veterans, who served off the coast of Vietnam, are not considered presumptively exposed to Agent Orange. Despite a legal challenge, the \"foot-on-land\" test remains the current standard. In 2001, Vietnam veteran Jonathan Haas applied for disability compensation. In 2001, Vietnam veteran Jonathan Haas applied for disability compensation for Type 2 Diabetes allegedly caused by his exposure to Agent Orange. Despite serving on a U.S. vessel off the coast of Vietnam, he was initially denied presumptive service connection. However, in 2006, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) overturned the decision, ruling that his service off the coast should qualify him for the presumption of service connection. In 2006, the CAVC overturned the BVA's decision regarding Agent Orange exposure claims for veterans who served on ships off the coast of Vietnam. The court found the regulation ambiguous and disagreed with the \"foot-on-land\" test, stating that veterans on ships near the coast faced the same risk of exposure. The VA was directed to stay proceedings and published a notice of proposed rulemaking to clarify its interpretation. The VA also appealed the CAVC's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CAVC's decision in the case Haas v. Peake, ruling in favor of the VA and upholding the \"foot-on-land\" policy for Vietnam veterans to qualify for exposure to Agent Orange. \"Blue Water\" veterans can still receive compensation if they prove exposure but won't receive a presumption of exposure. The court found the VA's interpretation of the statute reasonable under the Chevron doctrine. The court upheld the \"foot-on-land\" policy for Vietnam veterans regarding exposure to Agent Orange, stating that the VA's interpretation was reasonable and consistent. It was deemed an interpretive rule, not a substantive rule, so no violation of the Administrative Procedure Act occurred. The court reversed the CAVC decision and allowed Mr. Haas to pursue his claim of herbicide exposure on his ship without the benefit of presumptions from the Agent Orange Act of 1991. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on Mr. Haas's appeal regarding the \"foot-on-land\" policy for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Three major issues for Vietnam-era veterans include presumptive service-connected disability compensation, paternally mediated birth defects, and health care for biological grandchildren. Veterans with listed diseases are entitled to compensation if they served in Vietnam or its inland waterways. Veterans who served in Vietnam or its inland waterways between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, are entitled to benefits for Agent Orange-related diseases. Exceptions exist, and only Vietnam veterans are eligible for retroactive benefits. \"Blue Water Navy\" veterans are advocating for expanded eligibility for disability compensation. The VA asked the Institute of Medicine to study if \"Blue Water Navy\" veterans had comparable Agent Orange exposure as ground veterans. In 2011, IOM couldn't confirm exposure for \"Blue Water Navy\" veterans. The Institute of Medicine's report in 2011 could not confirm if Blue Water Navy personnel were exposed to Agent Orange or its associated TCDD due to a lack of data and inability to compare exposures with ground troops and Brown Water Navy personnel. There is no consistent evidence to suggest higher or lower cancer risk for Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans compared to other veterans. Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans may have been exposed to Agent Orange, but the committee cannot determine the extent of exposure. Various groups of Vietnam-era veterans claim exposure to Agent Orange through storage, transportation, testing in Panama, and use in C-123 airplanes after the war. The VA is reviewing claims for disability compensation related to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam-era veterans. Currently, only spina bifida in children of male veterans is compensated, while a range of birth defects in children of female veterans are covered. This decision was based on a health study of women Vietnam-era veterans. The \"Women Vietnam Veterans Reproductive Outcomes Health Study\" was completed in October 1998 by the Environmental Epidemiology Service of the VA. The 2012 Agent Orange report stated insufficient evidence for birth defects in offspring of male Vietnam-era veterans. Veteran organizations advocate for more research on paternally mediated birth defects and disability compensation policies for later generations. Some veterans believe genetic effects of Agent Orange may skip a generation and reappear in subsequent generations. In November 2010, veterans requested the IOM to assess the issue. In November 2010, veterans requested the IOM to assess transgenerational effects of exposure-related epigenetic changes from Agent Orange. The IOM extended its focus in 2010 to include all medical conditions in Vietnam-era veterans' children and successive generations. The 2012 Agent Orange report found insufficient evidence to determine the effects. The 2012 Agent Orange report from IOM found insufficient evidence to determine the association between exposure to Agent Orange and specific health issues in offspring. The report recommends conducting epidemiologic studies on developmental effects in offspring associated with paternal exposure and evaluating offspring for clinical health conditions later in life. The committee recognizes evidence of environmental exposures affecting later generations through fetal and germ-line modifications, making epidemiologic investigation challenging."
