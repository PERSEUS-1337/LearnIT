    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Save Our Climate Act of 2009\". The Congress finds that human emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are responsible for global climate change. The IPCC estimates a 3.2-7.2 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures in the next 100 years if emissions are not reduced. This increase could have major adverse impacts on both human and man-made environments, including rising sea levels, intensified weather events, species extinction, and water scarcity. The United States is responsible for nearly 24% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, totaling around six billion metric tons per year. To stabilize the earth's climate and prevent catastrophic global climate change, worldwide carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced by 80% by 2050. Implementing a tax on fossil fuels based on carbon content can help reduce emissions and the revenue collected could be used for various purposes such as decreasing taxes on low and middle-income taxpayers, funding research on alternative green energy sources, or increasing funding for other domestic social priorities. The text introduces a new subchapter in the Internal Revenue Code imposing a carbon tax on primary fossil fuels. A tax is imposed on taxable fuel based on carbon content, starting at $10 per ton and increasing annually. The rate freezes after the target attainment year. The tax on taxable fuel is based on carbon content, starting at $10 per ton and increasing annually. The rate freezes after the target attainment year, which is when carbon dioxide emissions do not exceed 20 percent of the 1990 levels. Taxable fuel includes coal, petroleum, and natural gas. The tax on taxable fuel is based on carbon content, starting at $10 per ton and increasing annually. Taxable fuel includes coal, petroleum, and natural gas extracted, manufactured, or produced in the United States or entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. Definitions for terms like 'United States', 'importer', and 'ton' are provided. No tax is imposed on the sale or in-kind exchange of taxable fuel for deposit in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Special rules include only one tax imposed on a product, fractional ton tax calculation, and treating use by manufacturers as a sale. The tax liability for manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable fuel who use the fuel is the same as if the fuel were sold. Special rules apply for inventory exchanges where the exchange is not treated as a sale, and the other person involved is treated as the seller for tax purposes. For inventory exchanges, both parties must be registered as manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable fuels. The recipient must provide their registration number to the fuel supplier. For inventory exchanges, both parties must be registered as manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable fuels. The recipient must provide their registration number and internal revenue district. Inventory exchange refers to exchanging property described in section 1221(a)(1). Refunds or credits may be available for taxable fuel used in manufacturing or production under regulations set by the Secretary. A credit or refund may be allowed to a person who used taxable fuel in manufacturing a substance that is not taxable fuel, if carbon from the fuel is embedded or sequestered during the production process. If carbon from taxable fuel is embedded or sequestered during manufacturing, a credit or refund may be allowed equal to the tax amount imposed on the fuel used for production. The credit or refund amount cannot exceed the tax imposed on the fuel used in manufacturing. Exemption for exports of taxable fuels under subsection (h) allows tax-free sales by manufacturers or producers for export or resale for export, with rules similar to section 4221(b) for proof of export. A credit or refund is available if tax was paid on exported taxable fuel. The provision allows for a credit or refund of tax paid on exported taxable fuel, subject to conditions such as repayment to the exporter or obtaining their consent. The Secretary may allow a credit or refund of tax on exported fuel directly to the exporter under certain conditions, as specified in regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall conduct a study every 5 years on the impacts of the carbon tax on primary fossil fuels. The results will be submitted to the relevant congressional committees. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments regarding a carbon tax on primary fossil fuels will apply to sales after the enactment of this Act."
