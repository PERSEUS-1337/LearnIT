    "content": "The FY2002 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (P.L. 107-63) was enacted on November 5, 2001, with a total budget of $19.18 billion. It allocated funds to various departments including $9.44 billion for DOI, $4.13 billion for the Forest Service, $1.77 billion for energy programs, $2.76 billion for the Indian Health Service, and amounts for the Smithsonian Institution, National Endowment for the Arts, and National Endowment for the Humanities. The bill also removed provisions related to hardrock mining regulations, the Kyoto Protocol, and oil and gas drilling in the \"Lease Sale 181\" area of the Gulf. The FY2002 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes funding for agencies in four federal departments, excluding the Bureau of Reclamation. It also extends the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program and modifies the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. The bill prohibits funds for offshore energy leasing in certain areas and within presidentially-proclaimed national monuments. The FY2002 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies within the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, and Department of Health and Human Services. It also covers related agencies like the Smithsonian Institution and National Endowment for the Arts. President Bush submitted the FY2002 budget to Congress on April 9, 2001. The FY2002 budget request for Interior and Related Agencies is $18.19 billion, a decrease from the $19.07 billion enacted for FY2001. The total funding for FY2001 included emergency supplemental appropriations and funds for land conservation and infrastructure improvement, which are not continued in the FY2002 budget request. The report outlines a new category of discretionary spending for \"conservation\" activities, with specific funding allocations for the next 5 years subject to annual appropriations. This includes preserving lands, habitats, wildlife, and providing recreational opportunities. Table 12 shows the distribution of conservation funds for FY2001 and proposed funding levels for FY2002. The term \"appropriations\" refers to total available funds, including regular, supplemental, and other allocations. Increases and decreases are based on a comparison between FY2001 and requested funding levels. The FY2002 budget requests included significant changes in agency budgets compared to FY2001 levels. Increases were proposed for agencies like the National Park Service, Indian Health Service, and Department of Energy, while decreases were suggested for agencies such as the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Geological Survey, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest Service. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding of approximately $18.9 billion for the FY2002 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. This included increases above the President's request for various programs such as the U.S. Geological Survey, Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, and Energy Conservation. The bill was reported to the full House Appropriations Committee on June 13, 2001. The House Committee on Appropriations reported bill H.R. 2217 to the House on June 19, 2001. Several funding increase amendments were rejected during the markup, including for the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Institute of Museum and Library Services. The House debated and passed H.R. 2217 on June 21, 2001, with a total of $19.0 billion. On June 21, 2001, the House passed bill H.R. 2217 with a total of $19.0 billion. The amendments accepted included increasing funds for the arts and ensuring equal value of oil received as royalty-in-kind. Amendments rejected involved funding for various programs and maintaining the prohibition on oil and gas drilling in the Lease Sale 181 area of the Gulf of Mexico until April 1, 2002. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 2217 on June 28, 2001, providing a total of $18.66 billion, slightly below the House-passed level. The bill recommended increases for almost all agencies and bureaus of the Department of the Interior for FY2002. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for various agencies under the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies for FY2002. The Senate debated and passed the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill on July 12, 2001, with a total of $18.53 billion allocated. An amendment was included to prohibit the use of funds for energy leasing within the bill. The Senate passed an amendment to bar funds in the bill from being used for energy leasing within presidentially-proclaimed national monuments. They also agreed to extend and modify the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, pushing the repayment deadline to 2015. The amendment extends and modifies the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, allowing for an increase in loan coverage to 90% or 95%. There are limits on the total outstanding loans and individual loan amounts. Provisions regarding iron ore mining and coke-producing companies were removed from the amendment. Conferees were appointed from the House and Senate to discuss the bill. The House and Senate conferees met on October 10, 2001, and filed a report (H.Rept. 107-234) on October 11, 2001, containing a total of $19.18 billion for FY2002. The report includes funding for agencies within the Department of the Interior, the Forest Service, fire funds for the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, energy programs, Indian Health Service, Smithsonian Institution, and the National Endowment for the Arts. The conference report for FY2002 includes funding for the Smithsonian Institution at $497.2 million, National Endowment for the Arts at $98.2 million, and National Endowment for the Humanities at $124.5 million. It also allocates $1.32 billion for conservation spending, $120 million for restoration of the Florida Everglades, $600 million for backlog maintenance for land management agencies, and $429 million for land acquisition. Provisions were made to address energy and mineral issues, including dropping restrictions on hardrock mining regulations and oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, funds were barred for offshore preleasing and leasing activities in certain areas. The FY2002 conference report allocated funds for various agencies and programs, including the Smithsonian Institution, National Endowment for the Arts, and National Endowment for the Humanities. It also included provisions for conservation spending, restoration of the Florida Everglades, backlog maintenance for land management agencies, and land acquisition. The agreement extended the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, retained the Senate's provision on the Steel Loan Guarantee Program, and addressed energy and mineral issues. The bill passed both the House and Senate and was signed into law on November 5, 2001. Interior and Related Agencies appropriations increased by 56% from FY1993 to FY2002. Appropriations for Interior and Related Agencies increased by 56% from FY1993 to FY2002, with significant growth in the latter years. Funding rose from $12.2 billion to $19.1 billion, with the largest increase occurring from FY2000 to FY2001. Additionally, a $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation was enacted in response to the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. The $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation enacted in response to the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks was distributed in three phases. The first phase made $10 billion immediately available, the second phase allowed an additional $10 billion to be obligated after a 15-day notification to Congress, and the final phase allocated $20 billion only after another emergency appropriations act. Of the $20 billion provided, $3.1 million went to programs under the Department of Interior and Related agencies appropriations. The $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation enacted in response to the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks was distributed in three phases. The first phase made $10 billion immediately available, the second phase allowed an additional $10 billion to be obligated after a 15-day notification to Congress, and the final phase allocated $20 billion only after another emergency appropriations act. Of the $20 billion provided, $88.1 million was appropriated for anti-terrorism activities in the Department of Interior and related agencies, including $10.1 million for the National Park System and $25.3 million for the U.S. Park Police to enhance security measures. The Bush Administration's initial FY2002 budget request included funding for security enhancements at key national park sites in New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as for security improvements at iconic monuments and museums in the area. This included funding for the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, National Gallery of Art, Smithsonian, National Museum of the American Indian, and John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The Bush Administration's initial FY2002 budget request for the Department of the Interior included $7.7 million for combating terrorism, including defense against weapons of mass destruction. Additional funding was requested for DOI efforts to protect critical infrastructure, totaling $9.6 million for combating unconventional threats in FY2002. The funding included only DOI agencies and not related agencies funded by the Department of Interior appropriations laws. The FY2002 Interior appropriations law did not specify additional funding for anti-terrorism activities. The conference report mentioned anti-terrorism indirectly, with increases in funding for the Office of Protection Services and oil and gas resource evaluation in light of recent events. The FY2002 Interior appropriations law did not allocate extra funds for anti-terrorism efforts, but highlighted the importance of protecting America's energy supply. The Bureau of Land Management manages vast public lands for various uses like mining, energy development, and recreation, making it a top priority project. For more information on the Department of the Interior's budget and performance, visit their website. The Bureau of Land Management oversees federal subsurface mineral resources, Indian Trust lands, and wildland fire management on millions of acres of land. The FY2002 appropriations law allocated $1.87 billion to the BLM, with a decrease in funding for Wildland Fire Management compared to FY2001. The FY2002 appropriations law provides $2.24 billion for wildland fire management for the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, allowing for fund transfers in emergency situations like wildfires. This is an increase over the President's request but a decrease from the previous year. The FY2002 appropriations law allocates $775.6 million for the management of lands and resources, including $29.0 million for conservation spending. This is an increase from the previous year's funding and includes funds for BLM land programs such as protection, use, improvement, development, and disposal. Additionally, funds for land use planning have increased from $25.8 million in FY2001 to about $33 million in FY2002, a 28% increase. The FY2002 appropriations law allocates $775.6 million for land and resource management, with $29.0 million for conservation. Funds are recommended to update land use plans for mineral and recreational uses. Energy and minerals receive nearly $100 million, targeting oil and gas programs on public lands. Funds cannot be used for energy leasing within national monuments, except as allowed by presidential proclamations. The FY2002 appropriations law allocates $775.6 million for land and resource management, with $29.0 million for conservation. Amendments were made to prevent boundary adjustments of national monuments for energy leasing. The law does not include language to suspend or revise regulations on hard rock mining on federal lands. The Bush Administration proposed suspending hardrock mining regulations amended extensively by the Clinton Administration. A final rule was issued retaining land reclamation requirements but removing BLM authority to deny mining operations. Additional changes were proposed with public comment allowed until December 31, 2001. The law maintains a moratorium on new mining patents on federal lands, except for applications meeting specific criteria filed before September 30, 1994. The law extends fees for maintaining mining claims on public land and for locating and recording claims. It also addresses range issues, including preventing the destruction of wild horses and burros, and the automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases. The FY2002 appropriations law includes provisions for the automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases, addressing heavy agency workload concerns. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT) receives $210 million, with $50 million allocated for conservation activities. This marks a substantial increase over previous years and compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions. The FY2002 appropriations law includes $49.9 million for Land Acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), allocated for conservation activities. The funds are less than FY2001 levels but more than the House and Senate passed levels. The money will be divided among various projects. For more information on the Bureau of Land Management, visit http://www.blm.gov/nhp/index.htm. The FY2002 appropriations law includes $49.9 million for Land Acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), allocated for conservation activities. The funds are less than FY2001 levels but more than the House and Senate passed levels. The money will be divided among various projects. The Administration requested $1.09 billion for FWS for FY2002, a decrease of 11.1% from FY2001. The FY2002 appropriations law includes $1.28 billion for FWS, with funding priorities shifting in several areas. The House passed $1.34 billion, the Senate approved $1.27 billion, and the enacted amount is $1.28 billion. Additional Title VIII funds for existing FWS programs in FY2001 included money for endangered species, wetlands, maintenance, and land acquisition. Title VIII also allocated funds for a new program benefiting non-game species. Title IX in the Commerce bill provided $50 million for different programs. In FY2001, additional funds of $50 million were allocated in Title IX of the Commerce bill for State Wildlife Grants benefiting non-game species. These funds, along with the funding levels for FY2002, are detailed in Table 3. Endangered Species Funding remains a contentious issue within the FWS budget. The Administration requested a decrease in endangered species funding for FY2002, with the House and Senate proposing different amounts. The FY2002 appropriations law ultimately provided $272.1 million for endangered species programs, including $96.2 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The FY2002 appropriations law provided $272.1 million for endangered species programs, with a cap on funding for FWS listing function to prevent diversion of funds. The Administration proposed a new cap due to budget constraints and court orders. The Administration proposed a new cap on funding for the FWS listing program, limiting it to $8,476,000 for implementing certain sections of the Endangered Species Act. This proposal was highly controversial in the FWS budget discussions. The FWS proposed a controversial cap on funding for the listing program, aiming to regain control of the listing process based on biological need rather than lawsuits. Critics argued that the cap would hinder listings and was one-sided, as it did not apply to de-listings or down listings. The House approved $8.48 million for the listing program, rejecting the proposed change to remove the spending cap. They also set a subcap of $6 million for new critical habitat designations. The Senate passed a $9 million cap on listing without a subcap on critical habitat. The FY2002 appropriations law follows the Senate's funding level. The FY2002 appropriations law follows the Senate's funding level for the listing program and specifies that the critical habitat designation limitation is exclusive of funds needed for litigation support. The Klamath River Conflict involves a controversy over scarce water resources in California and Oregon, centering around two listed species of suckers, coho salmon, and bald eagles. The Bureau of Reclamation restricted irrigation water to protect fish, leading to conflict with farmers seeking a reprieve. The Senate amendment to prohibit funds for the Bureau's decision was tabled on July 12. Water deliveries were to continue as per earlier biological opinions until certain actions were carried out. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund received proposed funding of $11.4 million, with the House passing $16.4 million and the Senate passing $14.4 million. Payment amounts are based on authorized formulas in law and have been controversial due to small additions of land to the National Wildlife Refuge System. The National Wildlife Refuge System has seen small additions of land in recent years, leading to calls for increased funding from Congress. Local governments often see payments as entitlements, although they are subject to annual appropriations. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimates $11.4 million would cover 49% of formula amounts for counties, with an additional $5 million raising it to 70%. Land acquisition in FY2002 is complex due to distribution of Title VIII funds and program revisions. Title VIII in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act originally derived funding from the U.S. Treasury's General Fund, but was later amended by P.L.106-554 to use LWCF funding. New land acquisition programs in FY2002 overlap with existing programs proposed to be cut. Table 5 shows appropriations for land acquisition from FY2000 to FY2002, with $19,956,000 from LWCF. Funding for FWS in FY2001 came from Commerce, but in FY2002 it would come from Interior with competitive grants replaced by formula grants. In FY2002, $5,000,000 is earmarked for the State wildlife grant program. The Private Stewardship Grants and Landowner Incentive Program are related to existing programs, with a focus on supporting federal land acquisition. The FY2002 budget proposes redirecting $60 million in federal land acquisition funds towards private conservation efforts. The FY2002 budget proposes redirecting $60 million in federal land acquisition funds towards private conservation efforts. The House and Senate approved increased funding for conservation programs, with a new category of discretionary spending called \"Conservation Spending Category\" included in the FY2002 law. The FY2002 budget includes funding for the Multi-national Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) benefiting various endangered species. The House and Senate approved an increase in funding for the program, with the House proposing $4 million and the Senate agreeing. The program remains at $3.2 million as proposed. For more information on the Fish and Wildlife Service, visit http://www.fws.gov/. The National Park Service manages 384 units in the National Park System, covering 83 million acres with nearly 300 million annual visits. The mission involves balancing visitor use with resource preservation, posing challenges for staff. Funding for the National Park Service has improved in recent years after decades of limited support. The National Park Service has recently overcome funding shortfalls, leading to operational and maintenance improvements. Public support for increased funding grew after temporary closures during the budget debates of 1995-1996. Funding for the NPS has risen annually since 1996, with the FY2002 appropriations law providing $2.32 billion, $187.8 million more than current levels. Park Operations accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total NPS budget. The National Park Service's budget for Park Operations covers resource protection, visitor services, and major park programs. The House bill allocated $1.48 billion for Park Operations, slightly more than the request and $92 million above current funding. The Senate-passed bill allocated $1.47 billion. The FY2002 law provided $1.48 billion, including $48 million for National Recreation and Preservation, a decrease from the previous year. Maintenance Backlog remains a challenge due to the extensive infrastructure of the National Park System. The National Park Service faces a maintenance burden with thousands of miles of roads, structures, and a multi-billion dollar backlog. President Bush seeks $4.9 billion over five years to eliminate the backlog through various funding sources. The National Park Service's maintenance backlog, totaling $2.7 billion, includes roads, bridges, and transportation projects funded by the Transportation Equity Act. The President's proposed $4.9 billion plan aims to address this backlog through a combination of appropriated funds, recreation fees, and potential TEA 21 reauthorization in 2004. Critics have labeled the initial $440 million budget proposal as \"modest.\" The proposed $440 million downpayment to address the National Park Service's $2.7 billion maintenance backlog has been criticized as modest. Critics argue that the funds are mainly allocated to roads and buildings rather than protecting park resources. The Administration requested a moratorium on new park unit creation and study authorizations, but Congress has approved study legislation for potential new units. The Administration did not submit an annual list of new areas for study and evaluation as required by Congress. The FY2002 law allocates $600 million for backlog maintenance needs of the Park System, with the NPS portion unspecified. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program allows higher entrance and recreation user fees, with the NPS proposing to direct up to 60% of generated receipts towards deferred maintenance needs. The House-passed bill extends the program for four years and includes other changes. The House supported a four-year extension of the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, allowing agencies to charge fees at more sites. There were concerns about the program, with debates on how fee revenues should be spent. The Senate bill did not address the program extension, but the FY2002 appropriations law extended it for two years. Agencies are working on draft legislation to make the program permanent. The draft legislation aims to make the Fee Demo program permanent and remove it from the appropriation process. The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery (UPARR) program received a significant increase in funding in FY2001 but was not continued in the FY2002 budget request. The Administration argued that the LWCF state grant program provided more flexibility for local governments. The U.S. Conference of Mayors opposed the Administration's decision to eliminate UPARR. The U.S. Conference of Mayors opposed the Administration's decision to eliminate UPARR funding, which was restored by the House Appropriations Committee at $30 million. The FY2002 law also allocated $30 million for UPARR. The legislation overrides court decisions to limit cruise ships in Glacier Bay National Park, allowing 139 ships for two years despite concerns about ecosystem damage and endangered humpback whales. The Historic Preservation fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants to states, local governments, and outlying areas for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. Grants are typically funded on a 60% federal- 40% state matching share basis and have been provided to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Indian Tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians for cultural heritage projects. The fund was reauthorized through FY2005 by the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 2000. The Historic Preservation Fund, reauthorized through FY2005, receives $74.5 million in funding. Save America's Treasures, a program funded alongside the HPF, grants money for preserving significant cultural artifacts and historic structures. Notable projects include the restoration of the Star Spangled Banner and the Declaration of Independence. The Save America's Treasures program received appropriations for FY2000 and FY2001, with criticism for lack of geographic diversity in grants. The FY2001 law allocated $20 million for projects like the Rosa Parks Museum and Mark Twain House, with added language requiring formal approval for project recommendations. Projects need a 50% cost share and no single project can receive more than one grant. The program focuses on preserving and restoring historic buildings. The HPF account has funded preservation projects for historic buildings on HBCU campuses, with grants awarded for repairs on buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places. An appropriation in FY2001 of $6.9 million represented unused authorization from P.L. 104-333, which has been fulfilled according to the Bush Administration. No funding was allocated for HBCUs in the FY2002 appropriations law. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, chartered by Congress in 1949 to protect historic American sites, no longer receives direct federal funding since FY1998. It remains self-supporting through private funding and maintains financial assistance programs like the Preservation Services Fund and National Preservation Loan Fund for preservation projects. The FY2002 Senate and House passed bills and appropriations law include $2.5 million for a National Historic Trust Endowment grant, while the Administration's FY2002 budget requested $67.06 million for the Historic Preservation Fund total. This total reflects a revision resulting from a line item for \"conservation,\" which zeroed out the HPF and replaced it using a different accounting procedure. The FY2002 Interior Appropriations Act provides $74.5 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, which is $19.7 million below the FY2001 appropriation. The House approved $77 million, adding $5 million for a grant to the National Trust Historic Sites Fund. The Senate concurred with providing $74 million for the HPF for FY2002. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the primary science agency for earth and biological science information related to natural hazards, environment, energy, mineral, water, and biological sciences. The budget for USGS for FY2002 was $813.4 million, a decrease of $69.4 million. The Administration requested $813.4 million for the USGS for FY2002, a decrease of $69.4 million from FY2001. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $900.5 million, an increase of $87.1 million above the request and $17.7 million over FY2001. The House restored high-priority research programs proposed for reduction. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $892.5 million for the USGS, an increase of $79.1 million above the request. The FY2002 appropriations law contains $914.0 million, with $25.0 million allocated for State Planning Partnerships. The Administration requested $123.7 million for the National Mapping Program, a decrease from FY2001. The House and Senate approved funding for the USGS Program, with the FY2002 appropriations law allocating $133.3 million, an increase from the request and FY2001. The Administration requested a reduction in funding for the Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activity. The House approved $228.2 million for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes, emphasizing the importance of the minerals information program and looking forward to a review of the program. Funding for global change research was maintained, while funding for the Central Great Lakes Geologic Mapping Coalition was discontinued. The budget sought to refocus funding on domestic minerals information and analysis activities. The Committee emphasized the need to enhance the Survey's coastal geology program and upgrade hazards monitoring networks. The Senate approved $229.5 million for the Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes program, allocating funds for multidisciplinary programs and international minerals analysis. The FY2002 budget maintained funding at the FY2001 level for international minerals analysis activities, global change research, and monitoring activities at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The budget also included $232.8 million, an increase of $19.0 million over the request and $7.5 million above FY2001. Major decreases were proposed for the Toxic Substances Hydrology Program and the National Water Quality Assessment Program, with plans for more collaborative partnerships and cost-sharing with stakeholders. The budget for FY2002 proposed a decrease in Conservation Spending Category program funding for stream gauging activities and sought to discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes. The House approved $205.5 million for Water Resources Investigations, an increase of $46.0 million over the request. Funding for Water Resources Research Institutes was restored with a $545,000 increase. The House-approved levels restored $5.0 million in Conservation Category Spending for streamgauges, with a proviso that it was one-time money. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Survey to prepare a report on water availability by Jan. 31, 2002. The Committee also directed the Survey to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to examine water resources research funded by federal and non-federal organizations. The Senate approved $200.8 million for Water Resources Investigations program, which was $41.3 million over the request but $2.7 million under FY2001. The FY2002 law contains $205.8 million for Water Resources Investigations, $46.3 million above the request and $2.3 million over FY2001. Additionally, $5.0 million was restored in Conservation Category Spending for streamgauges, indicating that the Federal streamgaging program in FY2002 would be about equal to the FY2001 level. The FY2002 budget for the Water Resources Investigations program is $205.8 million, $46.3 million above the request and $2.3 million over FY2001. The Biological Research activity requested $149.3 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from FY2001. Funding for the National Biological Information Infrastructure Program was discontinued. The conferees agreed to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to assess water resources research investments. The FY2002 budget for Biological Research was approved at $166.4 million, exceeding the request by $17.1 million and FY2001 by $5.8 million. This funding allows for the National Biological Information Infrastructure Program to continue. The USGS budget presentation for FY2002 included Science Support at $81.3 million and Facilities at $85.9 million. Science Support saw an increase of $7.5 million from FY2001, mainly due to a transfer of funding for the USGS library and support services. This transfer offset decreases in USGS network efforts, resulting in a net increase for the activity. The FY2002 budget for USGS included $86.2 million for Science Support, an increase of $4.9 million from the request and $12.5 million above FY2001. Facilities funding was $89.4 million, with the House approving $86.4 million and the Senate approving $86.7 million. The FY2002 budget for USGS included $85.9 million, $2.5 million below the request. The law contains $89.4 million for Facilities, with $2.2 million designated for construction of a Center for Coastal Geology in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Minerals Management Service administers the Offshore Minerals Management Program and the Minerals Revenue Management Program. The Minerals Management Service oversees production of offshore oil, gas, and minerals, collecting and disbursing revenues from federal onshore and OCS leases. In FY2002, they anticipated collecting $7.9 billion in revenues. The Administration's FY2002 request included $252.1 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management, with allocations for various programs and funds. The FY2002 funding for the Minerals Management Service included $252.1 million, with $149.4 million from appropriations and $102.7 million from offsetting collections. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding at the requested level, with a slight increase for the regulatory program. An amendment was adopted to ensure the government receives fair value for oil royalties. The amendment ensures fair value for oil royalties paid by the industry to the government. It specifies that royalty-in-kind oil should be equal to or greater than income from a comparable royalty-in-value program. Another amendment delays Administration plans for \"Lease Sale 181\" in the Gulf of Mexico. The amendment passed by a wide margin (247-164) in the area of the Gulf of Mexico within Alabama state boundaries, 17 miles from the Florida panhandle coast. Supporters cited risks to the shoreline and marine environment, while opponents argued against trading off energy security for a small environmental risk. The Senate rejected an amendment (33-67) to prohibit federal funds for oil and gas Lease Sale 181. The House vote on Interior appropriations led to a reduced acreage for Lease Sale 181. The lease sale known as Sale181 would only cover 1.47 million acres out of the originally proposed 5.9 million. Secretary of Interior Gale Norton described it as a compromise between affected States and the Administration. The sale would take place on December 5, 2001, as per the proposed notice of sale issued by the MMS. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $151.9 million for royalty and offshore minerals management, with additional funding for outer continental shelf leasing and environmental programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $151.9 million for royalty and offshore minerals management, with additional funding for outer continental shelf leasing and environmental programs. The full Senate supported the Committee's recommendations, resulting in a total FY2002 appropriation of $156.8 million for royalty and offshore minerals management and oil spill research. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement was established to ensure land mined for coal would be reclaimed, funded by the Abandoned Mine Lands fund. For more information, visit http://www.mms.gov/. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) oversees state regulatory programs for reclaiming abandoned sites. The FY2002 budget request for OSM was $269 million, a decrease of $33.9 million from the previous year. This included $166.8 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands fund, with reductions in grants for states and tribes. Additionally, $102.2 million was allocated for Regulation and Technology programs. The FY2002 budget for OSM included $102.2 million for Regulation and Technology programs, with increases for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative and the Small Operators Assistance Program. The House Appropriations Committee approved $203.6 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands fund, including a $37 million restoration and an additional $1 million for Regulation and Technology programs. The House approved $203.6 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands fund, including $1 million for Regulation and Technology programs. Grants to states are based on coal production levels, with \"minimum program states\" receiving a minimum funding level of $2 million. Congress has allocated $1.5 million to these states since FY1996, with a proposed increase to $1.6 million for FY2002. The Bush Administration did not take a clear stance on restoring the minimum program level to $2.0 million for qualifying states. The House and Senate agreed on funding levels for various programs related to Abandoned Mine Reclamation. The total amount allocated for FY2002 was $306.5 million, with slight alterations made by the conferees. The funding levels for Regulation and Technology, Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, ACSI, and minimum program states were all agreed upon. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides a variety of services to federally recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. The FY2001 direct appropriations were $2.19 billion, with a proposed increase to $2.20 billion for FY2002. In FY2002, the Administration proposed a $2.20 billion budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, with increases in Tribal Priority Allocations, BIA school operations, and aid for Tribally Controlled Colleges. The House approved a slightly higher budget of $2.21 billion, with additional funding for Tribal Priority Allocations. The Senate approved total BIA appropriations of $2.23 billion, with increases in funding for Tribal Priority Allocations, tribal colleges, and education construction. The total BIA construction budget includes $295.5 million for education construction. The FY2002 appropriations law allocated $2.22 billion for BIA, slightly more than the Administration's request and the House's budget. The BIA appropriations include $752.16 million for TPA, with key issues focusing on greater tribal influence, equitable funding distribution, trust asset management, law enforcement, and school building repairs. Provisions for tribal control over federal Indian programs have been added, including lands for gaming for certain tribes. Greater tribal control over federal Indian programs has been the goal of Indian policy since the 1970s, with three forms of tribal involvement: tribal contracting, tribal compacting, and Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA). TPA accounted for 42.2% of the BIA's operation of Indian programs in FY2001, giving tribes more influence in budget planning and authority to reprogram funds. The FY2002 enacted amount for Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) is 41.8% of the recommendation for operation of Indian programs and 33.8% of recommended total BIA appropriations. Contract support costs, authorized under the Indian Self-determination Act, fund non-operational and overhead costs incurred by tribes in administering programs under self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. Issues raised by contract support costs include consistent shortfall in appropriations, tribes' claim of entitlement to full funding, identity of programs included in funding base, and rate-setting methods. Congress imposed a one-year moratorium on BIA self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts in FY1999 to address contract support costs. The GAO recommended four alternative funding methods and urged BIA and the Indian Health Service to develop a standard policy. However, Congress did not retain the moratorium for FY2000 and FY2001. The BIA estimates that appropriations for contract support costs only met 88% of the needs. Both the House and the conference committee are urging the OMB to coordinate solutions for the handling of contract support costs by BIA and IHS. The BIA estimates that appropriations for contract support costs met 88% of reported tribal need in FY2000 and 89% in FY2001, and will meet 88% of the need in FY2002. Funding distribution involves equitable distribution of BIA funding and consideration of tribes' own financial resources. A 1998 GAO study found that TPA funds were distributed based on historical levels and formulas, with varying per capita distribution across BIA areas. Supporters of TPA funding redistribution argue for \"means-testing\" based on inequitable distribution of BIA funding, inadequate funding for poorer tribes, and discrepancies in per capita funds. Opponents claim most tribes are in poverty, funding is insufficient, means-testing would penalize tribes with severe needs, violate federal trust responsibility, and be unfair compared to state or local governments receiving federal assistance. Congress debated various proposals. Congress debated proposals for reallocating TPA funding during FY1998-FY2001. A tribal-federal workgroup was authorized to assess tribal needs and funding, with a recommendation that base TPA funding should not be redistributed. In FY2000, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to redistribute TPA funds to alleviate tribal funding disparities. In FY2000, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to redistribute TPA funds to alleviate tribal funding disparities. Congress also directed the BIA to distribute funds to its two post-secondary institutions based on a formula. For FY2001, a provision prohibited Alaska Native tribes with fewer than 25 members from receiving TPA funds. Trust fund management is now the responsibility of the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians. The BIA and the Office of Special Trustee are implementing the Secretary of the Interior's High Level Implementation Plan for the Trust Management Improvement Project, which includes improvements in trust asset systems, policies, and procedures. A new computerized trust asset and accounting management system (TAAMS) has been contracted, but critics have raised doubts about its success. Congress has prohibited the deployment of TAAMS until the system meets contract requirements. The BIA's Billings region serves as a test site for the certification of a new trust asset and accounting management system (TAAMS). Congress did not include the TAAMS prohibition in the FY2001 or FY2002 Interior appropriations laws. Funding for BIA trust asset management functions, including law enforcement initiatives in Indian country, has increased for FY2001 and FY2002. The initiative aims to address increased crime rates and inadequate law enforcement by providing additional resources for law officers, police facilities, tribal youth programs, and tribal court assistance. For FY2002, BIA funding primarily supports reservation law enforcement operations and improvements, while DOJ funds are allocated for grants, tribal courts, juvenile justice, and detention facility construction. The Administration proposed a $9 million increase for BIA law enforcement, which was agreed upon by the House, Senate, and conference committee. School construction under BIA covers new facilities, repairs, and improvements for over 2,000 education facilities. The BIA estimates a $942 million backlog in education facility repairs. Congress funded a 74% increase in education facility construction for FY2000 and a 119% increase for FY2001. Additionally, a new tribal school construction demonstration project was recommended for funding in FY2001. The Administration proposed a decrease in funding for construction of replacement schools for FY2002. The FY2002 appropriations law approved $292.5 million for BIA education construction, with the Senate adding $3 million for new school construction. Total education construction funding remained at $295.5 million. Congress has also addressed Indian land and gaming issues in recent Interior appropriations acts. The FY2002 appropriations law includes provisions restricting the use of the Huron Cemetery in Kansas City, KS for economic development, including gaming, by the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma. The law clarifies that gaming cannot occur on the cemetery or contiguous lands not taken into trust. In a California case, a provision was repealed that authorized the Secretary of the Interior to take certain land into trust for the benefit of the Lytton tribe. The FY2002 appropriations law includes provisions regarding the use of land for gaming by tribes. A provision allowing the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for the Lytton Rancheria was repealed, affecting gaming eligibility under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The new provision makes gaming subject to state-tribal compacts for casinos. The impact on the governor's power to disapprove gaming on the lands is uncertain. For more information on the Bureau of Indian Affairs, visit their website. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 to oversee tribal bingo and other gaming operations. Its budget authority primarily comes from fee assessments on tribes' Class II operations. The FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act increased assessment fees for NIGC to $8 million, expanded fees to include Class III operations, and raised NIGC appropriations to $2 million. NIGC activities have been funded solely by fees since FY1999, with no direct appropriations in FY2000 or FY2001. No appropriations were proposed or enacted for NIGC in FY2002. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and funds. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians took over the management of Indian trust funds from the BIA in 1996 due to severe mismanagement. In FY2001, the Office received $119.0 million in funding for federal trust programs and the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians received $110.0 million in FY2001 for federal trust programs, including an emergency appropriation of $27.5 million. The FY2002 budget proposed a decrease of 7.4% from FY2001 but an increase of 20.5% over the initial appropriation, with $99.2 million for federal trust programs and $10.98 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds and Individual Indian Money. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians received $110.0 million in FY2001 for federal trust programs, including an emergency appropriation of $27.5 million. The FY2002 budget proposed a decrease of 7.4% from FY2001 but an increase of 20.5% over the initial appropriation, with $99.2 million for federal trust programs and $10.98 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds with a value of about $2.6 billion and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts with a total asset value of about $480 million. An outside audit was conducted for tribal trust fund accounts, but not for IIM accounts, leading to a class-action suit filed in federal court for an accounting of the IIM funds. The class-action suit filed for an accounting of Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts found government mismanagement, leading to a court order for system improvements and quarterly reports. The Department of Justice lost an appeal in February 2001. The next trial phase involves determining the amount owed to plaintiffs through historical accounting. DOI was directed to develop a sampling methodology for IIM accounting in FY2001. The class-action suit for an accounting of Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts found government mismanagement, leading to a court order for system improvements and quarterly reports. The Department of Justice lost an appeal in February 2001. DOI was directed to develop a sampling methodology for IIM accounting in FY2001, but a cost-benefit analysis was required before implementation. Plaintiffs object to the historical accounting methodology and estimate they are owed at least $10 billion. OST submitted a Strategic Plan in April 1997 recommending a new agency for trust funds and assets management. In response to the Strategic Plan recommending a new agency for trust funds and assets management, Congress directed the OST to focus on trust funds system improvements and settlement of financial claims due to BIA mismanagement. The Secretary of the Interior agreed to implement aspects of the plan related to trust management systems and data cleanup, issuing a \"High-Level Implementation Plan\" in July 1998. In January 1999, a reorganization of the OST was ordered to address these issues. In 1999, the Secretary reorganized the OST, creating a principal deputy special trustee to oversee policy, budget execution, and day-to-day operations. The then-Special Trustee resigned in protest. Congress expressed concern about the reorganization and oversight of trust fund reform efforts. For more information, visit the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians website. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to territories, manages relations with islands and the federal government, and aims to build local government capacity. The OIA's budget for FY2002 is $351.2 million, with roughly 70% coming from permanent and indefinite appropriations totaling $249 million. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) budget for FY2002 is $351.2 million, with $145 million allocated to three freely associated states in the Pacific Islands. Additionally, $104 million is designated for the Virgin Islands and Guam for tax collections. The FY2002 appropriations law includes $102.2 million, a 6.3% increase from FY2001, with funding exceeding the requested amount for \"Technical Assistance.\" The FY2002 appropriations law provides funding for various purposes, including an increase in compact impact funding for Hawaii, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. It also includes funding for a utility privatization study in the U.S. Virgin Islands and payment to FEMA. Additionally, there are slight increases in funding for OIA, operation costs for the High Court of American Samoa, eradication of the brown tree snake, coral reef protection, and insular management controls. Congress continues to monitor economic development and financial management in the territories and the OIA. Congress continues to monitor economic development and financial management in the territories. The FY2002 Interior appropriations law allocates $4.13 billion for the U.S. Forest Service, which is $305 million less than FY2001 but more than the House and Senate allowances. The Bush Administration proposed reductions related to FY2001 appropriations above baseline programs. For more information on Insular Affairs, visit http://www.doi.gov/oia/index.html. For information on the Department of Agriculture, visit http://www.usda.gov/. The FY2002 Interior appropriations law allocated $4.13 billion for the U.S. Forest Service, with reductions in \"extra\" spending for FY2001. Funding increases were seen in Title VIII for deferred maintenance and urban and community forestry assistance. The law also included additional funding for the forest legacy program to prevent conversion to non-forest uses. The FY2002 Interior appropriations law allocated $65 million for economic action programs, $36 million for wildland fire management, and proposed a $5.6 billion National Emergency Reserve Fund for fire emergencies. The FY2002 appropriations law provides $1.56 billion for wildland fire management, exceeding the Administration's request and House and Senate levels. The law includes $346 million in emergency funding for fire suppression operations, rehabilitation, state fire assistance, and research. Land acquisition funding is also increased to $150 million. The FY2002 appropriations law allocated $150 million for land acquisition, exceeding the President's request and House and Senate allowances. Stewardship incentives received $3 million, below the House level of $8 million. Timber sales saw proposed increases in salvage and green sales compared to previous years. The FY2002 appropriations law allocated $150 million for land acquisition, exceeding the President's request and House and Senate allowances. Stewardship incentives received $3 million, below the House level of $8 million. Timber sales saw proposed increases in salvage and green sales compared to previous years. Additionally, the FY2002 law includes Senate language directing $5 million more than the normal allocation to the Alaska region for additional timber sale preparation. The summer of 2000 was a severe fire season, leading to the proposal of the National Fire Plan with a $1.6 billion increase for wildfire operations, fuel treatment, fire preparedness, and community assistance programs. The National Fire Plan proposed increased cooperation among federal agencies and with state, local, and tribal governments. Congress responded by increasing wildfire management funds and enacting Wildland Fire Emergency Appropriations. The total increase equaled the Clinton Administration's request, with provisions for reporting on \"urban wildland interface\" communities and projects. The Forest Service was directed to publish its Cohesive Strategy for Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems. The FY2002 law includes expedited NEPA review procedures and Endangered Species Act consultations for hazardous fuel reduction and burned area treatments. Land management planning on federal lands has been controversial, with bills introduced to improve planning but not enacted. Forest Service promulgated new planning regulations emphasizing ecosystem management and biological protection. The Bush Administration requested $70 million for land management planning in FY2002, with potential changes to regulations. The appropriations law allocated $70 million for planning, with provisions to prevent challenges based solely on missed deadlines. For more information on the U.S. Forest Service, visit http://www.fs.fed.us/. The U.S. Forest Service information can be found at http://www.fs.fed.us/. Resources on the Government Performance and Results Act can be accessed at http://www.usda.gov/ocfo/strat/index.htm. Various CRS reports on forest management topics are available, including below-cost timber sales, forest ecosystem health, forest fire protection, budget allocation formula, performance measures, and the National Forest System Roadless Areas Initiative. Additional information is provided on public lands and national forests. The Bush Administration's FY2002 budget request for fossil fuel research and development is $449 million, 17% less than FY2001. This includes funding for the Clean Coal Power Initiative at $150 million. The Budget Outline proposed $2 billion over 10 years for the CCPI, a cost-sharing industry/government program for advanced power technologies. The Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) has completed most of its projects and has faced funding reductions since the mid-1990s. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) would receive $150 million in funding, with reductions in other fossil R&D programs. No funding deferrals or rescissions are proposed for FY2002, unlike the previous year. The CCTP would receive $82 million from previously deferred budget authority to continue active projects. The FY2001 appropriations bill includes $150 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) to fund research and development of new technologies for coal-fired power generators. The House Appropriations Committee also allocated $130 million for other fossil fuel programs, totaling $579 million. This increase includes additional funding for Fuels and Power Systems, Natural Gas Technologies, and Petroleum - Oil Technology. The Senate Committee on Appropriations is in agreement with these numbers. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $570.4 million for fossil energy research and development, $8.6 million less than the House allocation but $124.1 million above the Administration's request. The full Senate supported this recommendation, resulting in a total of $616.5 million for fossil energy research and development in the FY2002 Interior Appropriations Act. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, authorized in 1975, consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas holding over 570 million barrels of crude oil. For more information on Fossil Energy, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) stores over 570 million barrels of crude oil in salt domes in Louisiana and Texas. It serves as an emergency source of oil in case of supply interruptions or adverse economic effects. The Clinton Administration authorized exchanges and swaps of oil from the SPR, as well as a program to accept 28 million barrels as royalty-in-kind payments. Additionally, the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) holds 2 million barrels of home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut and New Jersey. The 106th Congress approved $165 million for the SPR in FY2001. The 106th Congress approved $165 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY2001. The FY2002 budget request for the SPR was $169 million, with additional funding for leasing facilities and monitoring caverns. The House Committee on Appropriations added $10 million for de-gassing SPR oil, bringing the total to $179 million. An amendment to establish an ethanol and biodiesel reserve was withdrawn. The Senate agreed to the requested $169 million without the additional $10 million. The FY2002 budget request for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was $169 million, with an additional $10 million approved by the House for degasification of oil in storage. The conferees stipulated that funding for the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve should not exceed $8 million, with any savings applied to the degasification project. Funding for the project should be maintained at $12 million for the next three fiscal years to complete it by the end of FY2005. For more information on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, visit http://fossil.energy.gov/nposr/index.shtml. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the oil field at Elk Hills, CA. In FY1996, P.L. 104-106 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the Elk Hills oil field in CA to Occidental Petroleum Corporation for $3.65 billion. Most of two Naval Oil Shale Reserves were transferred to the Department of the Interior, with NOSR-2 returned to the Ute Indian Tribe in 2000. The U.S. retains a 9% royalty interest in NOSR-2 for remediation costs near Moab, Utah. Two small oil fields in California and Wyoming are projected to generate revenue of $7.8 million in FY2001 and $6.8 million in FY2002. The budget for the NPR program in FY2002 was projected to be $6.8 million, with Congress appropriating $1.6 million for FY2001. The remaining balance from the Elk Hills sale was proposed to be used in FY2002, along with a congressional appropriation of $17.3 million to fully fund the program. California's Teachers' Retirement Fund is set to receive 9% of the sale proceeds from Elk Hills, with payments spread out over several years. The budget request for $36 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund for FY2002 was approved by both the House and Senate, with payments to be made in FY2004 and FY2005. The Administration's energy efficiency programs are highlighted in the FY2002 budget request document, emphasizing benefits for economic growth, national security, and a cleaner environment through research and development of energy efficiency technologies. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://fossil.energy.gov/nposr/index.shtml. The Administration's FY2002 budget request for Energy Conservation programs at the Department of Energy proposes a decrease in funding to $755.8 million, with cuts in R&D programs and an increase in grant programs. The request includes a $120.3 million increase, with all of it allocated to the Weatherization Program, which would grow by 79% to $273.0 million. The House recommended $940.8 million for Energy Efficiency, with $629.8 million for R&D and $311.0 million for grants. The Senate approved $870.8 million, with $619.8 million for R&D and $251.0 million for grants. Compared to the request, the enacted level includes an increase of $157 million for R&D, $7 million more for State grants, and $57 million more for Weatherization grants. The FY2002 law provides an increase of $97.4 million, or 12%, excluding inflation adjustments. This includes a $13 million increase for R&D and an $84.4 million increase for grants. However, there are cuts in funding for Equipment, Aluminum, and Vehicle Technologies under different offices. For more information on the Energy Conservation Budget and Programs, visit the websites provided. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health care services to approximately 1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban Indian-operated programs and facilities. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, health stations, and residential treatment centers, while tribes and tribal groups also operate facilities through contracts with IHS. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, health stations, residential treatment centers, regional youth substance abuse treatment centers, and staff quarters. IHS funding is divided into Indian Health Services and Indian Health Facilities categories, covering various programs and services. Funding comes from federal appropriations and reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. The FY2002 Interior Appropriations Act estimates that IHS will collect $500 million in reimbursements, an increase of $95.4 million over FY2001. The total appropriation for IHS is $2.759 billion, with $2.390 billion allocated for health services and $369.5 million for health facilities. The population served by IHS has a higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than other U.S. populations. The IHS user population has a higher incidence of illness and premature mortality compared to other U.S. populations. In 1995, the rate of dying from alcoholism for Indians was 727% higher than the national average. The total health services budget for FY2002 was $2.390 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year. The FY2002 total health services budget is $2.390 billion, a 5% increase from FY2001. Funding distribution varies within the budget categories, with differences between the House and Senate recommendations. Clinical services receive $1.892 billion, while preventive health programs receive $99.7 million. Other health services receive $398.0 million, with variations in recommendations for allocation. Clinical services include primary care at IHS hospitals and clinics, with contracts for services outside the system when needed. The FY2002 law provides $460.8 million for contract health services, with additional funds recommended to be distributed based on needs and funding disparities. The House expressed concern about access to hospital care for the Hopi due to the closed Keams Canyon Hospital. The FY2002 law also reflects a $99.7 million appropriation for preventive health services. The President's request for a preventive health services appropriation of $99.7 million in FY2002 reflects a 4.4% increase over FY2001. The request includes funding for public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and a community health representatives program. The enacted amount for other health services in FY2002 is $398.0 million, slightly higher than the House amount, but below the requested amount. The Senate recommended $427.7 million for other health services. The other health services category in FY2002 includes funding for various programs such as contract support costs, direct operation costs, scholarships for health care professionals, support for urban health projects, tribal management grants, and administration of the Self-Governance Demonstration Project. The Senate specifically increased funding for urban health projects by $1 million to support a dental program run by First Nations Community Health Sources. The FY2001 appropriation includes funding for a dental program run by First Nations Community Health Sources in cooperation with the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute. The Senate also allocated funds for mental health professions programs at the Universities of Montana and North Dakota, as well as for the InMed program at the University of North Dakota. Direct contract support costs cover expenses tribes incur for various purposes, but funding has been insufficient, leading to criticism of IHS's distribution of funds among tribes. Congress has made efforts to address these issues in the past. For FY2002, Congress allocated $268 million for contract support costs and self-governance, an 8% increase from FY2001. The House was concerned about the disparity in funding between the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Indian Health Service (IHS), with IHS paying $55 million in direct contract support costs while BIA paid nothing. This led to the House inserting language to prevent IHS from funding new or expanded contracts, which was later removed by the conference committee. The conference committee removed the bill language regarding funding for new or expanded contracts. The FY2002 appropriations law allocated $369.5 million for IHS health care facilities, an increase of $6.4 million from FY2001. The House recommended $369.8 million while the Senate recommended $363 million. The House favored increased support for facilities needing replacement or improvements, specifically mentioning hospitals in Winnebago, NE, and Fort Defiance, AZ, as well as clinics in Pinon, AZ, Pawnee, OK, and Sisseton. The House and Senate recommended funding for various IHS health care facilities and programs, with differences in distribution. The conference committee agreed on funding for staff quarters, dental units, ambulatory care facilities, and clinic infrastructure improvements. The House emphasized addressing annual caseload fluctuations and maintaining funding parity among IHS areas and tribes. The House and Senate recommended funding for various IHS health care facilities and programs, with differences in distribution. The conference committee agreed on funding for staff quarters, dental units, ambulatory care facilities, and clinic infrastructure improvements. The House emphasized addressing annual caseload fluctuations and maintaining funding parity among IHS areas and tribes. Additionally, the House supported innovative approaches for funding construction and repairs to facilities, while the Senate encouraged funding for a new drinking water system for the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301 due to a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land. Most relocatees are Navajo, with about 300 families yet to complete relocation. For more information on the GAO report on Contract Support Costs, visit http://www.gao.gov/. The Appropriations Committee estimates that around 300 families, mostly Navajo, still need to complete relocation, including about 33 Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. ONHIR received $15.0 million for FY2001 and $15.1 million was proposed for FY2002. Negotiations and litigation have been ongoing between the tribes, Navajo families on Hopi land, and the federal government, particularly regarding Hopi Tribe claims. In 1995, a proposed settlement agreement was reached between the United States and the Hopi Tribe. The settlement agreement between the Hopi Tribe and Navajo families provided for 75-year leases on Hopi partitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved the agreement. Despite some opposition, most Navajo families signed accommodation agreements by September 1999. The Hopi Tribe enforced relocation against Navajo families without leases. The FY2002 law prohibits ONHIR from evicting Navajo families from Hopi partitioned lands without providing a replacement home. The settlement agreement allows the Hopi Tribe to take quiet-possession actions if Navajo families have not relocated or entered into leases by a certain date. Congress has been concerned about the slow pace of relocation and the low interest in moving to new lands acquired for Navajo relocation. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum, education, and research complex with 16 museums and galleries, the National Zoo, and research facilities. Congress debates federal support for arts and culture and the appropriate federal role in funding. The Smithsonian Institution is located on the Mall in Washington D.C. and had 33.5 million visitors in FY2000. It is 70% federally funded and also receives private contributions for designated projects. In FY1999, private contributions for designated projects at the Smithsonian totaled $123.6 million. The largest single donation of $60 million was pledged by Steven F. Udvar-Hazy for the NASM's Dulles Center. The Lemelson Foundation increased its commitment to $40 million in FY2001. The FY2002 budget estimate for the Smithsonian was $494.1 million, an increase of $40.2 million from FY2001. $30 million was requested for the National Museum of the American Indian in FY2002 for museum construction. Private donations totaling $36.7 million, including $15 million from the Indian community, were raised for the National Museum of the American Indian. The Smithsonian identified a funding shortfall of $76 million for the $186 million project and planned to request an additional $10 million in FY 2003. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in September 1999, with the museum projected to open by the end of 2003. The Smithsonian's buildings and the National Zoo make up one-third of the SI's public space, with various historical buildings in need of repair. The Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian recommended $50 million annually for a decade to restore facilities. Additionally, the National Zoo requires $10 million per year for the next 5 years. The FY2002 budget request included renovation plans for several key buildings. The Smithsonian is undergoing routine repair in its facilities, including the National Museum of Natural History and the Patent Office Building. Controversies arose over the proposed closing of the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education and the Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal, Virginia, which support endangered species conservation and research. The Smithsonian faced controversy over plans to close the Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal, Virginia due to funding issues. Biologists argued that the center's work relied on its natural habitat. However, after scientists objected, the Smithsonian reversed its decision and decided to maintain the facility. The Smithsonian reversed its decision to close the Conservation and Research Center in response to scientists' objections. Both the House and Senate proposed funding for the Smithsonian Institution in FY2002, with the Senate bill reflecting an increase in funding for Administration and restoration of funding for the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education. The Smithsonian reversed its decision to close the Conservation and Research Center in response to scientists' objections. The House and Senate recommended establishing a Science Commission, with the Senate specifying that the CRC and SCMRE should remain open until reviewed by an independent Science Commission. The FY2002 law concurred with the establishment of a Science Commission and allocated $497.2 million to the Smithsonian, an increase of $43.3 million from FY2001.

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and Institute of Museum Services (IMS, now IMLS) operate under temporary authority since 1993. Congress debates federal funding for arts, humanities, and museums, with some arguing against government support. Proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the government has a long tradition of funding culture, dating back to 1817. Some in the private sector believe they cannot fill the gap left by the loss of federal funds. The President's Committee on the Arts recommended restoring funding for NEA, NEH, and IMLS to fulfill their national roles. The NEA's direct grant program currently supports approximately 1,600 grants, with state arts agencies receiving over 40% of grant funds. The Challenge America Arts Fund, a program of matching grants for arts education and community arts activities in rural areas, is administered by NEA. NEH provides grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs. Detailed reports on the use of funds for the Challenge America Arts Fund are required to be submitted to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. NEH provides grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs, including support for regional humanities centers and state humanities councils. The Office of Museum Services (OMS) under IMLS offers leadership grants, museum conservation, and General Operating Support (GOS) to improve museum services to the public. OMS is also working on Museums Online to bring the educational and cultural significance of museums to communities and schools. The Office of Museum Services (OMS) supports Museum/school partnerships, reaching over 20 million people through over 200 schools, 80 museums, and 80,000 students. OMS provides awards for integrating museum experiences, particularly for at-risk youth. Previous NEA controversies include questionable grants, but no projects have been deemed obscene by courts. A federal appeals court ruled that applying \"general standards of decency\" to NEA grants was unconstitutional. NEA eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline, except for Literature fellowships, Jazz masters, and National Endowment for the Arts. The Supreme Court reversed a federal appeals court decision for NEA v. Finley, stating that the NEA can consider general standards of decency when judging grants for artistic merit. Congress enacted NEA reform measures, including increases in funding allocations to states and grants for underserved populations. A 15% cap was placed on NEA funds allocated to each state, exempting only grants with a national impact. Three Members of the House and three Members of the Senate were added to the National Endowment for the Arts. The National Council on the Arts was reduced in size from 26 to 20 members. The NEA and NEH were given authority to solicit and invest funds. The House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee allocated $105.2 million for NEA, $24.9 million for OMS, and $120.5 million for NEH. An amendment to increase funding for all three agencies was rejected. The House passed an amendment adding $10 million to the Challenge America Arts fund administered by NEA, $3 million for NEH, and $2 million for OMS/IMLS. Another amendment to reduce funding for the Challenge America Arts fund and NEA by $10 million was rejected. The House-passed appropriation would provide NEA with a total of $115.2 million, NEH with $123.5 million, and OMS/IMLS with funding. The FY2002 appropriations law provides funding for the arts and humanities, with $115.2 million for NEA, $124.5 million for NEH, and $26.9 million for OMS/IMLS. Funding levels are in line with Senate and House totals, with slight variations. Further information can be found on the respective websites for NEA, NEH, and OMS/IMLS. The Institute of Museum Services provides funding for land acquisition activities for various agencies like the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and Forest Service through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually, but actual appropriations have been lower, varying from year to year. Since its establishment in 1964, LWCF appropriations have fluctuated among agencies. Congress has allocated $11.8 billion cumulatively, with $12.7 billion remaining unappropriated. Recent years saw an increase in funds for federal land acquisition, reaching $444.17 million in FY2001 before dropping to $429 million in FY2002. The House Appropriations Committee reported BLM's federal land acquisition figure for FY2001 as $47.3 million. The BLM figure for federal land acquisition in FY2001 was $47.3 million, excluding $8.8 million from the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act. NPS amounts did not include the state grant program, which was funded at $41 million in FY2000 and $90 million in FY2001. The Administration proposed funding at $450 million for FY2002, with the House providing $154 million, the Senate $164 million, and the FY2002 Interior Appropriations Act containing $144 million. Appropriations have been increasing due to various factors, including efforts to address the federal budget deficit in the 1990s and Congress responding positively to requests for more funds for resource protection activities. The Clinton Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative requested increased funding for resource protection activities, including federal land acquisition. Legislation known as CARA (Conservation and Reinvestment Act) aimed to fully fund the LWCF for 15 years, with different versions addressing funding mechanisms. H.R. 701 passed the House in the 106th Congress and was marked up in the 107th Congress. The 106th Congress did not enact CARA but provided increased funding for land acquisition through the Lands Legacy Initiative in FY2000 and FY2001. Funding for conservation programs was allocated in a separate category starting in FY2001, with $1.32 billion allocated in FY2002. Congress also appropriated funds from the LWCF for purposes beyond land acquisition in recent years. In recent years, Congress allocated funds from the LWCF for purposes other than land acquisition. This included funding for various programs such as the Elwha River ecosystem restoration and addressing maintenance backlogs. These additional uses of the Fund indicate a shift towards funding levels for the LWCF that are less focused on land acquisition. The Bush Administration proposed full funding of the LWCF at $900 million in FY2002, with $450 million each for federal agencies and state grants. $390 million would be allocated for federal land acquisition, with $60 million earmarked for FWS's incentive grant program. The Bush Administration proposed full funding of the LWCF at $900 million in FY2002, with $450 million each for federal agencies and state grants. $390 million would be allocated for federal land acquisition, with $60 million earmarked for FWS's incentive grant program. The current proposal includes providing technical and financial assistance to landowners for habitat protection and stewardship grants for voluntary conservation efforts. The administration suggests a new distribution formula for grants to states based on land area and population percentages. The proposed allocations for LWCF funding among states varied, with California receiving over $29 million and 4 states receiving $4.5 million each. The House and Senate bills allocated less than the President's $900 million request, with the House supporting $390 million for federal land acquisition and the Senate increasing it to $406 million, mainly for the National Park Service. Both chambers reduced the \"stateside\" grants request, with the House allocating $319 million for \"state and other grants.\" The Senate concurred with the proposed allocations for LWCF funding, providing additional funding for stateside grants and excluding grants for Indian tribes. They also included detailed instructions on how state wildlife grants are distributed and expressed the intent to allocate a significant portion of federal revenues from offshore oil and gas to states supporting those activities. The FY2002 appropriations law allocates $708 million for the LWCF, funded by offshore oil and gas revenues. This includes $429 million for federal land acquisition, more than the President's request, and $279 million for state and other grants, less than the President's request. The law retains the Senate's distribution formula for state wildlife grants and drops language regarding coastal impact assistance. (For more details, see Table 12 in the report).
