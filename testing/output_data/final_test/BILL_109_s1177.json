    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Mental Health Care Capacity Enhancement Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to veterans' mental health care. Congress finds that mental health treatment capacity at community-based outpatient clinics for veterans remains inadequate and inconsistent, despite requirements for the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop plans to meet these needs. A survey in 2001 found no established baseline for mental health services at these clinics. The Government Accountability Office reported in February 2005 that the Department of Veterans Affairs had not fully implemented the clinical care and education recommendations for post-traumatic stress disorder made in 2004. Congress had not received a final report on the Comprehensive Mental Health Strategic Plan submitted to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, which identified service and funding gaps within the VA health care system. SEC. 3. REQUIRED CAPACITY FOR COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT CLINICS. The text chunk discusses the strengthening of performance measures for mental health programs, including establishing staff-patient ratios, fostering collaborative environments, and encouraging mental health consultations during primary care visits. Additionally, it mentions inflationary indexing of capacity requirements. The Secretary must adjust funding levels for specialized treatment and rehabilitative services for disabled veterans for inflation each fiscal year. Additionally, the Secretary is required to ensure that at least 90 percent of community-based outpatient clinics have the capacity to provide onsite, contract-referral, or tele-mental health services for a certain percentage of clinic visits by specific dates. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must ensure that primary care health care facilities provide inpatient detox services and assign case managers for outpatient services within 2 years of enactment. A report on mental health services at community-based outpatient clinics must be submitted to Congress by January 31, 2008. The report on mental health services at community-based outpatient clinics must describe available services, staff-to-patient ratios, and be certified by the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs. SEC. 4. COOPERATION ON MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND PREVENTION. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a Memorandum of Understanding to provide mental health and sexual trauma assessments for separating servicemembers. They will also create a joint workgroup on mental health within 180 days, comprised of leaders in the field appointed from each department. The workgroup established by the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will analyze initiatives related to combating stigmas, improving mental health treatment availability, and providing family education for veterans and servicemembers. The workgroup established by the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2007, containing findings and recommendations on recognizing signs of mental health issues in veterans and seamless transition of servicemembers with mental health disorders to veteran status. The Under Secretary for Health, Veterans Health Administration will establish guidelines for screening primary care patients for mental health disorders and provide training for clinicians to conduct mental health consultations."
