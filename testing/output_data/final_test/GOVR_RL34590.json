Congress has so far refused to give DOD the authority to raise the fees, despite the Defense budget for health care growing from $19 billion in FY2001 to over $42 billion in FY2008. The proposed DOD budget for FY2009 would gradually raise enrollment fees for Tricare Prime users, with rates as high as $1,750 for retirees making over $40,000 annually. DOD also suggested a $120 per year enrollment fee for Tricare Standard users and recommended increases in pharmacy co-payments. The Tricare for Life program for Medicare-eligible retirees would not be affected by the proposed fee increases. The DOD proposed increasing pharmacy co-payments and eliminating co-payments for pharmaceuticals from the DOD Mail Order Pharmacy to save $1.2 billion in FY2009. However, opposition from beneficiary organizations and the Government Accountability Office's findings of overestimated cost savings led Congress to deny DOD authority to increase Tricare fees in FY2007 and FY2008. Congress encouraged DOD to explore other ways to control healthcare budget growth. TRICARE Cost-Sharing Proposals aim to offset rising healthcare spending, but projected savings may be overestimated. The Tricare Reserve Select program, established by the FY2005 Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act, allows drilling reserve personnel to utilize Tricare with enrollment fees similar to those of Federal civil servants. The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act extended this benefit to all drilling reservists. In December 2007, the Government Accountability Office found that DOD's premiums for Tricare had exceeded the actual costs of providing the benefit. Tricare Reserve Select (TRS) provides health care benefits to reservists in drilling status with monthly premiums of $81/self or $253/self+family. Enrollment has been lower than estimated, possibly due to high premiums. A GAO report in December 2007 found that DOD's premiums exceeded the actual costs of providing care through TRS. GAO recommended basing premiums on actual costs, which DOD supports. The FY2008 NDAA supported increasing the Army and Marine Corps end strength. The Navy remains stable while the Air Force continues manpower reductions. Army and Marine Corps growth is in response to continuing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army and Marine Corps successfully grew their end strength from FY2005 to FY2009 to meet congressional goals. The Army plans to reach 547,400 personnel by 2010, two years ahead of schedule. The Secretary of Defense recommended the Air Force maintain a minimum of 330,000 personnel. The House authorized additional Navy and Air Force personnel for military medical positions, while the Senate committee authorized more Air Force personnel for B-52 aircraft maintenance. The ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with end strength increases and recruiting challenges, continue to highlight the military pay issue. Title 37 U.S.C. 1009 provides a formula for annual military pay raises indexed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The FY2009 President's Budget requested a 3.4 percent military pay raise, consistent with the formula. Congress has approved raises above the formula in previous years, and targeted pay raises have also been authorized. The proposed legislation for military pay this year does not mention targeted pay raises. Chapter 15 of Title 10, also known as the Insurrection Act, grants the President authority to use the armed forces in response to domestic disorders. Amendments in Section 591 of H.R. 5658 would clarify the President's authority in these situations. H.R. 5658 clarifies the President's authority to use the armed forces, including activating federal reserve components, in response to domestic disorders. This includes activating members of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. The legislation also allows for the activation of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. Presidential Reserve Call-up under Title 10 permits the activation of certain reservists for up to 365 days for specified purposes. Section 594 of H.R. 5658 clarifies the President's authority to use the armed forces, including activating federal reserve components, in response to domestic disorders. It allows the President to use Presidential Reserve Call-up authority to activate Selected Reserve units to respond to disasters or emergencies defined by the Stafford Act. This provision is similar to one in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 but applies only to federal reserves, not the National Guard. The President's authority to use the armed forces, including activating federal reserve components, in response to domestic disorders was clarified by Section 594 of H.R. 5658. This provision applied to the National Guard as well as federal reserves and was later repealed by section 1068 of P.L. 110-181. Congress authorized $30 million for assistance to local agencies impacted by DOD military and civilian employee dependents, and $10 million for agencies affected by base closures or force relocations. The language in S. 3001 was similar to previous efforts regarding impact aid. Military spouses face challenges in finding employment due to frequent relocations. Local employers prefer a stable workforce with less turnover. Implementing policies to support spouses' careers after relocation may help address this issue. Each service offers educational programs for members to attend civilian institutions without interrupting their service. The military is considering programs like \"Career Intermission\" and \"Career Flexibility\" to allow personnel to take extended breaks for personal or professional reasons. These programs aim to enhance retention by offering opportunities for pursuing other goals. The House and Senate programs would be limited to 40 service members per year for each armed force, with a service obligation of two months for every month of participation. The military is considering programs like \"Career Intermission\" and \"Career Flexibility\" to allow personnel to take extended breaks for personal or professional reasons, aiming to enhance retention. Section 619 of the House and Senate bills seeks to improve language skills of new officer accessions by providing financial incentives for studying foreign languages and cultures before active service. There is statutory authority for bonuses for those proficient in designated foreign languages, but not for those seeking proficiency. The final version of S. 3001 combines provisions for compensating individuals seeking foreign language proficiency or cultural skills, offering three options for incentives. Individuals cannot receive multiple bonuses or incentives simultaneously for the same period of service and skill. The Senate report suggests expanding travel and transportation allowances for family members of service members with serious psychiatric conditions. This aligns with Section 586 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The proposed change in H.R. 5658 aims to allow military members with minor children and a spouse already deployed in an imminent danger pay area to request a deferment of deployment to that area until the spouse returns, regardless of unforeseen circumstances. The Department of Defense defines sole survivors as the only remaining son or daughter in a family where a parent or sibling was killed, captured, or disabled while serving in the Armed Forces. Sole survivors can enlist if they waive their right to separation but can request a protective assignment to avoid deployment to hostile areas. Enlisted sole survivors can apply for separation, which is considered a voluntary discharge. Section 651 of the Senate bill would authorize benefits for sole surviving sons and daughters who elect to separate before completing their initial enlistment. National Guard and Reserve personnel qualifying for disability retirement have their pay calculated based on years of service or disability rating. Reserve component personnel have their years of service calculated based on participation points, resulting in fewer equivalent years of active-duty service. Proposed changes in Section 641 of H.R. 5658 would modify the calculation method for reservists eligible for disability retirement or placed on TDRL due to combat-related injuries. The provision in Section 641 of H.R. 5658 would award a year of service for each year a reservist met the minimum participation standard of 50 points, benefiting combat-injured reservists with modest disability ratings and many years of reserve service. This change aims to address recent incidents of fraudulent claims of military decorations. The committee believes that false claims of military decorations reduce their prestige and proposes a searchable database to verify awards. This initiative aims to discourage fraudulent claims and preserve the valor of decorations. The battle on Koh Tang Island resulted in the failure of a rescue operation, with four U.S. helicopters shot down, 41 Marines killed, and 39 sailors captured by the Khmer Rouge. The language in H.R. 5658 authorizes the Vietnam Service Medal for participants in the Mayaguez rescue, but the benefits of this recognition are unclear. Chapter 80 of Title 10 U.S. code addresses various provisions, including complaints of sexual harassment and domestic violence data. The curr_chunk discusses provisions for maintaining protective orders in cases of domestic violence and sexual assault incidents in the Armed Forces. It highlights the importance of centralized reporting and reforms in the military justice system. The curr_chunk discusses proposed changes in the Armed Forces regarding paternity leave and burial flag presentation for fallen service members. The new paternity leave would be in addition to regular leave and apply to children born after the enactment date. The final version of the bill allows for a burial flag to be presented to the surviving spouse and each surviving child of the service member. The House and Senate-passed bills proposed authorizing the provision of a burial flag to a surviving spouse and surviving children. Current DOD policy requires a minimum of four months following the birth of a child before a military mother can be assigned to a dependent-restricted or unaccompanied tour. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides annuities to the surviving spouse, children, former spouse, or spouse/former spouse and children. SBP annuities cease if a spouse or former spouse remarries before age 55. Children remain eligible until age 18 or 22 if a full-time student. SBP is offset or reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis if the spouse is eligible for Veterans Affairs Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). A surviving spouse of a service member killed in the line of duty is eligible to receive both SBP. The Army and Air Force provide a minimum of four months, while the Marine Corps defers for six months and the Navy for up to one year before deployment after childbirth. A surviving spouse of a service member killed in the line of duty can receive both SBP and DIC. Congress allows survivors to designate their children as SBP beneficiaries to avoid the offset. This House language would restore SBP eligibility to a surviving spouse or former spouse after the termination of remarriage. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) can be reduced by Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 created a survivor indemnity allowance for survivors of service members entitled to retired pay. This allowance started at $50 per month in October 2008 and increased annually by $10 through FY2013, providing additional benefits to offset-affected survivors of active duty service members. The National Defense Act for Fiscal Year 1997 established a board to review sexually explicit materials on military installations. In 2006, the board reversed its decision on Playgirl and Penthouse, leading to protests from a Christian group. The House language aims to re-establish the review board with modified composition. The National Defense Act for Fiscal Year 1997 established a review board to regulate sexually explicit materials on military installations. The board's composition was modified in response to efforts to ban certain items for rental or resale. JROTC is a federal program in high schools sponsored by the Armed Forces to promote citizenship, service, and personal responsibility. There are approximately 3,300 JROTC units operating in high schools and overseas. The JROTC program in high schools is criticized as a military recruiting tool or for militarizing schools.
