    "content": "The Act titled \"Natural Disaster Housing Reform Act of 2006\" designates HUD as the lead agency for long-term housing needs in disaster cases. The Natural Disaster Housing Reform Act of 2006 designates HUD as the primary federal agency responsible for coordinating and administering housing assistance in major disasters, consulting with other relevant federal agencies, and utilizing regional and local offices for assistance. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will utilize regional and local offices to coordinate housing assistance in disasters. They will ensure that staff have the necessary resources and training. Housing assistance includes aid for displaced individuals and families. The term \"housing needs\" refers to assistance provided to individuals or households displaced from their primary residences due to a major disaster. This includes financial aid, temporary housing, repair and construction assistance, and other forms of housing support. Amendments are made to determine long-term housing needs under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Amendments to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act allow the Governor of a State to request the President to determine long-term housing needs in areas affected by a major disaster. The President will decide whether to grant the request. The President shall grant a request to determine long-term housing needs in areas affected by a major disaster if displacement or uninhabitable conditions last for 30 days or more. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act regarding HUD administration. The Natural Disaster Housing Reform Act of 2006 requires the President to provide housing assistance in areas with long-term housing needs after a major disaster. This does not affect the authority of the Director of FEMA for overall coordination of disaster relief. SEC. 3. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS. Section 408 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to consider cost effectiveness of manufactured modular housing compared to other dwellings for individuals or households. The President must obtain consent from individuals or households before providing manufactured modular housing assistance. If consent is not given, they can still receive other assistance. Individuals or households can contribute additional funds for larger or higher-quality housing. In subsection (c), adjustments are made to security deposits and utility fees for accommodation. Additionally, repairs for safe and sanitary housing are emphasized. In subsection (c), adjustments are made to security deposits and utility fees for accommodation. The repair of existing rental units to provide safe and sanitary housing for individuals or households is highlighted. Adjustments are made to security deposits and utility fees for accommodation, including inserting \"or semi-permanent\" after \"Permanent\" and making changes to insular areas. In subsection (d)(1), sites located in a floodplain are exempt from certain regulations for housing provided in connection with Hurricane Katrina of 2005. Manufactured modular housing provided in connection with disasters may be located in areas with special flood hazards. The housing should be placed on separate parcels of land and not on sites managed by the Director containing 3 or more other units. The Director, in consultation with the Governor and local government heads, will develop mass evacuation plans for individuals in disaster assistance for an 18-month period."
