    "content": "In 2011, almost $1.8 billion worth of consumer products entered the US daily from 800,000 importers at 327 ports, with over 80% of recalls being of imported products, many from China. The CPSC and CBP stopped millions of units of unsafe imported products in FY2012. Congress passed the CPSIA in 2008 in response to lead-contaminated toy recalls. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 introduced new testing and certification requirements for consumer products. The CPSC oversees the safety of imported products in collaboration with CBP and can restrict the export of certain products. Additionally, the CPSC enforces product safety rules, bans, and standards, relying on voluntary standards when appropriate. The CPSC enforces product safety rules, bans, and standards, sometimes promulgating its own regulations or Congress enacts a standard. The United States has international obligations regarding technical regulations, including those related to consumer product safety. The CPSC, established in 1972 by the Consumer Product Safety Act, is responsible for enforcing federal consumer product safety laws. They have jurisdiction over products sold to consumers for household, school, or recreational use. The CPSC enforces federal consumer product safety laws for products used in households, schools, or recreation. They lack jurisdiction over certain products like tobacco, motor vehicles, pesticides, firearms, aircraft, drugs, and more. They also cannot regulate risks that can be addressed by other acts like the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The CPSC evaluates the safety of consumer products for import into the U.S. and works with CBP to identify shipments violating import provisions. The CPSA prohibits certain importation acts and imposes penalties. Importers of products manufactured outside the U.S. are subject to these regulations. Importers of finished products manufactured outside the U.S. must certify compliance with CPSC regulations. They share responsibilities with manufacturers, including reporting safety issues. The CPSC maintains a surveillance program for imported products and develops risk assessment methods to identify violations. The CPSC and CBP cooperate to evaluate safety risks of consumer products entering the US. They signed memorandums in 2010 to share information and use shipment data for safety evaluations. The CPSC collaborates with CBP to assess consumer product safety risks entering the US. They have agreements with foreign agencies to enhance compatibility of safety laws and share information on unsafe products. The CPSA prohibits importing products that violate safety rules, have undergone corrective actions, or are subject to recalls or court orders. The CPSA imposes civil and criminal penalties for prohibited acts involving the importation of consumer products, including fines up to $100,000 per violation and up to $15 million for related violations. Criminal penalties may include up to five years' imprisonment. The CPSC may refuse to admit a consumer product into the US if it fails to comply with safety regulations. The CPSC can refuse admission of consumer products into the US for various reasons, such as non-compliance with safety rules, false certificates, hazardous defects, or violations of inspection requirements. CPSC informs CBP to refuse admission and may request samples for testing. The CPSC can refuse admission of consumer products into the US for reasons like safety rule violations or hazardous defects. CBP must deliver samples for examination, and products may be modified under bond for admission. The CPSA allows for a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act for importation decisions. Refused products can be destroyed unless permission is granted to export them. The CPSC enforces statutes related to importation of products within its jurisdiction. For example, under FHSA Section 14, CBP can provide samples of hazardous substances to CPSC for inspection. The CPSC can refuse admission of misbranded or banned hazardous substances. Imported products subject to flammability standards must comply with the Tariff Act of 1930 before release from customs custody. The Tariff Act of 1930 requires products imported into the United States to be inspected by CBP for compliance with U.S. laws. The CPSA mandates importers to certify that products comply with all CPSC regulations, including safety rules for children's products. Compliance certifications must be based on product testing or a testing program. The Consumer Product Safety Act mandates importers to certify compliance with safety rules by testing products through accredited third-party bodies. Certificates must accompany shipments and be provided to distributors. CPSC may allow electronic filing of certificates before imported products arrive. Proposed regulation requires importers to electronically file certificates with CBP for products manufactured outside the US. The proposed rule would require importers to electronically file certificates with CBP at the time of entry or entry summary filing. Importers of record, as defined by the Tariff Act, may include licensed customs brokers. This includes common carriers, contract carriers, third-party logistics providers, and freight forwarders. The CPSA exempts consumer products intended for export from the United States, but applies if they are distributed for use in the US or pose a risk. Exporters must notify CPSC before exporting products that violate safety rules. The CPSC can prohibit exporting products from the US. The CPSC may prohibit exporting consumer products from the US if they violate safety rules, unless the importing country accepts them. The amendment aims to stop the export of products breaking US laws. The CPSIA and FFA have similar provisions. The CPSC regulates the export of products that are subject to recall orders, court orders, or are banned hazardous substances. The FHSA prohibits the export of misbranded or banned hazardous substances without notifying the CPSC. Other statutes enforced by the CPSC also have provisions for exporting consumer products. The CPSC regulates the export of products subject to recall orders, court orders, or banned hazardous substances. The FHSA prohibits exporting misbranded or banned hazardous substances without notifying the CPSC. International trade agreements classify measures regulating product characteristics as technical regulations or barriers to trade. US obligations include promulgating standards-related measures like product safety regulations. The World Trade Organization (WTO) enforces trade rules for its members, including the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) to prevent obstacles to international trade. In the US, the CPSC ensures compliance with mandatory consumer product safety laws. The CPSC is the federal authority responsible for consumer product regulations. It relies on voluntary standards but can also enact its own regulations. The TBT Agreement applies to standards set by government bodies like the CPSC, ensuring compliance. WTO Members can challenge US standards that do not align with TBT obligations. The TBT Agreement requires WTO Members to ensure that their technical regulations do not discriminate against imported products. Disputes regarding compliance with the agreement are settled following the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The TBT Agreement mandates that technical regulations must not hinder international trade and should only be as trade-restrictive as necessary for legitimate objectives like protecting human health or safety. Members must regularly review regulations to ensure they are still needed and are the least trade-restrictive option. Using international standards as a basis for regulations is encouraged unless they do not effectively serve the Member's legitimate objectives. The TBT Agreement requires technical regulations to align with legitimate objectives and not unnecessarily restrict trade. Members should base regulations on product performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics when possible. The agreement promotes transparency in the promulgation of mandatory technical regulations by central government bodies. If a technical regulation proposed by the CPSC may impact trade significantly without following relevant international standards, the United States must notify and allow comments from other Members. WTO Members must share adopted technical regulations with interested parties. U.S. FTAs impose additional obligations on the United States regarding standards-related measures. Chapter Seven of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement focuses on \"Technical Barriers to Trade,\" covering standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures that impact trade in goods between the Parties. The chapter does not include technical specifications for government production or sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The United States has additional obligations in transparency, allowing participation from the other party in the development of standards and regulations. The TBT Agreement requires parties to allow participation from the other party in developing standards and regulations, with obligations for transparency and public input on proposed technical regulations. Proposed free trade agreements may also include provisions on standards-related measures. Negotiators of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement are including annexes on sector-specific TBT commitments to harmonize regulations. International trade obligations of the United States regarding standards-related measures have been implemented in domestic laws, such as the Trade Agreements Act (TAA) of 1979, which prohibits federal agencies from creating unnecessary obstacles to foreign commerce. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) of 1979 prohibits federal agencies from creating unnecessary obstacles to foreign commerce by ensuring equal treatment of imported products in standards-related measures. The act also requires consideration of international standards and consultation with relevant agencies during trade negotiations. Additionally, rulemaking provisions in other acts enforced by the CPSC may also implement standards-related trade obligations of the United States. H.R. 1910, the Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act of 2013, aims to hold foreign manufacturers accountable for harms caused by their products in the United States by requiring them to establish a registered agent in the country authorized to accept legal process on their behalf. The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act of 2013 requires foreign manufacturers to appoint a registered agent in the U.S. to accept legal process for regulatory proceedings or civil actions related to their products. Importers must declare compliance with registration requirements for products under CPSC jurisdiction. If H.R. 1910 is enacted, it may have implications for the United States under WTO rules, specifically regarding the national treatment requirement for internal regulation. Manufacturers of imported products could be subject to registration requirements, potentially leading to discrimination against these products. The panel would consider whether the registration requirement in H.R. 1910 for foreign manufacturers affects the internal sale, purchase, or distribution of imported products, potentially leading to less favorable treatment compared to domestic products under WTO rules. The registration requirement in H.R. 1910 for foreign manufacturers may lead to higher prices for imported products on the U.S. market, potentially making them less competitive with domestically manufactured products, which could result in less favorable treatment for imported products compared to domestic ones under WTO rules. The registration requirement in H.R. 1910 may impact the competitiveness of imported products in the U.S. market, potentially leading to less favorable treatment compared to domestic products under WTO rules. If adopted, H.R. 1910 could potentially violate the national treatment obligation in the GATT, subjecting foreign manufacturers to legal liability similar to domestic manufacturers. The registration requirement in H.R. 1910 could potentially violate GATT rules, but exceptions under Article XX(b) and (d) may justify it. Article XX(b) allows measures to protect human health, while Article XX(d) allows measures to secure compliance with non-GATT laws. The requirement aims to protect consumers from unsafe products and ensure foreign manufacturers comply with U.S. safety regulations. The Article XX exceptions in GATT require a showing of necessity for measures to secure compliance with U.S. consumer product safety laws. If a less trade restrictive alternative is available, the measure may be rejected. The measure must also satisfy the Article XX chapeau to avoid being a disguised restriction on international trade. If H.R. 1910 becomes law and is challenged by a WTO Member for violating GATT obligations, a WTO panel could find it inconsistent with GATT articles. Failure to comply could result in retaliatory measures such as suspending tariff concessions. CPSC prioritizes enforcing consumer product safety laws at the border. In 2008, Congress passed the CPSIA to modify CPSC's role in import/export of consumer products. H.R. 1910, introduced in 2013, aims to hold foreign manufacturers accountable for harm caused by their products in the US. If H.R. 1910 becomes law, foreign manufacturers of consumer products distributed in the US may need to establish a registered agent and face product liability lawsuits, potentially impacting their competitiveness due to higher prices. However, it could also be seen as leveling the playing field for domestic products. The US could justify this requirement under GATT exceptions if challenged. Under GATT exceptions at Article XX(b) and (d), a complaining Member may need to suggest alternative measures for the defending Member. If a measure is justified under these exceptions, it must also meet the Article XX chapeau requirements."
