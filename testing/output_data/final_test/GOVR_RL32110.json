    "content": "On December 30, 2005, the U.S. Trade Representative announced the implementation of the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) on a rolling basis as countries meet their commitments. President Bush issued proclamations for El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. The Dominican Republic and Costa Rica are expected to follow suit in the near future. The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a report on converting sugarcane into ethanol, finding it profitable currently but not projected to be in mid-2007. This study was part of a commitment made during the DR-CAFTA debate to explore alternatives for sugar imports. U.S. agricultural exports to DR-CAFTA countries totaled $1.7 billion in 2004, representing almost 3% of U.S. worldwide sales. In 2004, U.S. agricultural exports to DR-CAFTA countries totaled $1.7 billion, accounting for almost 3% of U.S. worldwide sales. The top exports were corn, wheat, rice, soybean meal, and tobacco. The Dominican Republic and Guatemala were the largest markets, with $462 million and $383 million in sales respectively. U.S. farm exports to these countries have increased by 56% since 1995. Agricultural imports from these countries amounted to nearly $2.5 billion, making them the fourth-largest source of U.S. agricultural imports in 2004. Top imports included bananas, raw coffee, fresh fruit, raw cane sugar, and fresh and frozen vegetables. In 2004, U.S. agricultural imports from DR-CAFTA countries totaled $2.5 billion, with Costa Rica and Guatemala being the largest suppliers. U.S. farm imports from these countries have grown by 23% over the last decade. Costa Rica shipped $899 million, while Guatemala shipped $784 million. The United States recorded an agricultural trade deficit of $761 million with these countries in 2004. In 2004, U.S. agricultural imports from DR-CAFTA countries totaled $2.5 billion. Excluding bananas and coffee, bilateral trade would have resulted in a surplus of $394 million. U.S. imports entered duty-free under trade preference programs. Certain commodities entered duty-free under tariff-rate quotas, limited by quotas. The United States and six countries use tariffs and quotas to protect their agricultural sectors. Central American countries and the Dominican Republic have high average tariffs on agricultural imports, but in practice, they impose lower tariffs. U.S. applied tariffs on imports from these countries are very low. The United States and six countries use tariffs and quotas to protect their agricultural sectors. The U.S. applied tariffs on imports from these countries are very low, averaging 0.2% with trade preference benefits. However, higher levels of border protection are provided through quotas and other restrictive measures for sensitive agricultural products. Once DR-CAFTA takes effect, tariffs and quotas on agricultural products between the United States and six countries will be phased out completely. U.S. objectives include eliminating tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers to trade, and providing relief mechanisms for the U.S. agricultural sector to adjust to increased imports of sensitive products. The U.S. aims to eliminate trade barriers and provide support for its agricultural sector in the DR-CAFTA agreement. This includes removing unjustified SPS restrictions, supporting the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, and not excluding any products or sectors from the agreement. Agricultural exports from FTA partner countries already enter the U.S. duty-free under existing programs. The issue of U.S. farm support should only be addressed in WTO negotiations. The six FTA partner countries sought unrestricted market access for commodities subject to U.S. TRQs like sugar, beef, dairy products, peanuts, tobacco, and cotton. Central American and Dominican Republic negotiators were concerned about U.S. corn and rice imports affecting small farmers. The subsidy issue was deferred to WTO negotiations. The agreement involved phasing out tariffs and quotas on most products. The agreement involves phasing out tariffs and quotas on all but four agricultural commodities and food products in seven stages over different time frames. The four most sensitive commodities will have quotas that increase by 2% each year indefinitely to limit imports. Over-quota tariffs will remain high to protect producers. Negotiators agreed to provide protection during transition periods for agricultural products, including tariff-rate quotas, long phase-out periods, nonlinear tariff reductions, and import safeguard mechanisms. Safeguards protect against import surges with temporary additional duties. Each country negotiated its own safeguard list, with expiration at the transition period's end. The DR-CAFTA agreement includes rules on safeguards, agricultural export subsidies, rules of origin, and application of WTO's SPS measures for trade facilitation. Disagreements will be addressed by a working group. The DR-CAFTA agreement grants immediate duty-free status to various U.S. farm products exported to Central American countries. Tariffs and quotas on certain agricultural products will be phased out over a 15-year period. Disagreements will be resolved through a working group. The DR-CAFTA agreement will phase out tariffs and quotas on agricultural products over 15-20 years. Transition periods will apply to imports from the United States, including rough/milled rice, chicken leg quarters, and dairy products. Other U.S. agricultural products will see tariffs and quotas eliminated over 15 years. White corn is designated as a sensitive commodity by El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Negotiators agreed to establish a quota for white corn that increases about 2% annually in perpetuity, with no reduction in over-quota tariffs. U.S. exports of fresh potatoes and onions to Costa Rica will face quotas that increase slowly in perpetuity and high over-quota tariffs. U.S. agricultural products will have better access to Central American countries compared to imports from Canada, Europe, and South America. The six FTA partners also agreed to recognize export eligibility for U.S. plants inspected under the U.S. food safety and inspection system. DR-CAFTA will consolidate duty-free access for agricultural imports from six countries, with specific quotas for sensitive products. Sugar imports will be treated similarly to white corn imports, with expanding quotas each year but unchanged over-quota tariffs. The DR-CAFTA will maintain unchanged over-quota tariffs for sugar imports, with specific quotas for sensitive products from six countries. The U.S. International Trade Commission projects that 12% of export gains from the agreement will benefit U.S. agriculture, while textile imports are expected to drive most of the growth in total U.S. imports under the agreement. Under DR-CAFTA, U.S. agricultural imports from the six countries would increase by 1.3%, with a $52 million net increase in imports. This would mainly involve a shift in labor and resources towards textile, apparel, leather products, and sugar sectors, benefiting from the agreement's openings in the U.S. market. The ITC's analysis shows that under DR-CAFTA, U.S. agricultural imports would increase by $52 million, representing a small fraction of total U.S. agricultural imports. The impact on U.S. corn and rice exports to the region would be minimal in the short term but is expected to rise significantly as quotas expand. By the end of the transition period, U.S. grain exports to the region could increase by at least 20%, offering significant market opportunities for U.S. corn and rice. The ITC expects a small increase in U.S. sugar and sugar-containing product imports from the region due to DR-CAFTA's sugar provisions. This could lead to a drop in prices by about 1%, impacting production and employment for U.S. sugar producers but benefiting producers of certain SCPs with high sugar content. The ITC's analysis shows that the U.S. sugar manufacturing and sugar crops sectors would experience the largest percentage decrease in domestic output and employment due to DR-CAFTA. Most U.S. commodity organizations and agribusiness supported the trade agreement, expecting benefits from increased access. The Agricultural Coalition for DR-CAFTA was formed in 2005 to support the trade agreement, with the U.S. cotton sector eventually backing it as well. However, some commodity groups like the sugar industry opposed DR-CAFTA due to concerns about increased competition and economic impact on domestic producers and processors. The Agricultural Coalition for DR-CAFTA, formed in 2005, supported the trade agreement. Some groups, like the sugar industry, opposed DR-CAFTA due to concerns about competition and economic impact on domestic producers. Many U.S. agricultural organizations supported DR-CAFTA, expecting benefits from market openings to increase sales to six countries. The Agricultural Coalition for DR-CAFTA supported the trade agreement, arguing that without it, U.S. farm exports would face barriers while imports would still receive duty-free treatment. Food manufacturers saw the six countries as strong markets for processed food products, with potential for an 84% increase in exports if tariffs were eliminated. The elimination of tariffs and quotas on key food products under DR-CAFTA could lead to an 84% increase in U.S. exports to the region, particularly in snack foods, confectionary products, and soups. GMA anticipates long-term benefits for its member companies, such as a more predictable business climate and enhanced intellectual property protections. The USA Rice Federation also supported DR-CAFTA. The USA Rice Federation supported DR-CAFTA, highlighting market access gains for U.S. rice producers. The agreement improves access to the Central American market, reduces import duties, and extends preferential duty treatment. TRQs are established for rough and milled rice, with total quotas increasing over time. U.S. rice exports to the region were valued at $184 million in 2004. U.S. rice exports to six countries totaled 714,000 MT in 2004, valued at $184 million. In-quota rice imports from the United States would no longer face applied tariffs. The Rice Federation notes that separate TRQs will allow end users to choose between rough and milled rice, enabling U.S. exporters to sell higher-value rice. Pork producers supported DR-CAFTA for market openings, with duty-free TRQs for pork cuts increasing annually to 29,040 MT in year 15. U.S. pork sales to the six countries totaled 8,442 MT in 2004, valued at $16 million. The United States will no longer face applied tariffs ranging from 15% to 47% during this transition period. The NPPC expects income growth from free trade to increase demand for pork in the region, despite low meat consumption. SPS discussions have led countries to recognize and accept pork from USDA-inspected facilities. The NCGA sees DR-CAFTA creating new export opportunities for U.S. corn farmers, stimulating exports of corn co-products like corn gluten feed, meal, DDGs, corn oil, and sweeteners. Tariffs on some corn products will be reduced within 15 years. The United States will reduce tariffs on some corn products within 15 years, with immediate elimination of tariffs on corn gluten products, starch, oils, and DDGs. The Corn Refiners Association supports the agreement, noting excellent export prospects for these products. Tariff and quota provisions distinguish between yellow and white corn, with duty-free TRQs for yellow corn totaling 1.15 million metric tons in year 1, rising to 1.74 MMT at the end of transition periods. In 2004, U.S. corn exports to Central American countries totaled 1.22MMT ($150 million) and to Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic were 1.24 MMT ($147 million). Tariffs on yellow corn will be eliminated by the end of the transition period, with duty-free access in the first year for Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. White corn will be treated differently, with duty-free TRQs totaling 84,660 MT in year 1, increasing to 116,200 MT in year 20. Tariffs on over-quota imports will remain in place indefinitely, with Costa Rica eliminating its tariff on U.S. white corn over 15 years. Costa Rica will eliminate its tariff on U.S. white corn over 15 years, while the Dominican Republic will maintain current duty-free treatment. The agreement on poultry reflects a framework developed by the U.S. poultry sector with minor changes, aiming for restricted access to sensitive products and more generous access to less sensitive ones. Some countries impose tariffs up to 164% on fresh and frozen poultry imports, with U.S. poultry exports averaging just above 73,000 MT annually valued at $51 million to the six countries in the 2000-2004 period. Under DR-CAFTA, the six Central American countries will provide duty-free access for U.S. chicken leg quarters. Each country will establish a TRQ that increases gradually over 17 to 20 years. Costa Rica's TRQ will start at 330 MT and grow by 10% annually, while the other countries will have a regional TRQ of 21,810 MT in the first year. The Dominican Republic's initial TRQ for leg quarters is 550 MT, increasing by 10% each year. Tariffs on other poultry products will be reduced at a faster pace. Under DR-CAFTA, the Dominican Republic will establish separate TRQs for mechanically de-boned chicken (phased out over 10 years) and for turkey products (with a 15-year phase-out). The dairy industry supported the agreement as an opportunity to export more U.S. dairy products duty-free to the region while minimizing imports from these countries. The provisions largely reflect discussions between U.S. and Central American dairy sectors. DR-CAFTA includes a 20-year transition period for dairy products, providing reciprocal access between the U.S. and Central American countries. U.S. dairy exporters gain more access to the Dominican Republic market. The agreement's declining tariffs and preferential quotas enhance U.S. competitiveness against other dairy exporters. Duty-free TRQs are created for six dairy products, with high over-quota tariffs phased out over the transition period. The DR-CAFTA agreement includes a 20-year transition period for dairy products, with reciprocal access between the U.S. and Central American countries. Quota amounts vary by country and product type, with the U.S. gaining quota access in the first year for dairy products. Duty-free access is granted for whey and lactose. U.S. dairy exports to the six countries averaged 20,700 MT annually from 2000 to 2004. In return, the six countries receive duty-free quota access to the U.S. market for specified dairy products. The United States offers new preferential quotas for sugar from six countries under DR-CAFTA, allowing them to sell a minimum of 311,700 MT of raw cane sugar annually. This represents 28% of the U.S. sugar import quota commitment. By year 15, these countries will have access to an additional 109,000 MT of sugar, a 35% increase over their current level. Negotiators agreed on new preferential quotas for sugar from six countries under DR-CAFTA, allowing them to sell a minimum of 311,700 MT annually in the U.S. market. By year 15, their access will increase by 153,140 MT above the 2004/05 level, with a subsequent annual increase of 2,640 MT. The U.S. over-quota tariff will remain at 78%, and a compensation mechanism can be activated by the U.S. to manage sugar supplies. The sugar industry opposes the sugar access commitments in DR-CAFTA and other FTAs, advocating for multilateral WTO trade negotiations instead. The USTR defends the additional access granted to six countries, stating it will only equal a small percentage of current U.S. sugar consumption. The Sweetener Users Association supports DR-CAFTA, stating it will enhance competition in the U.S. sugar market and increase export opportunities for other sectors. They believe it will have a positive employment effect on sugar-using industries by reducing incentives to relocate offshore for cheaper sugar. The Dairy Foods Association, National Confectioners Association, and Imperial Sugar Company supported DR-CAFTA for increased sugar imports. The American Sugar Alliance expressed concerns about the agreement's impact on the U.S. sugar sector, citing potential dangers and the need to consider NAFTA commitments. The American Sugar Alliance opposed increased sugar imports from Mexico and potential obligations to open the U.S. sugar market to other sugar-exporting countries. They argued that it would lead to lower prices, bankruptcies, and job losses. The Sweetener Users Association disagreed with the projections, stating that they did not consider the additional demand for sugar over time and USDA's authority to limit domestic sugar marketing. Agriculture Secretary Johanns committed to discussing concerns with Members regarding the approval of the Administration's draft bill to implement DR-CAFTA. Secretary of Agriculture Johanns committed to discussing concerns with Members about the sugar provisions in the agreement. Proposals from Members included earmarking additional sugar imports for ethanol production, resolving the trade dispute with Mexico, and maintaining current sugar program features. In response, USDA proposed to administer the domestic sugar program through FY2008 to control total U.S. sugar imports. The USDA proposed to administer the domestic sugar program through FY2008 to control total U.S. sugar imports, ensuring that market prices do not fall below support levels. If allotments are triggered, the sugar industry argued that releasing stocks into the market would depress prices, leading to USDA acquiring sugar as price support loans came due, resulting in program outlays and not meeting the \"no-cost\" objective. To keep imports below the trigger level, USDA proposed to donate surplus commodities or make cash payments to sugar exporters. The USDA proposed to control U.S. sugar imports through FY2008 by donating surplus commodities or making cash payments to sugar exporters in Central America or Mexico under trade agreements like DR-CAFTA and NAFTA. Discussions with industry representatives led to commitments to address concerns of Senators Chambliss and Coleman, delaying Senate Finance Committee consideration of the DR-CAFTA implementation bill. The Secretary's letter on sugar imports addressed concerns of Senators by pledging to preclude additional imports exceeding the trigger, using surplus sugar for ethanol, and conducting a feasibility study on sugar-to-ethanol conversion. The industry's proposal for a sugar-for-ethanol program with federal subsidy was rejected in favor of these measures. Members reacted to the letter positively. The U.S. sugar industry rejected the Administration's offer, citing concerns about future trade agreements, resolution of the Mexico sugar access dispute, and the continuation of the current sugar program. The Congressional Budget Office estimated an additional cost of $500 million for the domestic sugar program due to the DR-CAFTA agreement. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $500 million additional cost for the domestic sugar program due to the DR-CAFTA agreement, despite projections of lower costs in 2006 and 2007. The U.S. sugar industry expressed concerns about maintaining a sugar program without federal taxpayer costs. The National Cotton Council of America announced changes on May 10, 2005. The National Cotton Council of America (NCC) announced its support for DR-CAFTA on May 10, 2005, marking a shift in position from earlier concerns raised by various cotton industry stakeholders. The NCC resolution emphasized the importance of the agreement in promoting U.S. cotton fiber and textile products in the western hemisphere, while also urging action on increased textile competition, particularly from China. Initially opposed to DR-CAFTA, the NCC now seeks to address the trade priorities of the U.S. cotton industry. The National Cotton Council of America (NCC) reversed its position on DR-CAFTA, supporting the agreement after concerns were addressed. The NCC emphasized the importance of promoting U.S. cotton fiber and textile products in the western hemisphere, while also addressing increased textile competition. The NCC sought reciprocal liberalization in cotton fiber trade and NAFTA-type rules-of-origin in FTA negotiations. NAFTA rules require cotton and yarn in textiles to originate in the US or partner country for preferential trade treatment. NCC opposed DR-CAFTA initially due to less restrictive rules of origin allowing third-country textiles to qualify for preferential treatment. Cattlemen were divided on DR-CAFTA, with R-CALF opposing it. Under DR-CAFTA, Central American countries will eliminate tariffs on US prime and choice beef cuts immediately, with tariffs on other beef products phased out over 5, 10, or 15 years. Tariff reduction schedules are backloaded for sensitive beef products, with duty-free TRQs created for other beef cuts. U.S. beef sales to the six countries totaled 1,134 MT in 2004. Under DR-CAFTA, Central American countries will eliminate tariffs on US prime and choice beef cuts immediately, with tariffs on other beef products phased out over 5, 10, or 15 years. The United States will create separate duty-free TRQs for beef imported from all countries except Guatemala, with quotas totaling almost 23,000 MT in year 1 and rising to 37,962 MT before being eliminated in year 15. U.S. beef imports from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras totaled 31,258 MT last year. R-CALF expressed concerns about safeguards for U.S. beef imports from the region and the rule of origin for beef imports. Under DR-CAFTA, Central American countries will eliminate tariffs on US prime and choice beef cuts immediately, with tariffs on other beef products phased out over 5, 10, or 15 years. R-CALF expressed concerns about the rule of origin for beef imports, allowing cattle born in Argentina and Brazil but slaughtered in Central America to qualify for preferential tariff treatment in the U.S. market. The NCBA argued that DR-CAFTA eliminates tariffs on U.S. beef exports in the region and provides safeguards, including country-specific beef TRQs. The AFBF supported DR-CAFTA, stating that U.S. agriculture stands to benefit. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) backed DR-CAFTA, projecting a $1.44 billion net gain for U.S. agricultural trade in 20 years. Some state-level farm bureaus opposed the agreement due to concerns about sugar provisions. The National Farmers Union (NFU) also opposed CAFTA. The National Farmers Union (NFU) opposed CAFTA, stating it offers few benefits to U.S. farmers and will adversely impact domestic producers of various commodities. They argue that the agreement does not address key issues like exchange rates, labor, and environmental standards. The Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee believes CAFTA will improve opportunities for U.S. agricultural trade. The Policy Advisory Committee supports CAFTA, stating it will enhance U.S. agricultural exports with duty-free access. Most commodity-oriented ATACs favor the agreement for increased market access, while the sugar industry is divided on the impact of increased access for Central American sugar. Sugar users in the minority support the agreement for modest improvements. The FTA with the Dominican Republic on April 23, 2004, will result in reciprocal trading benefits for the U.S. agricultural and food sectors as tariffs and quotas are eliminated. However, the projected increase in exports is small due to the small population and low incomes of the six countries involved. This could also put pressure on the U.S. sugar and cotton/textile sectors. The FTA with the Dominican Republic on April 23, 2004, will result in reciprocal trading benefits for the U.S. agricultural and food sectors as tariffs and quotas are eliminated. U.S. sugar and cotton/textile interests lobbied Congress to defeat or modify the agreement due to fears of increased competition from imports. The agreement's investment provisions aim to give U.S. investors in the region equal treatment and protections, allowing some U.S. food manufacturers to establish processing plants for regional and U.S. markets. The ITC's analysis suggests that the six countries' agricultural sectors would gain little from the agreement. The agreement with the Dominican Republic on April 23, 2004, will provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for sensitive commodities, benefiting sugar processors, beef, and dairy exporters. The congressional debate has caused divisions within the U.S. agricultural sector regarding the potential gains and losses from the agreement. The Bush Administration is considering including similar openings for sensitive agricultural products in other FTAs like Colombia and Peru. U.S. trade negotiators are aware of the need to secure congressional approval by translating potential export gains into supportive votes. To limit opposition, they must minimize trade concessions on sensitive agricultural commodities. Senate approval of DR-CAFTA was easier than expected, but securing a majority in the House is challenging due to opposition from the sugar sector. The Bush Administration is facing challenges with the approval of DR-CAFTA, particularly due to opposition from the sugar and textile sectors. They are debating whether to make further changes to secure enough votes or proceed with the current provisions. The Clinton Administration made last-minute changes to NAFTA to secure votes in the past, but U.S. trade officials are hesitant to follow a similar approach for fear of unraveling the overall DR-CAFTA package. Despite commitments to address certain textile issues, the President decided to move forward with the final implementing bill. The President forwarded the final implementing bill to Congress without seeking changes in the agreement itself. The DR-CAFTA bill did not include provisions on sugar compensation or textile commitments. The legislatures of five countries have approved the trade agreement, with Guatemala's debate marked by street clashes. Calls for a public referendum on the DR-CAFTA agreement in Costa Rica may delay the debate until early 2007 due to the upcoming presidential election. Commercial farmers and agribusiness firms supporting DR-CAFTA, while subsistence farmers and citizen groups fear its impact on rural areas. Some Central American leaders have a different view on the agreement. Some Central American leaders see textile provisions of DR-CAFTA as necessary to compete with Chinese imports in the U.S. market and address labor movement from agriculture. Unclear if governments will support farmers affected by increased imports from the U.S., but the Bush Administration plans to allocate resources to help producers adjust. The Administration committed to supporting additional spending of up to $150 million over five years for transitional rural assistance in Guatemala, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic. This commitment may be superseded by resources from a Millennium Challenge Corporation compact. Another approach involves expanding government efforts, with support from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, to assist producers and entrepreneurs in increasing food exports to neighboring countries and the U.S. markets."
