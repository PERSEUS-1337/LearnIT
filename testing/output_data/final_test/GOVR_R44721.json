    "content": "This report provides policy and historical background on Puerto Rico's political status, which has not been altered by Congress since 1952. The island's status is crucial in Puerto Rican politics, with recent political changes leading to a 2017 plebiscite on statehood or free association/independence. After the U.S. Department of Justice declined to certify federal funds for a plebiscite in Puerto Rico, the island amended its law to include a status-quo option on the ballot. Despite some groups calling for a boycott, 23.0% of voters participated in the plebiscite, with 97.2% choosing statehood, 1.5% selecting free association/independence, and 1.3% opting for the current territorial status. In anticipation of a statehood victory, the territorial legislature passed legislation in June 2017 to pursue a \"Tennessee Plan\" path to statehood by sending a delegation to Washington to lobby Congress. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress broad discretion over territories like Puerto Rico, allowing them to reexamine its political status. Congress could alter Puerto Rico's status through statute regardless of a plebiscite. This report provides background information on the current status debate in Puerto Rico specifically, focusing on relevant issues for House and Senate consideration. It does not substitute for a comprehensive analysis of the complex issues surrounding Puerto Rico's affiliation with the U.S. for over 100 years. Puerto Rico's history dates back over 500 years when Spain first claimed the island. Christopher Columbus arrived in 1493, encountering native Ta\u00edno Indians. Juan Ponce Le\u00f3n established a permanent settlement in 1508. In 1508, Juan Ponce Le\u00f3n led Spanish settlers to Puerto Rico, turning it into a Spanish settlement. After 400 years of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Puerto Rico in 1898. The island served as a strategic location for the U.S. military in the Caribbean. Today, Puerto Rico is both integrated into American society and insulated from it. The flag has flown over San Juan for over 100 years, and those born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens. The island is geographically isolated from the mainland U.S. Residents lack full voting representation in Congress and do not pay federal income taxes on income earned on the island. Puerto Rico's status is a key political question in its relationship with the U.S. In the foreseeable future, oversight of Puerto Rico is likely to be relevant for Congress as they monitor the PROMESA Act enacted during the 114th Congress in response to the island's financial crisis. Legislation in the 115th Congress could impact the island's political status, making basic knowledge of the topic helpful in various policy areas. In the context of overseeing Puerto Rico's financial crisis, Congress may address the island's political status through oversight or legislation in response to the 2017 plebiscite. The debate surrounding past or future plebiscites in Puerto Rico may influence federal support for a plebiscite, but ultimately Congress has the authority to admit Puerto Rico as a state or not. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory under congressional authority. The Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to make rules regarding territories like Puerto Rico. Congress established a civilian government on the island in 1900 through the Foraker Act, which included a governor, House of Delegates, and judiciary system. The Resident Commissioner position was also created. The Foraker Act established a U.S.-style judiciary system in Puerto Rico and created the Resident Commissioner position to represent island interests in Washington. The Jones Act of 1917 extended U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, established a bill of rights for the island, and recognized island authority over internal governance. The Federal Relations Act of 1950 and the approval of the island's Constitution in 1952 solidified Puerto Rico's governmental structure with no major status changes since. After the approval of the territorial constitution, Puerto Rico became formally known as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" The term \"commonwealth\" and its legal or political significance is a topic of debate. Some argue that Puerto Rico's commonwealth status signifies a unique recognition between territory and state, known as \"enhanced commonwealth\" or \"new commonwealth.\" This perspective suggests that a new legal entity was created with a unique status in American law. The term \"Commonwealth\" in Puerto Rico's context is debated. Some view it as a unique legal entity with non-colonial status, not covered by the Constitution's Territory Clause. Others see it as a stylistic or historical term without specific legal or political significance. Leibowitz notes that the term has been debated since the beginning. The concept of the \"Commonwealth\" in Puerto Rico is debated, with some questioning its legal status and arguing that Congress retains broad powers under the Territorial Clause. Changing Puerto Rico's political status would require action by Congress and approval by the President. Those rejecting the status quo believe that Puerto Rico's current status was not intended to be permanent. The political status of Puerto Rico is debated, with three main perspectives represented by the established political parties: pro-commonwealth (PDP/PPD), pro-statehood (NPP/PNP), and independence (PIP). The independence perspective, although not a major party, continues to influence the status debate. The political status debate in Puerto Rico involves various perspectives within the major parties, leading to factional groups and minor parties. The PDP, NPP, and PIP are the main partisan forces, with other options like \"enhanced commonwealth\" and \"free association\" also considered. The viability of the \"enhanced commonwealth\" position is not universally accepted. At the federal level, positions on Puerto Rico's status do not follow clear partisan patterns. Members of Congress base their stance on personal preference or constituent issues. Consensus among Puerto Ricans is seen as crucial for any change in status. Puerto Rico has held multiple status plebiscites, with the most recent in 2012. In the 2012 plebiscite in Puerto Rico, approximately 54.0% voted \"no\" to the first question about the current political status. In the second question, around 61.2% chose statehood, but controversy arose due to blank answers. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla deemed the results inconclusive. After the 2012 plebiscite, interest in revisiting Puerto Rico's status waned until 2016 when momentum towards a new plebiscite increased. The House and Senate in Washington allocated $2.5 million in federal funds for voter education and a future plebiscite. However, the \"enhanced commonwealth\" status option was excluded from the ballot due to constitutional inconsistencies. In the 2016 general election, NPP candidates were chosen by Puerto Rico voters for both Governor positions. In the 2016 general election, Puerto Rico voters elected NPP candidates for Governor and Resident Commissioner. Governor-Elect Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 aims to focus on statehood, with plans to join the union through the Tennessee Plan. The Tennessee Plan for Puerto Rico involves creating a state-like political entity, drafting a constitution, electing state officers, and lobbying for statehood in Congress. Ultimately, achieving statehood requires a congressional statutory change with presidential approval. In 2017, Governor Rossell\u00f3 and the NPP-led legislature favored statehood, leading to a plebiscite on June 11, 2017. The 2017 plebiscite in Puerto Rico, supported by the NPP government, aimed to reaffirm the desire for decolonization and statehood. The initial ballot was modified after the DOJ refused to certify federal funds for the plebiscite. Supporters argued that Puerto Rican voters preferred non-territorial options, with statehood or independence as the only permissible choices. The 2017 plebiscite in Puerto Rico aimed to reaffirm the desire for decolonization and statehood. The ballot included \"Statehood\" and \"Free Association/Independence\" options, with only marked ballots counted. If \"Free Association/Independence\" won the majority, a referendum would be held for voters to choose between the two options, both leading to Puerto Rico becoming an independent country with potential ongoing relationships with the United States. The 2017 plebiscite in Puerto Rico included options for \"Statehood\" and \"Free Association/Independence\". PDP supporters objected to the ballot wording and choices, arguing for a status-quo option. The U.S. Justice Department did not approve releasing federal funds for the plebiscite, citing multiple considerations. The U.S. Justice Department did not approve releasing federal funds for the 2017 plebiscite in Puerto Rico due to concerns about ambiguous and misleading ballot language. DOJ also raised issues about how U.S. citizenship rights were explained and the potential misperception of the \"free association\" option. After DOJ's determination, the Puerto Rican government amended the plebiscite law. The Puerto Rican government amended the plebiscite law to include a commonwealth option after the U.S. Justice Department raised concerns about the ballot language. The revised ballot included options for statehood, free association/independence, and current territorial status, with supporters viewing it as a federal endorsement. The Puerto Rican government amended the plebiscite law to include a commonwealth option after the U.S. Justice Department raised concerns about the ballot language. The new ballot options sparked political controversy among the island's parties, leading to boycotts by the Independence Party (PIP) and the Popular Democratic Party (PDP). Despite this, on June 11, 2017, voters in Puerto Rico overwhelmingly chose statehood in the revised plebiscite ballot. In a plebiscite, 1.5% of voters chose free association/independence, and 1.3% chose the current territorial status. Turnout was 23%, with approximately 518,000 voters out of 2.3 million. Legislation was enacted for a \"Tennessee Plan\" path to statehood. The PDP opposition criticized the law and plans to challenge it. Two status bills have been introduced in Congress, one proposing statehood and the other proposing independence. After assuming office, Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner introduced legislation for statehood. H.R. 260 proposes statehood by 2025 if voters choose it in a plebiscite. Another bill, H.R. 900, suggests a referendum between independence and free association, allowing mainlanders of Puerto Rican descent to participate. Voting eligibility includes those born in Puerto Rico or with a parent born there. In the 114th Congress, legislation related to Puerto Rico's political status was discussed, but no direct action was taken. H.R. 727 proposed a vote on admitting Puerto Rico as a state, but the bill did not progress further. The bill specified a statehood admission process to conclude on January 1, 2021 if voters selected statehood. The status debate focuses on governance and democratic principles rather than economic issues. The relationship between status and economics is debated, with some arguing they are linked while others say the status debate distracts from economic problems. Puerto Rico's financial crisis has shaped recent attention to status. Economic issues are beyond the scope of this report. Congress enacted PROMESA in June 2016 to address Puerto Rico's economic crisis. PROMESA (P.L. 114-187) establishes a process for restructuring Puerto Rico's public debt and creates a federal oversight board with broad powers over the island's budget. Some Members of Congress criticized the board's powers as undemocratic, particularly its authority to approve fiscal plans and territorial budgets. The status debate was not a central focus during the congressional deliberation over PROMESA. Proponents argued that PROMESA was necessary to help Puerto Rico restructure its debts orderly, while critics believed it undermined the established status relationship. Section 402 of the law ensures Puerto Rico's right to determine its political status. The task force established in PROMESA recommended that if a plebiscite is held, Congress should analyze the result carefully. The Supreme Court's opinion in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle did not alter Puerto Rico's political status but concerned the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause to criminal prosecutions in Puerto Rico. The Supreme Court's opinion in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle did not change Puerto Rico's political status but focused on the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause in criminal prosecutions. The Court traced Puerto Rico's prosecutorial power to Congress, indicating that Puerto Rico's Constitution does not break the chain of congressional authority. This ruling suggests that Congress retains significant power over Puerto Rico's government, as seen in recent legislation like PROMESA. Sanchez Valle does not limit Congress's authority over Puerto Rico, leading to debates on the commonwealth's autonomy. Some argue it contradicts previous U.S. characterization of Puerto Rico's status to the U.N. despite being considered self-governing since 1953. U.N. meetings continue to discuss the island's political status and relationship with the U.S. The Special Committee's attention to Puerto Rico post-Sanchez Valle has led to calls for reexamining the island's relationship with the United States. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla has criticized the U.S. for backtracking on democratic accomplishments and must address this new position internationally. The U.N. regularly examines territorial issues worldwide, with Puerto Rico's status being a topic of discussion. The topic of Puerto Rico's status debate may not be prominent in Washington policy debates, but it is noteworthy that both departing and incoming Governors testified about the island's self-governance in light of the Sanchez Valle case."
