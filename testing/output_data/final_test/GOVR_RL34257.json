Congress closely monitors the performance, cost, and schedule of these investments to ensure accountability and responsible use of public resources. Earned Value Management (EVM) is a key management tool in this process. Earned Value Management (EVM) is a management technique that provides metrics to assess capital investments in terms of planned cost, time schedule, and functionality. EVM compares planned aspects against actual measurements, highlighting potential issues for further investigation. It is increasingly important in executive branch practices and congressional oversight. This report offers an overview of EVM terminology and concepts. The report provides an overview of EVM terminology and concepts, using a hypothetical example to illustrate potential oversight issues. It discusses the risks associated with major capital investments and how EVM is being adopted by executive branch agencies. The conclusion includes potential oversight questions for Congress regarding EVM. Major capital projects are considered inherently risky, with risk defined as the probability of adverse events occurring or favorable opportunities not being exploited. To achieve successful outcomes in major capital projects, agencies must effectively plan and manage risks to avoid adverse events like schedule delays, cost overruns, and performance failures. It is important to seize favorable opportunities such as completing projects quickly, at lower costs, and with better performance. Despite careful planning, problems may still arise due to the complexity and inherent risks of such investments. Stakeholders, including Congress and the public, closely monitor the performance, cost, and schedule of major capital projects. The public and stakeholders closely monitor major capital investments for performance, cost, and schedule. Interest increases when issues arise, often disclosed by journalists, inspectors general, or the Government Accountability Office. Problems with capital investments can indicate deeper issues with management capacity and accountability. EVM attempts to address monitoring and evaluation issues in tracking planned cost, schedule, and functionality of major capital assets. However, it does not cover all important aspects for assessing investment status and progress. Other techniques can be used for monitoring major capital investments throughout their life cycle. EVM is used to track planned cost, schedule, and functionality of capital investments primarily during acquisition. It is part of monitoring and evaluation activities in the capital investment life cycle. Concerns about project risks and efforts to mitigate them have been ongoing, with OMB's Capital Programming Guide first published in 1997. The government enacted statutory provisions related to major capital investments, including setting goals for acquisition programs and monitoring information system investments. The government enacted statutory provisions related to major capital investments, including setting goals for acquisition programs and monitoring information system investments. OMB has issued requirements for executive agencies to use Earned Value Management (EVM) to track progress of investments in information systems, including cost, capability, timeliness, and quality. Circular A-11 provides detailed directions for agencies to use EVM for major capital assets, requiring submission of an \"exhibit 300\" for each major investment in annual budget submissions to OMB. The circular defines Earned Value Management (EVM) as a project management tool that integrates scope, schedule, and cost elements for investment planning and control. It references the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) Standard 748-1998 for EVM system characteristics. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided directions to agency Chief Information Officers in August 2005 regarding major IT capital investments, emphasizing the need for performance measurement baselines and the use of an earned value management system compliant with ANSI standards. Agencies were required to meet four principal criteria for IT capital investments, including managing projects to within 10% of baseline goals. New expectations were added for agencies to ensure improvement in IT project execution. The memorandum in July 2006 introduced new expectations for agencies to validate cost, schedule, and performance goals for IT projects before development. EVM requirements were added to acquisition regulations, and three agencies amended the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement earned value management system policy in accordance with OMB Circular A-11. The FAR changes mandated the use of EVMS for major acquisitions, with agencies required to submit monthly reports. OMB utilized EVM data to assess agency performance. OMB has used EVM data to evaluate agency performance under the President's Management Agenda (PMA) initiative. While PMA standards are publicly available, the detailed rationales and worksheets behind agency scores are not transparent. EVM has been widely adopted for budgeting, management, and reporting purposes in the Bush Administration and executive branch agencies. The EVM metrics used under the Administration's PMA initiative will be presented to Congress and the public, potentially alongside the President's budget and management priorities. Congress may face challenges in judging the transparency and accuracy of these metrics, as well as in interpreting them for oversight and funding decisions. The EVM metrics used under the Administration's PMA initiative will be presented to Congress and the public, potentially alongside the President's budget and management priorities. EVM information might be relevant to informing Congress's assessments of major capital assets, aiding in decision-making and oversight. The following tables provide a hypothetical example of EVM metrics applied to asset development, illustrating basic analyses and potential topics for further investigation. The example presented here is adapted from federal government websites and publications, illustrating EVM metrics applied to asset development. It involves a major capital investment called \"Project B\" with six interrelated work units. Project B consists of six interrelated work units, collectively known as the project's work breakdown structure. The project's baseline plan, B1, outlines the costs and schedule for completion. The baseline plan shows that the six work units are planned to be completed at a total cost of $100. The EVM report details the planned budget for each work unit in Project B. Work unit D is planned to cost $25 and work unit E is planned to cost $20, referred to as planned value. This assigns a monetary value to the functionality of each work unit based on the planned budget. The EVM report provides a quantitative representation of completed work units in Project B. Table 2 includes new metrics showing planned and earned values for each work unit. For example, work unit A has an earned value of $10, indicating successful completion of planned functionality. The EVM report in Project B shows that work unit A has successfully completed planned functionality, earning $10. Other work units like B, C, and E have also achieved their planned functionality. However, work units D and F have not been fully completed or started, with only 40% of work unit D's planned value accomplished. Only 40% of work unit D's planned value of $25 has been completed, resulting in a schedule variance of -$15. Work unit D is 60% behind schedule compared to the baseline. Work unit F was never started, leading to a schedule variance of -$20 and being 100% behind schedule. Project B has an earned value of $65, $35 lower than planned, with a 35% schedule variance. Work units D and F falling behind schedule contributed to this shortfall. Further analysis beyond EVM data may be needed to understand why these work units were not completed. The evaluation and monitoring methods from Figure 1 may need to be explored to understand the slip in schedule for Project B. Qualitative and quantitative information from project members and stakeholders can help determine the cause of the schedule variance. It is important to note that variances are indicators that work is not progressing as planned and further assessment is necessary. The schedule variance metric only shows part of the project's progress; it is also essential to assess if the project is on track with its actual cost compared to the baseline. Table 3 presents EVM metrics to assess Project B's cost performance. It compares earned value with actual cost to calculate cost variance. For example, work unit A had an earned value of $10 and actual cost of $9, resulting in a $1 cost variance. The EVM data for Project B shows cost variances for different work units. Work units A and C were under budget, with positive cost variances. However, work units B, D, and E experienced cost overruns, with negative cost variances. Work unit B had a cost overrun of $7, with actual costs higher than planned. The cost overrun in work unit D was significant, with only 40% of planned functionality delivered successfully but at a cost that exceeded the budget. The cost variance for work unit D was -200%, indicating a substantial overspend compared to the planned value. The overall planned value of $25 was successfully delivered, becoming $10 in earned value. Work unit D had a cost overrun of 200% with $30 actual cost instead of $10 planned. Work unit F had a cost variance of zero as it was not started. Project B achieved $65 in earned value but spent $91, resulting in a cost overrun. Project B had a cost overrun of 40% with an actual cost of $91 compared to the planned value of $65. This resulted in a cost variance of -$26. Additionally, there was a schedule slip of -35% in delivering the capability. Comparing EVM metrics with the \"spend comparison\" approach showed discrepancies in actual expenditures against planned expenditures. The comparison of planned spending and actual spending in Table 4 is not useful as it does not relate to the work performed or the functionality delivered. Tables 1, 2, and 3 cover key aspects of EVM, comparing planned cost, time schedule, and functionality against actual values. EVM can help identify and correct problems during the investment process. Earned Value Management (EVM) benefits project management by providing disciplined planning and metrics to identify variances and corrective actions. It also offers oversight by giving a snapshot of a project's status, allowing stakeholders to quickly assess if the project is on track with its baseline plan. Negative variances indicate schedule slips or cost overruns, while positive variances show progress. EVM metrics may prompt further analysis to address root causes. EVM metrics provide a simple snapshot of a project's status, flagging outliers for further scrutiny. This can prompt additional analysis to address root causes and potential management issues. Without further evaluation, EVM metrics may only provide a partial story about project performance. Process evaluations and other methods are needed to assess the worth of a project and its impact on agency missions. Investments can impact an agency's mission and public policy success. Project plans may not accurately reflect costs and schedules needed for functionality. Uncertainty can lead to projects not proceeding as planned. Estimates may be based on insufficient research. Metrics can create incentives, including perverse ones. Caution is advised when accepting EVM metrics at face value. The scenario presented cautions against blindly accepting EVM metrics as accurate representations of a project's status. It highlights the importance of considering possible explanations for variances, such as lower labor costs, unexpected efficiencies, or lucky breaks. This serves as a reminder to assess project progress critically and not solely rely on surface-level metrics. The project manager \"sandbagged\" his estimates, padding everything to play it safe. Situation 1 is unlikely to happen simultaneously, while Situation 2 occurs occasionally. Situation 3, the most likely explanation, involves the project manager playing it safe to come in ahead of schedule and underspent. However, it is doubtful that the manager will give money back, as they may find ways to spend it on additional project features, equipment, or celebrations. The project manager may not give back money from an under-budget project, as they can use it for additional project features, equipment, or celebrations. However, giving back the money would mean losing the opportunity to fund other projects. Rescheduling and rebudgeting the project could make the money available for other projects, depending on the return on investment. The tolerance for variances in projects depends on the nature of the business, with construction projects having small tolerances and research and development projects likely to have variances. In federal government projects, tolerances for variances can range from 3 to 25 percent, depending on the nature of the project. The scenario highlights psychological and implementation phenomena that may affect major capital investments, involving various actors in the process. Questions arise about the accuracy of project budgets and planned functionality. The accuracy of project budgets and planned functionality for proposed federal government projects is questioned. Analysis is needed to determine if cost and benefit estimates are reasonable, and if decision-makers are using objective analysis. Concerns about the reasons for projects being under or over budget, or behind schedule, are raised. Scrutiny levels, capacity for assessment, and potential consequences of variances are also considered. Major capital investments can bring high levels of scrutiny to projects and their sponsoring agencies. Questions arise about learning lessons from experience in specific policy areas and types of investments. Prerequisites for learning from experience include capacities and processes for planning, funding, implementing, evaluating, and overseeing investments. These issues are of concern for Congress. The emergence of Earned Value Management (EVM) as a tool for monitoring major capital investments presents potential oversight issues for Congress. Questions arise about the advantages, disadvantages, costs, and benefits of requiring formal, periodic, and publicly accessible agency reporting of EVM metrics for these investments. This report provides a sampling of potential oversight questions for Congress in light of the increasing adoption of EVM practices. The establishment of a searchable website for federal contracts and grants required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) raises questions about the advantages and disadvantages of using EVM information. The quality and reliability of cost, schedule, and functionality data underlying project baseline plans and reports are crucial for the usefulness of EVM metrics. Concerns have been raised about the quality of agency capital investment business cases and project management, prompting options for Congress to improve deficiencies in the underlying analyses and data supporting capital investment decision making and reporting. The curr_chunk discusses the advantages and disadvantages of requiring independent assessments of the quality of EVM data and agency capacity to manage the capital planning and investment control process. It questions the use of \"scorecards\" for systematic oversight. The curr_chunk raises questions about agency capabilities in managing capital investments, including the adequacy of staff and financial resources. It also questions the use of \"scorecards\" for oversight and the ability of agencies to recruit, retain, and train staff effectively. The curr_chunk questions agency capabilities in managing capital investments, including recruiting, retaining, and training staff in various disciplines. It also explores the advantages, disadvantages, costs, and benefits of applying EVM-related requirements to major capital investments pursued by agencies in the legislative and judicial branches."
