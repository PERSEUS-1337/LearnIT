    "title": "AB 2497",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18729 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to specify that the article will only be in effect for taxable years before January 1, 2016, and will be repealed as of January 1, 2017. Any contribution amounts designated prior to the repeal will still be transferred and disbursed accordingly. Additionally, a new Article 3.6 is added to Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, establishing the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund. For taxable years starting January 1, 2016, individuals can designate excess contributions on their tax return to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund. Contributions must be in full dollar amounts and are irrevocable once made. If the total payments and credits do not exceed the tax liability, the designation is disregarded. The Franchise Tax Board will update the tax return form to include a section for the \"California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund\" contribution. Contributions can be one dollar or more and will support the California Senior Legislature's activities for older persons. A deduction is allowed for contributions made under this provision. The California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund is established in the State Treasury to receive contributions from taxpayers. The Franchise Tax Board notifies the Controller of excess tax payments and refund money designated for the fund. The Controller transfers the designated amounts from the Personal Income Tax Fund to the Advocacy Fund. The California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, successor to the California Senior Legislature Fund, receives all assets and liabilities from the latter. Moneys allocated to the Advocacy Fund are used for reimbursing costs incurred by the Controller and Franchise Tax Board, with the remaining balance supporting the ongoing activities of the California Senior Legislature for older persons. The funds allocated to the California Senior Legislature for its activities must be spent according to the organization's rules and bylaws. The organization's website should provide information on its goals, bills proposed, and events supported by the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund. The article will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed as of December 1, 2021. The Franchise Tax Board will determine the minimum contribution amount for the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund each year. The Franchise Tax Board will estimate contributions to determine if they meet the minimum amount required for the calendar year. If contributions fall short, the article will not apply for taxable years starting January 1 of that year and will be repealed on December 1. The minimum contribution amount for the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund is $250,000 for the second calendar year after its first appearance on the tax return, with adjustments made by the Franchise Tax Board starting from the third calendar year. The minimum estimated contribution amount for the calendar year is determined by multiplying the minimum estimated contribution amount by the inflation factor adjustment based on the California Consumer Price Index. Contributions designated prior to the repeal of the article will continue to be transferred and disbursed accordingly."
