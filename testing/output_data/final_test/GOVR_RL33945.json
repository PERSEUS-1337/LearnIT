    "content": "Developing countries are generally technology receivers rather than innovators, with room to catch up to industrialized nations through technology-based production. Wide gaps in economic welfare exist among developing countries, excluding certain countries from this category. Developing countries have seen increasing shares of U.S. exports and imports over a 20-year period. The data in Table 1 shows a trend where developing countries have increased their share of U.S. exports and imports from 1985 to 2006. Asian developing countries have been a significant contributor to this growth, with the East Asian Newly-Industrialized Economies' influence declining. The East Asian Newly-Industrialized Economies were once important contributors to U.S. trade growth, but their influence has declined. ASEAN members' share of U.S. trade also decreased. China has had the most significant impact on U.S. trade in the last twenty years, while India plays a smaller role. India accounts for a small portion of U.S. trade, with 0.9% of U.S. exports and 1.1% of U.S. imports. Latin America has increased in importance, with Mexico being a significant trade partner. Sub-Saharan African countries have stagnated as U.S. trading partners. In 1985, U.S. imports from Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 2.8% to 3.2% in 2006, with 81% of imports being oil from Nigeria and Angola. The poorest countries, including many in Africa, accounted for a small share of U.S. trade, with 1.1% of exports and 0.8% of imports in 1985, and 0.6% of exports and 1.3% of imports in 2005. OPEC countries' share of U.S. trade remained fairly constant, with imports reaching 7.9% in 2006 and exports declining from 5.0% in 1985 to 3.9% in 2006. In 2006, U.S. exports to developing countries included electronic products, computers, autos, and agricultural goods. Developing countries bought 56% of total U.S. agricultural exports. U.S. imports from developing countries were mainly crude oil, electrical machinery, and computers. The composition of U.S. trade varied among different subgroups of developing countries. More than 60% of U.S. imports from the least developed countries were oil, with textiles and apparel also significant. On the other hand, over 90% of U.S. imports from advanced newly industrializing economies in East Asia were non-oil products. U.S. imports from advanced newly industrializing economies in East Asia consist of technology-advanced products like electrical machinery, machinery, and cars. Developing countries have not attracted much U.S. foreign investment compared to trade. In 2005, the majority of U.S. foreign direct investment went to Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan, with developing countries accounting for a small percentage. Developing countries in Asia and other regions have seen an increase in their shares of world trade from 1985 to 2004. East Asian countries, particularly the NIEs, have been leading this growth in trade. Their shares of world exports and imports have also shown significant increases during this period. From 1985 to 2004, developing countries in Asia, including East Asian countries and the ASEAN-member countries, have seen significant growth in their shares of world exports and imports. China has experienced the fastest pace of trade growth, overshadowing others. However, other Asian countries like India have shown less robust trade growth, while Latin American countries have had relatively stable shares of world trade. The shares of world trade for Latin American countries have remained stagnant, with Mexico showing modest growth. In contrast, African countries, especially sub-Saharan ones, have experienced a decline in their participation in world trade. The most successful developing countries have focused on export-led growth, with East Asian countries like the NIEs leading the way since the 1970s. The NIEs in East Asia, such as Thailand, Malaysia, and China, have successfully integrated into the world economy since the 1970s, leading to economic growth. Other countries like Chile, Mexico, and India have also adopted export-oriented strategies. In contrast, import substitution policies have hindered economic growth in some developing countries. The most successful developing economies have built successful manufacturing sectors, while less successful countries are highly dependent on primary goods. The 50 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) rely on just three primary commodities for 70% of their exports, with some dependent on a single commodity. This dependency is concerning due to volatile commodity markets and decreasing shares of world trade. Many LDCs lack the necessary infrastructure for large-scale trade. Trade liberalization can pose adjustment costs for smaller, less diversified economies. Developed countries offer trade-capacity building assistance to promote economic growth. US trade policy towards developing countries is evolving, with a shift towards bilateral and regional trade agreements. Observers note ambiguity in US trade policy towards developing countries. The U.S. trade policy towards developing countries is ambiguous, encouraging trade liberalization through preference programs and free trade agreements while applying high import tariffs on labor-intensive and raw material goods. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) was established in 1976 to provide low or no tariffs on imports from certain developing countries, aiming to promote economic growth. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) was established in 1976 to reduce high tariffs on products from developing countries, promoting their competitiveness in global markets. The program has been renewed multiple times, with criteria including labor rights and intellectual property protection. Certain goods like watches, footwear, and electronics are excluded from coverage, leading to criticism about limitations of the program. Critics argue that exclusions in the U.S. GSP program limit its effectiveness by disqualifying labor-intensive products, which are a significant part of beneficiary countries' production profile. In 2005, only 9.6% of U.S. imports from GSP-eligible countries entered under the GSP program. Additionally, 83.9% of GSP-covered imports in 2005 were from just 10 countries, raising concerns about limited access to benefits. The program also has automatic competitive need limits for beneficiary developing countries, unlike other preference programs. The United States provides extensive tariff preferences to developing countries under three regional preference programs. The African Growth and Opportunity Act offers tariff preferences for imports from eligible sub-Saharan African countries in addition to those under GSP. The program has been amended three times since its inception in 2000. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was amended multiple times to expand benefits and extend effective periods. In 2005, $32.7 billion in imports entered the US under AGOA, with Nigeria accounting for a significant portion. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) provided tariff treatment to imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to encourage economic diversification. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) and the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) are U.S. programs aimed at diversifying economies away from illegal drug production in developing countries. The ATPA was reauthorized under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, while the CBERA extends tariff preferences to eligible countries in the Caribbean region. The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) was enacted in response to Hurricanes Georges and Mitch in 1998, providing trade preferences for imports from the region, including textiles and apparel. The CBTPA is set to end on September 30, 2008, or upon completion of the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement. The program has significantly impacted U.S. trade, but its importance will decrease with the implementation of the DR-CAFTA agreement. CBI beneficiaries are participants in bilateral free trade agreements with various countries, including Israel, Canada, Mexico, Jordan, Chile, and Singapore. The United States has shown increased interest in FTAs under the Bush Administration. Agreements have been signed with Oman, Colombia, and Peru, with negotiations ongoing with Panama, South Korea, and Malaysia. Other negotiations with countries like SACU, Thailand, Ecuador, and UAE are currently dormant. The United States has shifted its trade policy towards bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with developing countries, aiming for reciprocal agreements. FTAs provide opportunities for greater market access, addressing concerns like anti-dumping practices. Both the US and its FTA partners use these agreements to achieve non-commercial foreign policy objectives. The United States focuses on bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with developing countries to achieve reciprocal agreements. Critics suggest shifting emphasis to larger trade partners like Japan and the EU for greater benefits. Additionally, the US utilizes bilateral and regional trade and investment framework agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries. Countries establish a council to discuss trade and investment facilitation, with TIFA seen as a precursor to FTA negotiations. Developing countries hold significant influence in the WTO, with 71% of members being developing countries. Their participation has evolved over time, allowing them to exert a disproportionate influence in decision-making. Until the 1990s, developing countries viewed GATT as unsympathetic to their economic concerns and worked through U.N. organizations. Their increased involvement during the Uruguay Round led to the establishment of the WTO, reflecting their efforts to integrate their economies globally. Developing countries' influence in the WTO has grown, particularly during the Doha Development Agenda round. In late 1999, WTO trade ministers gathered in Seattle to launch a new round of negotiations. Developing countries, united against the proposed round's scope, felt their concerns were not addressed. The Seattle meeting failed, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda round in November 2001 in Qatar. The Doha Development Agenda round was launched in November 2001 in Qatar, focusing on the concerns of developing countries. Negotiations stalled at the fifth ministerial in Cancun, where the G-20 group of developing countries, led by Brazil and India, emerged as a major force. Developing countries face challenges in participating in WTO disputes due to high costs. Their importance in U.S. trade has raised various policy issues. The prevalent issues in U.S. trade negotiations with developing countries include challenges to U.S. laws and practices, as well as concerns about trade liberalization's impact on employment and wages. This has led to debates on the role of U.S. trade with lower-wage countries and the potential effects on American workers. Labor and trade issues have gained attention due to the growing income gap in the United States. The gap is attributed to technology advancements, trade liberalization, and globalization, leading to higher rewards for highly-paid workers and multinational corporations. Increased trade with low-wage countries like China and India has also compressed wages in developed countries. The rise in trade with developing countries has led to income inequality in the United States, causing a compression of wages. Some suggest that trade policies should include safety nets like enhanced trade adjustment assistance or wage insurance for workers affected by trade. Some argue for safety nets like trade adjustment assistance or wage insurance for workers affected by trade. Others propose boosting education to compete globally. Congress debates labor rights in trade agreements with developing countries, seen as protectionism by some. The 110th Congress and the Administration prioritize foreign government protection of U.S. intellectual property rights in trade negotiations and agreements, including Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Developing countries struggle with enforcing IP laws, leading to piracy issues. U.S. producers argue that piracy not only impacts revenues but also quality control of their products. Developing countries claim they lack the infrastructure to combat piracy and that legal goods would be too expensive for their residents. The Office of the United States Trade Representative issues an annual Special 301 report on this issue. The Office of the United States Trade Representative issues a Special 301 report annually, identifying countries failing to protect U.S. intellectual property rights. Developing countries face challenges accessing affordable medicines due to high prices set by pharmaceutical companies. Some companies provide drugs on an ad hoc basis during health emergencies. In December 2005, WTO members adopted an amendment allowing developing countries to use compulsory licenses for generic pharmaceuticals in health emergencies. This provision permits importing medicines from third countries with production capacity, compensating patent holders, and restricting use for a limited time. However, the use of compulsory licenses has been limited, with developing countries criticizing developed nations for not facilitating the process. Developing countries have raised concerns about high U.S. tariffs and non-tariff barriers on products like textiles, apparel, and certain agricultural goods, limiting their exports to the U.S. market. Specifically, they point to high tariffs on textiles and apparel, with 62.7% facing tariffs of 10% or more. This issue has been brought up during bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements. Developing countries criticize high U.S. tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and subsidies on agricultural products. U.S. quotas and tariffs on sugar are contentious in FTA talks. A study shows U.S. protection for agricultural producers is 19.9%, lower than Canada (52.3%), EU (46.4%), and Japan (82.1%). The U.S. urges developing countries to reduce tariffs and barriers on agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services like banking and insurance. The United States has urged developing countries to reduce barriers to trade in services, which could benefit U.S. exporters and improve developing economies' efficiency. Developing countries have raised concerns about antidumping actions initiated by the U.S. and other developed countries, proposing special treatment in WTO negotiations and FTA talks. South Korea has been involved in these discussions. In FTA negotiations, South Korea is seeking special treatment. Congress opposes any weakening of U.S. trade remedy laws. Bipartisan support exists to maintain rigorous enforcement of antidumping laws. The Bush Administration allowed changes in trade remedy laws for Doha negotiations, criticized by many Members of Congress. Many developing countries criticize trade preference programs like GSP for not providing significant benefits due to exceptions for import-sensitive products. They argue that tariff preference programs are losing value as developed countries enter free trade agreements that eliminate tariffs. Multilateral negotiations have also reduced tariffs for all members. The growth of developing countries' foreign trade has influenced U.S. trade policies, including the possible renewal of trade promotion authority, implementing FTAs, reauthorizing trade adjustment assistance, reviewing trade preference programs, overseeing WTO negotiations, and addressing other trade issues. Developing economies' imports offer U.S. consumers a wider range of choices. Trade with developing countries provides U.S. consumers with more product choices at lower prices, boosting real incomes and the standard of living. However, U.S. workers face competition from lower-wage labor in countries like India and China, leading some firms to use technology, move production offshore, or shut down. Economists believe trade affects job composition but not overall employment levels. Issues like labor rights, environmental protection, and intellectual property rights are also raised by trade with developing countries. Developing countries are challenging U.S. trade policies on various issues such as trade remedies, high tariffs, pricing of medicines, and entry of foreign workers. As trade trends continue, developing countries are expected to play a larger role in U.S. and world trade. However, there is a significant divide among developing countries, with some making progress in trade while others lag behind. Developing countries, including those in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, vary in their trade performance with the U.S. and the world. These differences are important for shaping U.S. trade policy decisions regarding trade preferences, agreements, and negotiations."
