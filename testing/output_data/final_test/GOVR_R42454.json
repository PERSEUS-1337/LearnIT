    "content": "This report provides an overview of Congress's ability to participate in litigation before federal courts as a plaintiff or third-party intervener. It does not cover situations where Congress appears as a defendant or as amicus curiae. Congressional plaintiffs, including individual Members, committees, or legislative branch entities, must establish standing to sue in federal court. The Supreme Court's 1997 decision in Raines v. Byrd has made it challenging for individual Members to demonstrate standing, but authorized Members or committees representing a whole house have been successful in establishing standing. Authorized Members or committees representing a whole house can establish standing to sue in federal court, even after the Raines decision. Recent case law shows that suits brought by Congress in an institutional capacity have a better chance of meeting standing requirements compared to cases where individual Members claim political or institutional injuries. Standing is a procedural question based on whether the plaintiff has a legal right to a judicial determination. The law regarding standing before the court is a mix of constitutional requirements and prudential considerations. Article III of the Constitution limits federal judicial power to \"cases\" and \"controversies,\" with courts declining to exercise powers beyond those strictly judicial. To satisfy constitutional standing requirements, the Supreme Court imposes three criteria: alleging a personal injury-in-fact, showing the injury is traceable to the defendant's conduct, and demonstrating the injury can be redressed by relief. Federal courts also follow prudential principles relevant to standing inquiries, separate from constitutional requirements. These principles require the plaintiff to assert their own legal rights, fall within the protected interests, and avoid generalized grievances. Unlike constitutional limits, prudential standing requirements can be changed by Congress. The doctrine of standing is typically invoked in cases challenging executive branch actions or acts of Congress. Before the 1997 Raines v. Byrd decision, legislative standing law was largely developed by the D.C. Circuit, relying on Supreme Court decisions like Coleman v. Miller involving the ratification of a constitutional amendment by the Kansas state legislature. The Kansas Supreme Court rejected a request by legislators to erase the state's ratification of a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that the legislators had standing to challenge the ratification, as they had a direct interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that legislators had standing to challenge the ratification of a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution, affirming their right under the Constitution. Despite this, the Court held that questions regarding ratification of constitutional amendments are considered \"political questions\" and are non-justiciable. The case was compared to Powell v. McCormack, where a challenge was made regarding exclusion from the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court ruled that Representative Powell had standing to sue for his removal from the House of Representatives, citing a personal injury rather than an institutional one. D.C. Circuit decisions have been crucial in shaping the standing of individual Members of Congress to bring civil suits in federal court since the 1970s. Mitchell v. Laird established one of the first approaches to this issue. The D.C. Circuit granted Members of Congress standing to sue against President Nixon and other officials for conducting an unconstitutional military operation in Southeast Asia. The court adopted a broad theory of legislator standing, allowing Members to challenge actions that affect their constitutional duties. Despite the case being dismissed on political grounds, the rationale for legislator standing remained significant. Beginning in 1974, the D.C. Circuit changed the standard for legislator standing in cases like Kennedy v. Sampson, where Senator Kennedy sued the General Services Administration over the Family Practice Medicine Act becoming federal law. President Nixon's pocket veto was contested, leading to a shift in the interpretation of legislator standing. The court addressed Senator Kennedy's standing in the case regarding the \"pocket veto\" and established two approaches for adjudicating such claims. The court found a logical nexus between the status of Members of Congress and their ability to challenge executive actions that disapprove of Acts of Congress. The court determined that Senator Kennedy had standing in the case involving the \"pocket veto\" as his injury affected the effectiveness of his vote as a U.S. Senator. The court also clarified that individual legislators can have standing, rejecting the argument that only the interests of the entire legislature are protected. The D.C. Circuit clarified that individual legislators have standing to protect the effectiveness of their vote, as seen in cases involving Harrington v. Bush and Goldwater v. Carter. Congressional plaintiffs must allege a distinct injury to themselves to establish standing. The court adopted the Kennedy approach in Harrington v. Bush, focusing on nullification of a specific vote as the requisite injury in fact. In Goldwater v. Carter, Senator Goldwater argued he suffered an \"injury in fact\" due to the unilateral termination of a treaty without Senate approval. The court ruled in Goldwater v. Carter that Senator Goldwater had been disenfranchised by the unilateral termination of a treaty without Senate approval, setting a standard for determining nullification. The decision established the law of legislator standing. In Goldwater v. Carter, the court established the law of legislator standing, requiring legislators to prove concrete injury and lack of alternative remedies to bring suit in federal court. The decision emphasized that executive violations or diminished effectiveness as a Member of Congress were not sufficient grounds for standing. The case also clarified that one or several legislators could bring suit without the entire Congress or a single house being required as a party. However, this settled law was challenged in 1979 when Senator Donald Riegle sued the Federal Open Market Committee for being unconstitutionally constituted. In Riegle v. Federal Open Market Committee, the D.C. Circuit addressed separation of powers issues raised by a Member of Congress suing without Senate consent. The court applied the \"doctrine of circumscribed equitable discretion,\" requiring dismissal if the Member could seek relief through legislative avenues. This reflects judicial reluctance to provide a forum when legislative remedies have not been exhausted. After Riegle v. Federal Open Market Committee, Members of Congress had some success in establishing standing, but suits were often dismissed based on the equitable discretion doctrine. The D.C. Circuit explained the challenges of congressional plaintiff suits in Moore v. U.S. House of Representatives. In Moore v. U.S. House of Representatives, the D.C. Circuit addressed separation-of-powers concerns regarding congressional plaintiffs' standing to sue coordinate branches of government. Standing requires a specific and cognizable injury, not generalized complaints about legislative effectiveness or executive actions. In Raines v. Byrd, the Supreme Court ruled that Members of Congress lacked standing to challenge the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 because they did not show a personal injury. The Court also questioned if the injury was traceable to unlawful conduct by the defendants. The Supreme Court in Raines v. Byrd held that Members of Congress did not have standing to challenge the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The Court distinguished between personal and institutional injury, stating that a congressional plaintiff must allege a personal injury or an institutional injury that is not abstract and amounts to vote nullification. The plaintiffs in Raines asserted an institutional injury, but their votes were not nullified due to other legislative remedies available. The Raines v. Byrd case established that congressional plaintiffs must allege a specific personal or institutional injury, not a generalized grievance. The plaintiffs in Raines did not have standing to challenge the Line Item Veto Act as their votes were not nullified, and other legislative remedies were available. The case of Coleman legislators, whose votes were nullified, does not provide meaningful precedent for the appellees' argument. The Court in Raines established that congressional plaintiffs must allege a specific personal or institutional injury, not a generalized grievance. The limits on Member standing set in Raines may prevent a Member from challenging an act of Congress in court, as legislative remedies would be available to address the issue. Raines also restricts a Member's ability to establish standing. The Raines decision restricts a Member's ability to establish standing to challenge an executive action, particularly in cases of vote nullification. D.C. Circuit decisions post-Raines have clarified the meaning of vote nullification and the status of pre-Raines rulings. The D.C. Circuit denied Members standing to challenge the President's executive order without statutory authorization, citing the Raines decision's requirement of vote nullification. This conflicted with previous precedents like Kennedy and Moore, leading the court to retract its expansive standing determination. In Campbell v. Clinton, the D.C. Circuit addressed the issue of \"vote nullification\" when Members of Congress sued President Clinton for violating the War Powers Clause by directing U.S. forces in NATO airstrikes without congressional authorization. The court considered the Coleman exception to Raines but ultimately denied Members standing, retracting its previous expansive standing determination. The court in Campbell v. Clinton addressed the issue of \"vote nullification\" when Members of Congress sued President Clinton for violating the War Powers Clause. The court rejected the argument that a War Powers Resolution and congressional declaration of war were \"nullified\" by U.S. troop involvement, stating that Raines did not suggest that the President 'nullifies' a congressional vote. The court interpreted Raines vote nullification to require no other legislative remedies be available to rectify executive action. The court distinguished Coleman from the plaintiffs' claims, as the Coleman senators may have been powerless to rescind a ratification of a constitutional amendment. In Campbell v. Clinton, Members of Congress lacked standing to sue President Clinton for violating the War Powers Clause as they had legislative remedies available to them, similar to the situation in Raines. The court rejected the argument of \"vote nullification\" and emphasized that the Members could have passed a law to stop the Yugoslav campaign. Therefore, there was no vote nullification and the Members did not have standing. In Kucinich v. Obama, a suit alleging War Powers Clause violations in Libya was dismissed due to lack of standing. The court found no vote nullification and Members had legislative remedies available. Similarly, in Johnson v. U.S. Office of Personnel Management, a lawsuit by a Member of Congress was dismissed for lack of standing challenging an OPM rule for health benefits. The court ruled that plaintiffs' personal injuries did not meet standing requirements to challenge federal contributions towards health insurance premiums for Members of Congress. Institutional plaintiffs have had more success in establishing standing, but only when authorized to seek judicial recourse on behalf of a house of Congress. The House passed H.Res. 676 authorizing a lawsuit against the President or executive branch for not fulfilling duties under the Constitution and laws, shedding light on applying Raines vote nullification standard to cases involving institutional plaintiffs. The House passed H.Res. 676 authorizing a lawsuit against the President or executive branch for not fulfilling duties under the Constitution and laws. The resolution allows the Speaker to seek relief from a federal court regarding implementation of the ACA. The specific claims and relief requested are not known yet, but it may involve an institutional injury and the application of Raines to suits brought by authorized, institutional plaintiffs. The Supreme Court's decision in Reed v. County Commissioners of Delaware County, Pennsylvania in 1928 may be relevant in understanding what it means for a congressional body to be authorized to sue. The U.S. Senate special committee was investigating means to influence Senate candidate nominations. They sought election materials from Delaware County Commissioners, leading to litigation. The Supreme Court affirmed the Senate's power to obtain evidence but dismissed the case. The Supreme Court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, stating that the Senate Resolution did not authorize Senators to sue. Congress must expressly authorize litigation for Senators or committees to represent it in court. Reed did not specify how authorization for litigation should be provided, leaving open the question of whether a law or resolution is required. The House has previously authorized committee counsel to intervene in civil litigation through a House resolution. For example, in 1976, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce issued subpoenas to AT&T for national security request letters from the FBI. Before AT&T could comply with the subpoena, negotiations between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Representative John Moss failed, leading the DOJ to seek an injunction in the U.S. District Court. The House of Representatives passed a resolution authorizing Chairman Moss to represent the Committee in litigation to obtain information on the privacy of telephone communications held by AT&T. The House resolution authorized Chairman Moss to represent the Committee in litigation to obtain information from AT&T. Chairman Moss intervened in the proceedings, and an agreement was eventually reached regarding the disclosure of the documents sought. The court recognized Chairman Moss's standing, stating that the House as a whole can designate a member to act on its behalf. In 1976, Chairman Moss was authorized by the House to intervene in a lawsuit between Ashland Oil and the FTC. The case involved a dispute over the transfer of information to a House Subcommittee, with Chairman Moss seeking House authorization to intervene. The district court granted Chairman Moss's motion to intervene and denied the injunction against the FTC. In a case involving Chairman Moss's motion to intervene and refusal to grant an injunction against the FTC, the court of appeals affirmed the decision without addressing standing issues. In separate cases involving House committees seeking to enforce subpoenas against executive branch officials, the U.S. District Court in Miers held that the Judiciary Committee had House authorization to sue, being an institutional plaintiff with institutional injury. The Committee in Holder had Article III standing as it was authorized to sue and asserted a concrete injury to its investigatory power. In contrast, In Re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation showed the consequences of a House committee not being expressly authorized to represent the House in court. The subcommittee chairmen appealed to the Fifth Circuit to modify a protective order, arguing they didn't need House authorization as they weren't enforcing a subpoena. The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument. The Fifth Circuit rejected the subcommittee chairmen's argument that House authorization was unnecessary for appearing in court, citing House Rules that require authorization for any litigation involving a House committee. The court emphasized the need for a House resolution before intervening in legal matters, leading to the dismissal of the appeal due to lack of authorization. Thompson argued that legislative branch suits to enforce requests for information from the executive branch are justiciable if authorized by Congress. The Waxman case involved minority members of the House seeking access to Department of Health and Human Services records related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The plaintiffs claimed the right to sue under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954. The court rejected the argument that Members had the right to sue to enforce their informational demands under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Reed. The court found that because \u00a7 2954 was silent on civil enforcement, Congress may not have intended to grant Members the power to seek judicial orders for document demands. As a result, the Members lacked standing to sue, and the case was dismissed without addressing the merits of the claim. In a similar case in 2002, Walker v. Cheney, the General Accounting Office was involved in a dispute in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The General Accounting Office (GAO) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking records on the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG) after concerns were raised about exclusive non-governmental participants in task force meetings. GAO requested information from Vice President Cheney on the individuals present, meeting purpose, agenda, invitation process, and meeting notes. Despite unsuccessful attempts to obtain the information, GAO issued a demand letter for the records. The Comptroller General filed suit after a demand letter for records on the National Energy Policy Development Group was ignored. The court dismissed the suit due to standing issues, stating that the Comptroller General's alleged injury was not personal but solely institutional. The court found the institutional injury insufficient to establish standing. The court dismissed the suit filed by the Comptroller General for lack of standing, stating that his alleged institutional injury was not sufficient to establish standing. The court found that the Comptroller General was acting as an agent of Congress and did not have a personal injury to assert. Additionally, Congress had not expressly authorized the suit, leading to the conclusion that the plaintiff lacked standing. The Miers case analyzed the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, specifically regarding congressional institutional plaintiff standing. The court in Miers determined that the House's explicit authorization for the plaintiffs to sue distinguished it from cases like Raines, allowing for standing to enforce a subpoena. This distinction was crucial in moving the case from individual plaintiff status to institutional plaintiff status. The court in Holder reinforced the precedent set in AT&T, distinguishing Raines and its progeny by highlighting that authorized institutional plaintiffs alleging institutional injury may have standing. However, the question of whether the Raines vote nullification standard applies in such cases remains unanswered. The courts did not address the application of the vote nullification standard. It may not prevent authorized institutional plaintiffs from enforcing a subpoena without a legislative alternative. Member plaintiffs must show a personal or institutional injury to establish standing, as seen in the Raines decision. Institutional plaintiffs with authorization to sue have standing in cases involving subpoena enforcement, but it is unclear how the Raines vote nullification standard applies to institutional plaintiffs outside of this context."
