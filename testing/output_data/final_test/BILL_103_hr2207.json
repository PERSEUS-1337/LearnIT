    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Common Sense Amendments for All Endangered Species Act\" and includes an amendment to evaluate wildlife management effects under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Secretary must assess the impact on fish and wildlife management practices of any proposed action under the Act, including species listing or critical habitat designation. This evaluation involves notifying relevant state or local agencies and holding a hearing near the proposed action. This section does not alter the standards for listing determinations in section 4. The entry for that section in the table of contents to the Act of 1973 is amended. SEC. 13. Wildlife management effects evaluation. Amends the Endangered Species Act to specify that fish and wildlife management activities authorized by Federal or State authorities do not constitute taking unless they harm endangered or threatened species. Does not affect consultation requirements or permit issuance. Section 8A(c) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include recognition and adherence to determinations made by contracting parties to the Convention regarding threatened or endangered species. The Secretary may reject determinations if there is evidence of fraud or inadequate scientific data. SEC. 5 amends the Endangered Species Act to require violations of foreign laws to be related to wildlife conservation statutes for criminal penalties. All other foreign law violations are subject to a different subsection. SEC. 6 addresses criteria for subspecies and populations, as well as adjudication and peer review. The Endangered Species Act is amended to establish criteria for determining subspecies or distinct population segments eligible for listing as threatened or endangered species. Genetic data analysis must be used when available, and a reasonable burden of proof is set for these determinations. Adjudicative procedures may be employed to acquire scientific data. The Endangered Species Act is amended to establish criteria for determining subspecies or distinct population segments eligible for listing as threatened or endangered species. The Secretary may submit any scientific determination on a proposed listing for peer review before making a final determination. The Secretary of the Interior will study and report to Congress on the feasibility of a program similar to the Dingell-Johnson and Pittman-Robertson programs, collecting funds from those benefiting from the Endangered Species Act to support its goals."
