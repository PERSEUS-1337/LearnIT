Assistant Attorney General for Agriculture Competition established within the Department of Justice for oversight of antitrust matters affecting agriculture. Appointment by the President with Senate approval. SEC. 5. Statutory trust added to the Packers and Stockyards Act for the protection of sellers of livestock to market agencies and livestock dealers. Congress finds that a burden on commerce in livestock is caused by financing arrangements where dealers encumber livestock obtained through cash sales without payment, contrary to the public interest. The purpose is to create a trust for unpaid cash sellers of livestock. A cash sale is defined as a sale without credit extension from the seller to the buyer. The trust corpus established under this section includes assets of a dealer held for the benefit of unpaid cash sellers of livestock, encompassing accounts receivable, proceeds from cash sales, and livestock inventories. The dealer must hold accounts receivable and proceeds from livestock sales in trust for unpaid cash sellers until full payment is received. Payment instruments that are dishonored do not count as payment, and the benefit of the trust is lost if this occurs. The unpaid seller must notify the dealer and the Secretary within specific timeframes after a payment instrument is dishonored to retain the benefit of the trust. Dealers with annual livestock purchases under $250,000 are exempt from these provisions. Purchases of livestock by a dealer for feeding purposes are not considered dealer transactions under this section. The trust established under this section does not affect the rights of a third-party purchaser of livestock or an animal care provider. District courts have jurisdiction to enforce payment from the trust funds and prevent violations. The Secretary has the authority to prevent dissipation of a trust and there are no limitations on other available remedies. Dealers violating the section are liable for damages and penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 per violation. The Secretary can impose a civil penalty of $1,000 to $10,000 for violations related to livestock purchases. Factors considered include the gravity of the offense and the impact on the violator's business. Failure to pay the penalty may result in legal action by the Attorney General. SEC. 6 authorizes funding for the Department of Justice to support the Assistant Attorney General for Agriculture Competition. SEC. 7 provides authorization for additional staff and funding for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. SEC. 8 authorizes funding to enhance the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration's capability to monitor and investigate structural changes in the meat packing industry. Specifically earmarked sums will be used to hire litigating attorneys for more effective enforcement activities, especially through regional offices. Additionally, the section mentions the application of the administration to poultry. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on disparities in the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration's authority over poultry, beef, and pork industries. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within a year. Additionally, confidentiality clauses in livestock and poultry production contracts will be unenforceable. Confidentiality clauses prohibiting parties from sharing contract terms for legal or financial advice are unenforceable in livestock and grain production contracts, except to protect legitimate trade secrets. Additionally, producers harmed by packers engaging in anticompetitive behavior are entitled to reparations. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration will establish a trust fund for farm producers harmed by packers engaged in anticompetitive behavior. 50 percent of fines and settlements received by the Administration will be deposited into the trust fund. The Secretary of Agriculture can use the funds to compensate harmed farm producers for losses."
