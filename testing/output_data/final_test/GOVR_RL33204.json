    "content": "This report focuses on the major factors affecting price formation for the five largest U.S. program crops - wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, and cotton. These crops accounted for 67% of harvested crop land in the United States in 2002 and share common characteristics such as annual production, long-term storability, bulk movement from farm to market, and active trading on commodity futures exchanges. The competition for crop land in production indirectly links their prices across markets. The report discusses economic fundamentals in agricultural commodity markets, the role of futures markets in price determination, the USDA's role in market information dissemination, and unique factors affecting price determination in different commodity markets. Price equilibrium (P*) is where demand and supply meet in the marketplace. New market information can alter market expectations and lead to a new equilibrium price as sellers and buyers adjust their prices based on the information. Shifts in demand or supply from the market equilibrium can result in short-term price changes. In the long run, producers adjust to these changes. In the long run, producers adjust their planting decisions based on new price expectations. Market structure influences the speed and efficiency of price adjustments, with factors like the number of buyers and sellers, product differentiation, close substitutes, and storability playing a role. The price of a commodity is influenced by factors such as storability, price transparency, market mobility, and artificial restrictions. These factors can affect the equilibrium price level and market dynamics. The price of a commodity, whether in a terminal, port, or commodity futures exchange, is influenced by various market forces such as supply and demand balance, consumer preferences, production factors, relative crop prices, government policies, storage, transportation, and international market conditions. Local supply and demand conditions also play a significant role in determining grain and oilseed prices worldwide. Grain and oilseed prices are influenced by local supply and demand conditions, with lower prices in surplus-producing regions and higher prices in deficit regions. Similarly, cotton prices are lowest in production zones and highest around processing centers. Market participants compare prices based on product characteristics, leading to fluctuations in supply and demand based on specific variety, quality, or end-use characteristics. The U.S. grain and oilseed handling network includes various components like on-farm storage, trucks, railroads, barges, and elevators. Local supply and demand conditions determine the movement of commodities through this network based on specific product characteristics. The movement of commodities in the U.S. grain and oilseed handling network is influenced by local supply and demand conditions. Price changes can lead to shifts in transport modes or routes as marketers seek the most cost-effective method. Country elevator managers monitor prices in various markets to determine demand and adjust bids for local producers after deducting transfer costs. Transfer costs, such as loading and transportation charges, play a significant role in determining spatial price differentials in competitive markets, including international trade barriers. In the international marketplace, transfer costs like tariffs and quotas affect price differentials. Marketers quickly adjust prices between regions to balance transfer costs. Trucks, trains, and barges compete in moving grain based on shipping distance. Trucks are efficient for short distances, while railroads and barges excel in long-distance transportation. Barges have a cost advantage in moving grain long distances, helping to hold down rates charged by rail and truck transportation industries. Disruptions in the agricultural transportation network lead to higher transportation costs as demand shifts to alternate modes and routes. For example, a weather event affecting barge traffic on the Mississippi River can raise barge freight rates, prompting a shift in commodities to alternate uses, transport modes, or trade routes. Government policies in the United States provide support for major field crops through various programs, with annual direct commodity payments averaging over $18 billion. These programs range from direct price support to conservation efforts. Government programs influence crop selection and marketing decisions by providing support, leading to oversupply and lower prices. This support is not unique to the United States, as other major agricultural producing countries also offer similar forms of assistance. The market equilibrium and commodity prices are influenced by various forms of support provided by agricultural producing countries. This support includes border protection, state-sanctioned monopolies, rural infrastructure development, and agricultural research. Large multinational companies like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland have an advantage due to their access to vast amounts of market information. Three key sources of market information that offset the advantage of large multinational agri-corporations are Agricultural Commodity Futures Markets, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and timely crop supply, demand, and price projections. The USDA's market information reporting process is detailed in the section \"USDA Market Information.\" Private news services, including weather information and commodity reporting, have developed to complement USDA's activities. Futures markets play a significant role in U.S. and international commodity markets, allowing for the trading of commodity contracts for potential physical delivery at a fixed price in the future. Agricultural commodity futures contracts are traded on various exchanges in the U.S. and overseas. Futures contracts are traded on commodity exchanges in the US and overseas, with detailed information published by each exchange on contract specifications. These contracts specify grade, quality, amount, and conditions for product delivery, with various product grades deliverable. The contract specifications aim to mirror cash market conditions, with trading months selected based on significance in the crop marketing year. A futures exchange facilitates open trading of commodity futures contracts. Futures exchanges provide facilities for trading commodity futures contracts openly and report market transactions to the public. Daily information on prices, volume, and open interest is published, serving as a central exchange for market information and price discovery. The reliability of price discovery depends on daily transaction volume, with thinly traded markets more susceptible to price manipulation. Futures markets are more susceptible to price manipulation when thinly traded. Distant futures contracts often have low volume. Publicly announced futures prices are crucial for seasonal market operations, allowing for forward contracting and hedging. Grain elevators use futures exchanges to hedge purchases, setting bid prices based on nearby futures contracts. Cash prices and futures contract prices are closely linked. Speculators play a crucial role in futures markets by increasing trading volume and liquidity. They help dampen extreme price volatility, allowing hedgers to buy and sell in large volumes easily. Most futures contracts are settled without actual delivery of the commodity, with the basis being the key price relationship between the local cash price and nearby futures contract prices. The basis is the difference between the cash price of a commodity at a specific location and the nearby futures contract price. It reflects transportation and carrying costs. The basis represents the difference between the cash price of a commodity at a specific location and the nearby futures contract price. As a futures contract nears expiry, carrying charges decrease, leading to convergence of cash and futures prices. The basis at delivery date reflects transportation costs. In cases of local demand exceeding supply, the basis may be lower than transport costs or even higher than futures prices, influenced by factors like ethanol plants or livestock operations. Geographic basis distributions show that local corn prices in certain regions routinely exceed nearby futures contract prices. The basis reflects the difference between cash and nearby futures prices, influenced by factors like local demand and transportation costs. Local corn prices can exceed futures prices due to strong demand from livestock operations. Full carrying charges are rarely achieved in the market, but basis movements for storable commodities are more predictable than cash or futures prices, reducing risk for producers and users. Factors influencing the basis in the futures market for grains, oilseeds, and cotton include overall supply and demand, competition with other commodities, geographical disparities, transportation issues, storage availability, quality factors, and market expectations. Price relationships between different futures contract months are known as inter-contract price spreads, with deferred contracts typically having a premium reflecting carrying charges. The premium between futures contracts reflects carrying charges, but market conditions often change, leading to price differences. Supply shortages can cause cash prices to rise relative to futures contract prices. Prices tend to rise relative to futures contract prices, and nearby futures contract prices tend to rise relative to more distant contract months. Both the basis and price spreads between nearby and deferred contracts will narrow. In cases of severe scarcity, carrying charges may disappear or become negative, resulting in an inverted market. Scarcity leads to high prices in cash and nearby futures contracts due to prioritizing the present over the future. Normal inversion often occurs between the last futures delivery month of one crop year and the first delivery month of the next crop year. The old-crop/new-crop price spread is represented by the difference between futures contracts for various crops like wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton. In 2004, there were variations in price spreads at U.S. wheat exchanges, indicating supply situations for different types of wheat. The old-crop/new-crop price spread at the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBOT) and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) for wheat was -2 to -2.5 cents per bushel, suggesting tight supply conditions. HRW and SRW wheat had less tight conditions compared to HRS wheat, which had an inverted basis of +4 cents. Protein premiums and supply differences influence market prices across time and location. USDA releases commodity market information reports regularly. The USDA releases commodity market information reports regularly, including crop and livestock production data. These reports are relied upon by commodity markets for guidance on supply and demand conditions, with private sector market news services basing their activities around USDA data releases. Market watchers often offer their own predictions ahead of major USDA reports, which can significantly impact market expectations. The USDA releases commodity market information reports regularly, which can significantly impact market expectations. The reports are closely watched by market participants and can lead to significant price movements when they deviate from expectations. The reports are released annually in December and are transmitted electronically from USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C. through state statistical offices. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) plays a key role in collecting and publishing market information. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collects and publishes reports on various U.S. agricultural activities, including crop production, livestock, and dairy. NASS estimates production based on data from farm operations and field observations, with monthly reports on harvested acreage, yield, and production for grains, oilseeds, and cotton. Other crop-related reports are released according to each crop's production cycle. NASS reports provide estimates, forecasts, and projections for crop production. Estimates are based on harvested crop yields, forecasts are based on current growing conditions, and projections extend into the future without objective supporting information. The USDA's projections for crop production are based on historical data, trade patterns, and government policies. NASS conducts surveys throughout the year to estimate planted acreage and production. The Prospective Plantings survey in March provides early indications of farmers' planting intentions. The USDA conducts surveys to estimate planted acreage and production, with the Prospective Plantings report in March providing early indications of farmers' planting intentions for the year. Actual plantings may vary due to weather or market conditions. Acreage estimates are published in the Acreage report in June, with exceptions like winter wheat. The USDA releases forecasts for winter wheat and rye planted area from January to July, with revisions in the Prospective Plantings, Acreage, and Crop Production reports. Harvested acreage estimates are based on reported acres for early harvested crops, subject to revisions in the June Acreage report. Initial estimates for later harvested crops like corn and soybeans account for abandonment and other land use. Estimates of acreage for harvest are obtained from objective yield measurement programs for various crops, with monthly revisions. Initial forecasts for yield and production are published in specific reports from May to August for different crops, with monthly updates provided until November. The USDA provides monthly updates on yield estimates for crops like cotton, corn, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. These estimates are based on objective yield surveys conducted during the growing season. Weather conditions and other factors are taken into account in forecasting prospective yield or production. Additionally, NASS publishes weekly Crop Progress reports on growing conditions from April to November. The USDA provides monthly updates on yield estimates for various crops, including cotton, corn, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. These estimates are based on objective surveys conducted during the growing season, taking into account weather conditions and other factors. Year-end estimates for acreage, yield, and production are published in reports such as the Small Grains Annual Summary and Crop Production Annual Summary. Demand for agricultural products comes from various sources, including the livestock sector and food industry. The USDA provides monthly updates on yield estimates for various crops, including cotton, corn, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. These estimates are based on objective surveys conducted during the growing season, taking into account weather conditions and other factors. Demand for agricultural products originates from a broad range of sources including the livestock sector, food and industrial processors, and foreign markets. USDA informs agricultural markets about commodity demand conditions by publishing various reports on domestic use, trade, stocks, and prices for major agricultural commodities, with the cornerstone being the monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report. This report is released simultaneously with the Crop Production report each month to incorporate new production forecasts and provide supply and demand estimates by combining U.S. and foreign market information. The USDA provides monthly updates on yield estimates for various crops, including cotton, corn, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report includes projections of the national average U.S. farm prices for major U.S. program crops and is supplemented by monthly commodity situation reports and annual data yearbooks. Domestic use of commodities is categorized into sub-categories such as feed use, seed use, and food and industrial use. Market information for various crop demands is less systematic compared to USDA crop production reports. The Grain Stocks report, published quarterly, covers a range of crops and is closely monitored for domestic demand indicators. Quarterly usage can be estimated by comparing current and previous quarter stocks. Seed demand is directly related to seed use. USDA reports provide information on feed demand, prices, and availability of substitute feeds through various reports such as the Cattle on Feed, Hogs and Pigs, and Poultry Slaughter reports. The Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook report offers economic analysis based on NASS livestock reports, while the Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin indicates grazing availability. Seed demand is directly related to plantings and is influenced by changes in crop area planted. Seed use represents a small portion of total disappearance and changes in seed demand typically do not elicit a market response. Projections of food and industrial use are stable and predictable, often using trend lines to forecast future demand levels. Agricultural products usually make up a small portion of the final cost of processed products. Changes in demand for industrial products like food items or soap are usually predictable and do not cause unexpected market price movements. Data on industrial use is gathered from surveys like the Census Bureau's survey of manufacturing industries. Industry reports and associations provide information on demand for specific products. Federal support for ethanol production has increased the industrial use of corn and sorghum. This new demand is typically recognized by the market well in advance. Export Demand is a key factor in commodity supply and price forecasts, with the 1972 Soviet Union purchases of U.S. grain leading to record-high prices. The USDA monitors U.S. agricultural trade through the weekly Export Sales report published by the Foreign Agricultural Service. The USDA monitors U.S. agricultural exports through reports like the weekly Grains Inspected for Export report and the monthly export report issued by the Census Bureau. Census Bureau data becomes the official USDA export estimate at the end of each commodity's marketing year, with a two-month lag in data release. The Export Sales and Grains Inspected for Export reports are important for monitoring commodity supplies and price forecasts. Market prices can react to differences between private forecasters' expectations and actual USDA reports. FAS also monitors international commodity market conditions through an agricultural attaches network. The USDA's FAS provides detailed market information through reports on crop production, international market conditions, and government program activity. This includes data on crop area, yield, production estimates, and government price supports. Additionally, the Risk Management Agency oversees market-relevant government program activity. The USDA's FAS monitors government-subsidized crop insurance and agricultural exports, impacting producer planting decisions and market prices. The Conservation Reserve Program removes cultivable land from production, affecting agricultural production. USDA projects season-average farm prices for major crops. The USDA projects season-average farm prices for major program crops, tightening the range of values each month until a single point estimate is reported. Market observers use the mid-point of the projected range as a reference point for comparisons. NASS releases monthly Agricultural Prices reports with average prices received for major crops at national and state levels. AMS provides a portal for price information. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides market information for agricultural commodities, including cash, barge, rail, and truck bids for grains and oilseeds at major terminal and export markets. They also monitor nearby futures contract prices, cash-to-futures basis, and recent export sales in various reports. USDA projects season-ending stocks for major program crops in the monthly WASDE report. Season-ending stocks of annually produced commodities reflect supply and demand factors during the marketing year. Expected ending stocks are used as an indicator of price outcomes, with high stocks leading to lower prices and low stocks leading to higher prices. USDA and market observers use this ratio to forecast price trends. The end-of-year stocks-to-use ratio for wheat, corn, and soybeans is crucial for maintaining a continuous grain supply. Market analysts monitor stocks approaching historically low levels to speculate on pipeline stock levels. For wheat, pipeline stocks are around 350-400 million bushels, for corn 400-500 million bushels, and for soybeans 150-200 million bushels. When USDA projections near these levels, market prices become highly sensitive to news, leading to increased price volatility. Long-run commodity demand is influenced by population and income dynamics, with demographic changes occurring slowly. Short-term price movements are rarely affected by these factors, except for exceptions like the 1997 Asian financial crisis which led to a significant decline in commodity prices. Currency exchange rates play a significant role in international trade, affecting the competitiveness of exporting countries and the demand for imports. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact commodity prices quickly, with devaluation making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. This phenomenon is not limited to agricultural commodities but applies to all goods and services traded between nations. Agricultural product markets are unique due to seasonality, derived demand, and price-inelasticity, leading to volatile prices. Production of crops in temperate-zone countries like the US follows strong seasonal patterns, with a lag in response to market signals. Production of spring-planted crops has a lag in response to market signals. Producers base planting decisions on future yields, prices, government support, and international market conditions. Agronomic factors also influence crop viability. Market conditions, supply and demand changes, and unexpected factors like weather and pests can impact agricultural prices. Demand for agricultural products comes from consumers who use raw farm commodities for various food and industrial products. Demand for agricultural products is derived from the demand for their final products, such as corn for livestock feed, wheat for bakery products, and cotton for textiles. Similarly, soybean demand is derived from soybean meal and oil. Consumer preferences for specific qualities in products trace back to decisions made in the supply chain. In the supply chain, buyers seek specific end-use characteristics in agricultural commodities like feed ingredients for livestock or baking qualities in wheat. Price premiums or discounts may develop based on these traits, leading to variations in supply and demand. This phenomenon is common in markets like wheat, rice, and other grains and oilseeds. In grain and oilseed markets like rice, corn, soybean, and barley, price-inelastic demand and supply lead to large price movements with small changes in supply. Market news can cause significant swings in farm prices and incomes due to the slow response of new supplies to price changes. In grain and oilseed markets, price changes can lead to limited short-term supply response due to low stock holdings. Producers may withhold commodities from the market when prices fall, considering factors like storage costs and expected price rebounds. Demand elasticity also plays a role in market dynamics. Demand elasticity in grain and oilseed markets reflects consumers' ability to adjust consumption based on price changes for complementary and substitute products. Factors influencing willingness to substitute include availability of alternatives, budget allocation for the commodity, and consumer preferences. Despite the small farm cost share in retail prices, changes in grain prices have minimal impact on consumer behavior and farm-level demand. Grain accounts for only a 5% share of retail food prices. Demand elasticity in grain and oilseed markets reflects consumers' ability to adjust consumption based on price changes. Despite grain accounting for only a 5% share of retail food prices, a 20% rise in wheat prices would result in only about a 1% increase in the price of a loaf of bread. Inelastic demand curves show that a shift in demand leads to a modest change in quantity supplied but a much larger increase in prices. Demand elasticity in grain and oilseed markets reflects consumers' ability to adjust consumption based on price changes. Inelastic demand curves show that a shift in demand leads to a modest change in quantity supplied but a much larger increase in prices. A sudden shortfall in supplies results in a large price change, while an unexpected increase in supply leads to a significant drop in market price. More responsive demand and supply curves are typical in higher-valued, non-agricultural markets. An outward shift in demand leads to a larger percentage change in quantity supplied compared to a smaller increase in prices. Increasing demand for grains and oilseeds by the industrial processing sector reinforces the price inelasticity of demand for agricultural commodities. Industrial users are less sensitive to price changes due to small share of agricultural commodity cost and investments in plant equipment. Feed demand for grain and protein meals, especially in cattle feeding, is more sensitive to relative feed grain prices. The Southern and Central Plains States have cattle feeders who can adjust feed rations based on changing grain prices. Wheat is a major crop grown in many countries, with the US being a leading exporter. The U.S. is a leading wheat exporter with a 25% share of world trade. The market is competitive, with sales depending on wheat variety, product characteristics, and price. The U.S. produces all major wheat classes, each with specific uses like bread making or pasta production. Local prices are determined by demand relative to supply. The U.S. wheat market is competitive, with prices determined by demand relative to supply. Factors like transportation costs, competitors supplies, and foreign demand also play a role in pricing. Wheat is the principal food grain in the U.S., with a portion used as feed grain. Export markets are important, especially for white wheat and HRS wheat classes. The more exports a class has, the more vulnerable it is to international market forces. In the U.S. wheat market, flour millers are the major users of wheat, accounting for over 70% of primary domestic wheat processing. Wheat buyers at flour mills source wheat based on location, quality attributes, and baking performance. Price premiums and discounts reflect quality differences. Other wheat processors include breakfast food, pet food, and feed manufacturers. Wheat milling by-products like bran, shorts, and middlings are used in animal feeds. Key market factors unique to the wheat market influence pricing. The U.S. wheat market structure has greater supply and demand elasticity compared to other field crops, leading to less dramatic price swings. Factors such as the confluence of food and feed markets, seasonal production differences, foreign export competitors, and government food aid programs play a role in stabilizing wheat prices. The feed potential of wheat can help prevent prices from falling too low. The feed potential of wheat can help stabilize wheat prices by introducing additional demand when prices fall too low and reducing demand when prices rise too high. U.S. wheat production is divided into winter and spring seasons, with planting periods six months apart. The potential production losses in wheat can be offset by increased spring wheat plantings, which can crowd out other crops competing for the same acreage. Additionally, Argentina and Australia, major wheat export competitors of the U.S., have the opportunity to expand planted wheat acreage in response to supply and demand circumstances. The potential for surplus production to enter agricultural markets from competing wheat exporter nations increases supply responsiveness beyond other major grains. Government export programs directed at wheat have dampened price variability. Government export programs for wheat have helped stabilize prices by introducing additional demand that offsets price declines. The price sensitivity of wheat feeding, coupled with export programs and global production distribution, plays a key role in stabilizing the U.S. wheat market prices. Corn production is less evenly distributed globally compared to wheat. Corn production is concentrated in a few countries, with the United States, China, and Brazil dominating production and trade. The U.S. is the leading corn exporter, followed by China and Argentina. Other potential exporters like Ukraine, Brazil, and South Africa have been increasing their exports since 2000. This limited pool of exporters makes international corn prices susceptible to disruptions in major exporting countries. Corn is the most widely produced feed grain in the U.S., accounting for over 90% of total feed grain production. Corn is the largest crop grown in the United States, with around 80 million acres planted annually. The majority of the U.S. corn crop is grown in the traditional Corn Belt region. Since 2000, 58% of the corn crop has been used as livestock feed, 24% processed into various products, and 18% exported. Corn must compete with other feedstuffs in the market. Feed grain markets, including corn, barley, and sorghum, are sensitive to relative prices among feed components. U.S. corn exports for livestock feed are vulnerable to availability of alternate feed sources, such as Canadian wheat converting to low-priced feed grain. This competition affects U.S. corn exports, particularly in East Asian markets like South Korea. The increasing use of corn for ethanol production in the U.S. is impacting corn exports for livestock feed, with certain livestock species better able to adjust to feed rations than others. The share of total demand attributed to industrial use, such as ethanol production, is growing, which could lead to greater price variability in the face of supply shortfalls. USDA projects that 15% of U.S. corn production will be used for ethanol production in the 2005-2006 marketing year, compared to 4% in 1990/1991 and 6% in 2000/01. Continued growth in corn-based ethanol production without a corresponding increase in corn production will support prices. Ethanol production without a growth in corn production may raise prices and impact U.S. corn in feed and export markets. Rice is a key food staple globally, with Asian production dominating. The U.S. has a small share of global rice production but exports nearly half of its production, ranking among top rice exporting nations. The United States has a marketing year for rice from August 1 to July 31, with domestic production using over half of the crop. U.S. rice is used for table rice, snacks, ready-to-eat meals, and brewing. Only 6% of global rice production enters world markets, making the international rice market sensitive to production shortfalls. The United States produces and exports both long grain (indica) and short grain (japonica) types of rice, each with specific cooking qualities. Consumers have strict preferences for one type over the other. Rice quality is associated with polishing and whiteness of the grain, which depends on milling infrastructure. The U.S. rice industry competes in international markets based on these attributes. Parboiling rice is a market advantage for the U.S. rice industry in international markets, preferred by countries like Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Nigeria. Cotton is a significant textile fiber globally, with the U.S., China, and India being major producers and exporters. The U.S. leads in raw cotton exports, accounting for over one-third of global trade. The U.S. textile industry has been declining, leading to increased reliance on international markets for cotton sales. Cotton competes with various fibers in both domestic and international markets, with polyester being its main competitor. The phaseout of the Multifiber Arrangement has been reshaping world textile and cotton markets. The Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) and its predecessor agreements influenced world textile and clothing trade patterns for nearly 50 years, protecting U.S. and EU producers but raising prices and reducing consumption. The elimination of the MFA in 2004 is reducing clothing prices in the U.S. and EU, shifting industrial demand for cotton to China, India, and Pakistan. World cotton consumption has accelerated since 1999, driven by economic growth in developing Asia. Income growth and technical change are expected to have a greater impact on world cotton consumption than the elimination of the MFA. Government programs like Step-2 payments have facilitated domestic consumption and exports of U.S. cotton. However, a ruling in 2004 against certain features of the U.S. cotton program by the WTO may lead to changes with potential market consequences. The U.S. has already announced adjustments to the export credit guarantee program to comply with the ruling, and there is a proposal to eliminate Step-2 user payments in legislation pending conference action. The potential reduction in U.S. cotton exports due to changes in export credit guarantees and the elimination of Step-2 user payments could lower domestic market prices. International pressure at the WTO may lead to further changes in U.S. cotton subsidies. The demand for oilseeds is driven by edible oils and protein meals, with various oil-bearing crops like canola and sunflowerseed in the global market. Processed soybeans are the largest source of protein feed and vegetable oil globally, with major producers being the United States, Brazil, China, and Argentina. These countries dominate soybean production and trade, accounting for nearly 90% of global production since 2000. The United States, Brazil, and Argentina dominate world soybean trade, accounting for 92% of exports since 2000. The U.S. is the leading soybean producer and exporter, with soybeans making up 90% of total oilseed production. Soybean oil and meal are significant components of U.S. vegetable oil consumption and protein meal consumption, respectively. Soybean meal and soybean oil are key components of global vegetable oil production and livestock feeds. Brazil and Argentina have seen significant growth in soybean output and exports, now accounting for half of the world market. Palm oil from tropical regions is also becoming a major player in the vegetable oil trade. The rapid growth in Southeast Asian palm oil output is projected to surpass soybean oil's top ranking in the global vegetable oil production and trade market. Key market factors affecting oilseeds include market conditions in feed-grain and edible oil sectors, as well as foreign import demand based on countries' domestic oilseed output and consumption. Indonesia and Malaysia are leading palm oil producers with untapped territory for further expansion of plantations. When importing oilseeds, the ratio of oil to meal yield must be considered, along with protein and fiber content. Soybean meal is the most valuable component, making up 50%-75% of its value. High-fiber meals are better for ruminants. Soybean crushers must consider oil and meal yields, protein and fiber content when processing. Soybean crushers make processing decisions based on the gross soybean processing margin, which determines when to commit to buying soybeans, processing them, and selling soybean meal and oil. Trade in whole oilseeds like soybeans is relatively unrestricted, but vegetable oils and oilseed meals face higher tariffs. Successful completion of the on-going Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations could reduce import tariffs and quantitative restrictions to global oilseed product markets, leading to increased demand. China and India's rapid economic growth has boosted their domestic food consumption, with China becoming the world's leading soybean importer. The EU, self-sufficient in vegetable oil production, remains the world's largest importer of soybean meal and second-largest importer of soybeans. Changes in agricultural and trade policies in these countries have significantly impacted world oilseed markets. The Euronext is a synthesis of stock markets within the European Union, including the previous London and Paris Commodity Futures Exchanges. Major Agricultural Commodity Futures Contracts are listed in the table with contract months specified. The MGE introduced a durum futures contract in 1998 but ended it in 2003 due to low volume. Cash settlement only, no physical delivery of the commodity is accepted. For 2004, the April and June contract months are available. In 2004, the April and June contract months are available for major agricultural commodity futures contracts. Season-average prices and supply-and-use balances are calculated for a crop's marketing year, which spans over two different calendar years. The specific release dates of USDA reports in 2006 can be found in a calendar of 2006 release dates. The USDA reports in 2006 have specific release dates listed in a calendar. The terms estimate, forecast, and projection have distinct meanings in these reports. The preliminary U.S. S&U projections use various methods to derive harvested area for spring-planted crops.
