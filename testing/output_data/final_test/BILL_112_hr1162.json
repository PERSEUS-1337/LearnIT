The Act aims to resolve a dispute over Reservation boundaries near the Quillayute River, clarify public access to Olympic National Park lands, provide land to the Quileute Tribe for housing and schools, adjust wilderness boundaries for tsunami and flood protection, and grant the Tribe access through land conveyance. The Act redesignates certain Federal wilderness land in Olympic National Park, no longer designated as wilderness, to grant the Quileute Tribe access to land outside of tsunami and flood zones for housing and schools.

The Secretary will adjust boundaries and conduct a survey to define the Reservation, Park, and adjacent Federal lands along the Quillayute River. The Secretary will take non-Federal land into trust for the Tribe, totaling 184 acres as \"Eastern Lands\", after an environmental hazard assessment. The Map will be available for public inspection and will show any non-Federal land owned by the Tribe placed in trust. The Secretary will submit a revised map to Congress depicting the Federal and non-Federal land taken into trust for the Tribe, along with the actual boundaries of the Park as modified by the land conveyance.
