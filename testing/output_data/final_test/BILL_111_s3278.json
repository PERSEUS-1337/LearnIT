    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Meth Project Prevention Campaign Grant Program Act of 2010\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that methamphetamine is a significant drug threat in the United States, leading to increased crime, identity theft, and the rise of methamphetamine laboratories. This poses dangers in terms of toxicity, environmental damage, violence, and strains law enforcement and local government resources. Methamphetamine poses significant risks to teens, with a high percentage believing it is easy to obtain and low risk to try. The economic burden in the US is estimated to be between $16.2 billion and $48.3 billion annually, leading to increased government and individual expenditures on treatment and social issues. The estimated annual cost of methamphetamine-related crime in the United States is $4.2 billion, with no specific pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine dependence. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources for the Department of Justice to implement the Meth Project Prevention Campaign in States with a critical methamphetamine problem, focusing on community outreach programs to educate youth on the risks of methamphetamine use. The Meth Project Prevention Campaign Grant Program is established under Section 3 of the Act to provide resources for community outreach programs in States with a critical methamphetamine problem, focusing on educating youth about the risks of methamphetamine use. The Attorney General may grant up to $2,000,000 per year to eligible entities for the Meth Project Prevention Campaign aimed at teenagers. Funds can be used for producing advertisements and educational materials, as well as acquiring ad placements. The Meth Project Prevention Campaign includes community outreach, benchmark studies, surveys, and qualitative research to develop and test messaging effectiveness for methamphetamine education. An eligible entity receiving a grant must conduct a statewide benchmark survey at the beginning of the campaign to capture attitudes and behaviors related to methamphetamine use. The eligible entity receiving a grant must conduct periodic follow-up studies to track changes in attitudes and behaviors related to methamphetamine for the development of prevention advertising and outreach activities directed at teens. Application for the grant must be submitted to the Attorney General as per specified requirements. Each application for the grant must include a plan for a Meth Project Prevention Campaign with specific strategies for youth, and assurance of consultation with relevant agencies. The Attorney General prioritizes grants for entities with widespread methamphetamine use, a full-time executive director, and an organizational model. The grant application must have an organizational model with a State-specific advisory council, access to licensed media copy, matching costs of paid media with no-cost advertising, and a history of raising private funding. The Federal share of the grant cost is limited to 50%, with the non-Federal share allowed in cash or in-kind. Reports to Congress are required within 120 days after the last activity. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 120 days after each fiscal year detailing activities and assessments of grants made under this section. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2011-2014 to carry out this section."
