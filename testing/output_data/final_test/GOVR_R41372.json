    "content": "The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 leaves insurance regulation to individual states. Prior to the financial crisis, some Members of Congress proposed federalizing insurance regulation, but no legislation advanced. The debate on federal involvement in insurance regulation shifted after the crisis, especially with the involvement of AIG. The financial crisis highlighted failures in the regulatory structure, leading to calls for increased oversight and systemic risk regulation. Despite overall good performance, there were significant failures in the insurance industry, particularly with bond insurers. This has sparked debates on federal oversight of insurance, especially after the involvement of AIG in the crisis. The financial crisis exposed failures in the insurance industry, particularly with bond insurers like AIG. The crisis led to downgrades in credit ratings, causing ripple effects in the municipal bond markets. Calls for increased oversight and systemic risk regulation followed. AIG, a global giant in the insurance industry, faced a significant failure in mid-September 2008. To avoid bankruptcy, AIG sought over $100 billion in assistance from the Federal Reserve, giving up 79.9% of its equity. Subsequent restructurings included up to $69.8 billion from the U.S. Treasury's TARP program. AIG is now selling off parts of its business to repay the government. The regulatory oversight of insurers' solvency is crucial to prevent such failures. The failure of AIG in 2008 highlighted the importance of insurance regulators ensuring solvency. AIG's complex structure involved state-chartered subsidiaries overseen by state regulators and a federally regulated holding company overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The losses that led to AIG's downfall came from derivatives and securities lending operations overseen by OTS. There were debates over the sufficiency of regulatory authority in overseeing such a complex company. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury to oversee the insurance industry and coordinate policy related to international agreements. FIO has the authority to preempt state laws that conflict with these agreements. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has the authority to preempt state laws and regulations that conflict with international agreements, but this authority is limited. It can only apply when the state measure results in less favorable treatment of a non-U.S. insurer compared to a U.S. insurer and is inconsistent with a written international agreement on prudential measures. FIO's preemption authority does not extend to state measures on rates, premiums, underwriting, sales practices, coverage requirements, or antitrust laws. FIO's monitoring function includes gathering information from public and private sources, with subpoena power if necessary. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection within the Federal Reserve, granting it significant budgetary independence. The bureau's director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. While consumer protection issues related to insurance products that are also considered securities fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission's jurisdiction, other insurance consumer protection matters remain within state oversight. Variable annuities, classified as securities products, are an exception to state regulation of insurance products. In 2008, the SEC adopted Rule 151A to expand oversight to fixed indexed annuities, sparking controversy. Legislation was introduced to overturn the rule, but it was not included in H.R. 4173 or S. 3217. Senator Tom Harkin proposed an amendment to add the legislation to S. 3217, but it was not considered. The conference committee agreed to an amendment by Senator Harkin in Section 989J of the act, aimed at returning indexed annuities solely to state oversight. The exemption from SEC oversight in Section 989J depends on meeting certain consumer protection standards. Section 913 of the act may affect insurance producers selling security products by authorizing the SEC to establish a fiduciary duty for broker-dealers giving personalized investment advice. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to harmonize standards for broker-dealers and investment advisers, potentially requiring agents selling securities products to meet a fiduciary duty. The Act also includes systemic risk provisions that impact the insurance industry through oversight of systemically significant firms. Insurers deemed systemically significant by the Financial Stability Oversight Council will be subject to Federal Reserve oversight and higher prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 619, known as the \"Volcker Rule,\" imposes restrictions on proprietary trading by banking entities, potentially affecting insurers with banking subsidiaries. An exemption exists for trading by regulated insurance companies directly engaged in insurance business for the company's general account. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 619, known as the \"Volcker Rule,\" imposes restrictions on proprietary trading by banking entities, potentially affecting insurers with banking subsidiaries. Insurers deemed systemically significant by the Financial Stability Oversight Council will be subject to Federal Reserve oversight and higher prudential standards. Any insurance subsidiaries of a financial company subject to the special resolution regime would not be subject to this regime. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 619, known as the \"Volcker Rule,\" imposes restrictions on proprietary trading by banking entities. The Act does not have a pre-funded resolution mechanism for systemically significant financial firms. The FDIC imposes assessments on financial companies with over $50 billion in assets to fund the resolution of a failed firm. Title V, Subtitle B of the Act includes similar language as H.R. 2571 / S. 1361. The 109th and 110th Congresses introduced bills that passed the House but not the Senate, addressing insurance regulatory issues. The legislation harmonizes and reduces regulation of nonadmitted insurance, giving sole authority to the \"home state\" for regulation and tax collection. It preempts conflicting state laws on surplus lines eligibility, implements federal standards for accessing surplus lines insurance, and allows for reinsurance. The legislation harmonizes insurance regulation, giving sole authority to the \"home state\" for nonadmitted insurance. It implements federal standards for accessing surplus lines insurance and allows for reinsurance transactions."
