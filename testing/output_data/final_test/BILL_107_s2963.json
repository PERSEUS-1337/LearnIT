The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to establish a Mitigation Tracking System for water resources projects. This system will track the quantity and type of wetland and other habitats for each project and permit issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Mitigation Tracking System established by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 will record information on wetland and habitat impacts, required mitigation, completed mitigation, and monitoring status for projects and permits. The system will organize data by watershed, project, permit application, and zip code.
