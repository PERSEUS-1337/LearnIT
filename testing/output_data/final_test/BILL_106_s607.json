    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999\". The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 is amended to emphasize the importance of geologic map information for sustainable development of natural resources. Advances in technology have made geologic map databases crucial for land and resource management. The definition of geologic mapping now includes surficial and bedrock deposits. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 is amended to define key terms related to the geologic mapping program, including the education, Federal, and State components. Section 4 of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 (43 U.S.C. 31c) is amended to include national priorities and standards for the geologic mapping program. This involves developing a 5-year strategic plan within 1 year of enactment. The National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999 amends Section 4 of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 to establish new deadlines for program implementation. The National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999 amended the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 to set new deadlines for program implementation, including the coordination and establishment of a Federal geologic mapping component. The National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999 amended the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 to establish a Federal geologic mapping component with mapping priorities based on national requirements for geologic map information in vital areas of the United States. The Federal geologic mapping component focuses on interdisciplinary studies that enhance geologic mapping, including establishing a national geologic map database and implementing cost-effective digital methods for data acquisition. The Federal geologic mapping component focuses on interdisciplinary studies including digital methods for data acquisition, analysis, and dissemination of geologic map information, paleontologic and geochronologic investigations for understanding the age and history of geologic map units, and geophysical investigations for mapping the physical characteristics and distribution of geologic materials and structures. The State geologic mapping program aims to establish the geologic framework of areas important for individual States' welfare, including economic, social, environmental, and scientific aspects. Investigations involve analyzing materials, structures, and geochemistry to characterize geologic map units, with results contributing to national databases. The State geologic mapping program determines mapping priorities based on State requirements for geologic map information in areas of need and integrates federal and state efforts. The national panel integrates State and Federal mapping priorities, limiting the use of funds for indirect charges. The Federal share of State mapping costs should not exceed 50 percent. The education component of the geologic mapping program is outlined. The geologic mapping program includes an education component for training geologic mappers, focusing on broad education in geologic mapping and field analysis through field studies. It also aims to develop academic programs teaching fundamental principles of geologic mapping and field analysis, with investigations integrated with the Federal and State components. The education component of the geologic mapping program aims to train mappers and develop academic programs integrated with the Federal and State components. Federal funds for education activities should not exceed 50% of the total cost, with restrictions on indirect expenses. SEC. 5 of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 is amended to update timelines and references in the Advisory Committee. SEC. 6 introduces a new Geologic Mapping Program 5-Year Plan. The Secretary will prepare a 5-year plan for the geologic mapping program with input from the advisory committee, identifying priorities and management structure. The plan will outline the Survey's role in developing a national geologic mapping program that meets Federal and State needs, as well as the responsibilities of State geological surveys. The nationwide geologic mapping program will include mechanisms for identifying short- and long-term priorities for each component, responding to Federal mission requirements, critical scientific problems, and shared Federal and State needs for geologic maps. The nationwide geologic mapping program includes mechanisms for identifying priorities for Federal and State needs for geologic maps, responding to specific intrastate and interstate requirements, and addressing mission requirements. The nationwide geologic mapping program includes mechanisms for adopting scientific and technical mapping standards, ensuring uniformity and quality of map products, and monitoring inventory to avoid redundancy. SEC. 7 of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 is amended to establish the National Geologic Map Database. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 is amended to establish a national geologic map database that serves as a catalog and archive for federal and state geologic map holdings, including maps, databases, and other relevant data. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 is amended to require the Secretary to submit a biennial report on the national geologic mapping program's status, progress in developing the national geologic map database, and any recommendations for legislative action. Additionally, the Act authorizes appropriations for these purposes. Authorization of appropriations for the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 includes specific amounts for fiscal years 1999 to 2005, with varying allocations for different components."
