    "title": "SB 465",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7021 allows the board to enter into agreements with other agencies to access relevant information for public protection. Section 7071.18 mandates licensees to report felony convictions or other crimes related to their contractor duties to the registrar within 90 days. The board will consult with stakeholders to study construction defect claims for rental units and report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018. The study will determine if regulations requiring licensees to report judgments, arbitration awards, or settlements would enhance public protection. Participation is voluntary, and the study will include criteria for differentiating settlements, identifying licensees for enforcement actions, and separating subcontractors from general contractors. The board will submit a report to the Legislature regarding criteria for identifying licensees subject to enforcement actions, including separating subcontractors from general contractors and limiting reporting to settlements from construction defects resulting in death or injury. The California Building Standards Commission's working group will submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018, on recent exterior elevated element failures in California, with findings and recommendations for statutory or Building Standards Code changes. Records exempt from public disclosure under the California Public Records Act will remain confidential. The working group will review documents and reports on exterior elevated element failures in California to make recommendations for proposed building standards. Technical expertise will be sought from various representatives for this purpose. The Legislature adds Section 7071.18 to the Business and Professions Code, limiting public access to meetings and writings of public officials. This is in accordance with the California Constitution to protect certain interests. The new section added to the Business and Professions Code limits public access to certain records shared with the Contractors\u2019 State License Board, balancing public access with the need for private information to be shared for regulatory purposes."
