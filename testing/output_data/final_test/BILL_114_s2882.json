    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act, known as the \"Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016,\" defines key terms such as 2015 ozone standards, Administrator, best available control technology, lowest achievable emission rate, and national ambient air quality standard. The \"national ambient air quality standard\" is a standard set under the Clean Air Act. A \"preconstruction permit\" is required for the construction or modification of a major emitting facility or source, issued by the Administrator or a permitting authority. SEC. 3. FACILITATING STATE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING OZONE STANDARDS. Designations for the 2015 ozone standards must be submitted by each State Governor by October 26, 2024, and finalized by the Administrator by October 26, 2025. State implementation plans for the 2015 ozone standards must be submitted by each State to the Administrator by October 26, 2026. The 2015 ozone standards do not apply to preconstruction permit applications deemed complete before the final designations are issued. The 2015 ozone standards do not apply to preconstruction permit applications deemed complete before the final designations are issued. The obligation to install best available control technology and lowest achievable emission rate technology remains, and States have the authority to impose more stringent emissions requirements. States have the authority to impose more stringent emissions requirements than the Federal national ambient air quality standards. SEC. 4. FACILITATING STATE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. Amendment to the Clean Air Act regarding technological feasibility in setting air quality standards. The Clean Air Act is amended to consider technological feasibility in setting air quality standards and establishes a 10-year cycle for reviewing national ambient air quality standards. The Clean Air Act prohibits the completion of ozone criteria review or proposing revisions before October 26, 2025. Additionally, it requires the Administrator to consider advice from a scientific review committee before establishing or revising national ambient air quality standards. The Clean Air Act mandates the Administrator to seek advice from a scientific review committee on potential adverse effects of strategies for achieving national air quality standards. Additionally, it includes a provision for timely issuance of implementing regulations and guidance, defining terms like 'best available control technology'. The term 'preconstruction permit' is defined as a permit required for the construction or modification of a major emitting facility or source, including permits issued by the Administrator or a permitting authority. In finalizing national ambient air quality standards, the Administrator must also publish regulations and guidance for implementation to assist States, permitting authorities, and permit applicants. This includes information on submitting and reviewing preconstruction permit applications under the new or revised standards. When finalizing national ambient air quality standards, the Administrator must publish regulations and guidance for implementation. This includes rules for reviewing preconstruction permit applications under the new standards. The new standards do not apply until final regulations and guidance are published. The Clean Air Act is amended to eliminate certain obligations for preconstruction permit applicants and limit the authority of State, local, or tribal permitting authorities to impose stricter emissions requirements than Federal standards. Additionally, contingency measures for extreme ozone nonattainment areas are specified. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify contingency measures for extreme ozone nonattainment areas, eliminating certain obligations for preconstruction permit applicants and limiting the authority of State, local, or tribal permitting authorities to impose stricter emissions requirements than Federal standards. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify contingency measures for extreme ozone nonattainment areas, including adding requirements for technological achievability and economic feasibility in certain subsections. (g) Plan Revisions for Milestones for Particulate Matter Nonattainment Areas.--Section 189(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act is amended to consider technological achievability and economic feasibility in redesignated attainment milestones.\n(h) Exceptional Events.--The definition of \"exceptional event\" in the Clean Air Act is revised to exclude ordinarily occurring stagnation of air masses. The Administrator, in consultation with States, must report on emissions from foreign sources impacting air quality standards within 2 years of this Act. This includes emissions from sources outside North America affecting designations of areas under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator must report on emissions from foreign sources impacting air quality standards within 2 years of this Act, including emissions from sources outside North America affecting designations of areas under the Clean Air Act. The report should include the procedures and timelines for handling petitions under section 179B of the Clean Air Act, the total number of petitions received, dates of submission and final disposition, and any recommended statutory changes for more efficient review and disposition of petitions."
