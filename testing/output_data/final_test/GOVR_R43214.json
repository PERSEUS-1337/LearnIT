    "content": "The FMLA, enacted in 1993, requires covered employers to provide eligible employees with job-protected leave, including regular leave and military family leave. Eligible employees must have worked for at least 12 months and 1,250 hours in the preceding year. The FMLA covers private employers with at least 50 employees for 20 weeks and public employers regardless of employee count. After returning from FMLA leave, employees generally have the right to return to the same, or an equivalent, job with the same pay, benefits, and working conditions. FMLA leave is generally unpaid but can be substituted with paid leave. Employers must maintain the employee's group health insurance coverage while on FMLA leave. Eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period. An eligible employee can take up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave for various reasons, including caring for a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition, or due to their own health condition. The leave can be continuous or intermittent, and employers must allow for part-time work if needed. Additionally, eligible employees can take military family leave for qualifying exigencies. Employees can take up to 12 weeks of leave for qualifying exigencies related to a family member's deployment or active duty. They can also take up to 26 weeks of military caregiver leave in a 12-month period. A covered servicemember's family member can take military caregiver leave to care for a servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Special FMLA rules apply to airline crew members, with eligibility based on hours worked. The proposal aims to expand or restrict employee eligibility for FMLA leave, including eliminating the 1,250-hour work requirement and narrowing the definition of a serious health condition. Other proposals suggest expanding employer coverage and allowing leave to care for more family members. This analysis helps Congress evaluate the impact of these proposals on FMLA leave availability. Data from two household surveys, the ASEC supplement to the CPS and a 2012 DOL employee survey, are analyzed to estimate the number of employees eligible for FMLA leave and examine the use of leave for FMLA-related reasons. The ASEC supplement data from 1993 to 2011 is used to determine eligibility based on hours worked, while the 2012 DOL survey looks at leave usage by eligible employees. The ASEC supplement data is used to categorize employees as potentially eligible for FMLA leave if they worked 1,250 hours or more in the previous year for an employer with 50 or more employees. However, the supplement does not directly ask about FMLA eligibility, and there are limitations to this methodology. Eligibility for FMLA leave requires working 1,250 hours for at least 12 months with the current employer. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must work for an employer with at least 50 employees within 75 miles of their worksite. The ASEC supplement data, starting in 2010, provides information on the number of employees working for employers with 50 or more employees. Eligibility is based on working 1,250 hours in the 12 months before FMLA leave, regardless of working for multiple employers or the duration of employment with the current employer. The ASEC supplement data, starting in 2010, provides information on the number of employees working for employers with 50 or more employees. Changes in the percentage of employees working for larger firms could impact estimates of FMLA eligibility. For example, from 2000 to 2010, the percentage of private sector employees working for firms with 50 or more employees increased from 70.4% to 71.3%. The ASEC supplement data before 2010 shows the number of employees working for employers with 50 or more employees, impacting FMLA eligibility estimates. The 2012 DOL survey compares FMLA leave usage among eligible and ineligible employees aged 18 and over. The survey asked about family or medical leave in the past year, with a smaller sample size than the ASEC supplement, limiting comparisons. Employees were categorized as \"may be eligible\" for FMLA leave if employed at a worksite with at least 50 workers. Demographic, social, and economic changes can impact FMLA eligibility for employees who have worked for an employer for 12 consecutive months and at least 1,250 hours in the past year. Factors like population growth, aging population, and changes in labor force participation rates can affect eligibility. The rate of FMLA eligibility for employees has fluctuated over the years, with a decrease in the percentage of employees working 1,250 hours or more from 2006 to 2011. Economic expansions and recessions can impact employment and hours worked, affecting the number of employees eligible for FMLA leave. The economic expansion of the 1990s was the longest since the 19th century, with more people working in 2000 than in 1993. The recession from 2007 to 2009 was the longest since the Great Depression, leading to a decrease in the number of jobs. The percentage of employees eligible for FMLA leave also decreased from 2006 to 2011. The average number of hours worked decreased from 34.3 in 2000 to 33.4 in 2010. The percentage of employees working full-time, year-round dropped from 70.4% in 2006 to 67.4% in 2011. Among employees taking medical leave, 56.6% did so for their own illness. The percentage of eligible employees who were married decreased from 61.9% to 58.6% from 1993 to 2011. The percentage of eligible employees who had never been married increased by 3.0 percentage points (from 22.8% to 25.8%). The percentage of employees eligible for FMLA leave with a spouse has fallen. Among employees who may have been eligible for FMLA leave, the percentage who had children under the age of 18 fell by 5.4 percentage points (from 26.8% to 21.5%). Data from the ASEC supplement for 2011 is used to compare employees eligible for leave. The 2012 DOL employee survey provides estimates of employees who took leave for FMLA-related reasons. Table 1 displays estimated percentages of employees eligible or ineligible for FMLA leave based on hours worked and employer size. Eligible employees worked at least 1,250 hours for an employer with 50 or more employees, while ineligible employees worked fewer hours or for smaller employers. The table provides percentage calculations for both eligible and ineligible employees. Based on data from the 2012 DOL employee survey, Table 2 shows the percentage of employees who used leave in the past year for FMLA-related reasons, categorized by eligibility. Eligible employees met specific criteria such as working at a site with 50+ employees within 75 miles, 12+ months with the same employer, and 1,250+ hours worked in the past year. The estimates in Table 1 and Table 2 are for wage and salary workers aged 18 and over in the private and public sectors, excluding self-employed workers. The data from the 2012 DOL employee survey and ASEC supplement indicate that a majority of wage and salary employees are eligible for FMLA leave. In 2011, an estimated 80.9 million employees (56.5%) may have been eligible for FMLA leave, while 62.3 million (43.5%) were likely ineligible. Approximately 59.2% of employees were eligible for FMLA leave according to the DOL survey. 15.9% of eligible employees took FMLA leave in the past. Among employees eligible for FMLA leave, 17.9% of women and 14.1% of men took leave in the past year. Employees between the ages of 34 and 49 were more likely than younger or older workers to be eligible for FMLA leave. Older workers were more likely to take leave for FMLA-related reasons. Among workers likely eligible for FMLA leave, older workers were more likely to have taken leave in the past year compared to younger workers. Marital status also played a role, with married workers being more likely to be eligible for leave. Among employees likely eligible for leave, married workers were more likely than unmarried workers to have taken leave in the past year. This difference may be due to one spouse being available to care for a child. In households with children under 18, approximately 20.4% of employees had children. Among employees with children under 18, around 60.5% may have been eligible for FMLA leave. Married employees and those who were widowed, divorced, or separated were more likely to be eligible compared to those who had never been married. Employees who had never been married represented a higher proportion of those likely ineligible for leave. In the past year, employees with children were more likely to have taken FMLA-related leave compared to those without children. Among employees with children under 18, around 60.5% may have been eligible for FMLA leave. African American employees were more likely than white employees to have been eligible for leave. Public sector employees are more likely than private sector employees to be eligible for leave. Among employees eligible for FMLA leave, non-Hispanic employees were more likely than Hispanics to qualify (57.6% vs. 50.4%). Employees with higher education levels, such as post-graduate or Bachelor's degrees, were more likely to be eligible for leave compared to those with lower education levels. Among employees eligible for FMLA leave, those with higher education levels were more likely to qualify. Employees with less than a high school diploma were the least likely to be eligible for leave, but more likely to have taken leave in the past year compared to other workers. In both eligible and ineligible groups, employees with some college education were more likely to take leave. Private and public sector employees were also analyzed, with a majority of those who may have been eligible for leave. Employees with advanced degrees were more likely to be eligible for FMLA leave. Public sector employees, including federal, state, and local government workers, had higher eligibility rates compared to those in the private sector. Industries such as Public Administration, Mining, Information, and Manufacturing had above-average percentages of employees eligible for FMLA leave. Employees in certain industries and occupations were more likely to be eligible for FMLA leave. Industries with high percentages of eligible employees included Information, Manufacturing, Educational Services, Transportation and Utilities, Financial Activities, and Health Services. On the other hand, industries like Wholesale and Retail Trade, Professional and Business Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Social Assistance, Construction, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting, and Other Services had below-average percentages of eligible employees. Similarly, occupations such as Professional and Related, Management, Business, and Financial, and Production had higher percentages of eligible employees compared to other occupations. Employees in certain industries and occupations were more likely to be eligible for FMLA leave. Occupations with lower shares of eligible employees included Sales, Services, Construction, and Farming. The percentage of employees eligible for leave increases with earnings, with higher family incomes more likely to have taken leave in the past year. The FMLA was enacted in 1993 in response to changes in the U.S. workforce and family structure. It aimed to provide job-protected family or medical leave for employees. Some policymakers question if this is a federal government role or should be left to the states. Employees with lower incomes were more likely to take leave, regardless of eligibility. Some policymakers question if family and medical leave should be mandated by the federal government or left to the states, individual employees, or collective bargaining. Proposed amendments to the FMLA aim to expand employee coverage by making it easier to qualify for leave, caring for more family members, and including employees of smaller employers. Suggestions also include narrowing the definition of a serious health condition or limiting intermittent leave for chronic health conditions. Data from the 2012 DOL employee survey is used in this discussion. The FMLA aims to help employees balance work and family life. Proposals to expand employee eligibility include eliminating the 1,250-hour work requirement, prorating leave based on hours worked, reducing the 12-month employment requirement, and lowering the employee threshold to less than 50 employees within 75 miles. Other suggestions involve allowing leave for additional family care. Expanding FMLA eligibility to include care for additional family members like grandparents, grandchildren, domestic partners, and same-sex spouses may increase employer costs and require adjustments to work schedules. Employers may need to hire more workers or pay overtime to maintain productivity. Providing FMLA leave to more employees could also lead to increased health insurance costs for employers and create an incentive to hire more part-time workers. Some proposals to amend the FMLA would expand reasons for leave, including parental leave for attending parent-teacher conferences, participating in children's activities, and routine medical appointments. Data from a 2012 DOL survey shows the percentage of employers offering parental leave. Table 3 displays the percentage of worksites offering parental leave, with a focus on FMLA-eligible employers. Some policymakers advocate for paid leave legislation separate from FMLA amendments. Various approaches have been suggested to provide paid time off for FMLA-covered reasons. Several methods have been proposed to provide paid leave for eligible employees, including a paid sick leave benefit, a payroll tax for a wage-replacement program, a grant program for family-related leave, and amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to require overtime premium or compensatory time for extra hours worked. Concerns may arise regarding the requirement for employers to provide paid leave, as many already offer such benefits. Some employers may oppose federal mandates for paid sick leave, while some employees may resist a payroll tax to fund such programs. Concerns exist about the potential impact on employer costs and the preference for paid leave to be a state, rather than federal, issue. Some argue that government-required paid leave should be a state issue or negotiated during collective bargaining. Policymakers may prefer incentives over mandates for employers to provide leave. Expanding FMLA coverage to include smaller employers has been suggested to make leave more accessible. Expanding FMLA coverage to smaller employers may increase employee eligibility for leave, with concerns about smaller employers having less flexibility to adjust to absences. Administration of FMLA leave has raised concerns about the burden on smaller employers. Some argue that FMLA regulations have expanded beyond Congress's intent, causing administrative burdens on employers. A 2012 DOL survey found that 65.5% of covered employers found it easy to comply with FMLA, while 75.3% of FMLA-eligible employers reported the same. Among all employers, 6.1% found it difficult to comply with the FMLA, compared to 14.6% of employers with FMLA-eligible employees. Regulations define a serious health condition as an illness, injury, or mental/physical condition requiring inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. The Department of Labor (DOL) regulations have broadened the definition of a serious health condition under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). This includes chronic conditions requiring regular treatment, long-term incapacity, and multiple treatments that would result in more than three consecutive days of incapacity without medical intervention. Some critics argue that these regulations go beyond the original intent of the law. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports reforms of the FMLA to clarify that it does not cover minor ailments like the common cold. SHRM members report misuse of medical leave for non-serious health conditions, prompting proposed changes to the FMLA. Some suggest amending the FMLA to exclude brief illnesses from being considered serious health conditions. Others argue that an overnight hospital stay should be a clear indicator of a serious health condition. The Deputy Administrator of the DOL's Wage and Hour Division expressed concerns about narrowing the definition of serious health conditions, citing the example of the flu as a nonserious condition that can still warrant FMLA leave. The flu, often used as an example of a nonserious condition for FMLA leave, can still be deadly, killing tens of thousands yearly. Employers find it challenging to determine if a health condition is serious, with some suspecting misuse of FMLA leave. Most recent leave taken by employees required doctor's care, with nearly half needing an overnight hospital stay. Intermittent FMLA leave is seen as disruptive and hard to administer by some. Intermittent FMLA leave can be difficult for employers to manage and may lead to misuse. Employers must account for FMLA leave in small increments, with eligible employees taking leave multiple times for the same condition. According to a 2007 SHRM report, tracking intermittent leave is the most challenging aspect of FMLA administration for HR professionals. A 2012 DOL survey found that dealing with planned intermittent leave was difficult for 31.3% of employers, while 50.9% struggled with unplanned intermittent leave. Among FMLA-eligible employees, 75.9% of recent absences were for six days or more, compared to 73.1% among ineligible employees. Additionally, 2.5% of recent absences for eligible employees were for a day or less, compared to 0.0% for ineligible employees. Dealing with unplanned intermittent leave can be challenging for employers, with 59.3% finding it difficult. Suggestions to reduce the burden include increasing the minimum increment of leave, although this could penalize employees needing short absences. Concerns have also been raised about the impact of FMLA on co-workers filling in for absent employees, especially if the leave is intermittent or prolonged. Expanding FMLA leave could further affect the burden on co-workers. Expanding FMLA leave could increase the burden on co-workers, as reported by HR professionals. When employees take intermittent leave, morale problems may arise among co-workers who have to cover for them. Employers commonly assign work temporarily to other employees when someone is on leave for a week or more. The 2012 DOL employee survey found that 83.3% of employees assigned work to others, while 6.3% hired temporary workers. Responses to how work changed when coworkers took leave were similar for all employees and FMLA-eligible employees. Among all employees, 51.0% reported no change, 34.1% took on more duties, 26.0% worked more hours, and 25.7% had different responsibilities. For FMLA-eligible employees, 53.3% reported no change, 34.3% took on more duties, 24.5% worked more hours, and 25.7% had different responsibilities. This appendix provides details on the data and methodology used in the report, which utilized data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The ASEC supplement is a survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the BLS, representative of the civilian population. It includes Armed Forces members in civilian housing but excludes those in institutions. Approximately 76,000 households are interviewed, with data for employees ages 18 and over. In 2011, the survey included 91,349 wage and salary workers, representing 143.2 million workers when weighted for the U.S. population. The ASEC supplement collects data on the longest job held by wage and salary workers in the previous year, including information on sector, occupation, and industry. Job growth in Health Services accounted for a significant portion of the increase in jobs in the Educational and Health Services industry from 1993 to 2011. The industry is further divided into Health Services, Educational Services, and Social Assistance. Data on the number of weeks worked, usual hours worked, and wages are also collected in the survey. The U.S. Department of Labor conducted surveys in 2012 to determine employee eligibility and use of FMLA-related leave. The surveys included employees 18 and over who were employed for pay. Earnings include wages, salary, commissions, tips, piece-rate pay, and bonuses before taxes or deductions. Employees with children under 18 in the household were considered. The U.S. Department of Labor conducted surveys in 2012 to determine employee eligibility and use of FMLA-related leave. The worksite survey included employers with at least 50 employees on the payroll. Interviews were conducted between February and June 2012."
