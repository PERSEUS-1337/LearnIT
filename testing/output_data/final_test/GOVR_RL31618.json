    "content": "Three postsecondary student financial aid programs authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) are collectively referred to as the campus-based programs\u2014the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program. These programs award federal funds to institutions of higher education based on past institutional awards and students' financial need. The aid students receive is determined by each institution's financial aid administrator according to specific award criteria. The FSEOG and FWS programs, along with the Perkins Loan program, were recently extended and amended under the Higher Education Opportunity Act. Changes included increases to loan limits and loan cancellation benefits. The campus-based programs' authorization of appropriations expired in FY2014 but was automatically extended through FY2015. Congress provided appropriations for the FSEOG and FWS programs beyond FY2015. The Perkins Loan program was extended through FY2017. The Federal Perkins Loan program was extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015. The authority for institutions to make new Perkins Loans expired on September 30, 2017. This report provides a description of each of the three HEA campus-based financial aid programs\u2014the FSEOG program, the FWS program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program. Program descriptions explain the purpose of each program and the terms under which aid is provided. The FSEOG program, authorized under Title IV, Part A, Subpart 3 of the HEA, provides financial assistance to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Institutions receive funds from the Secretary of Education to award FSEOG aid to eligible students as part of their financial aid packages. FSEOG aid is awarded to eligible students with exceptional financial need, prioritizing those receiving Pell Grants. Institutions can categorize students for award packaging based on various factors. The aid consists of a federal share (up to 75%) and a nonfederal share (at least 25%), funded by the institution's resources. The FSEOG aid is funded through a combination of federal and nonfederal shares, with the nonfederal share coming from the institution's resources. State scholarships and grants can count towards the nonfederal share, except for any portion attributable to federal funds. Students can only receive FSEOG aid for their first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study, with a maximum award amount of $4,000 per academic year. In cases of studying abroad, the award may be increased to $4,400 if the cost exceeds studying at the home institution, with a minimum award value of $100 per year. The FSEOG aid has a maximum award amount of $4,400, with a minimum value of $100 per year. Awards must be proportionately reduced for students enrolled for less than a full academic year. Institutions allocate funds based on financial need, with priority given to previous participants. Students do not repay FSEOG awards. Institutions participating in the FSEOG program receive funding based on their participation history. First- or second-time participants receive a base guarantee, while institutions that started after FY1999 receive a base guarantee of 90% of their second-year allocation or $5,000. Additionally, institutions in their first or second year receive a base guarantee of $5,000 or 90% of comparable institutions' funding. Institutions in the FSEOG program receive funding based on their participation history. The allocation is adjusted to be proportional to the total funds available. Remaining funds are distributed proportionately based on institutions' eligible amount of need. Financial need is calculated by subtracting Pell Grant aid from the students' aggregate financial need. The financial need for institutions in the FSEOG program is determined by a formula considering the cost of attendance and expected family contribution. Institutions with excess eligible need receive a fair share increase in funding. They can carry over up to 10% of their allocation for the next fiscal year and may also carry-back funds for grants to students. The Secretary can reallocate any excess funds returned by institutions. The Secretary can reallocate excess funds returned by institutions, with penalties for returning more than 10% of allocation. Up to 10% of funds over $700 million can be allocated to institutions with high Pell Grant recipient success rates. Federal Work Study programs provide part-time employment for students in need, authorized under HEA Title IV, Part C. Federal Work Study (FWS) programs were initially authorized under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and later transferred to Title IV of the Higher Education Act in 1968. FWS aid is awarded based on financial need, availability of funds, and student willingness to work. Students receive compensation for hours worked, and earnings are considered \"excludable income\" for determining financial need in the following year. Federal Work Study (FWS) aid is awarded based on a student's financial need for the subsequent year. Awards are determined by factors such as financial need, available aid from other sources, wage rate, and weekly work hours. FWS employment can be with the student's institution, nonprofit organizations, public agencies, or for-profit organizations. Conditions for FWS employment include not displacing workers, reasonable employment conditions, and not involving sectarian activities. Students employed through the Federal Work Study (FWS) program must be paid at least the federal minimum wage and work in jobs relevant to their academic pursuits. Private for-profit organizations must offer academically relevant jobs, while proprietary institutions can only employ FWS students in on-campus student service roles or community service jobs. Since FY2000, institutions participating in FWS must allocate at least 7% of their funds for community service jobs, including tutoring or family literacy projects. They can use up to 10% of the funds for administrative expenses related to the FWS program. Community services are defined as services identified by higher education institutions in consultation with local organizations to improve the quality of life for residents, especially low-income individuals. This includes areas such as health care, child care, literacy training, education, welfare, social services, transportation, housing, public safety, emergency preparedness, crime prevention, recreation, rural development, and community improvement. The National and Community Service Act of 1990 defines projects that support services for students with disabilities, including mentoring activities like tutoring, educational support, and counseling. Family literacy projects involve students as reading tutors for preschool or elementary school children. FWS jobs in tutoring and family literacy projects may count towards an institution's community service requirement, but exceptions apply, such as FWS students employed as tutors in a daycare center not open to the community. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) amended the Federal Work-Study (FWS) programs to include new categories of employment for students. Institutions must prioritize FWS projects that educate the public on evacuation, emergency response, and injury prevention related to natural disasters and emergencies. Students can also be employed in projects that teach civics, raise awareness about government functions, or increase civic participation. Participating students must be appropriately trained for these activities and compensated with federal and matching funds. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program provides compensation for students through federal funding and matching amounts from institutions or employers. The federal share of compensation varies depending on the type of FWS employment, with a maximum of 75% for most jobs. In the private for-profit sector, the federal share is limited to 50%. Institutions can provide their matching share in various forms such as tuition, room, board, or books. The HEOA also established an FWS Off-Campus Community Service Employment program with separate funding authorization. The Secretary can make grants to IHEs participating in the FWS program for off-campus community service employment. Funds are used for student recruitment, compensation, travel, and training related to community service. Priority is given to institutions focusing on early childhood education and disaster preparation. Institutions in disaster-affected areas can continue FWS payments to affected students who are unable to fulfill their work-study obligation due to the disaster. Disaster-affected students may receive FWS compensation for up to one academic year, with payments meeting federal matching requirements. Institutions can allocate funds to establish job location and development programs for enrolled students, with the federal share not exceeding 80%. These programs aim to find jobs compatible with students' schedules and educational goals, but cannot be used to find jobs at the institution or after graduation. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) programs support work-learning-service programs at select institutions known as \"work colleges.\" These colleges require students to participate in comprehensive work-learning-service programs contributing to their education and community welfare. At least half of full-time students must participate for a minimum of five hours per week. All resident students in work colleges must engage in work-learning-service programs as part of the institution's educational philosophy. The Work Colleges program requires all resident students to participate in work-learning-service programs as part of their education. Institutions can transfer funds from their regular FWS program to support these programs. Authorized activities include promoting the work-learning-service experience and coordinating joint projects. The FWS program funds work-learning-service programs at institutions based on previous allocations, with priority given to institutions that participated in FY1999. Funds are allocated according to statutorily prescribed procedures, with base guarantees determined based on years of participation. The FWS program allocates funds to institutions based on previous allocations, with base guarantees determined by years of participation. Institutions receive the greatest of $5,000, 90% of comparable institutions, or 90% of their first-year participation amount. If funds are insufficient, awards are reduced proportionately to adjusted base guarantees. Excess funds are allocated based on institutions' proportional share of excess eligible need, calculated separately for undergraduate and graduate/professional students. The FWS program allocates funds to institutions based on previous allocations, with base guarantees determined by years of participation. Institutions receive the greatest of $5,000, 90% of comparable institutions, or 90% of their first-year participation amount. Excess funds are allocated based on institutions' proportional share of excess eligible need, calculated separately for undergraduate and graduate/professional students. Institutions are provided flexibility to carry over up to 10% of their FWS funds for use in a succeeding fiscal year to carry out the FWS program. The Secretary may reallocate excess funds returned by institutions to other institutions within the same state in the next fiscal year. Up to 10% of an institution's allocation can be granted for student grants before the fiscal year begins. Excess funds must be distributed to institutions with eligible need. Institutions returning more than 10% of their allocation may have their next year's allocation reduced. The Federal Perkins Loan program is established. The Federal Perkins Loan program, established under the Higher Education Act, allows institutions to provide low-interest loans to students with financial need. Previously known as National Defense Student Loans, institutions used federal and institutional capital contributions to fund these loans. Excess funds returned by institutions can be reallocated to other institutions within the same state, with potential reductions in future allocations for institutions returning more than 10% of their allocation. The Federal Perkins Loan program allowed institutions to provide low-interest loans to students with financial need. Institutions recapitalized their loan funds by depositing repayments and earnings. The authorization for new Perkins Loans expired on September 30, 2017, but eligible students could still receive disbursements until June 30, 2018. Beginning October 1, 2017, institutions were required to return the federal share of their Perkins Loan fund. The Federal Perkins Loan program allowed institutions to provide low-interest loans to students with financial need. Institutions recapitalized their loan funds by depositing repayments and earnings. Institutions are allowed to make disbursements to eligible borrowers through June 30, 2018. ED will begin collecting the federal share of IHE's Perkins Loan revolving funds following the submission of the 2019-2020 FISAP, due October 1, 2018. When an IHE discontinues its participation in the Perkins Loan program, it must assign all loans with outstanding balances to ED. During the wind-down of the Perkins Loan program, IHEs have the option to assign their loans to ED. During the wind-down of the Perkins Loan program, institutions have the option to assign loans to ED or continue servicing them. Interest on Perkins Loans is fixed at 5% per year, with no interest accruing before repayment begins. Repayment starts nine months after a student is no longer enrolled half-time, with a 10-year repayment period. Institutions can offer incentive repayment programs, reducing interest rates for consecutive payments and providing discounts for early repayment. During the wind-down of the Perkins Loan program, institutions can assign loans to ED or continue servicing them. Repayment starts nine months after a student is no longer enrolled half-time, with a 10-year repayment period. Deferment is granted for various reasons such as pursuing a graduate fellowship, seeking full-time employment, serving in the military, or experiencing economic hardship. Institutions cannot use federal or institutional funds to cover the costs of incentive repayment programs and must reimburse the Perkins revolving loan fund for any lost income quarterly. Deferment is granted for various reasons such as pursuing a graduate fellowship, seeking full-time employment, serving in the military, or experiencing economic hardship. Borrowers are not required to request deferment in writing but must provide necessary information to document their deferment status. Payments can be resumed six months after the deferment period ends. Time in deferment does not count towards the 10-year repayment period. Forbearance is a temporary suspension of payments where interest accrues. It can be granted if debt burden is 20% of gross income or for specific reasons like AmeriCorps service. It can last up to one year and be renewed for a total of three years. Public service workers may have their loans cancelled. Full-time public service workers eligible for loan forgiveness include school teachers, Head Start staff, special education teachers, U.S. Armed Forces members, Peace Corps volunteers, law enforcement officers, and public defenders. Full-time public service workers eligible for Perkins Loan cancellation include teachers, nurses, firefighters, faculty members at Tribal Colleges, librarians, and speech language pathologists working in eligible schools. Perkins Loan cancellation is based on years of service and a specific cancellation rate. The program specifies that canceled amounts are not considered income for tax purposes. The Secretary reimburses institutions for Perkins Loans canceled for students in public service, but cannot use federal funds for this purpose. Since FY2009, funds have not been appropriated for Perkins Loan cancellations, but institutions are still required to provide cancellation benefits to eligible borrowers. Institutions must discharge a borrower's liability if they die or become totally and permanently disabled. Collections may be resumed if a borrower receives a new loan under HEA, Title IV. The Secretary may resume collections on a discharged Perkins Loan if the borrower earns income above the poverty line or if deemed necessary. Institutions are not reimbursed for losses from loan discharges. A Perkins Loan is in default if the borrower fails to comply with the terms or make payments for 240-270 days. The cohort default rate is the percentage of students who default on Perkins Loans within a year of entering repayment. The cohort default rate for Perkins Loans is calculated over a three-year period, with a rate of 10.87% for borrowers entering repayment in AY2014-2015. Rates have been above 10% since AY2007-2008, with four-year institutions having lower rates compared to two-year and proprietary institutions. Defaulted loans can be rehabilitated with nine consecutive on-time payments, returning borrowers to regular repayment status. Institutions can transfer up to 25% of their allotment between FWS and FSEOG programs. Institutions can transfer funds between FWS and FSEOG programs, with work colleges able to transfer up to 100% of their FWS allocation. In AY2015-2016, 1,262 institutions transferred $96.3 million from FWS to FSEOG, while 273 institutions transferred $4.3 million from FSEOG to FWS. Some institutions also transferred funds from Perkins Loan program to FSEOG and FWS programs. Administrative cost allowances cover program administration expenses. Administrative cost allowances for campus-based programs are calculated based on a percentage of institutional expenditures, with discretion given to institutions on how to allocate these costs. These allowances are taken out of federal funds allocated for the FSEOG and FWS programs. Budget information on past funding levels and program details, such as the number of participating institutions and students awarded aid, are also provided. In the past decade, funding for the FSEOG program decreased by 10% from FY2007 to FY2013, then increased by 5% in FY2014. Funding has since remained steady at around $730 million. Additional funding was provided for the FWS program in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Discretionary appropriations for Perkins Loan FCCs were last provided in FY2004, and funding for Perkins Loan Cancellations was last provided in FY2009. Matching federal funds are generally required for campus-based programs. In AY2015-2016, 7,277 postsecondary institutions participated in HEA Title IV financial aid programs. Approximately 52% awarded FSEOG aid, 46% employed students in FWS, and 20% advanced loans under the Perkins Loan program. Matching federal funds are generally required for campus-based programs, leveraging federal funding to provide greater student financial aid. Participation in the Perkins Loan program by two-year and proprietary institutions is lower compared to FSEOG and FWS, possibly due to administrative burden and higher default rates. Institutional participation in FSEOG and FWS has remained steady over the past 20 years, while participation in the Perkins Loan program has declined, with a slight increase in AY2013-2014. Figure 2 shows data on the number of students served by these programs. The FSEOG program serves the largest number of students among the three campus-based aid programs, with over 1.4 million students receiving awards annually since AY2004-2005. In AY2015-2016, approximately 1.53 million students received an FSEOG award. The FWS program is the second largest, serving around 700,000 students annually on average. In AY2015-2016, approximately 634,000 students participated in the FWS program. Since AY1994-1995, the number of students employed in community service increased from 58,596 to 109,150 in AY2015-2016. Participation in the Perkins Loan program declined over time, dropping to 421,000 in AY2015-2016, the lowest in two decades. The program's operations were curtailed on October 1, 2015, but later extended through the Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-105) until September 30, 2017. The Perkins Loan program participation declined to 421,000 in AY2015-2016, with average award amounts decreasing by 40% since AY2001-2002. The average FSEOG award amount was $649 in AY2015-2016, while the average FWS amount was $1,726. The average FWS award amount was $1,726, while the average Perkins Loan amount was $2,479 in AY2015-2016. The average Perkins Loan amounts have fluctuated over the past two decades, reaching a high of $2,790 in AY2003-2004 and decreasing to $2,046 by AY2010-2011."
