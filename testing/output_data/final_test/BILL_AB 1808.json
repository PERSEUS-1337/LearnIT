    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 124260 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define \"mental health treatment or counseling services\" as outpatient services provided by professional persons including mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists, licensed educational psychologists, and credentialed school psychologists. The curr_chunk lists professionals who can provide mental health treatment under supervision, including school psychologists, clinical psychologists, registered psychologists, psychological assistants, psychology trainees, and licensed clinical social workers. The curr_chunk lists professionals who can provide mental health treatment under supervision, including social work interns, marriage and family therapist interns, board certified psychiatrists, and licensed professional clinical counselors. A minor who is 12 years of age or older may consent to mental health treatment or counseling services if deemed mature enough by the attending professional. A trainee or intern treating a minor must notify their supervisor within 24 hours and immediately if the minor is deemed a danger to themselves or others. This does not replace any other reporting responsibilities required by law. The mental health treatment or counseling of a minor authorized by this section may involve the minor's parent or guardian, unless the professional treating the minor determines it would be inappropriate after consulting with the minor. The professional must document in the client record any attempts to contact the parent or guardian and the reason for not doing so if deemed inappropriate. The minor's parent or guardian is not responsible for payment unless they participate in the mental health treatment. Minors cannot receive certain treatments or drugs without parental consent."
