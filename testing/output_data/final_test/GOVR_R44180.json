    "content": "Several western states are facing extreme drought conditions, with federal legislative proposals focusing on managing water supplies and supporting drought-related projects. Bills such as H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 have garnered attention in Congress and the public, with H.R. 2898, the Western Water and American Food Security Act, passing the House on July 17, 2015. The House bill, H.R. 2898, and the Senate bill, S. 1894, address various issues related to drought in western states. Both bills focus on water management and infrastructure. S. 1894 was introduced in the Senate on July 29, 2015, and includes provisions not found in H.R. 2898. Congress is likely to continue discussing elements from these bills and others to address ongoing drought conditions in the region. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 bills focus on infrastructure and water conveyance in California, with provisions triggered by drought conditions. H.R. 2898 lacks specified authorization of appropriations, while S. 1894 authorizes funding subject to appropriations or mandatory funding for certain activities. The bills include provisions specific to the Bureau of Reclamation and other federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address drought-related issues in California, focusing on infrastructure and water conveyance, including management of the federal Central Valley Project. Common issue areas include fish populations, water flows, invasive species, operational flexibility, Delta Cross Channel gates, emergency reviews, water transfers, water rights protections, and completion of storage studies. The bills also aim to construct new surface water storage projects and make amendments to the Bureau of Reclamation. The construction of new surface water storage projects and amendments to Bureau of Reclamation authority under the SECURE Water Act can impact fish habitat and populations. In California, the coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) serve millions of people and farmland. Both projects collect and store water in northern California reservoirs, diverting water from the Bay-Delta to users in Central and Southern California. Operational changes have been made to protect species and water quality due to drought conditions. Operational changes under the Endangered Species Act aim to protect species and water quality in the Bay-Delta. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address water conveyance and flows for fish populations listed under ESA, specifically focusing on the CVP and SWP operations in relation to threatened species like the Delta smelt and salmon. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address the management of water flows in relation to fish populations listed under the Endangered Species Act. They define terms like Salmonid Biological Opinion and Smelt Biological Opinion, which are opinions issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service under the ESA. These bills also include provisions for incidental take statements and reasonable and prudent alternatives for proposed activities. H.R. 2898 defines \"negative impact on the long-term survival\" as reducing the likelihood of a listed species' survival and recovery in the wild. This term is used in the context of measuring the effects of water projects on species, although it is not formally defined under the Endangered Species Act. The phrase \"jeopardize the continued existence of\" is not formally defined under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), but federal regulations provide a definition that includes actions expected to reduce the survival and recovery of a listed species in the wild. S. 1894 does not define jeopardy or other terms related to species effects, potentially deferring to existing laws and regulations. For example, Section 121 of S. 1894 prohibits federal officials from taking actions likely to jeopardize listed species' existence or cause destruction. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to increase water supplies for users in the Delta by authorizing changes in pump and flow rate management. H.R. 2898 specifies water flow requirements for Delta smelt, while S. 1894 directs water managers to maximize water supplies while complying with laws and regulations. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 focus on increasing water supplies in the Delta. H.R. 2898 specifies water flow requirements for Delta smelt, while S. 1894 aims to maximize water supplies while following laws and regulations. Both bills call for more data collection on Delta smelt and real-time monitoring to inform water conveyance management. However, they differ in their approaches to monitoring and implementing operational changes. H.R. 2898 includes a provision for the director of FWS to use scientific data to evaluate and amend RPAs in the Delta smelt BiOp, while S. 1894 lacks this directive. S. 1894 does not have a broad directive to potentially change parts of the Delta smelt BiOp, but it would direct the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to use scientific tools to identify changes to water operations. H.R. 2898, on the other hand, includes provisions for increased monitoring practices for Delta smelt to minimize salvage and maximize pumping rates. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address negative flows on the Old and Middle Rivers (OMR flows) as they pertain to listed species. H.R. 2898 sets OMR flows at -5,000 cubic feet per second unless lower flow rate is justified, with conditions for change and increased monitoring for Delta smelt. S. 1894 also addresses flow rates in the Old and Middle River, directing the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to use scientific tools to identify changes to water operations. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address flow rates in the Old and Middle River to minimize water supply reductions. H.R. 2898 focuses on implementing new science into salmon management, while S. 1894 authorizes the NOAA's Salmon Restoration Plan. H.R. 2898 adjusts RPAs in the salmon BiOp based on new science, while S. 1894 outlines a process for examining new science and data on salmon to reduce water supply impacts. The recommendations in S. 1894 do not specifically adjust RPAs in the salmon BiOp but require reporting of any changes. Section 202 of H.R. 2898 evaluates activities to offset effects of pumping rate changes on species, providing a framework for identifying offsetting actions and estimating their impact on salmonid species survival. Section 202(e) of H.R. 2898 establishes a framework for evaluating alternative management measures to offset the effects of increased pumping on salmonid survival. If feasible, these measures would increase pumping rates while maintaining survival rates for listed salmon species. Section 202(h) discusses oversight responsibilities for adaptive management under the BiOp. S. 1894 authorizes actions to help threatened fish populations, such as implementing nonstructural barriers at Delta Cross Channel gates, alternative hatchery salmon release strategies, and a trap and barge pilot project to increase fish survival in the Delta. Both S. 1894 and H.R. 2898 authorize pilot projects for an invasive species control program. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 propose programs to reduce invasive species in the Delta and protect native anadromous fish in the Stanislaus River. The bills establish nonnative fish removal programs, with funding from participating water districts. They also direct the Secretaries to maximize water supplies to CVP users and SWP contractors by approving projects and operations that provide additional water supplies. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to streamline permit decisions and authorize expedited procedures for projects addressing water supply issues. They grant Secretaries new authority to approve projects without congressional authorization. H.R. 2898 also requires the development of a drought operations plan, while S. 1894 does not have a similar provision. The Delta Cross Channel (DCC) plays a crucial role in maintaining water quality and impacting listed fish in the Delta. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 focus on the Delta Cross Channel (DCC) and its impact on water quality, listed fish, and water flows to pumping facilities. H.R. 2898 includes provisions for data collection near the DCC and evaluation of its effects on water quality, supply, and listed species. H.R. 2898 focuses on the Delta Cross Channel (DCC) impact on water quality, listed fish, and water flows to pumping facilities. It includes provisions for data collection, evaluation of effects on water supply, listed species, and salmonid survival. The bill also directs the Secretary of the Interior to recommend revisions to maximize water supplies without significant negative impacts on listed species or water quality. Compliance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is addressed by consulting with the Council on Environmental Quality for alternative arrangements. The bills aim to expedite water transfers in the CVP service area by evaluating proposals to increase flows in the San Joaquin River in a timely manner. H.R. 2898 would require the Secretary to facilitate and expedite transfers of Central Valley water. The bills aim to expedite water transfers in the Central Valley Project service area by requiring the Secretary to facilitate and expedite transfers of Central Valley Project water in accordance with relevant laws. The bills also address San Joaquin River inflow-to-export ratios and the timing of water transfers through federal and state pumping plants. The bill allows for water transfers, sales, and exchanges during the drought designation period. It sets ratios for inflow-to-export unless it impacts threatened or endangered species. H.R. 2898 allows for a more restrictive ratio if it would avoid significant negative impacts on listed salmonid species. S. 1894 uses existing ESA documents as the standard, while H.R. 2898 uses the \"negative impact on long-term survival\" standard. Title V of H.R. 2898 and Title I of S. 1894 outline protections of existing water rights to different extents. Section 501 of H.R. 2898 and Section 111 of S. 1894 require any changes reducing water supplies to the SWP and increasing supplies to the CVP to be offset. Notification requirements for environmental protections differ between the bills. H.R. 2898 requires notification if salmon and smelt BiOps implementation reduces environmental protections, while S. 1894 requires notification of changes in BiOps implementation. The BiOps implementation changes in H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to protect state water rights. H.R. 2898 specifies that Secretary actions will not alter water rights priorities under California law, while S. 1894 does not. Both bills prohibit involuntary reductions in contractor water supplies, but H.R. 2898 applies only to CVP and SWP contractors. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 focus on protecting state water rights and preventing reductions in contractor water supplies. H.R. 2898 applies specifically to CVP and SWP contractors, with language clarifying actions that should not impact water supply or fiscal impacts. S. 1894 includes provisions for \"substitute actions\" and clarifies that the act does not authorize adverse effects on species listed under ESA or modify obligations under CVPIA. Both bills direct Reclamation to complete feasibility studies for new or augmented surface water. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 focus on completing feasibility studies for new or augmented surface water storage projects in California. H.R. 2898 includes financial penalties for delays in meeting deadlines, while S. 1894 encourages federal involvement in water storage projects and authorizes discretionary funding. S. 1894 authorizes $600 million for new water storage projects with federal cost share limits. H.R. 2898 proposes a new process for authorizing construction of storage projects and funding from a Reclamation Surface Storage Account. The funding for new surface water storage in H.R. 2898 would come from accelerated repayment by users, with 50% available for this purpose. The authorized funding level estimated by the Congressional Budget Office is around $360 million over the FY2016-FY2020 period. Both bills also include provisions for additional reservoir storage at Reclamation Safety of Dams projects, to be paid for by local sponsors. Changes to the SECURE Water Act are authorized in both bills. Section 421 of S. 1894 and Section 607 of H.R. 2898 propose amendments to the SECURE Water Act, authorizing federal assistance for water management projects in western states. The federal share of project costs would be limited to 25% or $20 million. H.R. 2898 also allows for nonfederal funds to be used for special studies under the Basin Studies Program. H.R. 2898 includes provisions related to California's Central Valley Project (CVP) and other Reclamation provisions. It specifies changes to the BiOps, such as authorizing the revision of incidental take levels for Delta smelt. H.R. 2898 would revise incidental take levels for Delta smelt and direct the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the method for calculating reverse flow in the Old and Middle River every five years. It also requires alternative measures for salmon management and limits Delta exports to 35% of Delta inflow under certain conditions. Section 310 of H.R. 2898 would determine new water storage at New Melones Reservoir, with a report due to Congress within 18 months. Section 313 aims to fulfill terms of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act with a \"warm water fishery\" below Friant Dam. Section 504 of H.R. 2898 includes water supply allocations for Sacramento Valley contractors. Section 601 expands the authorized service area of the CVP to include Kettleman City, CA, with a long-term water contract. Section 602 establishes an oversight board for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund expenditures. The board for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund would consist of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, representing various CVP contractors and wildlife entities. Section 603 would change water supply accounting under CVPIA to include restrictions on CVP water for fisheries, and Section 604 would require the implementation of a water replacement plan. The Secretary of the Interior must implement a \"water replacement plan\" as required under CVPIA, aiming to increase CVP water supplies by the amount dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes. If the plan fails to increase CVP yield by 800,000 acre-feet within five years, a 25% reduction in water for fish and wildlife purposes will be implemented. Additionally, hatchery fish must be considered in determining anadromous fish populations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta under ESA. The curr_chunk discusses the potential inclusion of hatchery fish in population estimates of protected species, which could increase population size and decrease pumping restrictions. It also mentions a provision to transfer the New Melones Unit of the CVP to water users and a limit on releases from Lewiston Dam for Trinity River fisheries. The curr_chunk discusses proposed changes to the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), including amendments to include replacement water and expedited water transfers, redefine anadromous fish coverage, and require annual reports on instream flow releases. These changes could impact fish protection and restoration goals. The curr_chunk discusses provisions not covered in S. 1894 related to Bureau of Reclamation policies and project management, including directing new budget authority to surface storage projects. One provision establishes a one-stop permitting office within Reclamation for nonfederal storage projects. Title VIII, Sections 801-806 of the legislation would establish an annual reporting process for Reclamation projects, similar to the Corps of Engineers. Title IX, Sections 901-902 would authorize accelerated repayment for nonfederal Reclamation project users for certain construction costs. S. 1894 includes provisions for accelerated repayment of construction costs for repayment contracts, allowing contractors to bypass certain requirements under reclamation laws sooner. The bill also introduces new programs and authorities for alternative water supplies, strengthening existing programs and creating new ones. Section 301 of S. 1894 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to award federal funds for water recycling, desalination, and innovative water supply projects in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. The projects aim to reduce reliance on surface and groundwater supplies through methods like groundwater recharge and stormwater capture. The Secretary will review project requests from eligible entities and specified water authorities, districts, and communities in California. Section 301 of S. 1894 authorizes federal funds for water recycling, desalination, and innovative water supply projects in western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. The projects aim to reduce reliance on surface and groundwater supplies. 105 specified water authorities, districts, and communities in California are included, with no specific appropriation amount mentioned. Projects may be eligible for assistance under the Reclamation Title XVI recycling program, with funds starting in FY2026. Desalination projects could also receive funds with a maximum federal cost share of 25%, starting in FY2026. Section 302 of S. 1894 establishes a new desalination grant program at EPA, providing federal grants for feasibility studies and project design costs for nonfederal desalination facilities. The program is authorized at $10 million annually through 2020 and amends the Water Desalination Act of 1996 to prioritize research and demonstration activities. Section 322 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter voluntary agreements with water agencies for water conservation programs, with conserved water allocated between the agency and the Secretary. Reclamation contractors can contribute funding, with the possibility of receiving water for groundwater recharge if they contribute over 50%. Section 323 establishes a grant program for water projects within the USDA's Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program. The bill includes provisions for grants to fund water projects in communities with populations under 10,000, as well as larger communities in certain cases. It also authorizes funding for water recycling and reuse projects in western states, Alaska, and Hawaii, prioritizing areas affected by severe drought or designated as disaster areas. The bill authorizes $200 million in competitive grant funding for water projects in communities affected by severe drought or designated as disaster areas. It also includes new financing provisions and amendments to existing authorities to address drought, such as utilizing State Revolving Fund programs for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. Section 103 of the bill directs EPA to prioritize water infrastructure projects in states with declared drought emergencies to assist communities at risk of water supply shortages. Section 315 authorizes the Corps to implement a pilot program for \"forecast-based\" operations based on weather and climate science to enhance water supply benefits and flood control operations. Eligibility for the program is not limited to western states but is based on gubernatorial drought declarations in 2015. Section 315 authorizes the Corps to implement a pilot program for \"forecast-based\" operations to enhance water supply benefits and flood control operations. Eligibility for the program is not limited to western states but is based on gubernatorial drought declarations in 2015. The Corps would report on the status of water control manuals, water supply storage allocation requests, and opportunities for forecast-based operations at existing Corps reservoirs and select nonfederal reservoirs. Additionally, a pilot program for five projects to implement forecast-based revisions to water operations manuals is authorized. No authorization of appropriations and no cost-sharing requirements are specified. WaterSense is a voluntary program established by EPA in 2006 to promote water-efficient products and buildings. It would be authorized $5.0 million per year through FY2019. The Open Water Data Initiative within the U.S. Geological Survey would be authorized $4 million through FY2020 to improve water data availability. The Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act would authorize $200 million for financing water supply projects. The Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA) would provide $200 million for secured loans or loan guarantees for certain Reclamation projects in western states, Alaska, Hawaii, and other authorized states. Priority would be given to areas facing water resource challenges. The RIFIA provisions are similar to the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) but not identical. Additionally, a new fund called the Federal Support for State and Local Drought Solutions Fund would be created, receiving surplus receipts in the Reclamation Fund starting in FY2026. The new fund, authorized at $150 million per year for 25 years without further appropriation, would receive surplus receipts in the Reclamation Fund starting in FY2026. It would fund various authorizations in the bill, including desalination projects, Title XVI projects, and innovative finance projects. Congress faces challenges in addressing water supply shortages and managing federal water supply projects during times of drought and increasing demand. Balancing obligations while meeting growing water demands poses significant challenges. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 propose guidance for Reclamation's management of the CVP to address challenges in meeting water demands. The bills aim to maximize water supplies with limitations and provide specific guidance on BiOps implementation. Questions arise on federal agencies' discretion in CVP operations and potential conflicts with state water quality regulations. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 propose measures for managing the CVP to meet water demands while considering state water quality regulations. The bills focus on assessing the impact of water operations on listed species under the ESA, with H.R. 2898 emphasizing long-term species survival. Questions arise about the potential new standards for measuring effects on species and the balance between short-term water supply maximization and long-term species viability. Both bills include provisions for increased data collection and monitoring, with H.R. 2898 specifying implementation details for BiOps related to the Delta smelt and salmon. The proposed changes in the bills could lead to higher pumping rates and water exports, raising concerns about detecting and addressing operational impacts on species. Both bills aim to encourage new water storage through expedited studies and potential authorization of storage projects. H.R. 2898 focuses on streamlining current processes. H.R. 2898 focuses on streamlining current Reclamation processes for water storage activities, while S. 1894 expands Reclamation's authorized activities to include desalination, water reuse, groundwater recharge, and stormwater capture. Questions arise about the quantity of water supplies generated and the cost implications of the new authorities and programs. The bills would establish new authorities and processes, prioritizing them over ongoing agency activities. Spending provisions may need to be offset."
