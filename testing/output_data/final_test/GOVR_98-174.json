    "content": "This report summarizes U.S. congressional action on Mexican drug control and certification issues from 1986 to 2002, focusing on recent developments. It details the evolution of drug certification requirements in the mid-1980s and recent modifications in 2001 and 2002. Congress has been interested in Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts, especially regarding presidential drug certifications. The Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988 laid the foundation for current Foreign Sections 489-490. The Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988 established Sections 489-490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, requiring the President to certify drug-producing or drug-transit countries' cooperation with the U.S. in drug control efforts to avoid sanctions. This was prompted by the kidnaping and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique Camarena in 1985. Congress closely monitored presidential certifications, with Mexico being fully certified by President Reagan initially. In 1987, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the full Senate voted against the President's certification, but no action was taken to reverse it. In 1989, Congress passed the International Narcotics Control Act with references to Mexico. In the early 1990s, with improving trade relations under NAFTA, few resolutions to disapprove presidential certifications were introduced. In early 1996, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY1996 dropped a House-passed restriction on aid to Mexico unless Mexico controlled illegal drug trafficking. Senators Feinstein and D'Amato and Representatives Miller and Shaw criticized Mexican drug control efforts and introduced measures calling for disapproval of the President's certification and action against the country unless drug trafficking was controlled, but no action was completed on these measures. In June and July 1996, the House and the Senate passed the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY1997 with restrictions on Mexico. The FY1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (H.R. 3540) included restrictions on Mexico related to drug trafficking and money-laundering. The final version withheld $2.5 million from Mexico until actions were taken to reduce drug flow and prosecute those involved in drug trafficking. Following the arrest of Mexico's drug fighting agency head on corruption charges in mid-February 1997, some Members of Congress urged President Clinton to send a message for more forceful action. When the President fully certified Mexico in late February 1997, congressional resolutions of disapproval were introduced. The House International Relations Committee voted to report out a resolution allowing the President to waive sanctions for one year with a national interests certification. In March 1997, Congress debated on drug trafficking issues. The House passed H.J.Res. 58 with the Hastert amendment, deferring disapproval of the presidential certification of Mexico pending progress in drug control cooperation. The Senate later passed the Coverdell-Feinstein amendment as a substitute. The amendment to H.J.Res. 58 required a report on Mexican and U.S. efforts in drug control. Congress did not complete action on this measure within the specified time, but President Clinton indicated he would abide by the Senate version of H.J.Res. 58. In May 1997, the House International Relations Committee proposed H.R. 1486, the Foreign Policy Reform Act, which aimed to eliminate presidential certification and sanctions for countries under drug certification. Instead, it required the President to report yearly and consult with Congress on drug control issues. H.R. 1486 was later divided into three bills, with the foreign aid and drug certification provisions placed in H.R. 1759. In 1997, foreign aid and drug certification provisions were included in H.R. 1759. The Senate defeated Amendment 901, which aimed to suspend drug certification requirements for two years. President Clinton certified Mexico as fully cooperative in drug control efforts in February 1998. The U.S.-Mexico Alliance Against Drugs was established in May 1997 through cooperation in the High Level Contact Group on Narcotics Control. The U.S.-Mexico Binational Drug Strategy was issued in February 1998. Some members of Congress criticized the certification decision, citing concerns about efforts to arrest major drug traffickers and extradite Mexican citizens on drug-related charges. Resolutions of disapproval were introduced in Congress in early March 1998. In Congress, resolutions were introduced to disapprove the President's certification regarding assistance to Mexico. Senator Coverdell introduced S.J.Res. 42 and S.J.Res. 43 in the Senate, while Representative Shaw introduced H.J.Res. 114 in the House. These resolutions would allow the President to waive withholding of assistance if vital U.S. national interests required it. The resolutions introduced in Congress to disapprove the President's certification regarding assistance to Mexico were referred to committees for hearings, but no further action was taken. The Senate considered the measures, with objections raised to S.J.Res. 43 due to a national interest waiver. Proponents argued Mexico had failed to meet standards, while opponents feared harm to relations and cooperative efforts. S.J.Res. 42 was defeated by a vote of 45 to 54. In 1998, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277) included measures for counter-narcotics funding for Mexico, Southwest border enhancement, and strengthening interdiction on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act was also incorporated to authorize funds for these efforts. The conference report on the omnibus measure was approved by the House and Senate in October 1998. President Clinton certified Mexico's full cooperation in drug control efforts on February 26, 1999, citing various cooperative measures, arrests of major traffickers, and joint anti-drug strategies. Representative Bachus introduced H.J.Res. 35 in the House on March 2, 1999, to disapprove the President's certification of Mexico. H.J.Res. 35 in the House disapproves the President's certification of Mexico but allows for waivers on assistance withholding and voting against development bank loans. H.J.Res. 43 introduced later extends the congressional period for consideration. The House International Relations Committee will carefully examine resolutions regarding Mexico's counterdrug measures, including a maritime agreement with the United States and the return of unwanted Huey helicopters. Senators urged President Clinton to use specific benchmarks for future certification decisions regarding Mexico. Senators introduced bills to strengthen President Clinton's authority to freeze assets of drug traffickers in the US and exempt countries like Mexico with bilateral counter-narcotics agreements from annual drug certification procedures. Senator Gramm and eight cosponsors introduced S. 658, the Drug Free Borders Act of 1999, to fund advanced sensing equipment for detecting illegal drugs at the border. Legislation was enacted to strengthen the President's authority to freeze assets of drug traffickers in the US and prevent them from doing business with US companies. The Senate approved measures introduced by Senators Coverdell and Feinstein as an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2000. The House passed H.R. 3164, the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, to designate foreign drug traffickers. The House passed H.R. 3164, containing the text of H.R. 1555 with the addition of a Judicial Review Commission. President Clinton certified Mexico's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking, citing various forms of collaboration and extradition of drug fugitives. In response to Mexico's failure to prosecute and extradite major drug traffickers, some lawmakers urged non-certification of Mexico. Despite criticism from some Representatives and Senators, no resolution of disapproval was introduced to overturn the President's certification. Bills were introduced to exempt Mexico from the drug certification requirement in FY2001 after Vicente Fox's election as President of Mexico in 2000. S. 3021 and H.R. 5155 were introduced but no further action was taken. The Senate agreed to a resolution welcoming the constitutional transition in Mexico and suggesting a one-year waiver of the drug certification requirement for new governments. In early 2001, there were efforts to eliminate the drug certification requirement for countries like Mexico to enhance cooperation in counter-narcotics programs. Senator Gramm and other members of Congress aimed to suspend the certification process, with President Bush also showing support for this move. In early 2001, Senator Hagel introduced S. 219 to suspend the drug certification process for all countries for two fiscal years unless it advanced U.S. drug control goals. The bill urged the President to convene a conference to develop a new strategy. Senator Hutchison introduced S. 353 to exempt Mexico from the certification requirement in FY2001. In early 2001, Senator Hagel introduced S. 219 to suspend the drug certification process for all countries for two fiscal years unless it advanced U.S. drug control goals. Senator Hutchison introduced S. 353 to exempt Mexico from the certification requirement in FY2001, with a plan for enhanced counter-narcotics cooperation between Mexico and the United States by June 30, 2001. Senator Grassley and Senator DeWine introduced S. 376 to modify the certification process for FY2002-FY2004. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 13 urging bilateral cooperation and a review of the current illicit drug certification process. In late February and early March 2001, additional measures were introduced to modify the existing drug certification procedures. H.R. 753 and S. 435 were introduced to exempt Mexico from the drug certification requirements, while H.R. 841 was introduced to suspend the certification process. President Bush expressed confidence in President Fox's efforts to combat drug trafficking during a joint press conference in Mexico. Representative Reyes introduced H.R. 841 to suspend drug certification procedures for two years and urged a conference of drug-producing countries. President Bush certified Mexico's cooperation in drug control efforts, citing arrests and eradication programs. President Fox's commitments offered opportunities for greater cooperation with the United States. At a hearing on the certification process, Senators and Representatives discussed modifications to the procedures. Assistant Secretary of State Rand Beers acknowledged the effectiveness of the certification process but recognized the need for more effective approaches to enhancing international counterdrug cooperation. At a hearing on the certification process, Assistant Secretary of State Rand Beers discussed the need for modifications to ensure continued international counternarcotics cooperation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee marked up S. 219 to modify drug certification procedures for a 3-year trial period. The approved measure would modify drug certification procedures for a 3-year trial period, requiring the President to identify and designate countries failing to make substantial efforts in adhering to counter-narcotics agreements. U.S. assistance would be withheld unless deemed vital to national interest or until countries show significant counter-narcotics efforts. Congress also urges a multilateral conference in 2001 to develop drug reduction strategies. The measure aims to develop multilateral drug reduction strategies and urges legislative changes to implement them within a year. It also requires yearly reports on country performance and major drug trafficking organizations. Additionally, it allows judicial review of decisions to freeze assets of suspected drug kingpins. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved S. 1401, the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act for FY2002-FY2003, with provisions to reform drug certification procedures. The Committee expressed concerns about the current process and called for changes to establish an effective and accountable drug policy. The Secretary of State is urged to work with Congress to modify the certification process accordingly. Subtitle D, Reform of Certification Procedures Applicable to Certain Drug Producing or Trafficking Countries. The Mexican President called upon Congress to suspend drug certification requirements during President Fox's state visit to the US, emphasizing trust and cooperation in law enforcement efforts. President Bush committed to working with Congress to replace the annual certification regime. The Senate passed the Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002 with amendments to replace the annual drug certification regime with new measures for international cooperation in the Western Hemisphere. The President was required to identify major drug-transit or drug-producing countries that failed to make substantial efforts in counter-narcotics agreements by November 30, 2001. The Senate-passed Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY2002 emphasized the need for international cooperation in counter-narcotics efforts. It called for withholding U.S. assistance from designated countries unless deemed vital to national interest or until substantial counter-narcotics efforts were made. Additionally, it proposed convening a multilateral conference to develop drug reduction strategies and urged the President to request legislative changes within a year. The bill also required yearly reports on individual countries' performance in drug control. The conference report on the Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002 included provisions modifying the annual drug certification procedures. Section 591 provided a one-year waiver of the procedures for all major drug-transit and drug producing countries, with the President required to identify these countries within 45 days of enactment. The Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002 included provisions modifying the annual drug certification procedures. The President is required to identify major drug transit and producing countries that have failed to make substantial efforts in adhering to international counter-narcotics agreements. U.S. assistance may be withheld from these countries unless deemed vital to national interest or until substantial counter-narcotics efforts are made. The President must still produce the yearly International Narcotics Control Strategy Report by March 1. Some Members criticized this provision as a weakening of the drug certification procedures. The House criticized the provision as weakening drug certification procedures, but the State Department saw it as a positive step. The measure was signed into law by President Bush in January 2002. Congress continued to adopt new requirements for drug-producing and transit countries in 2002. President Bush found that Afghanistan, Burma, and Haiti failed to meet counter-narcotics obligations, but decided to continue U.S. assistance to Afghanistan and Haiti. Mexico was noted as a major drug supplier and transit point, but its counter-narcotics efforts were praised for successes against drug cartels. In a meeting with President Fox, both leaders acknowledged Mexico's achievements in fighting narco-trafficking. In congressional action for FY2003, the Senate and House had differing bills regarding U.S. drug certification requirements. The issue was to be resolved in conference at the end of the session. The House International Relations Committee had reported on International Drug Control Certification Procedures. The House International Relations Committee reported H.R. 1646 without drug certification provisions, which was passed by the House. The Senate approved H.R. 1646 after incorporating a Senate measure on security assistance. The conference report on H.R. 1646 establishes new drug certification procedures requiring the President to identify and designate countries failing to adhere to international counter-narcotics agreements. The legislation requires countries to adhere to international counter-narcotics agreements to receive U.S. assistance, with exceptions for national interest. The INCSR report on countries' performance is still required annually. The President can choose to apply previous drug certification procedures if needed. A transition rule mandates the submission of the report before foreign assistance funds are obligated. Section 706 of the approved H.R. 1646 requires the President to designate and withhold assistance from countries failing to make substantial counter-narcotics efforts. The President can also withhold assistance and apply sanctions against countries not cooperating fully with the United States in counter-narcotics efforts. The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference supports this approach. Managers in the Committee of Conference believe the President should instruct U.S. Executive Directors to vote against loans for countries not qualifying for assistance under old or new procedures."
