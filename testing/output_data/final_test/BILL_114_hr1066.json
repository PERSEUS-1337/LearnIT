    "content": "The Act titled \"Clinical Trials Modernization Act of 2015\" introduces innovative statistical methods in clinical protocols for drugs, biological products, and devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act \"Clinical Trials Modernization Act of 2015\" introduces a framework for incorporating adaptive trial designs and Bayesian methods into clinical protocols for drugs, biological products, and devices to streamline regulatory review and approval processes. The Act \"Clinical Trials Modernization Act of 2015\" introduces guidance on using adaptive trial designs and Bayesian methods in clinical trials for drugs, biological products, and devices to improve regulatory review processes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will update and finalize draft guidance on adaptive trial designs and issue draft guidance on Bayesian methods. These guidances will establish standards for using these methods in clinical trials. The Act \"Clinical Trials Modernization Act of 2015\" introduces guidance on using adaptive trial designs and Bayesian methods in clinical trials for drugs, biological products, and devices to improve regulatory review processes. It includes establishing a mechanism for sponsors to obtain feedback from the Secretary on technical issues related to modeling and simulations, specifying required information for review, and recommending analysis methodology. The Secretary must consult stakeholders through a public meeting before updating or developing guidances. The final guidance must be published within specific timeframes after the public meeting. The Secretary must review and potentially revise guidance documents within 48 months of the Act's enactment to incorporate new statistical methods for clinical trials leading to drug approvals. SEC. 3. EVALUATIONS OF REQUIRED POSTAPPROVAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS. The Secretary will periodically evaluate postapproval studies and clinical trials to determine if they are still scientifically necessary or if changes are needed in design or timelines. The Secretary may renegotiate study timelines or design if changes in medical practice occur. If a postapproval study is deemed scientifically unwarranted, it may no longer be required. The Secretary has the authority to renegotiate study timelines or design in case of changes in medical practice. Draft guidance on the implementation of this provision must be issued within one year of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary must issue final guidance on implementation within two years of the enactment of the Act."
