The EPA creates a National Priorities List to prioritize sites based on risk. The Superfund budget funds immediate contamination removal and remediation efforts. Federal facilities are responsible for their own cleanup costs, typically paid by potentially responsible parties. The Superfund program, established by CERCLA and expanded by SARA, aims to clean up hazardous waste sites. Superfund cleanups are usually paid for by potentially responsible parties (PRPs), with EPA using funds from the trust fund for sites where PRPs cannot be located or lack financial resources. The trust fund has had various revenue sources, including taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks. The Superfund program, established by CERCLA and expanded by SARA, aims to clean up hazardous waste sites. Superfund cleanups are usually paid for by potentially responsible parties (PRPs), with EPA using funds from the trust fund for sites where PRPs cannot be located or lack financial resources. The trust fund has had various revenue sources, including taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks. The third tax, known as the Corporate Environmental Income Tax, was meant to raise funds from companies that may have used and disposed of hazardous substances, based on the \"polluter pays\" principle. The Administration's critics argue that industries profiting from chemicals being cleaned up should fund Superfund cleanups through dedicated taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks, rather than general Treasury revenues. Other sources of income for the trust fund include interest on the fund's balance and cost recoveries from potentially responsible parties. The Superfund program is funded through various sources including dedicated taxes, cost recoveries from PRPs, reimbursements from other federal agencies, and fines. From 1991 to 1995, the dedicated taxes provided an average of $1.45 billion per year, while general Treasury revenues contributed $369 million per year. The taxes supporting the trust fund expired in 1995. The taxes supporting the Superfund trust fund expired in 1995. The Republican leadership opposed reinstating the taxes without comprehensive CERCLA reauthorization. Despite the expiration, the fund had a $4 billion balance and continued to receive money from various sources. The Clinton Administration requested tax reinstatement annually, but Congress did not act on these requests. Congress did not act on requests to reinstate taxes supporting the Superfund trust fund. Funding continued from a combination of unobligated trust fund balance and general revenues, with increasing contributions from general revenues over the years. Despite improvements in the fund's starting balance, the majority of annual appropriations still came from general revenues. The Superfund Trust Fund balance has been declining in recent years, reaching $97 million at the end of FY2005. General revenues remain the primary source of program funding. The Superfund Trust Fund balance has been declining in recent years, reaching $97 million at the end of FY2005. Starting balances in FY2006, FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009 were $97 million, $178 million, $273 million, and $176 million, respectively. General Treasury revenues continue to be the main source of program funding according to OMB estimates. The Superfund Trust Fund relies on five categories of funds: corporate income taxes, interfund transactions, cost recoveries, interest and profits on investments, and fines and penalties. The corporate income taxes category, a previous revenue source, expired in 1995. The FY2009 budget proposed $1.26 billion for the Superfund appropriation, based on the Trust Fund balance from the previous fiscal year. The Superfund Trust Fund relies on various revenue sources to fund its appropriations, including cost recoveries, interest and profits, and fines and penalties. These funds help generate the end-of-year balance used in the next fiscal year. Cost recoveries come from payments by responsible parties for cleanup expenses, which can vary annually and are challenging to predict accurately. The Superfund trust fund's revenue sources include cost recoveries, interest, profits, fines, and penalties. From FY1997-2002, revenue averaged $272 million annually but declined to $60 million by FY2006. Despite a recovery in FY2007, OMB estimated $76 million for both FY2008 and FY2009. The unexpended balance was $2.9 billion at the start of FY2008, generating substantial interest earnings. OMB projected $151 million in interest for FY2008 and $125 million for FY2009. The Superfund trust fund's revenue sources include interest, fines, and penalties. OMB projected $2 million in fines and penalties for both FY2008 and FY2009. The Administration requested a $10 million increase in program funding for FY2009. OMB estimated that $1.09 billion would come from general Treasury revenues in FY2009. The FY2009 appropriation for the Superfund program would mainly come from general Treasury revenues. A study conducted in 2001 identified future program needs and projected costs for fiscal years 2000-2009, including emergency cleanups, long-term cleanup, site assessment activities, program administration, and costs of adding sites to the program. RFF estimated the FY2009 Superfund program needs to be $1.6 billion, with high and low estimates at $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion respectively. Factors contributing to the increased projections include the fund's decreasing unobligated balance since FY1997. The Superfund program's funding sources were insufficient compared to Superfund taxes. Cleanup costs were projected to rise due to \"mega sites\" with an average cost of $140 million. The cost of remedial action was expected to remain high through FY2007, and the program's overall cost was projected to stay above FY2001 levels until at least FY2009. The EPA's Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the financial impact of hardrock mining sites on the trust fund. The EPA's Office of Inspector General identified 156 hardrock mining sites nationwide with potential cleanup costs between $7 billion and $24 billion. There is uncertainty about risks to human health and the environment, as well as concerns about PRPs' ability to pay for cleanup. Cleanup delays in prior years were due to lack of funds, with only a portion of requested funding being allocated for construction activities. Seven sites received no construction funding, while five others received only a fraction of the requested amount. Long-Term Response Actions also received less funding than requested. In FY2003, the EPA's remedial action program faced a $175 million shortfall in funding, leading to delays in construction at multiple sites. The House Energy and Commerce Committee reported a $263.1 million funding shortfall in FY2004, resulting in construction delays at 19 sites. Congress could potentially increase appropriations to address these funding gaps. In FY2004, Congress did not provide the requested funding increases for the Superfund program, leading to a shortfall in appropriations. The President's budget proposals exceeded the amounts appropriated by Congress between FY2004 and FY2007. However, in FY2008, Congress appropriated more than requested. RFF projects funding needs for the Superfund program, highlighting competing interests for Congress due to limited available funds from sources other than general revenues. The adequacy of funding for Superfund and whether to reinstate the Superfund taxes have sparked debate. RFF estimates up to $1.5 billion per year from general Treasury revenue may be needed to finance Superfund. EPA Administrator opposes reinstating the tax on the chemical industry and seeks to fund cleanups through increased efficiency. Johnson plans to fund additional cleanups through increased program efficiency, focusing on responsible parties to cover costs instead of taxpayers."
