    "content": "100-PERCENT CAPITAL GAIN EXCLUSION FOR INDIVIDUALS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new section allowing a deduction for capital gains. For taxable years with a net capital gain, individuals can deduct 100 percent of the gain from gross income. Estates and trusts calculate the deduction by excluding gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets that are includible by income beneficiaries. A transitional rule limits the net capital gain taken into account for taxable years including January 1, 1995. The capital gain under subsection (a) is limited to the net capital gain determined by gains and losses from January 1, 1995 onwards. If the net capital gain exceeds this amount, the tax rate imposed on the excess shall not exceed 28 percent. Special rules apply for pass-thru entities where gains and losses are determined at the entity level. The term 'pass-thru entity' includes regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds. A new deduction for capital gains of individuals is allowed in computing adjusted gross income. Conforming amendments are made regarding the exclusion for gain from certain small entities.
