    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Andrew Carnegie Libraries for Lifelong Learning Act\" and amends the Library Services and Technology Act to provide grants to states for public library construction and technology enhancement. The Director will award grants to States with approved State plans for public library construction or technology enhancement. Construction includes new buildings, expansion, remodeling, equipment purchase, lease, and installation. The term 'equipment' includes remodeling for accessibility, safety, energy conservation, new technologies, and historic building purchases for public libraries. The term 'equipment' for public libraries includes information technologies, machinery, utilities, and necessary structures. A 'public library' serves residents free of charge and receives financial support from public funds. A public library provides free services to the public, offers extensive collections for scholarly research, disseminates humanistic knowledge, and is not part of a higher education institution. Technology enhancement refers to acquiring, installing, maintaining, or replacing substantial technological equipment. The chapter discusses the acquisition or replacement of technological equipment for accessing information in electronic formats. The provisions of this subtitle do not apply to this chapter. \"SEC. 242. USES OF FEDERAL FUNDS.\" A State can use funds from section 244 to cover half the cost of construction or technology enhancement of public libraries. The remaining cost can be covered by State, local, or private sources. If a public library facility built with grant funds is completed within 20 years, a special rule applies. If a recipient of grant funds ceases to be a public or nonprofit institution, or if the facility is no longer used as a library, the United States can recover an amount proportional to the value of the facility at that time. The value will be determined by the parties or through legal action in the district court. The State must include a description of library construction or technology activities in its plan to receive a grant under this chapter. $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2000 and the following 4 years for this purpose."
