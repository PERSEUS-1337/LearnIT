    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Land Sovereignty Protection Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that the power to regulate US lands is vested in Congress under the Constitution, some international land designations require laws enacted by Congress, and programs like the US Biosphere Reserve operate independently. Actions by the United States in designating lands may impact nearby non-Federal lands, affecting state sovereignty and private property rights. This can conflict with congressional responsibilities and state capabilities. The Act reaffirms Congress's authority over international agreements concerning US lands to protect state powers and individual rights from federal actions. Federal actions designate lands under international agreements to impose use restrictions, protect private property interests, and establish a process for US land designation. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN WORLD HERITAGE SITE LISTING. Section 401 of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 is amended to restrict the Secretary of the Interior from nominating US-owned lands for the World Heritage List unless commercially viable uses are found for the nominated lands and surrounding areas. The Secretary of the Interior must ensure that the inclusion of nominated lands on the World Heritage List will not adversely affect existing uses, submit a report on natural resources and impacts, and have the nomination authorized by a specific law. The President may propose legislation for a nomination after a finding is published. The Secretary of the Interior must object to including US properties on the World Heritage in Danger list unless a report on necessity, natural resources, and impacts is submitted. The Secretary of the Interior must submit an annual report on each World Heritage Site in the US, detailing money spent on site management. The Secretary is authorized to approve property inclusion on the list through a joint resolution of Congress. The annual report for each US World Heritage Site must include an account of expenses, federal hours dedicated to site management, contributions from non-governmental organizations, and a summary of complaints received by the Secretary regarding site management. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AND TERMINATION OF UNAUTHORIZED UNITED NATIONS BIOSPHERE RESERVES. Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 prohibits Federal officials from nominating any lands in the United States for designation as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Program of UNESCO. Any existing designations as Biosphere Reserves will not have any force or effect unless specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of enactment of the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act and before December 31, 2003. The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act prohibits Federal officials from nominating any lands in the United States for designation as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Program of UNESCO. Existing designations as Biosphere Reserves require a management plan to ensure no adverse effects on State or local government revenue and to prevent limitations on adjacent non-Federal property use. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report on each Biosphere Reserve's expenditures for management. The summarized chunk includes requirements for reporting on the management of Biosphere Reserves, such as accounting for expenditures, detailing federal hours spent on management, listing contributing organizations, and reporting on complaints received by the Secretary. SEC. 5. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN GENERAL. Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 is amended to require specific authorization by law for any federal official to nominate, classify, or designate US lands for special use under international agreements. State or local government-owned lands also require specific authorization by state law for such nominations, classifications, or designations to be valid. The section specifies that any nomination, classification, or designation of privately owned lands under international agreements requires written consent from the landowner. Exceptions include agreements under specific acts like the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and conventions mentioned in the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978. The term 'international agreement' encompasses various types of agreements between the US or its agencies and foreign entities with a primary conservation purpose. The term 'international agreement' refers to agreements between the US or its agencies and foreign entities with a primary conservation purpose. SEC. 6. CLERICAL AMENDMENT.

Deals with agreements on the disposal, management, and use of US lands.

The President can propose legislation for such agreements to Congress. Passed the House of Representatives on May 20, 1999."
