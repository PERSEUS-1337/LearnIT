    "content": "The \"21st Century Master Teacher Act\" is the short title of the Act. It amends Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include a new part called the Master Teacher Program. The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that a significant number of newly hired teachers lack proper training and do not meet state standards. Additionally, many individuals without the required training have entered teaching with emergency licenses. Only a small percentage of education schools meet professional standards, and a low number of teachers have studied child development or have degrees in their subject areas. Nearly a quarter of secondary school teachers, including over 30% of math teachers, lack a college minor in their subject area. 64% of urban school districts hire uncertified teachers under emergency certifications, with 40% allowing long-term substitute teachers. The purposes of this part are to establish master teacher programs, improve student performance at schools, fund efforts for teachers to become board certified, and provide salary incentives for teachers to become board certified. The definitions in this part include 'board certified' as meeting requirements for certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, 'master teacher' as certified by the National Board and teaching for at least 3 years, and 'novice teacher' as teaching for no more than 3 years at a public school. The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies to establish master teacher programs, giving priority to agencies that provide funding and salary incentives for teachers to become board certified. Grants should be distributed among schools geographically. The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies to establish master teacher programs for a duration of 5 years. The amount of the grant is based on the total appropriation for the fiscal year and the concentration of uncertified or provisionally certified teachers in the school district. The programs provide funding for teachers to become board certified, including the certification fee. The grant programs provide funding for teachers to become board certified, including the certification fee, and offer salary incentives for certified teachers. \"SEC. 2355. APPLICATIONS.\" A local educational agency seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with program activities, goals, objectives, and measurement methods outlined. The Secretary will determine approval of grant applications based on recommendations from a peer review panel and other relevant criteria. The panel considers factors outlined in section 2354(a) when making recommendations. Payments are made annually under this part, with a limit of 2 percent for administrative costs. Failure to meet performance goals may result in denial of grant payments for the following year. Reports are required under section 2357. The Secretary must submit a report to the Senate and House committees on program activities funded under this part within 6 months of receiving reports from local educational agencies. Each agency receiving a grant must report on the effectiveness of the program in increasing student achievement and teacher certification by March 31, 2004. Additionally, there is a matching requirement under section 2358. The Secretary may not award a grant to a local educational agency under section 2354 unless the agency agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 25 percent of the grant amount. Additionally, there is a repayment of funds requirement under section 2359. In programs providing assistance for teachers to pay for National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification, teachers must agree to complete the certification program and teach in the public school system for at least 5 years. If a teacher breaches these agreements, they are liable to repay the certification fee to the local educational agency. Teachers who voluntarily withdraw, are dismissed, or fail to comply with the certification program agreement may face liability for repayment. The Secretary can waive or suspend liability if compliance is impossible or would cause extreme hardship. Any amount owed to a local educational agency must be paid by a certain date. The amount owed to a local educational agency must be paid within 3 years of the agency becoming entitled to it. Authorization of appropriations for the Competency Examination Program is set at $50,000,000 annually from 2000 to 2004. Grants for competency examinations are provided under this program. The Secretary will collaborate with the Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering to create an advanced competency exam for math and science teachers. Grants may be given to local educational agencies to supplement salaries of teachers who pass the exam. An additional $2500 in salary must be provided to these teachers by the agency. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 for this program. SEC. 204A. INFORMATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary may conduct information campaigns to promote professional opportunities in elementary or secondary education, publicizing Federal assistance availability. This section is exempt from certain provisions, and appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2004."
