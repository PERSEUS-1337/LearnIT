    "content": "UPDATED OR NEW MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR HIGHLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES. The Secretary of Transportation will issue a final rule requiring safety assessment certifications for entities developing highly automated vehicles or automated driving systems, specifying which entities need to submit certifications and the required test results and data. The final rule will require safety assessment certifications for entities developing highly automated vehicles or automated driving systems, specifying the necessary submissions and updates. Until the rule takes effect, safety assessment letters must be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as outlined in the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy. The guidance issued on highly automated vehicles requires a safety assessment letter. The Secretary must periodically review and update the rule every 5 years. The rule does not limit the Secretary's authority to deploy or test highly automated vehicles. The Secretary is required to review and research Federal motor vehicle safety standards for highly automated vehicles within 180 days of the enactment of the section. No new authorities are granted other than the promulgation of the rule. The Secretary must develop a rulemaking and safety priority plan within one year of the section's enactment to update and issue new motor vehicle safety standards for highly automated vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must develop a plan detailing priorities for the next 5 years, including safety standards for highly automated vehicles and other safety initiatives. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should identify elements for performance standards in highly automated vehicles, including human-machine interface, sensors, actuators, software, and cybersecurity. The plan must be updated every 2 years, or more frequently if necessary. The Secretary must initiate rulemaking proceedings on updated or new motor vehicle safety standards within 18 months of the enactment of this section. The Secretary must initiate rulemaking proceedings in accordance with a safety priority plan, with the ability to change priorities as needed. An interim update of the priority plan must be completed, made public, and submitted to relevant committees. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 301 of subtitle VI of title 49, United States Code, is amended by inserting a new item after section 30128. The text introduces updated motor vehicle safety standards for highly automated vehicles, including a definition of \"automated driving system\" as the hardware and software capable of performing the entire driving task. The curr_chunk defines the \"dynamic driving task\" as the real-time functions needed to operate a vehicle in traffic, excluding strategic functions. It includes lateral and longitudinal vehicle control, monitoring the environment, response execution, maneuver planning, and enhancing conspicuity. The curr_chunk introduces the definition of a \"highly automated vehicle\" as a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial motor vehicles. It also defines \"operational design domain\" as the specific conditions for a driving automation system to function. If a revision is made to the definition of a \"highly automated vehicle\" in Recommended Practice Report J3016, the Secretary must be notified. The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register unless they determine that the new definition does not meet safety needs. If rejected, the existing definition will remain in effect. If the Secretary does not reject a revised definition by SAE International, conforming amendments will be made promptly. The Secretary may update definitions if circumstances regarding highly automated vehicles change. SEC. 2. HEADLAMPS. The Secretary of Transportation must conduct research to update motor vehicle safety standards for headlamps within 2 years of this Act. After the research, the Secretary will either revise the standards through rulemaking or provide a report if revisions are not deemed necessary. If the standard described in paragraph (1) does not meet requirements, the Secretary must report to relevant committees on reasons for not revising it."
