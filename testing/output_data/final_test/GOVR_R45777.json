    "content": "Before Congress enacted LMR in 1999, the USDA AMS collected livestock and meat price information from meat packers on a voluntary basis. Market reporters gathered prices from auctions, feedlots, and packing plants, disseminating the data through various USDA reports. The goal was to provide accurate market information to buyers and sellers. The livestock industry saw changes in the 1990s, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, production specialization, and vertical integration. Fewer animals were sold through negotiated sales. The livestock industry saw changes in the 1990s, with fewer animals sold through negotiated sales. An increasing number of purchases were made under alternative marketing arrangements, such as formula purchases based on future negotiated prices. Some producers called for mandatory price reporting to assess fair market prices. USDA estimated significant underreporting of transactions before the enactment of LMR in 1999. Opponents argued that the mandate would impose costly burdens on the industry and could lead to the release of confidential company information. Livestock producers and meat packers initially opposed the LMR law due to concerns about industry burdens and confidentiality. However, some opponents eventually supported the law as a way to strengthen market prices. LMR was enacted in October 1999 as part of the FY2000 Agriculture appropriations act, mandating price reporting for various livestock products. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) law was enacted in October 1999, with regulations to be implemented within 180 days. USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000, making reporting for lamb mandatory. The implementation of LMR did not affect the AMS voluntary price-reporting program. LMR authority lapsed in 2004 and 2005 before being extended. In September 2005, USDA requested packers to voluntarily submit required information for the Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) program. About 90% of packers complied, allowing USDA to continue publishing reports. In October 2006, Congress reauthorized LMR through September 2010, amending swine reporting requirements. Due to a lapse in statutory authority, USDA had to reestablish regulatory authority through rulemaking in May 2008 to enhance the program's effectiveness and efficiency. The Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2010 was signed into law on September 27, 2010, reauthorizing the Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) program through September 30, 2015. This act included a provision for LMR of wholesale pork cuts, following a study that showed benefits from mandatory pork reporting. The USDA established a committee with representatives from various sectors to develop recommendations for mandatory wholesale pork reporting. The final rule was released on August 22, 2012, and implemented on January 7, 2013. The Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 extended LMR through September 30, 2020, and addressed issues raised by livestock stakeholders. The Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54) extended Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) through September 30, 2020. It established a negotiated formula purchase reporting category for swine and amended swine LMR by requiring reporting of low and high range of net swine prices. The act also amended lamb reporting regulations to redefine lamb importers and lamb packers. The Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 extended Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) through September 30, 2020. It amended lamb reporting regulations by redefining lamb importers and lamb packers. Importers now need to import an average of 1,000 metric tons (MT) of lamb meat per year, down from the original threshold of 2,500 MT. Lamb packers are defined as entities with 50% or more ownership in facilities that processed an average of 35,000 head per year, down from the original threshold of 75,000 head. The Secretary of Agriculture may still determine an entity as an importer or packer based on certain criteria. Additionally, the reauthorization required a study on the price-reporting program for cattle, swine, and lamb. LMR requires livestock buyers and sellers to report prices and transaction details. Ten types of transactions are reported, including negotiated purchases. Confidentiality requirements, reporting, and enforcement measures are also discussed. Negotiated grid purchase and forward contracts are methods for determining base prices for livestock through seller-buyer interaction and agreement on delivery day. Cattle must be delivered within specific timeframes, with premiums and discounts added or subtracted. Formula marketing arrangements involve advance commitments for slaughter using publicly available prices as reference. The curr_chunk discusses different methods of purchasing livestock for slaughter, including swine or pork market formula purchases, negotiated formula purchases, other market formula purchases, and other purchase arrangements. These methods involve pricing mechanisms based on market prices or futures/options contracts. Sales of livestock for slaughter can be categorized as producer- or packer-sold, with packer-sold swine being those owned by a packer for more than 14 days before slaughter. Packer-owned livestock are also reported, including weight and dressing percent. Meat packers must report negotiated sales, formula sales, and forward contracts for various meats. The text discusses different types of sales in the livestock industry, including negotiated sales, formula marketing arrangements, forward sales, and export sales. It also shows a trend towards formula-based purchases over negotiated purchases since 2002. In May 2019, negotiated purchases accounted for about 25% of cattle purchases, with almost 50% of cattle traded on a negotiated basis. The trend in negotiated purchases for swine decreased from 17% in January 2002 to less than 2% in February 2019. AMS does not disclose the number of lambs sold on a formula basis due to confidentiality requirements. In 2016, 40% of lambs were purchased on a negotiated basis and 60% on a formula basis. AMS currently reports detailed information on purchased lambs, including weight, price range, and average price for negotiated purchases. The text discusses the average weight, net price, and dressing percent for LMR reports on cattle, swine, lamb, beef, pork, and lamb meat. It also covers reporting requirements, confidentiality, and enforcement of LMR regulations. Packers subject to mandatory reporting are federally inspected plants that have slaughtered a minimum number of animals. Packers subject to mandatory reporting are federally inspected plants that have slaughtered a minimum annual average of 125,000 head of cattle, 100,000 head of swine, 200,000 head of sows and boars, or a combination thereof. USDA determines reporting requirements based on plant capacity. Packers must report prices for various livestock categories multiple times daily, along with premiums, discounts, and purchase transaction types. Packers are required to report quantity, weight, quality characteristics, and type of purchase for steers, heifers, swine, and lambs. Weekly reports are filed for previous week's purchases, including premiums, discounts, and carcass characteristics. Swine packers also report premiums paid. Swine packers must report premiums based on noncarcass characteristics and provide producers with a list of such premiums. Packers are required to report sales data for boxed beef, wholesale pork, and carcass and boxed lamb, including price, quantity, quality grade, and type of cut. Sales are reported twice daily for beef and pork and once daily for lamb. Packers must also report beef and pork domestic and export sales, as well as domestic boxed lamb sales. Lamb importers meeting specific criteria must report weekly lamb prices, quantities imported, type of sale, cuts of lamb, and delivery period. Price reporting is confidential to protect packer information. The LMR law requires confidential price reporting to protect packer identity and proprietary information. Initially, AMS used a \"3/60\" guideline for data publication, but due to industry concentration, gaps in reporting occurred. To address this, a \"3/70/20\" guideline was adopted in August 2001, requiring at least three entities to report 50% of the time over the most recent 60-day period. The Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News Division of the AMS enforces guidelines to ensure data accuracy, with no single entity reporting more than 70% of volume or being the sole reporter for a specific report more than 20% of the time. This has reduced data gaps and improved information dissemination. The Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News Division of the AMS provides data for livestock slaughter and meat production, covering a significant percentage of the market. The AMS enforces compliance through audits every six months, classifying violations as major or minor. The program operates on an annual budget of $34 million, with the LMR program accounting for about $4 million of that amount. In FY2018, AMS issued 369 noncompliance violations (270 major and 99 minor) during audits of 457 plants and 4,389 audited. Violations can result in fines up to $10,000 per violation if corrective action is not taken, with the right to appeal within 30 days. AMS switched to semiannual compliance reports in FY2015. AMS issued 369 noncompliance violations (270 major and 99 minor) during audits of 457 plants and 4,389 audited lots in FY2018. Stakeholders from the cattle, swine, and lamb industries provided feedback on the LMR program, with concerns including limited market volume, confidentiality, and clarity in transaction categorization. Some stakeholders requested more detailed information on transactions, such as premiums and changes in reporting on livestock committed to packers. AMS has already made reporting changes to address industry concerns. The baseline study commissioned by AMS found that the meatpacking industry has become more concentrated and vertically integrated since the establishment of LMR. Producers are turning to vertical integration to stay competitive, responding to consumer demand with new product differentiation. Changes in livestock and meat trading show a shift towards formula pricing and other arrangements over negotiated trades. The study highlighted the increasing use of new platforms for pricing in the livestock industry, such as internet auctions. The loss of LMR data during the 2013 government shutdown impacted market evaluation. Structural changes in the industry, like concentration and integration, pose challenges for confidentiality in reporting. The effectiveness of LMR in providing relevant market information may need to be reassessed in light of changes like branded or specialty programs not captured by LMR. International trade in meat also plays a significant role. The study highlighted the need for more market information on exported meat products to enhance transparency. Timely collaboration with the industry is crucial for the usefulness of LMR. Stakeholders in the cattle, swine, and lamb industries provided comments and suggestions to AMS, focusing on changes to LMR reporting. Cattle stakeholders raised concerns about delivery period reporting, leading AMS to add a 15-30 day delivery period in 2008. AMS conducted a study in response to confidentiality guidelines preventing data reporting, resulting in deliveries being reported as 0-30 days. In response to concerns about delivery period reporting, AMS began reporting weighted average negotiated cattle prices for 0-14 and 15-30 day delivery periods in November 2017. Some in the cattle industry called for more reporting on committed cattle, similar to how hog packers report commitments for the next 14 days. However, some cattle stakeholders argue that additional data on committed cattle may be misleading due to smaller market numbers compared to swine. Stakeholders in the swine industry expressed concerns about low transaction volumes in negotiated markets and questioned if LMR can accurately capture market dynamics. Swine stakeholders expressed skepticism about LMR's ability to capture market information on consumer preferences for pork. They recommended legislative changes including removing the \"negotiated formula purchase\" definition and revising reporting on noncarcass premiums. The USDA is proposing changes to swine market reporting, including adjusting attribute premiums, base prices, and net prices by purchase type. They also plan to redefine affiliate ownership thresholds and report swine or pork market formula transactions based on the pork carcass cutout. Additionally, they will no longer require reporting wholesale pork on a free-on-board (FOB) Omaha basis due to industry preferences. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry faces challenges in price reporting, leading to the discontinuation of lamb formula purchases reporting. The study commissioned by AMS on lamb data and confidentiality found it is not feasible to relax guidelines. Alternatives suggested include publishing a comprehensive report and developing a standardized pricing model. Concerns were raised about price information for cooperative-owned and custom slaughtered lambs, which AMS addressed by adding prices and carcass weight information for cooperative-owned lambs in November 2017. Custom slaughter involves lambs being slaughtered on contract and priced per head, with carcasses sold to a processor for fabrication. Some stakeholders are requesting reporting of the number of lambs committed to be delivered to packers, but there is disagreement due to concerns about providing market information to import competitors. Proposed amendments for the reauthorization of LMR include lowering the reporting threshold for lamb packers, defining and requiring reporting of custom slaughtered lambs, and defining and requiring reporting of committed lambs. LMR has increased market transparency over the past 20 years, with livestock stakeholders generally supportive of it. Livestock stakeholders support LMR reauthorization for market transparency. Congress evaluates law's effectiveness amid industry changes. USDA report on LMR program serves as basis for possible 2020 reauthorization. AMS engages industry on reporting issues. Stakeholders offer proposals for Congress to consider. During reauthorization, Congress may consider legislation to strengthen Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) and assess if additional regulatory authority is needed for the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) to address LMR issues. Stakeholders are interested in adjusting confidentiality requirements and expanding reporting for certain attributes in response to evolving livestock markets."
