    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans-Specific Education for Tomorrow's Medical Doctors Act\" or the \"VET MD Act.\" It establishes a pilot program for clinical observation by pre-med students. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a three-year pilot program for undergraduate students to observe clinical experiences at VA medical centers. The program aims to increase awareness, knowledge, and empathy towards veterans' medical conditions, diversify the recruitment pool of future physicians, provide diverse clinical observation experiences for medical school applications, and expand opportunities for clinical observation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will select five medical centers for a pilot program offering clinical observation sessions to undergraduate students. Each session will accommodate at least 20 students for a minimum of 60 observational hours, aiming to diversify the recruitment pool for future physicians. The pilot program at five medical centers offers clinical observation sessions to undergraduate students. Each session lasts 4-6 months with a minimum of 60 observational hours. Students observe practicing physicians and gain exposure to various aspects of medical care and health care administration. The Secretary may prioritize areas with staffing shortages like women's health and psychiatric care. The pilot program at medical centers offers clinical observation sessions to undergraduate students in science or medical programs. Priority is given to students from health professional shortage areas and those who are the first in their immediate family to pursue higher education. The Secretary will establish requirements for student observers in the pilot program, including formal status, legal and ethical guidelines, and standardized application procedures. The Secretary will establish requirements for student observers in the pilot program, including creating an online information page, identifying medical centers and clinicians, notifying Committees on Veterans' Affairs, publishing center locations and program information, and establishing follow-up procedures for accepted students. The Secretary will submit a report on the pilot program results, including applicant demographics, acceptance rates, completion rates, and feedback from student observers."
