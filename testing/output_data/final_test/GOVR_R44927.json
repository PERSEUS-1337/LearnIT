    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2018, comparing enacted FY2017 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request, and response measures. It includes additional resources on DHS appropriations, a list of CRS policy experts, and tracks legislative action and issues related to discretionary funding for DHS. The curr_chunk discusses the appropriations legislation related to DHS programs, activities, and fee revenues, explaining budgetary concepts and terms. It emphasizes that all amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority for precision in calculations. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on the data sources for FY2017, FY2018 requested, and FY2018 enacted levels in DHS appropriations reports. Data is derived from specific legislative acts and includes unrounded figures for accuracy in calculations. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the process of enacting appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2018, cautioning against comparing data developed with different methodologies. The Trump Administration released a 53-page budget outline for FY2018, requesting $44.1 billion in net discretionary budget authority for DHS, including $4.5 billion for border security and immigration programs. The Trump Administration requested $44.00 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2018, representing a 3.8% increase from the previous year. The overall budget request for DHS was part of an estimated $70.69 billion budget, including fees and trust funds. The Administration requested an additional $6.79 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and a transfer of $162 million in OCO funding for the Department of Defense. The House Committee on Appropriations reported out H.R. 3355, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, with $44.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2018, $327 million above the Administration's request and $1.92 billion above the enacted level for FY2017. The House committee-reported bill for FY2018 included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding and provided Coast Guard OCO funding through H.R. 3219. The House later considered H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, which contained four annual appropriations bills but not the annual appropriations for DHS. On July 26, 2017, H.R. 3219 began consideration under a structured rule. The House adopted a rule (H.Res. 478) for additional amendments to H.R. 3219, including one by Chairman John Carter for a Procurement, Construction, and Improvements appropriation for CBP. The amendment allocated $1,571,239,000 for border barrier construction, with specific amounts for fencing in Texas and California as recommended by the House Committee on Appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended specific amounts for border infrastructure construction in H.Rept. 115-239. An amendment in H.R. 3355 was considered as adopted without a separate vote. A motion to strike the funding failed. The House took up the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act (H.R. 3354) with modifications to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 was modified by the House Appropriations Committee to reduce CBP's Procurement, Construction, and Improvement appropriation for border barrier planning and construction. Specific legislative direction was added for the remaining appropriation, exceeding the committee report. The bill also included new general provisions for a stand-alone committee-reported bill in a consolidated appropriations bill. On September 6, 2017, the House combined H.R. 3354 with H.R. 3219, creating a single bill with all annual appropriations. The House combined H.R. 3354 with H.R. 3219 to create a single bill for FY2018 appropriations. The border barrier funding remained separate in Division M. Division E of H.R. 3354 was amended during floor debate, reducing appropriations for certain accounts while increasing funding for others. The bill passed the House on September 14, 2017 with $45.2 billion in adjusted net. The House passed a bill with $45.2 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority and $6.8 billion in disaster relief appropriations. The Senate released a draft bill with $44.1 billion for DHS and additional funding for disaster relief and emergency purposes. Supplemental appropriations were provided in P.L. 115-31 for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund in response to hurricanes and wildfires in 2017. The Trump Administration requested $12.7 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and $16 billion for the National Flood Insurance Fund. The House passed a bill with $18.67 billion for the DRF, allowing funds to be transferred to other programs as well. The Trump Administration requested additional funding for disaster relief and recovery efforts, including $44.0 billion for FY2018. H.R. 4667 was introduced in response, seeking roughly $81 billion in total funding for various programs, including $28.6 billion for DHS. The bill H.R. 4667 included $28.6 billion for DHS. It passed the House and was sent to the Senate. The Senate later passed an amendment with over $84 billion in disaster assistance funding, including $24.7 billion for DHS. The amended bill passed the House as well. On February 9, 2018, an amended bill was signed into law by President Trump as P.L. 115-123 after passing the House by a vote of 240-186. On March 22, 2018, a resolution was reported out by the House Rules Committee for a consolidated appropriations bill as an amendment to H.R. 1625, which included all twelve annual appropriations measures and modifications to disaster relief funding. The bill also included the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, providing $47.7 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill includes annual funding for DHS operations, with discretionary appropriations making up the majority of the budget. The bill also designates funds for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations. The House and Senate passed the amended bill, which was signed into law as P.L. 115-141. In 2003, components of various agencies were consolidated within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over a few months. Instead of creating new appropriations structures, Congress and the Administration continued to use existing accounts. In 2014, DHS started working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. DHS noted in 2015 that having \"over 70 different appropriations and over 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities\" hindered transparency and decision-making. After negotiations, DHS implemented its first budget request in the CAS for FY2017. The Department of Homeland Security implemented a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) for FY2017, except for the Coast Guard. A visual representation of the FY2018 enacted funding in this new structure shows how funding is distributed across DHS components. Prior to the FY2017 act, appropriations for DHS were organized into five titles, with different components receiving funding from various categories. The legislative language often included specific directions or conditions on how the budget could be used. In the FY2017 act, provisions within appropriations and general provisions provided guidance to components. In the FY2017 act, appropriations for DHS were organized into five titles with specific directions on how the budget could be used. Provisions within appropriations and general provisions provided guidance to components. In FY2018, administrative provisions were grouped at the ends of titles where components are funded. Tables compare FY2017 enacted and FY2018 requested and enacted appropriations for the department. The tables summarize resources provided, requested, recommended, and enacted for each component. Data includes enacted annual and supplemental appropriations. The text discusses appropriations for DHS in FY2017 and FY2018, detailing how the budget was organized and used.

Additionally, funding for specific initiatives like Financial Systems Modernization and Presidential Residence Protection costs are reflected in the appropriations. For more information on FY2018 DHS appropriations, refer to CRS Report R44604. The DHS appropriations process involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays, with funds being obligated and payments made to liquidate those obligations. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. For more information, refer to CRS reports on DHS appropriations. The Antideficiency Act limits federal agencies from obligating more funds than authorized by Congress through budget authority, which can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year. One-year budget authority expires at the end of the fiscal year, while multiyear and no-year authority allow spending over a specified period or indefinitely. Obligations occur when agencies hire personnel, enter contracts, or receive services. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Outlays represent the actual funds spent during a fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up the gross budget authority, with discretionary spending not mandated by law. Appropriations acts fund discretionary funded agencies and programs, as well as appropriated entitlement programs each year. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds are collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes discretionary spending funded by Congress each year, which may be offset by fee or fund collections. These collections can offset discretionary or mandatory spending, with entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts being examples of mandatory spending funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget includes entitlements funded by permanent or annual appropriations, as well as Trust and Public Enterprise Funds. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The congressional budget process involves two stages: 302(a) allocations are discretionary funds available to House and Senate Appropriations Committees for annual appropriations bills, while 302(b) allocations are the distribution of these funds among subcommittees. These allocations enforce budget discipline to prevent exceeding the discretionary allocation. Adjustments can be made during the year by the Appropriations Committee. The committee issues a report outlining revised suballocations for appropriations bills. Table A-1 compares 302(b) allocations for FY2017 and FY2018. The Budget Control Act sets discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending. Adjustments can be made to these caps. The Budget Control Act sets discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending, with adjustments allowed for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other purposes. DHS's appropriations process has been influenced by these adjustments, with disaster relief funding determined by OMB until FY2019. The cap adjustment for the fiscal year is calculated based on a rolling average of disaster relief spending over the last ten years, with adjustments made for unused amounts from the previous year. The allowable adjustment for FY2018 was $7.366 billion, supporting appropriations to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the allowable adjustment by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act, amounting to $6.296 billion. OMB will release a sequestration update report for FY2019 in August 2018, including the new official estimate for the allowable adjustment."
