Despite efforts, CDC reports that 1 in 6 Americans get sick from contaminated food each year, with 48 million affected and 128,000 hospitalized. The U.S. food supply faces various health hazards, including pathogens, unapproved drugs, and pesticides. Concerns have increased due to food safety incidents, leading to scrutiny and congressional interest. Multiple agencies regulate food safety, with the FDA and FSIS having primary federal responsibility. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the FDA are key federal agencies responsible for ensuring the safety and labeling of food products in the U.S. State and local authorities also play a role in food safety inspections. The Government Accountability Office has identified multiple federal agencies collectively administering laws related to food safety. The FDA and USDA have distinct responsibilities for food safety, rooted in early U.S. food regulation history. The Pure Food and Drugs Act and Meat Inspection Act of 1906 created separate frameworks for addressing adulterated foods and unsanitary meat packing conditions. This organizational complexity and trends in U.S. food markets pose ongoing challenges to ensuring food safety. The bifurcated system of food safety responsibilities in the US began with the Pure Food and Drugs Act and Meat Inspection Act of 1906, assigning meat inspection to USDA and other food safety activities to various agencies. Over time, there have been debates on whether this dispersion of responsibilities has been problematic. The history of food safety in the United States is marked by a fragmented oversight system with multiple federal agencies responsible for different aspects of food safety. Reports from the GAO, NRC, and IOM highlight the need for a unified agency with clear responsibilities and budget to avoid duplication of efforts. The FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety of most domestic and imported foods in the U.S., excluding meats and poultry. They ensure that food products are safe, nutritious, and accurately labeled, including produce, dairy, processed foods, seafood, and shellfish. FDA also has jurisdiction over certain meats and shares responsibility for egg safety with FSIS. The FDA is responsible for implementing and enforcing various acts related to food safety, conducting inspections of food establishments and vehicles in interstate commerce. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was a significant legislative update to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to expand FDA's food safety authorities. FSMA focused on FDA's food inspection regime for domestic and imported foods. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) in Washington, DC, oversees food safety research, regulations, surveillance, compliance programs, and state cooperation. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) ensures the safety of animal drugs, feeds, and veterinary devices. The FDA collaborates with state agencies for food safety regulatory activities, setting standards for food establishments, and evaluating states' performance in upholding these standards. FSIS regulates the safety, wholesomeness, and labeling of meat and poultry products for human consumption, overseeing roughly 10%-20% of the U.S. food supply. Inspectors are placed in slaughterhouses, processing plants, warehouses, and other locations where these products are handled. The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) give USDA authority to inspect and label meat, poultry, and egg products for human consumption. The Egg Products Inspection Act allows USDA to inspect liquid, frozen, and dried egg products. Under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, USDA's FSIS provides voluntary inspection for various meat and poultry species on a fee-for-service basis. FDA has jurisdiction over these species in interstate commerce, including shell eggs. The 2008 farm bill mandates FSIS to inspect and grade farmed catfish products. Meat and poultry animals undergo 100% inspection for disease and contamination. FSIS inspects meat and poultry animals for disease and contamination before and after slaughter on a continuous basis. Federal inspectors are present during all operating hours of processing plants. Inspectors monitor operations, check sanitary conditions, review records, and conduct testing for pathogens and residues. FSIS also certifies foreign meat and poultry plants before they can export to the United States. Before exporting their products to the United States, foreign meat and poultry plants must meet safety standards equivalent to the U.S. system. Inspections are conducted by FSIS to ensure compliance, with 27 states having their own inspection programs. Plants under state inspection can only sell within the state, and if a state's program is deemed inadequate, FSIS takes over inspection responsibilities. FSIS works with states for meat and poultry plant inspections. If state programs are inadequate, FSIS takes over. CDC monitors foodborne diseases and collaborates with FDA and USDA on control methods. FoodNet improves data collection on outbreaks. FoodNet improves data collection on foodborne illness outbreaks, providing a clearer picture of incidence and causes for CDC to establish baseline data for measuring changes in food safety programs. CDC's food safety-related activities are authorized by the Public Health Service Act, while FDA oversees the safety of seafood products. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) conducts a voluntary seafood inspection and grading program for domestic and imported seafood products. The program is funded by user fees and works with the FDA to ensure seafood safety. NMFS inspects 20% of seafood consumed in the United States, with approximately 160 inspectors. EPA is responsible for ensuring chemicals used on food crops do not endanger public health. EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs registers new pesticides and determines residue levels. The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs registers new pesticides, evaluates health and environmental data, and interacts with various stakeholders to inform them of regulatory actions. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as well as the FFDCA, are the primary authorities for EPA's activities in this area. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service establishes quality and marketing standards for various food products. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for certifying quality programs and conducting quality grading services for various foods. AMS ensures product quality, not food safety, by establishing quality grade standards under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. AMS also administers the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) to collect data on residual pesticides in over 50 different commodities, chosen based on EPA data needs and food consumption patterns, particularly for infants and children. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes a program for food safety research conducted by USDA's Agricultural Research Service. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service protects the food supply from pests and diseases. The Department of Homeland Security coordinates food security activities, including at U.S. borders. Funding and staffing levels between FDA and FSIS have historically been disproportionate. Funding and staffing levels between FDA and FSIS have historically been disproportionate. FSIS, responsible for 10%-20% of the U.S. food supply, received about 60% of the combined food safety budget, while FDA, responsible for 80%-90% of the food supply, received only 40% of the budget a few years ago. However, funding for FDA food activities has more than doubled in recent years, shifting the balance of overall funding for food safety between FDA and USDA. Funding for FSIS remained mostly unchanged to slightly lower overall, with additional limited funding provided through industry-paid user fees. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) authorized increased appropriations and staff for FDA's food safety activities, marking the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. FSMA mandated various provisions such as increased inspections at food facilities, tightened record-keeping requirements, extended oversight to certain farms, and required food facilities to conduct food safety plans and implement risk-based controls. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) mandated improvements to foodborne illness surveillance systems, increased scrutiny of food imports, and authorized appropriations for FDA's food safety activities. However, funding for FSMA implementation has been lower than needed, with an additional $400-450 million per year required for full implementation. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provided a $104.5 million increase in budget authority for FDA's food safety activities, including FSMA implementation. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) mandated an increase in food safety inspectors at FDA and expanded the agency's authority. FDA reported staffing levels below the mandated goal, with 3,700 FTEs in FY2015. FSIS staff numbers about 8,900 FTEs, with differences in inspection methods between FDA and FSIS. FSIS personnel inspect all meat and poultry animals at slaughter continuously, with at least one federal inspector present during operating hours. Processing inspection involves daily monitoring of plant adherence to standards for sanitary conditions, ingredients, and packaging, as well as statistical sampling and testing of products. Over 300,000 food facilities are registered with the FDA for potential inspection, with about 88,000 domestic and 212,000 foreign registrations. About 88,000 domestic and 212,000 foreign food facilities are registered with the FDA. FDA and states inspected 24,462 domestic and 1,342 foreign food facilities in FY2012. FDA conducts compliance inspections of domestic establishments every 5-10 years, focusing on high-risk facilities. FDA relies on industry notifications for inspections. The FDA relies on notifications from the industry or other inspection personnel to identify facilities needing increased inspection. FDA inspects about 2% of all imported food lines, using the PREDICT system to electronically screen entries. Import bulletins are issued to highlight specific products or producers for inspection. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) conducts inspections in 6,389 establishments, including Talmadge-Aiken plants supervised by federal inspectors. There are about 1,100 plants that slaughter or process livestock/poultry, over 4,000 facilities that only process meat/poultry, and around 80 facilities that process egg products. FSIS also reinspects imported meat and poultry products. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) conducts inspections in thousands of establishments, including plants that slaughter or process livestock/poultry, meat/poultry processing facilities, and egg product processing facilities. Imported meat, poultry, and egg products are also reinspected. Food safety issues in Congress fall under various committees' jurisdictions, including Agriculture, Nutrition, Forestry, Homeland Security, Governmental Affairs, Health, Education, Labor, Pensions, Energy, Commerce, Oversight, Government Reform, and Science, Space, Technology. House and Senate Agriculture Committees oversee USDA's meat and poultry inspection programs and other food safety programs. Under FSMA, FDA and USDA maintain separate authorities for various foods. Identifying committees of jurisdiction for specific laws and programs is complex, especially with split jurisdiction between FDA and USDA for some foods. FDA-regulated foods fall under the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Split jurisdiction between FDA and USDA for some foods due to fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among agencies administering laws and programs."
