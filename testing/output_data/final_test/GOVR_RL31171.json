    "content": "The Constitution of the United States outlines the process for appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court, involving nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. Various practices have been used over the years for unsuccessful nominations, including withdrawal, inaction, postponement, rejection, and filibuster. A total of 36 Supreme Court nominations have not been confirmed by the Senate, involving 31 individuals. Six of the 31 individuals nominated for the Supreme Court were later re-nominated and confirmed. William Paterson was one nominee who was not confirmed initially due to a constitutional violation but was later re-nominated and confirmed. President George W. Bush's nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr. to be an Associate Justice was later withdrawn after Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's death, and Roberts was then nominated and confirmed as Chief Justice on September 29, 2005. This nomination process differed from the other unsuccessful nominations that faced opposition in the Senate. President Rutherford B. Hayes and James A. Garfield, Pierce Butler, nominated twice by Warren G. Harding, and John Marshall Harlan II, nominated twice by Dwight D. Eisenhower. Taney's first nomination as Associate Justice was postponed indefinitely by the Senate. Matthews's first nomination was never reported out of committee, but he was later confirmed as Chief Justice. Butler's confirmation was blocked initially but later confirmed. Harlan's first nomination remained in committee, and his second nomination was pending at adjournment. President Tyler had the highest tally of unconfirmed Supreme Court nominations, with eight out of nine nominations not confirmed. John C. Spencer, Reuben H. Walworth, and Edward King were among the unsuccessful nominees during Tyler's presidency. Tyler nominated Spencer first, then Walworth, but both nominations were rejected by the Senate. On the last day of the congressional session, Tyler withdrew Walworth's nomination and re-nominated Spencer. Tyler withdrew Walworth's nomination and re-nominated Spencer, but failed to gain unanimous consent. He then withdrew Spencer's name and re-nominated Walworth. King's nomination was also tabled. Tyler later re-nominated Walworth and King at the start of the next congressional session, but both nominations were tabled and eventually withdrawn. Samuel Nelson was Tyler's fifth nominee to be confirmed, while William B. Hornblower faced rejection after being nominated twice by President Grover Cleveland. John Rutledge and Abe Fortas were both unsuccessful nominees for Chief Justice. Rutledge had previously served as an Associate Justice and Chief Justice under a recess appointment, while Fortas was a sitting Associate Justice when nominated for Chief Justice in 1968. Both nominations were rejected by the Senate. President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Henry Stanbery to replace John Catron as Chief Justice in 1968, but the nomination was filibustered in the Senate. At the same time, a bill was passed to decrease the number of Associate Justices in the Supreme Court from nine to six. Only one position was vacant at the time of Stanbery's nomination. The Republican Congress reduced the number of Associate Justice positions on the Supreme Court to thwart President Johnson's influence. The law was passed to increase the positions to eight at the beginning of President Grant's administration. Senate records often do not provide reasons for failed nominations, leading scholars to rely on other sources for insight. Scholars analyze records to understand reasons for unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations. Henry J. Abraham categorizes reasons as opposition to the president, nominee's stance on public issues, opposition to nominee's philosophy, opposition to the incumbent Court, and senatorial courtesy. Scholars analyze reasons for unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations, including opposition to the nominee's qualifications, political unreliability, lack of qualification, sustained opposition by interest groups, and fear of altering the Court's lineup. Some nominations do not fit these categories, like the first nomination of William Paterson and John G. Roberts, which were withdrawn and later confirmed. Opposition to the nominating President played a role in at least 16 of the 36 nominations that were not confirmed, many of which were made by Presidents in their last year of office. These \"lame duck\" nominations occurred after a successor had been elected but before the transfer of power to the new administration, mainly during the 19th century. Notable examples include John Quincy Adams nominating John J. Crittenden in 1828 and President Tyler's nominations after losing to James Polk. President James Buchanan nominated Jeremiah S. Black to the Senate shortly before Abraham Lincoln's inauguration. Opposition to the President was a significant factor in several unsuccessful nominations, including those by Fillmore, Johnson, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Nineteen Senators opposed any nomination by President Johnson during his last months in office. The opposition to Justice Fortas for Chief Justice was based on concerns about money received for delivering lectures, his close relationship with President Johnson, and his judicial philosophy. President Hayes nominated Stanley Matthews before the transfer of power to the Garfield administration. President Washington's unsuccessful nomination of John Rutledge in 1795 was the first based on political views. The Senate rejected John Rutledge's nomination due to his strong opposition to the Jay Treaty. Alexander Wolcott's nomination 15 years later was also rejected for his enforcement of controversial acts. Andrew Jackson's nomination of Roger B. Taney in 1835 faced opposition due to his views and the President's policies. President Jackson's nomination of Roger B. Taney faced opposition due to his removal of government deposits from the United States Bank. President Polk's nomination of George W. Woodward was rejected due to his nativist views. Ebenezer R. Hoar's nomination as Associate Justice in 1869 was opposed due to his actions as Attorney General. Hoar's nomination as Associate Justice in 1869 was rejected by the Senate due to his recommendations for circuit judge nominees, his advocacy for civil service reform, and his opposition to Andrew Johnson's impeachment. Matthews faced opposition for his ties to railroad and financial interests but was eventually confirmed by a close Senate vote. Butler's nomination also faced scrutiny before being confirmed. Pierce Butler and John J. Parker faced opposition before being confirmed as Supreme Court nominees. Butler's nomination was initially blocked due to alleged pro-corporation bias, while Parker faced opposition from the NAACP and organized labor for his racial views. In 1920, John J. Parker opposed African-Americans in politics and faced criticism for supporting \"yellow dog\" contracts. President Eisenhower's nomination of John Marshall Harlan II was initially blocked due to perceived liberal views and hostility towards the South. President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of Justice Abe Fortas in 1968 for Chief Justice failed due to his judicial philosophy, with some Senators criticizing him for being part of the Warren Court's \"extremist effort\" and lacking willingness to subject himself to judicial restraint. Opposition to Justice Fortas and Judge Haynsworth's nominations was based on perceived ethical lapses, close relationships with Presidents, and doubts about their judicial philosophies. The nomination of Judge Haynsworth faced opposition due to doubts about his record on the appellate bench, criticism from labor and minority groups, and ethical questions. President Nixon's nomination of G. Harrold Carswell in 1970 also faced opposition based on perceived views. The Committee on the Judiciary reported the nomination favorably with dissenting views citing concerns about his decisions and courtroom demeanor towards certain groups. The dissent in the rejection of Robert H. Bork's nomination in 1987 was mainly due to concerns about his competence and qualifications. The Senate rejected him based on his publicly stated positions and judicial philosophy, despite some concerns raised about his evaluation by the American Bar Association and his role in the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. This rejection was closely related to opposition to the incumbent Court's views and record. The rejection of Robert H. Bork's nomination in 1987 was mainly due to concerns about his competence and qualifications, as well as his publicly stated positions and judicial philosophy. This rejection was closely related to opposition to the incumbent Court's views and record. In contrast, the nomination of Abe Fortas for Chief Justice faced opposition due to his affiliation with the Warren Court and its wider reputation, reflecting individual Senator views and disagreements with Warren Court opinions during confirmation hearings. The failed Supreme Court nominations due to senatorial courtesy include Reuben H. Walworth and George W. Woodward, opposed by home-state Senators. William Hornblower and Wheeler H. Peckham's nominations were also unsuccessful in 1893-1894, attributed to New York Senators' opposition. No Supreme Court nomination since then has failed due to senatorial courtesy. President Grant's nominee for Chief Justice, Caleb Cushing, faced opposition due to his changing political affiliations, advanced age, and past connections. Interest groups have been involved in confirmation fights since 1881. Interest groups have been actively involved in Supreme Court confirmation fights since 1881, with their participation increasing over time. They have testified both in support and opposition of nominees, conducted research, lobbied Senators, and utilized various tactics to influence the confirmation process. The number of organized interest groups testifying at confirmation hearings has grown significantly, indicating a rise in their influence and involvement in the process. Interest groups have played a significant role in Supreme Court confirmation fights, with their opposition growing and proving effective in blocking confirmations. The Senate may also be hesitant to confirm nominees who could shift the Court's ideological balance. This was evident in the case of Robert H. Bork, whose nomination was opposed due to concerns about his conservative views altering the Court's composition. Opposition to Harriet E. Miers' nomination as Associate Justice stemmed from concerns over her perceived views, including a 1993 speech. Factors contributing to the nomination's failure were cited as Senate requests for White House documents. Various factors, similar to those in previous nomination cases, led to Miers' withdrawal. Some conservative observers expressed concern about Harriet E. Miers' ideological reliability due to her sparse record on controversial issues. Her nomination faced opposition over perceived lack of qualifications, interest group opposition, and fear of altering the Court. Concerns intensified as she met with Senators, and her response to the Senate questionnaire was scrutinized. Harriet E. Miers faced opposition from conservative groups due to perceived lack of qualifications and fear of not altering the Court as expected. Some conservatives doubted her ability to rule fairly due to her close proximity to the President as Counsel. The Senate Judiciary Committee has historically played a significant role in the confirmation process of Supreme Court nominations. Since 1816, the committee has been involved in reviewing unsuccessful nominations, with most nominations since 1868 being automatically referred to the committee. Seven unsuccessful nominations were never reported or discharged by the committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee has historically been involved in reviewing unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations. Seven nominations were never reported or discharged by the committee, including those of Homer Thornberry and John G. Roberts. Thornberry's nomination was withdrawn when Abe Fortas's nomination for Chief Justice was withdrawn, and Roberts's nomination for Associate Justice was withdrawn so he could be nominated for Chief Justice. Harriet E. Miers' nomination for Associate Justice was withdrawn before any formal committee action, unlike the nominations of Matthews, Hornblower, and Harlan which were reported to the full Senate. Stanbery, Thornberry, and Miers had nominations that failed to be reported out of committee on any occasion.
