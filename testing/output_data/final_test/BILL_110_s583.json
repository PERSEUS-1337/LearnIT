    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural Teacher Retention Act of 2007\". Congress finds that a significant number of children attend rural public schools, with a high percentage of educators teaching in these areas. Despite lower salaries, rural teachers often handle multiple subjects with limited resources, facing challenges in attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Rural school districts struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers, leading to higher turnover rates compared to other regions. This turnover negatively impacts student and district performance, as well as teacher qualifications. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"child with a disability,\" \"highly qualified teacher,\" \"highly qualified special education teacher,\" and \"limited English proficient.\" The curr_chunk defines terms like \"proficient,\" \"low-income student,\" \"migratory child,\" and \"rural local educational agency.\" The curr_chunk specifies criteria for a local educational agency to qualify for certain provisions under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, including serving a high number of Native Hawaiian children and experiencing a teacher turnover rate of at least 10 percent in the preceding academic years. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. If a local educational agency serves multiple counties in their entirety, each county is treated as a separate agency for certain determinations. SEC. 4. PILOT PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary will award grants to up to 10 States for a 5-year pilot program to provide salary bonuses to highly qualified teachers in rural schools based on the needs of the schools for recruiting and retaining teachers. The Secretary will consider eligibility for assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, impact on low-income and limited English proficient students, and the number of rural local educational agencies for awarding grants to States for salary bonuses to qualified teachers in rural schools. The application process for states seeking grants under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 includes details on the impact of children with disabilities in rural educational agencies and plans to recruit and retain qualified teachers. Grant funds are to be used for the distribution and improvement of educational services in rural areas. Grant funds under this section will provide salary bonuses for highly qualified teachers in rural schools served by the same local educational agency. SEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORTS. The Secretary is required to conduct a study of projects funded under the Act to track and assess their implementation and effectiveness. A portion of funds will be reserved for this study. States receiving grants must submit annual reports on funded projects, with necessary information for evaluation. The Secretary will also submit a report to Congress. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2012, detailing the number of rural local educational agencies assisted, their characteristics, and the demographic information of teachers receiving bonuses under the Act. The Secretary will provide a report to Congress by September 30, 2012, including details on the impact of bonuses on rural local educational agencies' ability to recruit and retain qualified teachers, along with any other necessary information for project evaluation. Authorization of appropriation for this Act includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2012."
