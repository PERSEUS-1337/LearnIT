Congress finds that the US Government increasingly relies on armed private security contractors for critical functions, with a significant number operating in Iraq and Afghanistan compared to US military personnel. The use of armed private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan has significantly increased, with over 13,000 contractors in Iraq and over 5,000 in Afghanistan. There were reports of misconduct by contractors hired by ArmorGroup North America at the US embassy in Kabul, including lewd behavior and hazing. The parent company, Wackenhut Services, had allegedly ignored previous reports of misconduct. In March 2009, the Department of State expressed concern about ArmorGroup North America's guard post staffing. In May 2009, Paravant LLC military trainers fired on a civilian vehicle in Kabul, killing one Afghan. In September 2007, Blackwater contractors opened fire in Baghdad's Nisour Square, killing 17 Iraqis. Federal charges against the contractors were dismissed due to evidence misuse, currently under appeal by the Department of Justice. In October 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized contractors in Iraq for conflicting with the mission. In 2006, a drunk Blackwater contractor killed an Iraqi guard and was later hired by another defense contractor. After the 2004 killing of four Blackwater contractors, their families filed a civil suit against the company. Xe Services, LLC, formerly known as Blackwater, faced allegations of weapons smuggling and improper licensing of firearms. In 2007, the House of Representatives investigated Blackwater's employment practices, revealing potential tax avoidance. In 2008, the Small Business Administration's Inspector General investigated Blackwater in response to a request from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Small Business Administration investigated Blackwater in 2008 for misrepresenting its small business status to secure $110 million in government contracts. Affidavits in a civil lawsuit accused Blackwater founder Erik Prince of viewing himself as a Christian crusader, deploying unfit men to Iraq, and using illegal ammunition. In a separate incident, a contractor employed by DynCorp International, LLC, shot and killed an unarmed taxi driver in 2007. In 2007, DynCorp was reported to have billed the US for unauthorized work. An audit in October 2007 revealed that the Department of State did not know what it received for $1.2 billion spent on the Iraqi Police Training Program under its DynCorp contract.
