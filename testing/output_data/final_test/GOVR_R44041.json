    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) on November 25, 2002, combining components from 22 government agencies. Despite its restructurings, DHS does not solely handle all homeland security missions, with other federal agencies also having significant responsibilities in this area. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002, combining components from 22 government agencies. Not all functions of DHS are strictly \"homeland security\" related, with some components having historical missions unrelated to conventional definitions. Some argue that certain criminal justice elements could fall under homeland security. Various issues like military involvement in law enforcement, money monitoring, human trafficking, and foreign policy have implications for homeland security policy. This report is a survey of issues in homeland security policy debates, covering topics such as Counterterrorism, Border Security, Disaster Preparedness, and DHS Management. Each section lists the author and contact information, with highlighted CRS reports for more detailed information. Prior to 9/11, the U.S. addressed threats through national defense, law enforcement, and emergency management. Policy discussions on emerging threats were accelerated by the 9/11 attacks. Despite reorganization efforts post-9/11, over 30 federal departments and agencies have homeland security responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for homeland security strategy, while Congress provides oversight and funding. The White House coordinates activities across the federal government and encourages partnerships with state, local governments, and the private sector. National homeland security strategy evolved before DHS, with key documents like the 2003 National Strategy for Homeland Security and the 2008 DHS Strategic Plan. The 2007 National Strategy for Homeland Security focused on terrorism, while the 2008 Strategic Plan included all-hazards and border security. These documents evolved from earlier strategies in response to incidents like the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The QHSR process is used to present homeland security thinking to Congress and the public. The QHSR process involves DHS reviewing its homeland security policy and programs, reporting to Congress on the results, and informing the development of national security strategy. The 2014 QHSR endorsed five mission areas: Prevent Terrorism, Secure Borders, Enforce Immigration Laws, Secure Cyberspace, and Strengthen National Preparedness. The budget process also reflects the Administration's thinking on homeland security. The 2015 version of Circular A-11 outlines six critical mission homeland security areas based on the 2004 National Strategy for Homeland Security. These areas include Intelligence and Warning, Border and Transportation Security, Domestic Counterterrorism, Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets, Defending Against Catastrophic Threats, and Emergency Preparedness and Response. The continued use of these mission areas in current guidance suggests they still inform the Administration's analysis of homeland security matters. The 2015 National Security Strategy focuses on guarding against terrorism as the core responsibility of homeland security. It also emphasizes improved information sharing, aviation and border security, and international cooperation. Community-based efforts and local law enforcement programs are highlighted to counter homegrown violent extremism. The strategy also mentions working with owners and operators of critical cyber and physical infrastructure to decrease vulnerabilities. At the national level, the 2015 National Security Strategy guides DHS and federal government homeland security activities. Congress oversees and funds homeland security activities to ensure efficient usage of taxpayer dollars. Clear understanding of priorities is needed for effective oversight and strategic planning. Congress could encourage consistent priorities for homeland security to address new developments strategically in the dynamic threat environment. Homeland security missions should be guided by a consistent list to facilitate strategic decision-making. While counterterrorism is often seen as the main focus, homeland security involves coordinating stakeholders to address all risks. The challenge lies in determining the current risk portfolio, evolving threats, appropriate missions, and prioritization. This consensus should extend vertically to all levels of homeland security roles. Homeland security missions should be guided by a consistent list to facilitate strategic decision-making at all levels, including federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector stakeholders. Consensus on roles and resources is crucial for effective implementation. The U.S. government spent $564 billion on homeland security in the 10 years after 9/11, with spending peaking at $73.8 billion in FY2009. The budget for homeland security activities in FY2014 was $66.2 billion, a decrease from previous years. The Department of Homeland Security's budget grew from $31.2 billion in FY2003 to $59.9 billion in FY2014, with $35.8 billion considered as homeland security spending. The Administration requested $38.3 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2015, with additional funding for disaster relief. Legislation in the 113th Congress proposed budgets ranging from $39.0 billion to $39.2 billion for DHS, including disaster relief and funding for the Coast Guard. The 113th Congress did not consider bills for DHS appropriations, leading to the agency operating under a continuing resolution until February 27, 2015. In the 114th Congress, a new FY2015 homeland security appropriations bill was introduced and passed in the House with immigration policy-related amendments. The Senate later passed an amended version of the bill on February 27. On January 14, 2015, the House passed H.R. 240. The Senate passed an amended version on February 27. A one-week extension of the continuing resolution was passed to avoid a lapse in DHS appropriations. On March 3, 2015, the House approved the Senate version of H.R. 240, which was signed into law on March 4, 2015. The bill provided $39.7 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The Administration requested $41.2 billion for FY2016, plus $6.7 billion for disaster relief. The current budget environment poses challenges for homeland security programs and the department due to limited funds. The potential impact of the changed budget environment is discussed throughout the report. The Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296) extended until June 1, 2015, emphasizes the integration of capabilities in intelligence and law enforcement organizations to enhance information-sharing across the U.S. government. The focus is on breaking down barriers between foreign and domestic intelligence to prevent government spying on U.S. persons. The Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296) and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) established the DHS's role in coordinating law enforcement and intelligence information on terrorist threats. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) was created to oversee terrorism information at the federal level, along with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to manage the Intelligence Community. Initiatives like the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and DHS's National Network of Fusion Centers (NNFC) have improved collaboration across federal, state, and local levels. The U.S. government has 17 intelligence organizations/agencies across different departments, including DHS and FBI elements focused on homeland security. DHS's missions involve preventing terrorism, securing borders, managing immigration laws, strengthening cyberspace, and enhancing national preparedness. DHS's Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) section serves as the focal point for policy issues and activities involving the entire Intelligence Community, leading information sharing with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The U.S. Coast Guard, part of DHS since 2002, has intelligence elements focused on maritime security and homeland defense. Its responsibilities include maritime safety, security, and stewardship. The FBI's National Security Branch is the focal point for policy issues involving the Intelligence Community, with key functions in counterterrorism and counter-intelligence. Law enforcement information sharing is a key aspect of their operations. The FBI has shifted to a threat-based, intelligence-led approach under the leadership of Robert Mueller. This new framework prioritizes collecting and utilizing intelligence to develop a comprehensive threat picture, enabling strategic disruptions of terrorist networks. It also emphasizes the importance of information sharing with other intelligence agencies for all-source products. The 114th Congress may face concerns regarding domestic surveillance issues as three amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 are set to expire on June 1, 2015. FISA regulates government agencies' gathering of foreign intelligence through electronic surveillance, physical searches, and access to business records. Authorization for these activities is typically obtained through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The FISA Court was created as a neutral judicial decision-maker post 9/11. Congress amended FISA to allow the government to gather information more broadly through temporary provisions like \"roving\" wiretaps, \"Section 215,\" and \"lone wolf.\" These provisions differ in allowing wiretaps to follow individuals across different communication methods and requiring separate authorizations for each device under FISA if expired. The \"Section 215\" provision of FISA broadens the types of records accessible to the government. The \"lone wolf\" provision allows monitoring of individuals engaged in international terrorism. An extension of these authorities is needed before June 1, 2015, or they will revert to pre-USA PATRIOT Act provisions. The National Security Agency (NSA) has been collecting bulk telephone data using Section 215 authorities since 2006. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Section 215 does not authorize the \"bulk collection\" of phone records on the scale of the NSA program. Three bills have been introduced in Congress to extend these provisions. The House and Senate are considering bills to extend provisions of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 until December 2019 or 2020. Efforts are being made to improve information-sharing between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as well as between government levels and the public-private sector. DHS is working on cybersecurity data sharing initiatives. DHS has developed the Critical Infrastructure Information Sharing and Collaboration Program (CISCP) to share threat information with industry sectors. Congress may review DHS's progress in information-sharing on cybersecurity, border security, and other homeland security issues. Congress may also examine agency collaboration and accountability in case of failures. The organization is held accountable if a collaborative arrangement fails. Congress may pass legislation to promote information-sharing and collaboration, especially in cybersecurity. The focus is on addressing threats from Al Qaeda and the Islamic State to protect U.S. global security interests. Addressing threats from Al Qaeda and the Islamic State is crucial for protecting U.S. global security interests. Recent years have seen an increase in terrorist actions by entities claiming affiliation with these groups. U.S. officials believe that recent counterterrorism successes may be reducing the level of terrorist threats from core Al Qaeda. Counterterrorism efforts have significantly degraded Al Qaeda's ability to launch catastrophic attacks against U.S. interests. Some experts believe Al Qaeda has evolved into a philosophical movement, making it harder to combat. Despite this, Al Qaeda and its affiliates are expected to remain a threat due to budgetary constraints. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross warns that as the national debt rises, cuts in spending may weaken U.S. defenses against Al Qaeda's growing presence in multiple countries. The Islamic State (IS) is a transnational Sunni Islamist insurgent and terrorist group that has expanded its control over areas of Iraq and Syria since 2013. There is debate over the degree to which IS might represent a direct terrorist threat to U.S. facilities and personnel in the region or to the U.S. homeland. The organization has thrived in Sunni tribal areas of Iraq and taken control of some eastern provinces of Syria affected by the civil war. Islamic State-led forces, supported by groups linked to ousted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, advanced in Iraq, taking Mosul. IS continues to kill adversaries and hostages, drawing international ire. U.S. attention is on Iraq's political problems and the war in Syria. John Brennan, now Director of the CIA, is mindful of counterterrorism policies amid budget constraints. The Director of the CIA, formerly the President's Homeland Security advisor, warns of Osama bin Laden's goal to financially drain the U.S. through costly wars and inciting anti-American sentiment. The threat of global terrorism targeting U.S. interests remains a key concern for the Administration and Congress, with recent arrests made for transnational attacks and terrorism-related activities. The 113th Congress focused on understanding terrorism globally and assessing counterterrorism efforts. They reviewed programs like public diplomacy, sanctions, terrorism financing, and the link between crime, narcotics, and terrorism. The 114th Congress may continue evaluating the Obama Administration's strategies to determine if further guidance or legislation is needed to balance U.S. security interests with global concerns. Homegrown violent jihadist activity since 9/11 involves various endgames for plots, including becoming foreign fighters, planning attacks with explosives or firearms, and funding jihadist activities. Martyrdom is not a common goal among these individuals. The success of lone wolves in homegrown attacks since 9/11 highlights divergent capabilities among participants, with some showing terrorist tradecraft while others lack experience. Congress should consider these themes when addressing the threat of homegrown terrorism. Additionally, the potential threat posed by \"foreign fighters\" from the US and other countries involved in the Syrian civil war, joining groups like ISIS, is part of the overall threat picture. According to officials, over 20,000 foreign fighters from 90 nations, including 3,400 westerners, have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. In the US, 180 individuals have gone to Syria, with about 40 returning. The federal watchlisting process helps track individuals with ties to ISIS. The federal watchlist is used to track known or suspected terrorists, aiding in screening processes for visas, entry into the country, and other activities. U.S. law enforcement focuses on interdiction, investigation, and countering violent extremism to prevent IS terrorist activity. DHS components like Customs and Border Protection use the watchlist for intelligence-driven screening to mitigate risks posed by certain travelers. DHS Secretary Jeh C. Johnson has mentioned U.S. coordination with allies on tracking foreign fighters traveling to and from Syria. Enhanced screening measures, including upgrades to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), are being implemented to identify security risks before travelers board flights to the United States. The investigation focuses on Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) led by the FBI, coordinating federal counterterrorism cases in the US and abroad. The FBI works with foreign law enforcement partners to combat terrorist activity, while the DOJ expands its presence in countries serving as transit points for foreign fighters. Countering violent extremism (CVE) is a key aspect of these efforts. Countering violent extremism (CVE) programs aim to prevent individuals from shifting to violent extremism without traditional policing methods. These programs help prevent people from joining terrorist groups abroad and provide law enforcement with tips on returning fighters. Federal agencies like the FBI, DHS, and NCTC work to understand the motivations behind radicalization and provide information to community groups on recruitment efforts. The federal government, through agencies like DHS and NCTC, provides information to U.S. community groups on recruitment efforts of violent extremist groups, particularly those based in Syria and Iraq. A program is being implemented in cities like Boston, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-St. Paul to counter violent extremism, with a focus on bringing together community representatives, public safety officials, and religious leaders. This initiative is in response to the threat posed by the Islamic State. Cyber-based technologies are essential in modern life, but disruptions can have cascading effects on various devices. Cyberattacks pose significant threats to national security, the economy, and individual livelihoods. Congress faces questions about aggressors in cyberspace, impacts of attacks, and legislative responses. Cyber-based technologies are used for lawful and criminal purposes globally. Criminals, terrorists, and spies exploit these technologies to steal data, launch attacks, and undermine security and economic interests. The threats posed by cyber-aggressors are diverse, with examples including cyberthieves, cyberspies, cyberterrorists, and cyberwarriors. Cyber-aggressors, including cyberterrorists, exploit technological capabilities for malicious purposes. They use the Internet for planning attacks, propaganda distribution, and communication. Vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure control systems have been demonstrated, with the Department of Homeland Security conducting experiments to reveal weaknesses in power generators and grids in 2009. The Aurora Project demonstrated vulnerabilities in the nation's control systems managing power generators and grids through a computer-based attack. Cyberspies, working for foreign government entities, steal classified information for strategic advantage. Incidents like the loss of $1 billion worth of research data in 2011 and unauthorized access to the Department of Defense's classified network in 2008 highlight the threat posed by cyber espionage. In 2013, a classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) focused on cyberspying against U.S. targets from abroad addressed the Chinese government's cyber theft activities. Then-DOD Secretary Leon Panetta mentioned Russia and China's advanced cyber capabilities. Cyberthieves engage in illegal cyberattacks for monetary gain, such as stealing credit card numbers or deceiving victims to access financial accounts. Cybercrime costs individuals billions annually, with cyberwarriors carrying out attacks for strategic objectives on behalf of nation-states. The overall costs of cyberattacks remain unclear due to the complex nature of the issue and victims' reluctance to report attacks. Foreign governments often blame cyberwarriors for attacks, even when evidence is provided. In August 2012, cyberattacks targeted Saudi Aramco, compromising 30,000 computers to disrupt oil production. Iran was suspected of involvement, but cyberwarrior groups with different agendas also claimed credit. Cyberactivists engage in cyberattacks for nonmonetary reasons. Cyberactivists engage in cyberattacks for nonmonetary reasons, such as personal challenges or political motives. The complexity of ascertaining information about these aggressors, coupled with the United States' early adoption of vulnerable technologies, creates challenges for safeguarding national interests through operational responses, policies, and legislation. Over 50 federal statutes address various aspects of cybersecurity, reflecting the need for comprehensive measures to address these threats. Since the 111th Congress, various bills have been introduced to address specific cybersecurity issues, including information sharing, roles of DHS and the Intelligence Community, FISMA reform, and research and development. There is no overarching cybersecurity framework legislation in place, but multiple statutes cover different aspects of cybersecurity. The curr_chunk discusses key cybersecurity issues such as research and development, workforce improvement, protection of private-sector infrastructure, data breach notification, and updating cybercrime laws. These issues include agency roles, funding levels, workforce skills, data breach responses, and law enforcement authorities. The 113th Congress passed five bills with cybersecurity provisions in December 2014, including the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and the Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act. These laws updated criminal statutes and law enforcement authorities related to cybersecurity, addressing issues such as penalties, privacy, and civil liberties. The 113th Congress passed cybersecurity legislation in December 2014, including the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and the Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 authorized a national cybersecurity center, while the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 addressed various cybersecurity themes. Comprehensive cybersecurity legislation may be attempted in the 114th Congress. The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative was established in 2008. In March 2010, the Obama Administration released a description of classified documents related to cybersecurity initiatives. These initiatives aim to consolidate access points, deploy intrusion detection systems, improve research coordination, develop next-generation technology, and mitigate risks from the global supply chain. The White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, established in December 2009, is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity issues and implementing the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). The White House Cybersecurity Coordinator works with the National Security and Economic Councils but lacks direct control over agency budgets. President Obama signed a directive in 2012 to allow the military to be more aggressive in countering cyberattacks. Federal cybersecurity involves securing government systems, assisting nonfederal systems, and pursuing various initiatives in the military, intelligence, and law enforcement sectors. The White House has issued executive orders and directives on cybersecurity, intelligence issues, and critical infrastructure protection. Various government agencies have cybersecurity roles and responsibilities that may overlap or compete. Continuity of government operations ensures recovery from operational interruptions. Government continuity planning involves preparedness capacities such as agency response plans, employee training, and recovery plans to ensure the maintenance of civil authority and support for those affected by incidents. Contingency plans may be activated for interruptions like acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attacks. The 2007 National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) on National Continuity Policy, NSPD-51, provides authority for executive branch continuity programs. NSPD-51 sets out a policy for maintaining government continuity in order to ensure the preservation of our form of government and the performance of national essential functions under all conditions. E.O. 12656 assigns national security emergency preparedness responsibilities to federal departments and agencies, requiring them to ensure the continuity of essential functions in any national security emergency. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of contingency planning in government departments to ensure continuity of essential functions under challenging circumstances. It highlights the need for current authorities to reflect government organization and goals, consider costs, potential conflicts, and effectiveness in carrying out responsibilities. The 2014 Ebola outbreak emphasized the need for improved contingency planning. The 2014 Ebola outbreak underscored the lack of medical countermeasures for high-risk CBRN threats. Federal programs were created after the 2001 anthrax attacks to address this issue, but challenges remain in distribution. The 114th Congress may review the effectiveness of current programs and consider modifications. Federal efforts involve multiple departments including Defense, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services. Congress may increase scrutiny of the planning, coordination, and accountability of federal programs for medical countermeasures. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 and Project BioShield Act aim to address gaps in available countermeasures by encouraging the private sector to develop CBRN medical countermeasures. The federal government utilized Project BioShield to acquire medical countermeasures against various threats, including anthrax, smallpox, and nerve agents. Congress funded the program with a $5.6 billion advance appropriation for FY2004-FY2013, and has provided annual appropriations since FY2014. Countermeasure developers suggest that another multiyear advance appropriation could enhance their ability to develop countermeasures. The 114th Congress may consider adjusting funding or providing an advance appropriation to improve program efficiency. Distribution of medical countermeasures during a CBRN emergency remains a challenge for the federal government and its partners. The federal government maintains programs, such as the Strategic National Stockpile, to stockpile and distribute medical countermeasures. There are concerns about the sufficiency of these programs and the capacity of state governments to disseminate federal stockpiles effectively. Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of federal programs and consider additional stockpiling and distribution methods, including using the U.S. Postal Service. Concerns may arise regarding program costs, unintended use of countermeasures, and local implementation. The BioWatch program, managed by the DHS Office of Health Affairs, deploys pathogen sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. It has not detected any incidents but has found pathogens of interest. Critics claim it is prone to false alarms and lacks sensitivity. The BioWatch program, managed by DHS, deploys pathogen sensors in U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. Critics claim it is prone to false alarms and lacks sensitivity. Some officials defend the program for fostering collaboration. Efforts to improve system responsiveness with autonomous sensors were terminated after delays and skepticism. DHS terminated Gen-3 procurement activities in April 2014. Congressional appropriators have sought to limit BioWatch program funding and called for reviews. Committees have held hearings on the program, with investigations starting in the 112th Congress. FY2015 and FY2016 funding was requested to maintain current operations. Congress provided funding slightly above the request for system component replacement. House and Senate Appropriations Committees urged improvements in detection capability. Food safety efforts have long focused on protecting against unintentional contaminants, but since the 2001 terrorist attacks, there has been an added focus on food defense to protect against intentional contamination. Deliberate food contamination can have serious economic consequences and cause illnesses. Federal food safety responsibility primarily lies with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are primarily responsible for food safety regulation. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) focuses on preventing both intentional and unintentional contamination of foods. The Food and Agriculture Sector is mostly privately owned and includes farms, restaurants, and food facilities, accounting for a significant portion of the nation's economic activity. The FDA is working on implementing provisions of the FSMA to prevent food contamination, including intentional acts. The agency has not yet published the National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy as required by the law. GAO has identified food safety as a high-risk issue due to delays in implementing defense policies. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9) issued in 2004 assigns emergency response responsibilities to USDA, FDA, and DHS. GAO found a lack of centralized coordination in implementing HSPD-9 and recommended DHS take on this role. GAO also recommended developing a government-wide performance plan for food safety activities, which has not been fully implemented as of March 2015. The U.S. power grid consists of over 9,000 generating units and 200,000 miles of transmission lines. High-voltage transformers, which make up less than 3% of transformers but carry 60%-70% of electricity, are critical elements of the grid. HV transformers are critical elements of the nation's electric power grid and are considered the most vulnerable to intentional damage. A coordinated attack on multiple HV transformers could lead to severe implications for reliable electric service, causing widespread blackouts and serious economic and social consequences. Recent physical attacks on transformer substations have highlighted the vulnerability of HV transformers. The Metcalf incident in CA did not cause widespread blackouts but emphasized the vulnerability of HV transformer substations. Efforts have been made to secure HV transformers from physical attacks, including coordination, spare equipment programs, security standards, and grid security exercises. Standards for grid security, including HV transformers, have been developed since 2002 by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In late 2014, after the Metcalf attack, mandatory physical security standards were imposed for HV transformer substations in the United States due to their vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Despite concerns about potential catastrophic consequences, the true vulnerability of the grid to a multi-HV transformer attack remains uncertain without specific information on targets and attacker capabilities. The recent focus on the physical security of HV transformers has led to congressional interest and legislative proposals to strengthen federal authority in securing the U.S. grid. The 114th Congress may consider key issues in oversight, such as identifying critical infrastructure and ensuring efficient use of security resources. The 114th Congress may consider key issues in oversight of the sector, including identifying critical transformers, confidentiality of information, adequacy of protection, quality of threat information, and recovery from attacks. DHS was authorized to regulate security at chemical facilities through the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014. The Security Appropriations Act, 2007 granted new authority to DHS for chemical facility security, set to expire in January 2019. Congress may focus on oversight rather than new legislation in the 114th Congress. Criticisms of DHS's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) existed before the 2013 West Fertilizer Company explosion. P.L. 113-254 maintained existing regulatory challenges. Obama Administration and stakeholders seek to address regulatory exemptions. The Obama Administration and stakeholders are addressing regulatory exemptions for chemical facility security. Environmental groups advocate for the adoption of \"inherently safer technologies\" and the dissemination of security-related information. The regulated industry opposes DHS's authority to require specific security measures, citing the need for tailored approaches for each facility. The Obama Administration is working on improving chemical facility safety and security by coordinating federal agencies. Policymakers overseeing the CFATS program are facing decisions on DHS program changes, which is still in its early stages with implementation challenges and delays. It will take two or more years for DHS to complete its review and approval of security plans from regulated facilities. The vulnerability of passenger rail systems to terrorist attacks has been highlighted by bombings in Europe and Asia. With increased security in air travel, there are concerns that terrorists may target transit or passenger rail systems in the United States. Congress faces the challenge of balancing the need for increased rail passenger security with the efficient functioning of transit systems and other federal priorities. Transit security measures for rail passengers focus on managing attack consequences and reducing risks. Steps include vulnerability assessments, emergency planning, training of personnel, increased security staff, video surveillance, and random inspections. Securing bus passengers presents a greater challenge due to the large number of buses and passengers in the United States. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 focused on enhancing security for public transportation, including buses and railroads. It mandated security plans for high-risk targets, background checks for frontline employees, and regulation of security training standards by DHS. The TSA has the authority to regulate rail and transit employee security training standards. They have established goals for a secure transportation system, including increasing system resilience, expanding visible deterrence activities, and engaging the public in the counterterrorism mission. TSA inspectors conduct assessments of transit systems through the BASE program and have developed a security training and exercise program for transit. The agency has developed security training programs for transit, including I-STEP and VIPR teams conducting operations with local law enforcement to create visual deterrents. The House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Transportation Security discussed the surface transportation security inspector program, noting an increase in inspectors from 175 in FY2008 to 404 in FY2011. Issues included lack of transportation expertise among inspectors and administrative challenges with management by federal security directors located at airports. The number of surface inspectors decreased to 300 in FY2014, with a reduction in VIPR surface inspectors. DHS provides grants for security improvements in public transit and passenger rail under the Transit Security Grant Program. The Government Accountability Office found duplication among DHS state and local security grant programs, including public transportation security grants. The Obama Administration has proposed consolidating these programs in annual budget requests. The United States is the world's largest marketplace for illegal drugs, with Mexican drug trafficking organizations dominating the market. An estimated 24.6 million Americans were current users of illicit drugs in 2013. Congress has not supported proposals to consolidate grant programs, citing concerns about program focus and unawarded funds. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are the primary drug threat to the United States, trafficking heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana using established routes. They control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are expanding their market share, particularly in heroin and methamphetamine. The drugs are either transported or produced and transported across the border, distributed, sold, and proceeds laundered or smuggled back. Additionally, the proceeds may be used to purchase weapons in the U.S. and smuggled into Mexico. Mexican criminal networks generate income from various illegal activities, including drug trafficking, smuggling of humans and weapons, counterfeiting, piracy, kidnapping, and extortion. Heroin use in the United States has increased due to Mexican traffickers, who have switched from marijuana cultivation to growing opium poppies. The prices of marijuana in Mexico are influenced by increased marijuana legalization in the United States, along with a rise in U.S. heroin demand. Mexican heroin production has increased, leading to more heroin seizures at the Southwest border. The 114th Congress may consider supply-reduction and demand-reduction options to combat drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, including implementing the 2013 National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy. The curr_chunk discusses efforts to enhance intelligence sharing, interdict drugs, money, and weapons at ports of entry, disrupt drug trafficking organizations, and increase U.S.-Mexico cooperation. It highlights the connection between illegal money flows and homeland security, mentioning funding of destabilizing activities like smuggling and terrorist operations. The curr_chunk focuses on the movement of illicit funds across the Southwest border, specifically highlighting how drug trafficking organizations send billions annually to Mexico from the United States. These funds fuel criminal activities and are laundered through various illegal mechanisms. New technologies provide additional ways for organizations to conceal their illicit proceeds. Drug trafficking organizations use various technologies like stored value cards and mobile banking systems to move profits quickly and stealthily. Mexican drug traffickers can transfer profits from selling Colombian cocaine directly to the source country without involving middlemen. Different agencies, including the DEA, FBI, ICE, CBP, and FinCEN, work together to combat drug-related activities and the flow of illicit proceeds across the Southwest border and the United States. Mexican traffickers use cross-border tunnels to smuggle drugs, people, and contraband into the United States. The sophistication and frequency of these tunnels have increased, leading to a need for interagency coordination to reduce the flow of illicit money and goods across the Southwest border. The frequency and sophistication of cross-border tunnels used by Mexican traffickers to smuggle drugs, people, and contraband into the United States have increased significantly. Over 150 tunnels have been discovered along the Southwest border since the 1990s, with an 80% uptick in detections since 2008. These tunnels range from rudimentary \"gopher hole\" tunnels to more advanced ones that tap into existing infrastructure like storm drains or sewage systems. The most sophisticated tunnels can have rail, ventilation, and electrical systems. In November 2011, a sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel was discovered in San Diego, CA, stretching 612 yards with electric rail cars, lighting, reinforced walls, and wooden floors. In April 2014, two more tunnels were found in the same area within a week. U.S. law enforcement uses various tactics like sonic equipment, seismic technology, and ground penetrating radar to detect these tunnels, but effectiveness can be limited by factors such as soil conditions and tunnel characteristics. Despite efforts, officials lack reliable technology for tunnel detection. Law enforcement lacks reliable technology to detect sophisticated tunnels, relying on human intelligence and tips. U.S. officials value cooperation with Mexico in detecting and prosecuting criminals involved in cross-border tunnels. The 114th Congress may consider improving technology for law enforcement and enhancing bi-national partnerships to combat transnational criminals. Policymakers may also assess the role of combating smuggling tunnels in the broader border security framework. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is America's primary trade enforcement agency, focusing on balancing efficient trade flows with cargo security and enforcement of U.S. trade laws. The policy question revolves around minimizing the risk of weapons of mass destruction, illegal drugs, and contraband entering U.S. ports of entry while reducing costs and delays. CBP's current trade strategy emphasizes \"risk management\" and a \"multi-layered\" approach to enforcement, segmenting importers into higher and lower risk pools for cargo security. CBP's management involves segmenting importers into higher and lower risk pools, focusing security procedures on higher-risk flows, and expediting lower-risk flows. The agency's multi-layered approach to enforcement includes measures before goods are loaded in foreign ports and after they are admitted into the United States. Congressional attention has been on the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) trusted trader program and the requirement to scan 100% of incoming maritime cargo containers abroad. Congress also deals with questions about spending levels for port of entry infrastructure and personnel. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a voluntary program established by CBP in 2001 after 9/11, allowing import-related businesses to register and perform security tasks. Members receive benefits like expedited import processing. Some businesses criticize the program for inadequate benefits compared to the time and financial investments required for certification. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program offers benefits like expedited import processing, but expanding benefits may be challenging. Land ports provide dedicated lanes for faster wait times, but limited space hinders lane expansion. Maritime imports benefit from reduced secondary inspections, but only a small percentage undergo this process. The SAFE Port Act requires 100% of maritime containers imported to the United States to be scanned by NII and radiation detection equipment before being loaded onto a U.S.-bound vessel in a foreign port. The DHS Secretary delayed the deadline for 100% scanning of maritime containers due to obstacles identified in the pilot program, including lack of support from foreign governments, logistical difficulties, and high costs. In February 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementing 100% scanning at foreign ports would cost about $16.8 billion for all 2,100 shipping lanes. Port operators and foreign partners also incur additional costs. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the lack of progress in implementing 100% scanning, while others may consider changes to the requirement. In light of challenges identified by DHS, Congress may consider changes to the 100% cargo scanning requirement, potentially allowing for less than 100% scanning or scanning at U.S. ports. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to submit an alternative strategy for cargo scanning that could be achieved within the next two years. At ports of entry, Congress faces issues with allocating resources for CBP Office of Field Operations personnel and port infrastructure, leading to delays and wait times. Congress has invested more in Border Patrol agents than OFO officers since 2004. Recent fiscal pressures have hindered personnel increases, with Congress approving only half of the proposed funding for additional CBP officers in FY2014. Congress approved a slower personnel growth for CBP, with half the proposed funding. A pilot program was authorized in FY2013 for public-private partnerships to fund improvements in border facilities. The Administration proposed expanding the program in FY2014 to accept donations for port operations, which was approved by Congress. The current pilot program allows CBP to accept donations for port operations and other purposes. CBP's Office of Field Operations conducts immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections at U.S. ports of entry to identify high-risk individuals while facilitating access for low-risk travelers. Travelers must present a passport or equivalent travel document for admission. Foreign nationals entering the United States must have a visa or be eligible for the Visa Waiver Program. CBP officers conduct security checks and verify travelers' identities using biometric checks. Database interoperability allows officers to check records against various government databases. Inspection activities are concentrated at the border for both travelers and imports. The concentration of inspection activity at the border requires sufficient resources to minimize congestion and ensure efficient operations. CBP faces pressure to process individuals quickly, but expedited processing can lead to missed threats. Investment in ports of entry has not kept pace with international travel and trade growth, resulting in inadequate infrastructure at some ports. Trusted traveler programs require background checks, interviews, and biometric data submission to streamline admissions without compromising security. Trusted traveler programs like Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI offer expedited processing at ports of entry for pre-approved travelers who undergo background checks, interviews, and biometric data submission. These programs aim to streamline admissions without compromising security. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from 38 countries, mostly in Europe, to enter the US as temporary visitors for business or pleasure without a visa. Congressional focus on security risks increased after the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels. Non-VWP country visitors must obtain a visa from a US consulate abroad. When traveling to the United States, individuals from VWP countries must submit biographical information through ESTA for authorization. There is debate on the VWP's impact on national security as travelers do not undergo traditional visa screening. The ESTA system has improved security but lacks biometric checks. Some argue for stricter documentary requirements. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has raised concerns about national security due to relaxed documentary requirements, potentially increasing immigration fraud. However, proponents argue that the VWP enhances security by setting travel document standards, sharing information on criminals, and promoting economic growth. Travelers under the VWP must use machine-readable or e-passports, which are harder to alter. Additionally, some visas under the VWP are valid for 10 years, raising concerns about changing circumstances. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required the development of an automated entry and exit control system to track alien arrivals and departures. Congress has amended the system's requirements multiple times, including adding biometric technology and interoperability with other databases. However, the entry-exit system is still incomplete. The entry-exit system, mandated by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, is still incomplete despite amendments to include biometric technology. Exit data collection remains a concern, especially at southern border land ports, where no data is collected. Biographic data collection at other ports is limited and relies on information sharing with Canada and carriers. DHS believes biographic information sharing meets exit tracking needs at an acceptable cost, but acknowledges the importance of strengthening biographic data collection before implementing biometric data collection. Biographic data collection is essential before biometric data collection, with a biographic system seen as a long-term goal for the entry-exit system. CBP's U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration and federal laws along the border, preventing unlawful entries into the U.S. The Border Patrol patrols 7,494 miles of U.S. international borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as coastal waters around Florida and Puerto Rico. Since the 1980s, Congress and CBP have invested in border security personnel, fencing, infrastructure, and surveillance technology. Some Members of Congress question the effectiveness of DHS's border investments and the lack of a comprehensive strategy. Border apprehensions have decreased since 2006, but this may be influenced by various factors such as changes in the U.S. labor market or tactics of unauthorized migrants, making apprehensions an imprecise indicator of border security. Since the 1980s, Congress and CBP have invested in border security personnel, fencing, infrastructure, and surveillance technology. Border apprehensions have decreased since 2006, but this may be influenced by various factors such as changes in the U.S. labor market or tactics of unauthorized migrants, making apprehensions an imprecise indicator of border security. Congress may question the relative priority attached to the southern and northern borders, with some security experts warning that the northern border may represent a more important point of vulnerability for terrorism and related threats to homeland security. DHS has adopted a strategy of securing the border through emplacement of radiation portal monitors. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented a strategy to secure the border by using radiation portal monitors and non-intrusive imaging equipment. However, some experts criticize this system for not being able to detect all smuggled special nuclear material. DHS has been developing and testing next-generation detection equipment, but some systems like the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal and the Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System did not meet expectations and were not procured. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) was established in 2005 to research, develop, and procure detection equipment for DHS's nuclear detection activities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other groups have questioned the efficacy of DNDO's efforts to develop a next-generation radiation detection system. Congress has required DHS to scan all containerized cargo entering the United States for nuclear and radiological material, but DHS has not yet met this requirement. A shortfall of a key neutron detection material, helium-3, has led to a reconsideration of the current nuclear detection approach, with DHS investing in testing new neutron-detection materials and refitting deployed systems with alternative capabilities. The 114th Congress may oversee the development, testing, and procurement of current and next-generation nuclear detection equipment, interagency coordination in nuclear detection, the sufficiency of the global nuclear detection architecture, and DHS's approach to the helium-3 shortage. In January 2007, TSA and the Coast Guard implemented the TWIC at U.S. ports, requiring workers to apply for a card for access to secure areas. Since October 2007, about 2.9 million maritime workers have obtained a TWIC card, which must be renewed every five years. TSA conducts security threat assessments before issuing the card, using established procedures for examining criminal history and immigration status. The TWIC program requires workers to undergo security assessments, including criminal history checks and biometric identification. A fee of $130 covers the card administration costs. Card readers at port gates scan fingerprints for access control, but finding reliable readers for harsh marine environments has been a challenge. The Coast Guard proposed requiring card readers for high-risk maritime sectors handling dangerous bulk commodities or large passenger volumes. The Coast Guard proposed requiring card readers for high-risk maritime sectors handling dangerous bulk commodities or large passenger volumes. Currently, the Coast Guard performs spot checks with hand-held biometric readers while conducting port security inspections. GAO audits have been critical of how TWIC has been implemented, citing incomplete pilot test results for card reader requirements. The 2013 GAO audit found that TSA's Adjudication Center had performance measurement issues. A 2011 audit highlighted weaknesses in TWIC card enrollment and background checks at ports. In 2014, the House passed a bill requiring a cost-benefit assessment of the TWIC card. The DHS will assess the benefits and costs of the TWIC card. A bill similar to the House-passed version has been reintroduced in the 114th Congress. The federalization of airport screening post-9/11 remains controversial. Representative Bill Shuster criticized the decision to create TSA as a federal agency responsible for screening. The federalization of airport screening post-9/11 has been criticized, with calls for private security companies to handle frontline screening. While some airports have the option to opt out of federal screening, only 21 out of 450 commercial passenger airports have chosen private screening under TSA contracts. Congress has focused on mandates for explosives screening and background checks, with limited debate on more extensive reforms in passenger screening despite ongoing challenges in aviation security. Despite the extensive focus on aviation security for over a decade, challenges remain in effectively screening passengers, baggage, and cargo for explosive threats, developing risk-based methods for screening individuals with access to aircraft, utilizing intelligence information to identify potential threats, responding to security threats at airports, addressing aircraft vulnerabilities to missiles, and managing security implications of unmanned aircraft in domestic airspace. Prior to 9/11, explosives screening in aviation was limited to selective checked baggage screening on international flights. Post-9/11, ATSA mandated 100% screening of all checked baggage on domestic and international flights. The 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 mandated physical screening of all cargo on passenger flights, which TSA fulfills through Certified methods, unlike passenger and baggage screening. The TSA fulfills the mandate for physical screening of all cargo on passenger flights through the Certified Cargo Screening Program, involving manufacturers, warehouses, distributors, and shippers using TSA-approved technologies and procedures. TSA collaborates with other governments, trade organizations, and industry to ensure U.S.-bound and domestic cargo on passenger aircraft meets requirements. Additionally, TSA works with Customs and Border Protection for risk-based targeting of cargo shipments, including the use of the CBP Advance Targeting System-Cargo (ATS-C) to identify shipments of elevated risk. The ATS-C program, originally designed to combat drug smuggling, has evolved to assess shipments for explosives threats or terrorism-related activities. TSA has faced challenges in meeting explosives detection requirements, developing a technology investment plan, and implementing procurement best practices. The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act aims to address these concerns by requiring a five-year technology investment plan and increasing accountability for acquisitions. The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act aims to improve accountability for acquisitions and technology investments, tighten inventory controls, and enhance small business contracting opportunities. TSA's focus is on detecting concealed explosives carried by airline passengers, especially after the attempted attack on Northwest Airlines flight 253 in 2009. Al Qaeda has shown interest in attacking U.S.-bound airliners since 9/11. Al Qaeda has been linked to various terrorist plots since 9/11, including the Richard Reid shoe bombing incident, trans-Atlantic flight bombings, and air cargo explosives plot. The Obama Administration deployed Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) for improved explosives detection at passenger screening checkpoints. Next-generation screening technologies include X-ray systems for carry-on baggage, bottled liquids scanners, and shoe scanning devices. The use of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) at passenger screening checkpoints has raised policy questions, with privacy concerns addressed by eliminating human analysis of AIT images and not storing imagery. Automated threat detection capabilities using automated targeting recognition (ATR) software are now used. Medical risks posed by backscatter X-ray systems are no longer a concern as current millimeter wave systems emit nonionizing waves. Some advocate for risk-based use of AIT in coordination with passenger screening approaches. The TSA has deployed about 86% of its projected full operating capability of 870 AIT units by FY2014, with plans to expand AIT to smaller airports. Risk-based passenger screening measures are being used to manage the risk of not having AIT at all airports. The TSA has implemented risk-based passenger screening measures, including the PreCheck trusted traveler program, which is not available at many smaller airports. These initiatives focus resources and apply directed measures based on security risk assessments. The TSA has implemented risk-based passenger screening measures, including the PreCheck program for expedited screening of known flight crew and cabin crew members. Participants vetted through a background check process and randomly selected low-risk passengers are processed through expedited screening lanes, allowing them to keep shoes on and keep liquids and laptops inside carry-on bags. The PreCheck program is funded by $85 application fees per passenger for a five-year membership. TSA aims to process 50% of passengers through PreCheck lanes to reduce the need for standard security screening. While initial evaluations show PreCheck's effectiveness in streamlining screening, questions remain about its ability to target unknown or elevated-risk travelers. Despite concerns, risk-based screening measures like PreCheck have improved efficiency and saved costs for TSA. The PreCheck program has led to cost savings for TSA through improved screening efficiency. Concerns have been raised about the public dissemination of instructions on deciphering boarding passes, lack of encryption, and limited authentication capabilities. Other issues include the lack of biometric identity authentication and extensive use of managed inclusion in the program. TSA uses managed inclusion to route travelers through PreCheck lanes based on random selection or observations. GAO recommended testing the program and ensuring adherence to evaluation design practices. TSA also has a known crewmember program for airline flight crews and a behavior detection program for identifying potential threats. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program, initiated in 2003, deployed almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012, costing about $200 million annually. Despite concerns about its effectiveness and potential for profiling, Congress has not taken action to eliminate or revamp the program. The TSA's SPOT program, implemented in 2003, deployed almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012, costing about $200 million annually. Despite concerns, Congress has not taken action to eliminate or revamp the program. In the context of risk-based passenger screening, TSA policies on prohibited items, including carry-on liquids, may be of interest for congressional oversight. Outgoing TSA Administrator John Pistole suggested relaxing restrictions on liquids and gels for PreCheck participants in November 2014.

Outgoing TSA Administrator John Pistole suggested relaxing restrictions on liquids and gels for PreCheck participants in November 2014. The curr_chunk discusses the effective use of terrorist watchlists and intelligence information to identify individuals posing a threat to aviation, highlighting specific failings in including a bomber on the no-fly or selectee list despite intelligence suggesting a security threat. Additionally, it mentions an incident involving Faisal Shazad being allowed to board a flight to Dubai despite being on the no-fly list, leading to TSA modifying security directives for airlines. The TSA implemented security directives to require airlines to check passenger names against the no-fly list within two hours of urgent updates, accelerating the transfer of watchlist checks to TSA under the Secure Flight program. By November 2010, 100% of passengers flying to or from U.S. airports were vetted using Secure Flight, which continues the no-fly and selectee list practices by vetting passenger names against the Terrorist Screening Database. Secure Flight operates in coordination with CBP's National Targeting Center\u2014Passenger on international flights, using the Advance Passenger Information System to vet passenger manifests. TSA also relies on risk-based measures for security. In January 2015, TSA announced the incorporation of CAPPS assessments into Secure Flight, using passenger data for risk-based analyses to determine screening levels at airport checkpoints. Central issues for Congress include the speed of watchlist updates and the availability of federal information. The adequacy of utilizing all available information to assess threats among passengers and airport workers, detecting identity fraud, providing redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats, and coordinating with international partners are key considerations for Congress. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 requires the FAA to accommodate the routine operation of drones in domestic airspace by the end of FY2015. This raises security risks such as potential terrorist attacks using drones or cybercriminals targeting drones for data or control interference. In September 2011, the FBI disrupted a terrorist plot to attack the Pentagon and Capitol with model aircraft carrying explosives, raising concerns about drone attacks. Incidents like a drone flying near Angela Merkel in Germany, a drone crashing at the White House, and unauthorized drone flights in Paris have heightened security worries. Reports of drones flying near airports, restricted airspace, and crowded events domestically have also raised concerns. The potential security threats posed by unmanned aircraft, particularly small drones, include the risk of terrorist attacks using chemical, biological, or radiological weapons. The FAA is considering regulations for commercial drone operators, but recreational users are currently allowed to operate drones at low altitudes. Law enforcement agencies may not be adequately trained to respond to this emerging threat, and integrating tracking mechanisms into drone technology could help manage security risks. Integrating tracking mechanisms and \"geo-fencing\" capabilities into unmanned aircraft systems can help prevent unauthorized flights over sensitive locations or exceeding altitude limits. Security concerns include vulnerability to jamming or hacking, leading to potential crashes or hostile takeovers. Recommendations include requiring spoof-resistant navigation systems and reducing reliance on GPS signals. TSA has not formally addressed security issues related to unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace. Unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace raise security concerns but also offer potential benefits for homeland security, such as CBP border surveillance. CBP uses a fleet of modified Predator UASs for border patrol and plans to acquire more. State and local governments are interested in using UASs for various missions, with some agencies already using drones for tasks like traffic patrol and event security. Federal, state, and local agencies have obtained drones through grant programs and FAA authorizations. The introduction of drones into domestic surveillance operations raises legal issues related to privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. Courts use various tests to determine if government drone surveillance constitutes a search or seizure, considering factors like the location of the search, technology sophistication, and societal privacy norms. The use of drones in domestic surveillance raises legal issues regarding privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. Government drone surveillance in public places and at national borders may have fewer restrictions compared to intrusions into homes. Different levels of judicial scrutiny may apply depending on the technology used, such as thermal imaging or facial recognition. Proposed measures in Congress aim to require warrants for drone surveillance, with exceptions for border patrols and terrorist threat investigations. On November 1, 2013, a lone gunman targeted TSA employees at Los Angeles International Airport, killing one screener and injuring others. TSA proposed actions to improve checkpoint security, including enhanced training for screeners and increased law enforcement presence during peak times. They did not recommend arming TSA employees or providing bulletproof vests. The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015 (H.R. 720) proposes security incident response plans for airports, including terrorist attacks and active shooters. It mandates evacuation procedures, unified incident command, communication testing, law enforcement response timeframes, and joint training. The bill also requires TSA to share best practices for security incident planning and identify ways to increase funding for checkpoint screening law enforcement. The TSA is looking to expand funding for checkpoint screening law enforcement support by improving efficiencies. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles to civilian aircraft is a major concern, with over 40 aircraft hit since the 1970s, resulting in 25 crashes and over 600 deaths. The dangers of operating civil aircraft in conflict zones have been highlighted by incidents such as the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles to civilian aircraft has been a major concern, with over 40 aircraft hit since the 1970s, resulting in crashes and deaths. Initiatives have been taken to reduce the threat posed by man-portable air defense systems. Despite bilateral cooperation and voluntary reductions of MANPADS stockpiles, the threat of potential terrorists possessing these weapons remains. Civil aircraft are vulnerable to missile attacks due to limited security measures. The Counter-MANPADS program by DHS concluded in 2009, certifying two systems to protect airliners against heat-seeking missiles. However, these systems have not been deployed on commercial airliners due to high costs and limitations in protection. The Counter-MANPADS program certified two systems in 2009 to protect civil airliners against heat-seeking missiles. Critics note limitations in protection and high costs, while proponents argue they are effective against the most menacing threat. Airlines have not invested in these systems and suggest the government share the costs. Policy discussions focus on funding limited units for the Civil Reserve Aviation Fleet. Other approaches like ground-based missile countermeasures and escort planes with antimissile technology have been considered. MANPADS pose a security threat to civil aviation, especially in the United States. Efforts to improve airport security and reduce vulnerability to MANPADS attacks face challenges due to limited resources and large geographic areas. Despite past attention to the issue, significant vulnerabilities remain. Despite past efforts to improve airport security and reduce vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, considerable vulnerabilities remain. Terrorist attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities could escalate the threat of shoulder-fired missiles to a major national security priority. FEMA provides disaster assistance funded by the Disaster Relief Fund, which Congress appropriates budget authority to annually. Any remaining balance in the DRF at the end of the fiscal year is carried over to the next fiscal year. Congress has provided additional budget authority for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) through supplemental appropriations twelve times from FY2005 to FY2014. The reliance on emergency supplemental appropriations for disasters has raised concerns due to exceeding discretionary spending limits. The increase in declared disasters and their costs has prompted discussions on reducing federal spending on disasters, leading to provisions on disaster relief spending in the Budget Control Act (BCA). The Budget Control Act (BCA) sets spending caps and provides adjustments for disaster assistance. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received all available funding under the BCA's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 had $7.3 billion available for initial disaster needs. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the northeastern United States, causing $7.3 billion in initial disaster needs. However, this amount was insufficient for the full recovery. Congress later passed a $50.5 billion disaster relief package, including $11.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, 91 days after the incident was declared a major disaster. Funding for Hurricane Sandy was enacted 91 days after the incident was declared a major disaster, with $7.3 billion available in the DRF at the time. The BCA included an accommodation for additional funding for disasters, but catastrophic events like Hurricane Sandy still pose challenges. The OMB manages the sequestration process and calculates the adjusted 10-year rolling average of disaster relief spending to set the allowable cap adjustment. The allowable cap adjustment for disaster relief is determined by eliminating the highest and lowest years of costs. Initial expenditures for Hurricane Katrina and other 2005 storms will soon be irrelevant in calculating disaster assistance for FY2016. Congressional designation defines disaster relief funding post-BCA, with only a fraction of Hurricane Sandy's cost counting towards the 10-year average. The absence of significant spending in some years could lower the allowable adjustment, potentially leading to a breach if a large-scale disaster requires funding beyond the limit. Congress may opt for emergency funding or explore other options to address unbudgeted disaster relief needs. Congress could potentially increase the cap on disaster spending by combining costs from emergency declarations and Fire Management Assistance Grants with major disasters. There is a debate over the amount of federal money allocated for disaster relief, with suggestions to limit the number of events eligible for assistance or reduce the federal to state cost-share percentage. Congress has established federal firefighter assistance grant programs within DHS to provide additional support for local fire departments. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) was established in 2000 to provide grants for firefighting equipment and training. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the scope and funding for AFG were expanded. The 108th Congress established the SAFER program in 2003 to support firefighter staffing. Funding levels for AFG and SAFER are debated in the 114th Congress due to concerns over federal discretionary spending. AFG and SAFER were reauthorized in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act reauthorized AFG and SAFER grants, making changes to grant caps and distribution formulas. The 114th Congress will oversee the impact of these changes on grant distribution and effectiveness in protecting public health and safety against fire hazards. Emergency personnel and first responders use IP-enabled networks to disseminate alerts, warnings, and 911 calls during disasters. Federal, state, and local agencies are investing in interoperable public safety communications networks, digital alerts, NG 9-1-1 networks, and cybersecurity policies to support emergency communications. Adapting new technologies to existing systems poses challenges. Adapting new technologies like FirstNet, IPAWS, and ICO to existing emergency communication systems requires changes in governance, procedures, and training. FirstNet is developing a nationwide broadband network, IPAWS coordinates alert capabilities, and ICO focuses on improving 9-1-1 infrastructure. The NTIA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will share the goals of improving 9-1-1 infrastructure through ICO. Coordination is facilitated by federal programs and guidance outlined in the National Emergency Communications Plan of the Department of Homeland Security. The plan aims to converge emergency communication platforms and coordinate across various agencies for better response and coordination. The National Emergency Communications Plan focuses on communications for incidence response, notifications, public information exchange, and requests for assistance. Priorities include improving emergency responders' narrowband networks, integrating broadband technologies like FirstNet, and enhancing coordination among stakeholders in the emergency response community. The federal government has developed a National Preparedness System (NPS) to guide the nation in preparing for a wide array of hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, viral pandemics, and manmade disasters. This system aims to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from threats that pose the greatest risk to national security. The NPS is supported by strategic policies, national planning frameworks, and federal interagency operational plans mandated by Presidential Policy Directive 8, National Preparedness (PPD-8). The National Preparedness System (NPS) guides the nation in preparing for various hazards, including natural disasters and acts of terrorism. It includes strategic policies, planning frameworks, and operational plans mandated by Presidential Policy Directive 8. The NPS establishes methods for achieving preparedness for federal and non-federal partners, with annual National Preparedness Reports tracking progress. The Reports rely on a self-assessment process called THIRA to incorporate community risks and goals into the system, influencing budgetary decisions and long-term policy objectives. The 114th Congress may wish to oversee the development of the National Preparedness System (NPS) to ensure it aligns with the objectives of the PKEMRA statute and that federal roles and resources are properly allocated. This includes incorporating non-federal resources efficiently, allocating sufficient resources to the preparedness mission, and assessing the NPS's effectiveness in preventing, protecting against, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from risks. For more information, see CRS Report R43396, The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy. Hurricane Sandy, the second-largest Atlantic storm on record, made landfall in southern New Jersey on October 29, 2012. The storm caused immense damage, with at least 159 deaths, over 23,000 people in temporary shelters, 8.5 million customers without power, $65 billion in damages, and 650,000 homes damaged or destroyed. In response, President Obama established the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force through Executive Order 13632 on December 7, 2013. The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy (HSRS) is a comprehensive policy document with 69 recommendations for long-term recovery after Hurricane Sandy. The recommendations outline how federal funds should be used, how agencies should coordinate efforts, and how the region can prepare for future disasters. A Fall 2014 Progress Report showed that 50 of the recommendations had been completed. Congressional oversight may be necessary for years to ensure proper use of federal assistance. The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy (HSRS) has 69 recommendations for long-term recovery after Hurricane Sandy, with 50 recommendations completed by Fall 2014. Congressional oversight may be needed for years to ensure proper use of federal assistance. Further legislative and executive action is required to implement HSRS recommendations for future disaster recovery efforts. The 114th Congress may consider the need for an entity like the Hurricane Sandy Task Force for future disasters. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (SRIA) amended the Stafford Act to improve disaster assistance provided by FEMA after Hurricane Sandy. It aimed to address delays and bureaucratic burdens in recovery efforts. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 amended the Stafford Act to improve FEMA disaster assistance by establishing new procedures for administering the Public Assistance Program, revising the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, creating an alternative dispute resolution procedure, updating regulatory factors for Individual Assistance, and allowing tribal governments to request disaster declarations directly from the President. The 114th Congress may oversee the implementation of these reforms. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 amended the Stafford Act to improve FEMA disaster assistance by establishing new procedures for administering the Public Assistance Program. The 114th Congress may consider legislation to further address problems in implementing SRIA reforms and direct additional audits and reviews of the reforms. Public health emergency management laws expanded following the terrorist attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Since 2005, public health incidents have shown improvements in readiness for emergencies but also persistent gaps. Response plans may not anticipate all situations, technology for threat assessment may be limited, medical countermeasures may be lacking, distribution of countermeasures may be slow, medical system capacity may be insufficient, and funding for response costs may be delayed. The federal government's ability to address these gaps relies on the private sector and state/local governments. The 113th Congress reauthorized the body of law directing public health and medical preparedness through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. This focused on improving federal programs for medical countermeasures in emergencies and reauthorized grants to states for preparedness. Appropriations for programs under PAHPRA are lower than in the 2006 reauthorization. Assistance under the Stafford Act can help with public health emergency activities, but there is no federal program specifically for uninsured or uncompensated health care costs after a disaster. Congress has provided special assistance for this in the past. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) may help reduce disaster-related health care costs by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals. However, funding for public health emergencies is a challenge when not declared under the Stafford Act. The HHS Secretary has authority over the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF), which lacks funding. The Obama administration requested $110 million for the PHEF in the FY2016 budget to improve response capabilities. The Department of Homeland Security's management functions have expanded over the years, with funding for these functions increasing from $195 million in FY2003 to $743 million in FY2015. This growth is attributed to the need for more staff to oversee activities, rising personnel costs, technology investments, and real estate expenses. In debates over funding, the size and effectiveness of the department's management cadre are often questioned. The Department of Homeland Security's management functions have expanded over the years, with funding increasing from $195 million in FY2003 to $743 million in FY2015. This growth is due to rising personnel costs, technology investments, and real estate expenses. The unresolved debate revolves around the extent of departmental management involvement in departmental components. Some experts advocate for a strong management function, while others support a smaller management role. The Department of Homeland Security's management functions have expanded over the years, with funding increasing from $195 million in FY2003 to $743 million in FY2015. There is a debate over the extent of departmental management involvement in departmental components. Some advocate for strong management, while others support a smaller role. Once the department was established, it became clear that a small management cadre could not provide adequate coordination of policy or oversight. The term \"One DHS\" was used to describe efforts to establish a unified identity and way of doing business under different secretaries. In 2014, Jeh Johnson issued a memorandum to DHS leadership titled \"Strengthening Departmental Unity of Effort\" to reform DHS operations by implementing new processes for strategy, planning, and joint requirements. This initiative aimed to promote coordination, centralized decision-making, strategic budgeting, and department-wide acquisition strategy. The Department of Homeland Security is focusing on promoting greater efficiency in operations, budget processes, and acquisitions. They are establishing two groups, a Senior Leaders Council and a Deputies Management Action Group, to discuss policy, strategy, operations, and joint requirements. Additionally, improvements are being made to departmental management processes. The Department of Homeland Security is implementing reforms to enhance efficiency in operations, budget processes, and acquisitions. This includes establishing a Senior Leaders Council and a Deputies Management Action Group to address policy, strategy, and joint requirements. Bipartisan support has been shown for these reforms, with funding allocated in the FY2015 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. Several action items outlined in the reforms have been completed, such as improving coordination of cross-component operations. Several action items outlined in the memorandum were completed in 2014, including the establishment of a Cost Analysis Division and the development of a Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan. The Department of Homeland Security is seeking legislation to authorize proposed reforms and make permanent changes, with Congress potentially debating the appropriate role of departmental level management. Monitoring the progress of management reforms is crucial to assess their effectiveness. The Department of Homeland Security has faced financial management challenges since its inception, including difficulties in transferring budgets between agencies and inheriting financial problems from major legacy components. Attempts to develop an in-house financial management system and implement a department-wide system through outside developers have been unsuccessful. The Department of Homeland Security faced challenges with its financial management, including issues with transferring budgets and inheriting financial problems. The TASC initiative was cancelled after GAO ruled the initial contract was improperly awarded. Progress has been made in reducing material weaknesses in financial controls, with qualified audits completed in FY2012 and FY2013 highlighting significant deficiencies in internal controls. In FY2013, DHS completed a qualified audit with four material weaknesses resolved. In FY2014, DHS obtained a clean opinion on all financial statements for the first time. The DHS Office of Inspector General noted the progress but highlighted four deficiencies in internal control that remained. The challenge for DHS in FY2015 and beyond is to sustain progress in achieving an unmodified opinion on financial statements and avoid regression. The Department must continue remediation efforts to maintain a clean opinion on financial statements and obtain an unqualified opinion on internal control over financial reporting. The 114th Congress is likely to maintain interest in DHS's improvement efforts. The 114th Congress is expected to focus on DHS's efforts to enhance its internal financial systems, particularly in terms of budgetary oversight and controls for grant programs to prevent improper payments. Oversight may include reviewing compliance with control standards and considering adjustments to account for unique elements in DHS programs. The Department of Homeland Security is working on consolidating its headquarters to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The current headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 50 locations in the Washington, DC area, which is a result of merging 22 federal agencies. A $3.4 billion master plan has been approved to create a new unified headquarters. The Department of Homeland Security approved a $3.4 billion master plan to create a new headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia. The project is the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. $1.4 billion will be funded through DHS budget and $2 billion through GSA. Over $1.75 billion has been appropriated for the project. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters, has been completed. The project is now projected to be completed in FY2026 at a cost of $4.5 billion. The project at St. Elizabeths was criticized by GAO for not following capital decisionmaking practices. DHS and GSA revised their plans, with a new $3.7 billion plan to be completed by FY2021. Despite cost increases, the project is expected to save over $430 million compared to leasing. The Coast Guard now operates from St. Elizabeths, shifting the focus in Congress to how the consolidation should proceed. The new headquarters consolidation plan aligns with best practices identified by GAO and may be explored by the 114th Congress. Human resource management is a key consideration for the Department of Homeland Security, overseen by the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. The OCHCO supports the department's Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2012-2016. The current chief human capital officer, appointed in August 2011, is the first career member of the Senior Executive Service in the position. Oversight of personnel issues at DHS by the House of Representatives and the Senate may include succession management, employee morale, digital technology use for training and recruitment, and veteran employment policies. Hearings related to DHS appropriations or management matters could review these issues. Public Service Recognition Week in May highlights the value of public service and federal employees' work. Public Service Recognition Week in May honors federal employees and highlights the value of public service. Congress could use this occasion to review human resources management at the Department of Homeland Security, focusing on retention issues and succession planning. This could supplement ongoing congressional oversight of HRM policies at DHS. The Office of Personnel Management defines succession planning as a systematic approach to shaping leadership culture, building a talent pool, and identifying potential successors. Congress has previously reviewed succession planning policies at DHS during presidential transitions. The Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management conducted a hearing on presidential transition in 2008. DHS Under Secretary Elaine Duke testified about succession planning activities, including identifying critical positions and key competencies needed for transition. The House Subcommittee on Government Management discussed transition planning at DHS related to succession management. Recommendations for a comprehensive transition program were highlighted in a NAPA report. The House Subcommittee on Government Management discussed transition planning at DHS related to succession management. Recommendations for a comprehensive transition program were highlighted in a NAPA report, including identifying critical non-career executive positions, developing a transition training plan, and implementing training for career executives to serve in new roles during transition. However, the department's strategic plan and congressional submission do not mention succession planning. Congress may need to re-examine policies on succession management within DHS. The House Subcommittee on Government Management discussed transition planning at DHS related to succession management, including reviewing and updating succession plans, transition plans for executive positions, transition training programs for career executives, and the operation of the rotation program. Concerns about the morale of DHS employees persist, as evidenced by responses to the annual Employee Viewpoint Survey. The 2014 Employee Viewpoint Survey at DHS shows a decline in employee satisfaction. Responses indicate lower satisfaction with job and organization compared to previous years. OPM released a new data tool in July 2014. In July 2014, OPM released Unlock Talent.gov, a data tool for DHS to analyze Employee Viewpoint Survey results in detail. DHS has addressed morale issues through studies and initiatives, with Secretary Jeh Johnson establishing a DHS Employee Morale Task Force in October 2014. Task Force recommendations are due by July 2015 for council review and submission to the Secretary. The report on \"Federal Employee Engagement\" by MSPB recommended job characteristics and rewards to increase government-wide engagement. Suggestions included assigning employees interesting and meaningful work with a variety of tasks, and administering rewards fairly. Discussions on employee morale were also held in House and Senate hearings during the 113th Congress, with recommendations from the President of the Partnership for Public Service. During a Senate hearing, Jen Johnson, nominee for Secretary, emphasized the importance of improving employee morale at DHS by reminding them of the mission and addressing economic issues like pay raises and threats of sequestration. He also mentioned the need to involve labor unions in seeking support and ideas to boost morale. During a Senate hearing, Jen Johnson, nominee for Secretary, highlighted the significance of enhancing employee morale at DHS by addressing economic concerns like pay raises and threats of sequestration. Congress may review the council's report and consider potential changes to facilitate DHS employee engagement. Efforts to utilize data tools and partner with labor organizations to improve morale are also being explored. Executives from the private sector may provide expertise to DHS. Executives from the private sector can participate in DHS's Loaned Executive Program to assist with homeland security needs, improve processes, and enhance private sector engagement. They serve as advisors, evaluate policies, and can be appointed for up to one year, with a maximum total appointment of two years. Six loaned executives began six-month assignments as senior advisors to the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection on November 14, 2014. Their duties include \"site visits\" at major airports. FEMA planned to use a loaned executive to provide advice on supporting restoration after a catastrophic earthquake. Congress may examine the Loaned Executive Program's operation and results achieved. The Loaned Executive Program involves six executives advising TSA and CBP, with plans for FEMA involvement after a catastrophic earthquake. Digital technology is used for training and workforce development in the federal government. The Federal Leaders' views on workforce training and digital technology were obtained through an online survey. 76% of leaders felt adequately trained in digital technologies, while only 36% believed their agency's employees were adequately trained. The lack of skilled employees was considered a top barrier to implementing digital technology in the workplace. Federal Leaders reported that offices or positions had been created to assist in implementing new technology. Some leaders believed that digital technology had a positive impact on recruiting and retention. The report recommended investing in training for new and existing technologies using a blended approach. The Department of Homeland Security utilizes a \"blended approach\" for training, combining classroom, online courses, mobile-learning, and on-the-job training. Interagency groups convene to discuss lessons learned and share best practices. The department's specific use of digital technology for training, recruitment, and retention is not publicly available. The Federal Employee Viewpoint survey shows that 43.6% of DHS employees are satisfied with their training. The Department of Homeland Security uses a blended approach for training, with 43.6% of employees satisfied with their training. Congress may explore digital technology use for training and recruitment. The Obama Administration prioritizes assisting veterans in transitioning to civilian jobs. Executive Order 13518 focuses on employing veterans in the federal government. The Executive Order established an Interagency Council on Veterans Employment to increase the number of veterans employed by the Federal Government. It directed the Department of Homeland Security, along with other departments, to develop counseling and training programs aligning veterans' skills with Federal employment opportunities. The Department of Homeland Security aims to hire veterans as a management measure, with a goal of 25% of total new hires being veterans. In FY2014, 27.6% of new hires were veterans, exceeding the target. Congress may review DHS policies on veteran hiring, including recruitment positions and results. The Department of Homeland Security focuses on hiring veterans as a management measure, with a goal of 25% of new hires being veterans. In FY2014, 27.6% of new hires were veterans, exceeding the target. Stakeholders emphasize the importance of research and development (R&D) in creating technologies to defend against homeland security threats, but there are concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of agency performance in this area. The 114th Congress may continue to assess the impact of investments in homeland security R&D. The DHS homeland security R&D activities aim to meet the needs of component agencies and other customers. Stakeholders debate on maximizing effectiveness, with some advocating for increased research investments for technology breakthroughs, while others suggest a rebalancing towards technology development. Many prototypes in the private sector need a small boost to become procurable technologies. Some stakeholders call for a shift towards long-term research activities to avoid a lack of research outcomes for prototypes. Suggestions include adopting a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy similar to DARPA for \"leap-ahead\" advances in countering terrorist capabilities. The DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology coordinates homeland security R&D activities within DHS and across the federal government, facing challenges in this role. The 114th Congress may oversee new strategic approaches by DHS to coordinate R&D activities, address long-standing concerns, and improve productivity. Efforts to reorganize DHS R&D activities have been considered by both the Administration and Congress. Stakeholders criticize the current productivity of DHS R&D activities and call for reprioritization and consolidation. The S&T Directorate's R&D efforts have been valued by some stakeholders, despite fluctuating congressional appropriations. Some policymakers find the slow rate of return from S&T Directorate investments unacceptable."
