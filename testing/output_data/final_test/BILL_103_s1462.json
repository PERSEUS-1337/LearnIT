SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that youth are disproportionately victims of violence, with teenagers in the US being more at risk than adults. Child abuse and neglect rates are increasing, leading to a rise in fatalities. Violence is cyclical, with abused or neglected children more likely to perpetuate violence. Child abuse and neglect significantly increase the likelihood of future arrest for violent crimes, with statistics showing a 38% increase in adult arrest, 53% in juvenile arrest, and 84% of prison inmates reporting childhood abuse. Additionally, two-thirds of men who abuse their wives come from violent childhood homes, with half of them being abused as children themselves.
