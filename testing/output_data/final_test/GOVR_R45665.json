    "content": "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 gives the federal government power to address race and national origin discrimination by ensuring that federal funds do not support racial discrimination in any way. This unique provision prohibits discrimination in all federally funded programs, activities, and institutions. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs and institutions. The Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education plays a key role in enforcing Title VI to protect civil rights in all educational levels and institutions. The report traces Title VI's historical roots and legislative proposals, focusing on the central doctrinal question behind it. The report examines the central doctrinal question behind Title VI, focusing on what the statute prohibits and how agencies enforce it. It specifically looks at how the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights enforces Title VI in schools and discusses recent developments related to the law. The report does not cover litigation under Title VI but highlights considerations for Congress if they revisit the civil rights law. In 1964, Title VI was debated, building on the premise that federal funds should not support discrimination based on race. This idea was first proposed in 1947 by President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, and later echoed by President Eisenhower in 1953. The Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 further emphasized the need for the federal government to use its funds to combat discrimination. Pressure on the federal government to combat discrimination in public schools and beyond led to early steps in the Kennedy Administration. Secretary of HEW, Abraham Ribicoff, refused to support institutions that discriminated. This led to the withdrawal of support for segregated schooling on military bases. Attorney General Robert Kennedy suggested using federal funds to persuade southern states to change their racial practices. These early efforts had limitations. The federal government's use of the spending power to address race discrimination had limitations, as noted by former HEW Secretary Ribicoff and other Kennedy Administration officials. There were doubts about the executive branch's authority to withhold or condition funds, leading to the realization that administrative action alone was insufficient. The Kennedy Administration realized that administrative action alone could not fully address the issue of race discrimination. Congress, on the other hand, had more legal freedom to impose conditions on federal funding. This led to the creation of Title VI, which underwent significant changes to prevent potential administrative abuse. Title VI was created to address race discrimination by prohibiting federally funded programs from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. Federal agencies are required to implement rules to enforce this mandate. Title VI was created to address race discrimination by prohibiting federally funded programs from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. Any rule, regulation, or order issued under Title VI requires presidential or Attorney General approval. Agency enforcement can involve terminating federal financial assistance or using other legal means, such as lawsuits by the Attorney General. Procedural requirements aim to encourage consensual resolutions with recipients. Title VI prohibits racial discrimination in federally funded programs based on race, color, or national origin. The definition of discriminatory practices is left to enforcing agencies and the courts, with the Supreme Court's 2001 decision in Alexander v. Sandoval playing a significant role. The Supreme Court's 2001 decision in Alexander v. Sandoval clarified that Section 601 of Title VI only prohibits intentional discrimination in federally funded programs. This can be proven through either direct evidence of singling out individuals by race or indirect evidence of a discriminatory motive. Discrimination along racial lines can occur when individuals are expressly singled out for adverse treatment. The 2001 Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval clarified that Title VI prohibits intentional discrimination in federally funded programs. Discrimination can be proven through direct evidence of singling out individuals by race for adverse treatment. This has led to a shift where allegations of racially motivated mistreatment under race-neutral policies are more common. Title VI prohibits intentional discrimination in federally funded programs, even if race is not explicitly mentioned in the policy or by the decisionmaker. The key factor is whether discriminatory intent influenced the adverse treatment, with racial animus likely leading to intentional discrimination. This interpretation has been upheld for decades. Title VI prohibits intentional discrimination in federally funded programs, even if race is not explicitly mentioned. There has been debate about whether policies with a disparate effect on different races are also forbidden. The Supreme Court's Lau v. Nichols case initially suggested this, but a later case, Alexander v. Sandoval, rejected that interpretation. Currently, Title VI only directly prohibits intentional discrimination. Lau was the Court's first encounter with Title VI and led to uncertainty about the statute. In Lau v. Nichols, the Supreme Court ruled that the school system's refusal of bilingual or remedial English instruction violated Title VI and the Equal Protection Clause. The Court found that discrimination based on effect, not just purposeful design, was prohibited under Section 601. The school system, as a recipient of federal funds, was obligated to provide equal educational benefits to the Chinese-speaking minority. In Lau v. Nichols, the Supreme Court ruled that discrimination based on effect, not just purposeful design, was prohibited under Section 601. The school system was obligated to provide equal educational benefits to the Chinese-speaking minority. The Court also discussed regulations issued by HEW to ensure students with \"linguistic deficiencies\" had the same educational opportunities as other students. In Lau v. Nichols, the Supreme Court ruled that Title VI barred policies with a disparate impact, not just intentional discrimination. The Court's decision favored students under a disparate impact theory, citing HEW's regulation implementing Title VI. However, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Court appeared to reverse course by involving a white applicant's challenge to an affirmative action admissions policy. The Justices in Bakke had to address how Section 601's nondiscrimination mandate related to the Equal Protection Clause. Five Justices concluded that Title VI only prohibited racial classifications that violated the Equal Protection Clause, requiring discriminatory intent. The Court has since been divided on the ambiguity of what type of discrimination Section 601 prohibits. The Supreme Court in Alexander v. Sandoval clarified that Title VI does not prohibit policies with only a disparate impact, aligning it with the Equal Protection Clause. However, the Lau case presented a challenge as it seemed to contradict this interpretation. The Sandoval Court clarified that Title VI only outlaws intentional discrimination, not policies with a disparate impact. Lau case's interpretation was seen as conflicting with this, but the Court considered Lau to have been \"rejected\" by the Bakke decision. The Sandoval Court clarified that Title VI only outlaws intentional discrimination, not policies with a disparate impact. Section 602 of Title VI directs agencies to issue regulations consistent with the statute's objectives, limiting the redress of funding agencies to intentional discrimination outlawed by Section 601. The fight over Title VI in the courts has focused on definitions. The fight over Title VI in the courts has focused on definitions of unlawful discrimination under Section 601. Funding agencies must also consider their rulemaking authority under Section 602 to enforce the nondiscrimination mandate effectively. Every federal funding agency is directed to issue regulations consistent with the objectives of Title VI. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has unique coordinating authority over Title VI, and funding agencies have generally followed the rules developed by DOJ in 1964. The broad rulemaking authority provided by Section 602 has led to uncertainty about the limits of agencies' authority. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed this issue, resulting in contrasting views on what agencies can outlaw as unlawful discrimination under Title VI. The broad rulemaking authority under Title VI has led to contrasting views on agencies' ability to address discrimination. Justice Stewart's expansive view in Lau allowed agencies to issue broad rules deterring discrimination, but it was not adopted by the majority of the Court. This has created uncertainty about the limits of agencies' authority under Section 602. The expansive view of Section 602, based on principles of administrative law, allows agencies broad rulemaking authority. This approach, similar to Justice Stewart's in Lau, grants agencies the discretion to make necessary rules to carry out statutory mandates, with courts traditionally deferring to their expertise. This interpretation of Section 602 has not been rejected by the Court, despite not being widely adopted. The expansive view of Section 602 grants agencies broad rulemaking authority, allowing them to issue rules related to the enabling legislation. This leniency could authorize agencies to create prophylactic rules to achieve the goals of Section 601, such as prohibiting racially disparate impacts. This interpretation may find support in administrative law principles and constitutional analogies. The Court's decision in Guardians allowed federal agencies broad rulemaking authority under Section 602, similar to the Fifteenth Amendment's empowerment of Congress to enforce voting discrimination prohibitions. This structural similarity supports the view that Section 602 should give agencies significant authority. Justice Steven's view in Guardians and Justice Stewart's in Lau have not commanded a majority from the Court. The analogy between Section 602 and the Fifteenth Amendment has lost some force, but it has not been expressly ruled out by the Court. The analogy is consistent with the way federal courts have interpreted the Thirteenth Amendment. However, some Justices in Sandoval have suggested that regulations under Section 602 should not be as expansive. Justices in Sandoval have suggested that regulations under Section 602 must align more closely with the purpose of ridding federally funded programs of intentional discrimination. Justice Scalia expressed doubt that regulations allowing for disparate impact could be reconciled with Section 601's prohibition of intentional discrimination. The majority's concern focused on the narrowness of Section 601 rather than the breadth of Section 602. The majority in Sandoval expressed dissatisfaction with the \"reasonably related\" test for regulations under Section 602, suggesting a need for a new test aligned with the purpose of eliminating intentional discrimination in federally funded programs. They hinted at a potential constitutional analogy with the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce guarantees of equal protection and due process. The majority in Sandoval suggested a new test for regulations under Section 602, aligning with the purpose of eliminating intentional discrimination in federally funded programs. They hinted at a constitutional analogy with the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce guarantees of equal protection and due process. Congress may enforce the guarantees but cannot redefine violations. An agency can enforce Section 601's bar against intentional discrimination through regulations, but cannot add to the types of discrimination outlawed by Section 601. The Court has yet to resolve agencies' rulemaking authority under Section 602. Title VI disparate impact regulations may still be defensible depending on enforcement style. Even if Section 602 is narrowly construed for intentional discrimination, Title VI may allow regulations addressing disparate impact. Agencies could argue that disparate impact rules counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus, benefiting some races at the expense of others. Title VI regulations addressing disparate impact may still be justifiable by targeting unconscious prejudices and disguised animus, even if not explicitly focused on intentional discrimination. These rules could help uncover discriminatory intent in subtler forms like covert stereotyping, aligning with Sandoval's standards. However, they may face constraints, requiring agencies to demonstrate a causal link between a policy and its racially discriminatory effects. The \"robust causality requirement\" is proposed to prevent racial imbalance from automatically establishing a prima facie case of disparate impact, protecting defendants from liability for disparities they did not create. The practical implications of this requirement are unclear, but framing the debate around Section 602 in these terms could shift the focus to the concrete issue of disparate impact liability. Title VI, which applies to federal funds, has been heavily influenced by its use in public schools, particularly by the Office for Civil Rights. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), now under the U.S. Department of Education (ED), enforces Title VI in public schools and universities, handling a variety of claims alleging race and national origin discrimination. OCR uses a detailed manual called the Case Processing Manual (CPM) to guide its investigation and resolution of complaints, dividing its enforcement into five phases. OCR's enforcement is divided into five phases, starting with a Jurisdictional Evaluation where OCR assesses the sufficiency of an allegation for race or national origin discrimination. The allegation must contain enough facts to establish jurisdiction over the subject matter and entity complained of, and be filed within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. After determining jurisdiction and suitability for review, OCR opens an investigation by issuing informational letters to the complainant and recipient, outlining the allegations and basis for jurisdiction. OCR also informs parties of its role as a neutral fact-finder and the complainant's right to bring suit in federal court. Facilitated Resolution process is offered as a voluntary resolution method. OCR offers a voluntary resolution process called \"Facilitated Resolution Between the Parties\" to assist in informally resolving allegations before proceeding with an investigation. If parties fail to reach an agreement within 30 days, OCR will resume its investigation. OCR does not approve or monitor agreements reached through this process. If no resolution is reached, OCR will proceed with an investigation involving data review and interviews. OCR may conduct reviews of school data, interviews with students and staff, or other measures. Recipients can choose to negotiate a voluntary resolution with OCR, with recent resolutions indicating this is common. If no agreement is reached, OCR will issue findings on each allegation based on evidence, either finding non-compliance or insufficient evidence. In cases of non-compliance, OCR will propose a resolution agreement outlining steps for the recipient. OCR will propose a resolution agreement for non-compliance with Title VI, giving the recipient 90 days to negotiate. If no agreement is reached, OCR will issue a \"Letter of Impending Enforcement Action.\" Once an agreement is reached, OCR will monitor compliance through reporting requirements and site visits. OCR reserves the right to visit recipients, interview staff and students, and request additional reports or data to ensure compliance with resolution agreements. If circumstances change significantly, OCR may amend or terminate the agreement. If compliance cannot be achieved through negotiation, OCR may resort to enforcement mechanisms such as terminating federal funds or referring complaints to the DOJ for litigation. OCR's enforcement of Title VI has shifted towards resolution agreements over termination. Complaints often involve different treatment, retaliation, and racial harassment. In 2016, OCR received 2,400 complaints under 17 categories, with 976 alleging different treatment, 569 alleging retaliation, and 548 alleging racial harassment. In 2016, OCR received 2,400 complaints under 17 categories, with 976 alleging different treatment, 569 alleging retaliation, and 548 alleging racial harassment. OCR reviews complaints under Title VI, with the largest category involving allegations of \"disparate treatment,\" which includes intentionally disciplining students differently based on race or excluding them in some way. OCR seeks to confirm these allegations by looking for evidence of discriminatory intent. OCR investigates complaints under Title VI, focusing on disparate treatment based on race. In a recent case, a complaint from an African American student alleged he was disciplined more severely than his white classmates. OCR looked for \"apparent differences\" in treatment to determine if there was discrimination. OCR investigated a complaint from an African American student who alleged disparate treatment based on race in disciplinary actions. The investigation revealed apparent differences in how the school treated the student compared to similarly situated white students, including discrepancies in recording disciplinary warnings and the severity of consequences. The OCR investigation found that a white student's mother made a complaint about teasing leading to misconduct, while Student A pointed out a case of leniency towards a white male student for assault. The school defended its decisions, but OCR determined that there was a pattern of discriminatory treatment based on race in Student A's discipline, violating Title VI. In a recent case involving allegations of disparate treatment, an Illinois public school limited a \"Black Lives Matter\" assembly to only black students, leading to a finding of different treatment based on race. This decision raised concerns about Title VI violations. The OCR found that the school violated Title VI by holding a racially exclusive assembly without considering race-neutral alternatives. The school district agreed not to allow similar assemblies in the future to regain compliance. The debates over Title VI have focused on how courts interpret Sections 601 and 602, with Congress having the final say. Recent congressional interest has been on disparate impact regulations and new protected classes. The Supreme Court's decision in Alexander v. Sandoval raised doubts on disparate impact liability under Title VI. The Trump Administration is reconsidering Title VI regulations that go beyond intentional discrimination to address policies with a racially disparate impact. Congress may clarify Title VI's scope by either limiting it to intentional discrimination or endorsing disparate impact, similar to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Congress could potentially amend Title VI to include \"sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity)\" as protected classes, expanding its coverage. The effects of such an amendment would depend on how courts interpret this change in Section 601. In considering potential amendments to Title VI, courts may interpret changes to Section 601 to apply heightened scrutiny to claims of sex discrimination while possibly only requiring basic rationality for gender identity cases. Amendments introducing new protected classes could expand Title VI's reach beyond constitutionally suspect classifications, potentially reshaping the law's impact on discrimination in schools over the past 50 years. The debates over Title VI have focused on ambiguities regarding the type of discrimination it prohibits and the rules for enforcement. The Supreme Court has clarified that Title VI only prohibits intentional discrimination, not just discriminatory effects. The Court may further clarify that agencies can only outlaw policies with provable discriminatory intent. The Court's future decision on enforcing Title VI remains uncertain. OCR will likely continue enforcing Title VI in line with constitutional standards. OCR handles numerous complaints annually, resolving issues in various educational institutions. ED retains the power to withhold financial support from non-compliant programs."
