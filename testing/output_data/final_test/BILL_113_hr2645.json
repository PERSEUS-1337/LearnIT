    "content": "The \"Forbidding Advertisement Through Child Exploitation Act of 2013\" or the \"FACE Act of 2013\" prohibits social media services from using self-images uploaded by minors for commercial purposes. The Federal Trade Commission may create regulations to enforce this prohibition. The requirements of section 2 and its regulations apply to persons, partnerships, and corporations under the Federal Trade Commission's authority. Violations of section 2 are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC enforces these regulations in the same manner as other unfair or deceptive practices. The enforcement of section 2 and its regulations falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Violators are subject to penalties and privileges outlined in the Act. State Attorneys General can also enforce these regulations if the interests of their residents are affected by violations. State Attorneys General can bring civil actions on behalf of residents in State or Federal courts to enjoin acts or practices violating regulations, enforce compliance, obtain damages, restitution, or other relief. Before filing an action, the State must provide written notice to the Federal Trade Commission. State Attorneys General must notify the Federal Trade Commission before filing civil actions. The FTC has the authority to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal in such actions. State Attorneys General must notify the Federal Trade Commission before filing civil actions, allowing the FTC to intervene and file petitions for appeal. This does not prevent State officials from conducting investigations or compelling witnesses and evidence. The Act does not override any State laws that offer more protection for minors' self-images on social media. Definitions for \"self-image\" and \"social media service\" are provided in the Act. The Act will take effect six months after its enactment."
