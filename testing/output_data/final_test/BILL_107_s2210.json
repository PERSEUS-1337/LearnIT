    "content": "The Debt Relief Enhancement Act of 2002, also known as the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, amends the International Financial Institutions Act by adding a new section for the modification of the initiative. The Debt Relief Enhancement Act of 2002, known as the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to work with international institutions to reduce the debt of eligible countries to 150 percent of their annual exports for the first 3 years after enactment. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative allows for debt reduction to 10% of annual revenues, prioritizing the use of international financial institution resources. Debt cancellation is not tied to policy compliance in impoverished countries. The curr_chunk discusses policies that could deepen poverty or harm the environment in impoverished countries, including implementing user fees on education and healthcare, increasing cost recovery from the poor for basic services, reducing minimum wage to less than $2 per day, and undermining workers' rights. The curr_chunk outlines conditions that would disqualify a country from debt cancellation under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, including excessive military expenditures, support for terrorism, lack of cooperation on narcotics control, and unsustainable resource extraction. The curr_chunk specifies that a country may only receive debt cancellation under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative if it agrees to use the financial benefits for programs combating HIV/AIDS and poverty, improving basic services, and addressing environmental degradation. The curr_chunk outlines conditions for debt cancellation under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, including using financial benefits for HIV/AIDS and poverty programs, basic services, and environmental degradation. It also emphasizes transparent policymaking, good governance, and public participation in poverty reduction efforts. The recent epidemiological data for a country shows HIV prevalence rates of at least 5% among women in prenatal clinics or over 20% in high-risk groups. The Decision Point is when the executive boards of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund review debt sustainability for debt relief eligibility under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Ministers discussed the Cologne Debt Initiative at the Cologne Economic Summit in June 1999. SEC. 3. REPORT ON EXPANSION OF DEBT RELIEF TO NON-HIPC COUNTRIES. The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress within 90 days on options and costs for expanding debt relief to poor countries not eligible for the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. This includes burden-sharing among donor countries and institutions, as well as additional measures for debt sustainability after economic shocks or natural disasters. Expansion of debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative should be considered for poor countries with outstanding debt payments exceeding 10% of annual revenues, or 5% in cases of public health crises. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative refers to a multilateral debt relief program for heavily indebted poor countries. Authorization of appropriations for the President to carry out section 1625 of the International Financial Institutions Act is granted for fiscal year 2003 and beyond, with funds remaining available until expended."
