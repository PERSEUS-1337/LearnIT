    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public Retiree's Investment Act of 2009\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the United States banking system's ability to extend credit is restricted by a need to conserve capital, as private investors are unwilling to provide capital due to risk assessment challenges. State and local public pension funds are long-term investors who benefit from a well-capitalized banking system. Certain State and local pension plans have the ability to form cooperative business endeavors solely owned by them or in concert with public pension plans in other States. Some public pension plans are willing to invest in preferred stocks of US banking institutions with guaranties provided by the Secretary of the Treasury or other Federal Government officer. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to the Act, including \"eligible investment,\" \"public pension plans,\" and \"public pension bank capital infusion fund.\" These definitions clarify the types of investments and entities involved in the Act. The curr_chunk defines terms related to investing in preferred stocks of US banking institutions with guarantees from the Treasury or other federal agencies. It includes definitions for \"qualified equity offering\" and \"reguarantee.\" The curr_chunk defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Treasury. SEC. 4. PUBLIC PENSION PLAN INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN BANK PREFERRED STOCK INSTRUMENTS. The Secretary has the authority to guarantee eligible investments or reguarantee a guarantee of eligible investments. Guarantees provided must be unconditional for the life of the investment and cover timely payment of dividends and return of principal. Procedures for notification and performance under guarantees are outlined. The Secretary, along with other guarantors, must agree on the terms for guaranteeing or reguaranteeing eligible investments of a public pension bank capital infusion fund. Public pension plans must be authorized under state law to participate in such investments. The powers of public pension plans for eligible investments are determined by the law of the domicile State or a choice of law agreement in joint endeavors. Eligible investments of a public pension bank capital infusion fund can only be guaranteed under specific conditions. The public pension bank capital infusion fund can guarantee investments in preferred stock issued by qualifying financial institutions under specific conditions, with a limit of $50,000,000,000 in aggregate investments. The preferred stock must meet certain requirements, including senior preferred status with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share or higher. The preferred stock issued by qualifying financial institutions must have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share or higher, be senior to common stock, pari passu with existing preferred shares, meet Tier I capital requirements, have a perpetual term, and pay cumulative dividends at an initial rate of 8.5 percent per year. Beginning on the enactment date of this Act, the reset rate is determined annually by adding the yield on 10-year US treasury notes with the difference between 8.5 percent and the yield on the enactment date. The redemption of the stock is subject to conditions including a 3-year lock-up period and the option to redeem with proceeds from a qualified equity offering after the third anniversary of the investment. The preferred stock can be redeemed at any time at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued dividends, subject to approval. No dividends can be paid on other shares while the preferred stock is outstanding. The preferred stock issued by a financial institution cannot be repurchased or redeemed until it has been redeemed in full. The stock is nonvoting except for certain class voting rights. If dividends are not paid on the preferred stock, directors may be appointed. If dividends on preferred stock are not paid for more than 4 consecutive periods, the Secretary may appoint 2 directors to the board until full dividends are paid. Guaranty payments must follow a mutually agreed policy. Guarantee authority is limited to eligible investments. (g) Treatment Under Other Law: A public pension bank capital infusion fund managed by an approved service vendor shall be exempt from taxation and deemed a political subdivision of a State. (h) Reports: Guarantees issued by the Secretary for eligible investments require a guarantor. The guarantor of eligible investments must report to Congress and the Secretary on the status of guarantees. The report must include details such as the institution issuing the investments, face amount of each investment, dividends paid, and any payments made by the guarantor."
