    "content": "Since 1956, federal surface transportation programs have been funded largely by taxes on motor fuels that flow into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). However, trust fund revenues have not kept up with spending since 2001, leading to Congress providing Treasury general fund transfers to keep the HTF solvent. This report focuses on the challenge of how to pay for the national transportation system's needs. Since 2001, Congress has authorized transfers from the Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to cover shortfalls in surface transportation spending. A total of $143.6 billion has been shifted to the HTF, with the latest $70 billion authorized in the FAST Act signed in 2015. However, projections show that the HTF balance will approach zero in FY2021, leading to continued funding challenges for Congress. Transportation funding remains a major issue for Congress, with the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) relying primarily on fuel taxes for revenue. The HTF has separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with fuel taxes contributing 85%-90% of the funds paid by highway users. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon of fuel taxes, while the rest goes to the highway account. Motor fuel taxes have increased four times since the fund was created in 1956. Since its creation in 1956, motor fuel taxes have increased four times: in 1959, 1982, 1990, and 1993. Changes to the taxation structure since 1993 have modestly boosted trust fund revenues. Legislation like the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 aimed to increase future income for the trust fund by addressing tax fraud and transferring general fund revenue to support transportation activities. It was believed that these changes, along with a $12.5 billion unexpended balance in the trust fund and higher fuel tax revenue from economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the surface transportation program. The overly optimistic forecasts associated with SAFETEA led to shortfalls in funding for the surface transportation program. Congress enacted a bill in September 2008 transferring $8 billion from the Treasury general funds to support the Highway Trust Fund. Vehicle miles traveled are no longer increasing at the previous rate, and policy changes are weakening the link between driving activity and fuel tax revenues. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards are expected to increase, reducing fuel consumption in the long term. However, the rise of hybrid and electric vehicles, which pay less in fuel taxes, raises equity concerns. Increasing fuel tax rates could provide immediate relief to the trust fund, but the sustainability of relying on fuel taxes for transportation funding is uncertain due to decreasing fuel consumption trends. The federal highway user tax revenues in the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) have been insufficient to fund surface transportation programs since FY2008. The 2015 surface transportation act used Treasury general funds to address the shortfall through FY2020. From FY2021 to FY2026, there is projected to be an annual average gap of $20.1 billion between dedicated revenues and spending. Congress may need to find new sources of income or settle for a smaller transportation program in 2020. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has faced funding challenges since FY2008, leading to the use of Treasury general funds to bridge the gap until FY2020. Projections show a significant gap between HTF revenues and outlays post the FAST Act expiration in FY2020, with a potential shortfall of $101 billion for a five-year reauthorization and $125 billion for a six-year reauthorization starting in FY2021. This could result in the need for new income sources or reduced transportation programs in the future. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is projected to have a balance of $12.1 billion at the start of FY2021, which will allow the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to meet their obligations to states and transit agencies. However, without changes, the HTF balance is expected to reach near zero by the end of FY2021, leading to delayed payments. By the end of FY2025, the HTF is projected to have a negative balance of $88.5 billion, but current law does not allow for negative balances. This situation may require new income sources or reduced transportation programs in the future. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is projected to have a balance of $12.1 billion at the start of FY2021, but without changes, it is expected to reach near zero by the end of FY2021. By the end of FY2025, the HTF is projected to have a negative balance of $88.5 billion, requiring new income sources or reduced transportation programs in the future. Congress would need to find additional revenue or budget offsets to continue funding surface transportation at the current level. Highway and transit spending based solely on projected revenue would be limited to roughly $41 billion in FY2021. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is projected to have a balance of $12.1 billion at the start of FY2021, declining significantly from the \"baseline\" outlays of $58 billion. The projected decrease in HTF revenue implies reduced contract authority for FHWA and FTA through FY2026. Despite reducing expenditures, immediate relief from demands on the HTF may not be achieved due to the long-term nature of transportation projects. Obligated but unspent contract authority for highway projects is projected to be around $64 billion, with an additional $24 billion available but unobligated. For public transportation programs, unpaid obligations are projected to be nearly $16 billion, with another $10 billion in unobligated contract authority. The federal tax on gasoline was first imposed in 1932 at 1 cent per gallon, raised during World War II and the Korean War. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 established the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) at 3 cents per gallon for the Interstate Highway System. The tax remained at 4 cents from 1959 to 1983, with revenues growing as fuel consumption and vehicle miles traveled increased. Since 1983, lawmakers have raised the gasoline tax three times to address the growing fuel consumption and vehicle miles traveled. The tax rates increased significantly, with a 125% raise in 1983, a 55% raise in 1990, and a 31% raise in 1993. These increases were challenging and influenced by the broader budgetary environment and political factors. During the lame-duck session in 1982, bipartisan support for a 5-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax was secured, with a penny allocated to a new mass transit account within the Highway Trust Fund. President Reagan, initially opposed, softened his stance and announced support for the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, citing the need to stimulate the economy and maintain the user fee principle for the highway system. President Reagan signed the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) into law on January 6, 1983, doubling the highway fuel tax to 9 cents per gallon. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90) was passed to address impending sequestration orders and included budget cuts, tax changes, and a gasoline tax increase. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90) raised the gasoline tax by 5 cents per gallon, with half going to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and the other half to the general fund for deficit reduction. OBRA93 redirected the 2.5-cents-per-gallon fuel tax from deficit reduction to the HTF starting in 1995. The gasoline tax increased to 18.3 cents per gallon, with 6.8 cents per gallon initially going to deficit reduction. This later changed to 4.3 cents per gallon for deficit reduction and 14 cents per gallon for the Highway Trust Fund. In 1997, all motor fuel tax revenue was redirected to the HTF, with 3.45 cents per gallon for highways and 0.85 cents for mass transit. Revenue into the HTF has fallen short since 2001. Since 2001, revenue into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has not met expectations, lagging inflation since FY2007. Declines in HTF revenue have occurred due to reduced vehicle travel, but recent increases in vehicle miles traveled and gasoline sales suggest a potential for growth. Despite this, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts declines in gasoline tax revenues through FY2027, as the political challenges of increasing motor fuel taxes persist. The political challenges of increasing motor fuel taxes have led to interest in alternative approaches for supporting the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). These approaches include tying tax rates to fuel prices, changing the structure of fuel taxes, charging drivers based on distance driven, and implementing freight-related charges. A redesigned gas tax could be indexed to inflation and fuel-efficiency improvements, with the current gas tax rate raised to compensate for purchasing power loss since 1993. Adjusting fuel taxes in 2016 to match inflation would have increased the 18.3-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax to 31 cents. The consumer price index since 1993 has led to a proposed increase in the gasoline tax from 18.3 cents per gallon to 31 cents per gallon, and the diesel tax from 24.3 cents per gallon to 41.1 cents per gallon. The method involves raising the base tax rate for gasoline by 13 cents per gallon and for diesel by 17 cents per gallon, with future adjustments tied to inflation rates. Adjustments to account for lost revenue due to increased fuel efficiency would be based on miles driven and fuel consumed by vehicle category. Despite rising fuel-economy standards for new vehicles, the overall efficiency of the vehicle fleet will increase slowly due to the large number of older vehicles on the road. An annual efficiency adjustment to fuel tax rates would likely be small due to the large number of older vehicles on the road. One approach to overcoming political obstacles to higher fuel taxes is to pair a fuels-tax increase with income-tax rebates approximating the average cost of the increase to drivers. The cost of the rebates would be offset by the additional taxes collected, as certain groups would not receive rebates. The rebates could be phased out over time while the higher tax rates would continue. This solution raises concerns about being viewed as a general fund transfer and the need for offsetting spending reductions in the federal budget. The federal motor fuel tax could be assessed as a percentage of the retail price of fuel under the sales tax concept. This approach could lead to fluctuating sales tax revenues based on fuel price changes. States that tied fuel taxes to prices in the past faced revenue shortfalls when fuel prices dropped. Virginia recently eliminated its cents-per-gallon fuel taxes in favor of this model. Virginia recently eliminated its cents-per-gallon fuel taxes in favor of a sales tax on fuel based on the average wholesale price, with price floors to prevent further reductions. A federal sales tax on motor fuel may only be a temporary solution for transportation funding as it relies on fuel consumption, which could decrease with improved vehicle efficiency or adoption of electric vehicles. Economists suggest mileage-based user charges as a more reliable source of highway funding compared to sales taxes on fuel, which can underperform if fuel prices decrease. This concept involves motorists paying fees based on distance driven and other road use costs, with funds collected dedicated to surface transportation purposes. Federal motor fuel taxes and state truck mileage charges are existing forms of indirect road user charges. Recent technological advancements support the implementation of mileage-based user charges. Recent technological advancements support the implementation of mileage-based road user charges, which could range from a flat cent-per-mile charge to a variable charge based on GPS tracking. Proposals also suggest collecting charges at the pump similar to fuel taxes, with electric vehicle users required to pay for road use. Implementation would need to address concerns about personal privacy and higher costs compared to motor fuels tax. The implementation of a nationwide mileage-based road user charge faces barriers such as public concern about privacy, higher costs to establish and enforce the charge, administrative challenges due to the large vehicle fleet size, and controversy over setting and adjusting charge rates. Fairly charging the \"unbanked\" without bank accounts or credit/debit cards is also a challenge. This charge would be similar to a national toll, potentially resulting in double charges for toll road users. A road user charge could potentially replace tolls, but complications may arise regarding bond servicing. The Highway Trust Fund has funded federal transportation and highway programs since 1982. If a mileage-based charge is used for highways only, it could be considered a user fee. However, if it funds both highways and public transportation, it may be seen as a tax. Legal issues would need to be addressed, including specifying how the charge revenue would be spent. Legislation must specify revenue allocation to highway and mass transit accounts within the fund. Various proposals from SAFETEA commissions and groups like AASHTO and TRB aim to generate revenue for the HTF. AASHTO's Matrix lists 33 potential revenue options, including taxes on freight and energy. Revenue estimates are suggestive and dependent on fuel prices and auto registrations. The Highway Trust Fund's financing options could sustain the existing mechanism or support the general fund, weakening the link between taxes and highway spending. Initially temporary, the fund has expanded beyond the Interstate System, including a mass transit account created in 1982. The Highway Trust Fund, created in 1956, supports public transportation spending but is not essential for federal transportation funding. Congress has funded infrastructure projects from the general fund before and could eliminate the trust fund structure, leading to potential competition for funding with other programs. Moving away from trust fund financing of surface transportation could have advantages. The donor-donee dispute in reauthorization debates has faded as general fund revenues have made all states donees. Depositing transportation-related taxes into the general fund instead of the trust fund would eliminate this issue and dampen the link between road user charges and program spending. Eliminating the trust fund for surface transportation could provide Congress with more flexibility in allocating funding among different modes and purposes. This change could also lead to more performance-oriented goals for states in selecting projects, as well as encourage creativity in infrastructure provision across different transportation modes. Reconsidering the trust fund structure for transportation spending could lead to changes in funding allocation and political implications. Advocates for public transportation and cycling have become supporters of the surface transportation program, which has benefited their interests. This shift could open up discussion on alternative approaches, such as devoting all trust fund revenues exclusively to highway spending. The surface transportation program has been crucial in passing multiyear bills since the 1990s. The FAST Act showed Congress's support for the current HTF funding model, mainly through transfers from the Treasury general fund. The debate on whether to continue this general fund support will be significant when reauthorizing surface transportation programs post FY2020. Congress may make the general fund share permanent to address the inadequacy of motor fuel taxes. The New Starts program in surface transportation bills is already funded by general appropriations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) budget is supported by trust funds and general funds, with the general fund amount approximating the value of the airways system to military and societal nonusers. A similar argument could be made for the public benefits of a well-functioning highway system to justify an annual general fund appropriation for roads. If Congress decides to provide an annual general fund share for federal highway funding, the financing structure of the federal-aid highways program could change. Congress would have the option to appropriate the general fund share to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) or fund some programs from the trust fund and others separately. Congress could consider a two-pronged approach to authorization for highway funding. They could authorize trust-funded programs separately from appropriated programs, allowing for a long-term authorization bill for projects that take years to complete. This could be paired with short-term bills funded with general appropriations for quicker projects. Toll roads have a long history in the US, dating back to the 18th century. Federal law has supported road construction since the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 prohibited tolling on roads funded by federal funds. Despite this, toll revenues allowed states to build highways without federal aid in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The tolling prohibition was reiterated in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, but exceptions now cover most federal-aid roads and bridges. Existing Interstate System highway surface lane capacity remains banned from tolling. The tolling of federal-aid highways is restricted at three levels. Non-Interstate System highways can be tolled after reconstruction. Existing Interstate System surface lane capacity cannot be tolled, except for two pilot programs. Interstate System bridges and tunnels can be tolled if reconstructed. New capacity on federal-aid highways can generally be tolled. Toll revenue in FY2015 was $14.025 billion, with steady growth in recent years. There are no federal restrictions on tolling roads off the federal-aid system. Revenue from tolls on highways has been steady at 5-6% of total spending for over 50 years. In FY2015, toll facilities collected an average of $2.38 million per mile, with revenue varying widely. Toll revenue goes to state, local, or private operators, not the federal government. Expanding tolling could reduce federal road expenditures. There are 5,882 tolled miles, a 25% increase since 1990, comprising only 0.6% of eligible public roads. Increasing toll roads is one way to boost revenue. Increasing toll road usage is crucial for generating revenue, especially as vehicle miles traveled have been on the rise since 2014. However, if demographic shifts lead to slower growth in personal vehicle use, toll revenues may be limited in the long term. Higher traffic volume is essential for maximizing toll revenues. Increasing toll road usage is crucial for revenue generation, especially with the rise in vehicle miles traveled since 2014. However, if demographic shifts lead to slower growth in personal vehicle use, toll revenues may be limited in the long term. Raising tolls can be politically challenging, especially when revenue is used for purposes other than maintaining the toll facility. Trucking interests often oppose rate changes that increase truck tolls relative to automobile tolls. Imposing tolls on individual transportation facilities may have limited impact on overall highway capital spending, especially in states with low population densities. Value capture is a revenue mechanism to cover transportation improvement costs from landowners or developers benefiting from increased property value. It includes tax increment financing, special assessments, and development impact fees. The federal role in value capture strategies may be limited. Value capture strategies, such as joint development, involve public-private cooperation near transit stations to generate revenue, but the Government Accountability Office found that these mechanisms have only produced small amounts of money for transit agencies. Joint development has generated small amounts of money for transit agencies, with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority receiving about $10 million in FY2016. Special assessment districts, like the one in Seattle, have been more successful in generating funding for specific projects, such as the South Lake Union streetcar project. Value capture strategies are also being used in highway projects, with Texas authorizing tax increment financing to fund highway projects. Special assessment districts in states like Florida and Virginia help fund highway projects, such as the expansion of Route 28 near Washington Dulles International Airport. Calls for private-sector involvement in transportation infrastructure through public-private partnerships (P3s) have increased due to growing demands and limited public resources. These partnerships, involving state or local governments, can take various forms like design-build agreements. The federal government influences the prevalence and structure of P3s through transportation programs and funding. Private-sector involvement in transportation infrastructure is facilitated through public-private partnerships (P3s), which require a revenue stream from sources like tolls or building rents. Private financing can come from leasing existing assets or developing new ones. User fees, such as tolls, are crucial for private-sector participation. Availability payments, based on facility performance, can also support private-sector financing. Private-sector involvement in transportation infrastructure through public-private partnerships (P3s) has increased in recent years due to aversion to demand risk. Despite the availability of private funds globally, the number of transportation P3s in the United States remains relatively small. From 1993 to September 2017, there were 30 surface transportation P3s with total project costs of $39 billion, including projects like the Chicago Skyway lease and the Purple Line light rail transit project in Maryland. Private investment in surface transportation, including P3s, is more common in other countries like Portugal, Spain, and Australia. However, in the United States, private investment faces obstacles such as tax-exempt financing for state and local governments, political opposition to tolling and privatization, and project development challenges. P3s should be viewed as a supplement to traditional public funding. They can improve efficiency in construction, maintenance, and operation, potentially providing more infrastructure for the same cost. Private companies may offer more infrastructure for the same price by examining life-cycle costs and transferring financial risks to private investors. However, challenges such as procurement, oversight, and lack of state government capacity to manage P3 contracts may hinder cost reductions. Transferring risks may backfire if major miscalculations occur, leading to contract renegotiations or financial guarantees by the public agency. Private investors may not accept risks such as higher construction costs due to delays in the environmental review process. Municipal bonds, a major source of financing for transportation infrastructure, offer lower interest rates due to tax exemptions. Private activity bonds (PABs) involve a state or local government acting as a financial intermediary for businesses or individuals. The government acts as a financial intermediary for businesses or individuals through private activity bonds (PABs). Congress has approved limited use of tax-exempt PABs for specific purposes like airports, mass commuting facilities, and highways. The Secretary of Transportation must approve PAB issuance for qualified highway projects, with a cap of $15 billion. As of January 2017, $6.6 billion had been issued for 17 projects, with proposals to increase the bond issuance cap for P3 deals. Tax-exempt bonds, like PABs, are important for P3 deals but have disadvantages. They offer less federal control over project types and funding compared to grants and loans. The tax benefits mainly benefit high-income bond buyers, making them less attractive to investors without federal tax liability. This limits the funds available to state and local governments. Tax credit bonds are an alternative type of tax-preferred municipal bond that do not pay interest but provide investors with a tax credit. These bonds are more efficient than tax-exempt bonds as the revenue forgone by the federal government equals the reduction in borrowing costs for state and local governments. Unused tax credits can be carried forward or sold to another entity with tax liability. Some tax credit bonds, known as issuer credit or direct pay bonds, pay the credit to the issuer while investors receive interest similar to taxable securities. This makes tax credit bonds attractive to investors without federal tax liability. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized Build America Bonds for financing various projects, including transportation. These bonds expired in 2010. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program, enacted in 1998, provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects through secured loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit, reducing costs and project risks. The TIFIA program provides federal credit assistance for transportation projects, leveraging nonfederal funding and requiring repayment through dedicated revenue streams. TIFIA has supported over 70 projects with nearly $30 billion in assistance, contributing to an estimated $107 billion in project costs. Funding for TIFIA was reduced under the FAST Act after significant increases in previous authorizations. Under the FAST Act, TIFIA's direct authorization was reduced in FY2016 and FY2017 to $275 million, increasing to $300 million in FY2019 and FY2020. The subsidy cost of credit assistance is covered by appropriations, with each dollar historically providing about $10 in credit assistance. The cut in TIFIA authorization reduced DOT's loan capacity by approximately $7.25 billion in FY2016. The FAST Act reduced TIFIA's direct authorization to $275 million in FY2016 and FY2017, increasing to $300 million in FY2019 and FY2020. States can use funds from other highway programs to cover subsidy and administrative costs of credit assistance, potentially increasing loan amounts. TIGER Grant Program can also be used for TIFIA loan costs. Changes in the FAST Act aim to make it easier to finance smaller projects, especially in rural areas. The FAST Act aimed to make it easier to finance smaller projects, particularly in rural areas, by providing authority for a TIFIA loan to a state infrastructure bank (SIB) for a \"rural project fund\", adding transit-oriented development (TOD) infrastructure as an eligible project, allowing up to $2 million of TIFIA budget authority each fiscal year to pay application fees for projects costing $75 million or less, modifying minimum project cost thresholds for credit assistance, and streamlining the application process. The FAST Act authorized the creation of the National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau within DOT to administer federal transportation financing programs, including the TIFIA program, SIB program, RRIF Program, and private activity bonds. The Build America Bureau was established in July 2016 to promote best practices for innovative financing, P3s, and administer the INFRA grants program. The INFRA grants program, part of the Significant Freight and Highway Projects grant program, involves responsibilities for procurement and project environmental review. Congress has considered creating a national infrastructure bank to finance various infrastructure projects, potentially offering more independence and expertise in project selection. This bank could support a wider range of projects, including water, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure, with proponents claiming it would prioritize financially viable projects across sectors. An infrastructure bank could raise capital through bond issuance, attracting private investors not interested in tax-exempt bonds. It aims to fund projects with high economic returns, reducing federal costs and relying more on nonfederal capital and user fees. A national infrastructure bank aims to fund projects with high economic returns, potentially conflicting with Congress's traditional funding priorities. However, it may duplicate existing programs and not be the most cost-effective way to increase infrastructure spending. Additionally, it exposes the federal government to the risk of default and may not match the lower costs of U.S. Treasury debt. Several states and local governments have established State Investment Banks (SIBs) to attract private investment for public works projects. These banks are either created under a federal program or independently by states like California, Florida, and Ohio. Capitalization remains a challenge for federally authorized SIBs, with some states using highway and transit funds for funding. States can use apportioned highway and transit funds, along with rail program funds, to capitalize banks. Rural project funds can now be capitalized through a loan from the TIFIA program under the FAST Act. Federal funds must be matched with state funds on an 80% federal, 20% state basis. The authority to use federal transportation funds for this purpose lapsed between FY2010 and the FAST Act in December 2015. Few states took advantage of this authority prior to FY2010."
