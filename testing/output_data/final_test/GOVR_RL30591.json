USAID was also required to reorganize. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was required to reorganize and come under the authority of the Secretary of State by April 1, 1999. The Administration's FY2001 State Department and International Broadcasting budget request totaled $6.96 billion, with overseas security funding being a key issue in the appropriations debate. Secretary of State Albright testified on the FY2001 State Department appropriations request before House and Senate Committees in February and March. The House and Senate Committees discussed the State Department appropriations request in 2000, with the House passing a bill providing $6.11 billion for the Department of State. The Senate later received the bill and recommended $6.1 billion for the Department of State. Congress eventually passed a bill providing $6.6 billion for the Department of State and $451.5 million for international broadcasting in FY2001. The State Department's mission is to advance and protect U.S. interests worldwide through overseas missions, foreign policy, passports, and visas. It coordinates with 50 U.S. government agencies in over 180 countries. The staff size has increased due to the integration of ACDA and USIA into State. The Diplomatic and Consular Programs account funds overseas operations, foreign policy activities, passport and visa applications, and post assignment travel. The State Department's Diplomatic and Consular Program account, which includes salaries, expenses, technology, and security upgrades, received a total of $3.168 billion in FY2000. This amount includes $410 million for worldwide security upgrades, such as increased security guard services, personnel training, and maintenance of information systems and vehicles.

The FY2000 enacted appropriation for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was $31 million, with a slight increase requested for FY2001. The House and Senate recommended funding levels of $30.9 million and $31 million, respectively, with the final Congressionally-passed level set at $31 million. The East-West Center in Honolulu and the North-South Center in Miami promote understanding and cooperation among nations.
