    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012\". Since 1948, US Presidents and Congress have reaffirmed the special bond with Israel based on shared values and interests. The Middle East is experiencing rapid change, bringing hope for democracy but also security challenges, especially for Israel. Iran is seeking to exploit instability and promote extremism in the region. Iran, known for promoting extremism in the Middle East, is now taking advantage of political transitions in the region to undermine US-aligned governments and support extremist movements. There are concerns about Iran potentially acquiring nuclear weapons, which could threaten American interests, destabilize the region, and empower terrorist groups like Hizballah and Hamas. Iran has stockpiled over 60,000 rockets to target Israel, while also expanding its arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. This poses a threat to Israel, neighboring countries, and US military forces in the region, leading to a deteriorating strategic environment that has ensured security for Israel and protected US national interests for the past 35 years. The statement of policy is outlined in Section 3. The United States reaffirms its commitment to Israel's security as a Jewish state, providing military capabilities for self-defense, vetoing anti-Israel resolutions at the UN, and supporting Israel's right to self-defense. To further support Israel's self-defense, expand cooperation in defense and civilian sectors, and assist in achieving a peaceful two-state solution with Palestine. SEC. 4. UNITED STATES ACTIONS TO ASSIST IN THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL AND PROTECT AMERICAN INTERESTS. Sense of Congress is to provide support to Israel for joint missile defense systems, specifically the Iron Dome system, defense articles and services, air refueling tankers, missile defense capabilities, and specialized munitions. Additional weaponry and munitions will also be allocated. The United States will provide Israel with additional surplus defense articles and services, strengthen efforts to prevent weapons smuggling into Gaza, offer additional training opportunities to the Israeli Air Force, and expand Israel's authority to make purchases under the Foreign Military Financing program on a commercial basis. The United States aims to enhance security cooperation with Israel, expand joint military exercises, support Israel's role in NATO, extend loan guarantees, and increase intelligence cooperation, including satellite intelligence sharing. It is also the policy of the United States to help Israel maintain its qualitative military edge. The United States aims to enhance security cooperation with Israel, support its qualitative military edge, and encourage advanced technology programs. The President must submit a report on Israel's military edge status within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The President must submit a report to congressional committees on actions to improve Israel's purchase of F-35 aircraft, expand cooperation in various security areas, and integrate Israel into the defense of the Eastern Mediterranean. The term \"qualitative military edge\" is defined in the Arms Export Control Act. SEC. 5. Extension of authority to provide loan guarantees to Israel until September 30, 2015. Amendments made by this section take effect on the date of enactment of this Act."
