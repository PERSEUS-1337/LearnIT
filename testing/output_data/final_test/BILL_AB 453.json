    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 7 is added to the Water Code, establishing the Semitropic Water Storage District within the Kern County Groundwater Basin. Definitions for terms like \"Basin,\" \"District,\" \"Groundwater extraction facility,\" and \"Management area\" are provided. The chapter establishes the Semitropic Water Storage District within the Kern County Groundwater Basin. The district may collect groundwater extraction information and require reporting within the management area, including registration and measurement of extraction facilities. The \"Project\" refers to the Tulare Lake Storage and Floodwater Protection Project. The Semitropic Water Storage District in the Kern County Groundwater Basin requires owners or operators of groundwater extraction facilities to bear costs for water-measuring device installation. The devices must be calibrated as determined by the district and annual extraction statements filed. The district may use other methods to determine groundwater extraction. The Semitropic Water Storage District in the Kern County Groundwater Basin requires owners or operators of groundwater extraction facilities to bear costs for water-measuring device installation. The district may impose fees on groundwater extraction to fund project costs, including design, operation, maintenance, land acquisition, and other related expenses. A person extracting two acre-feet or less of groundwater per year for domestic purposes may be exempt from these fees. If the owner/operator of a groundwater extraction facility fails to report extractions, the district can determine the amount extracted, not exceeding the facility's capacity. Charges must be paid immediately unless a protest is filed within 20 days. Fees imposed for groundwater extraction protests require a hearing to determine charges, interest, and penalties. Notice must be given at least 20 days before the hearing. The fees may include fixed and volumetric charges based on production quantity and impacts to the basin. Collection follows Article 4 of Chapter 7 of Part 9. The chapter does not imply state approval, authorization, or funding for projects. Projects must adhere to relevant state laws. A special law is deemed necessary for the Semitropic Water Storage District. The Semitropic Water Storage District requires immediate implementation of storage and groundwater projects to aid in the recovery of the critically overdrafted Kern County Groundwater Basin. This act is deemed urgent for public peace, health, and safety."
