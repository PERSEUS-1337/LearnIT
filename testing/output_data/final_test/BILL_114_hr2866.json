    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Maternity and Obstetric Medicine Act\" or the \"Healthy MOM Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of maternity coverage for pregnant women, providing immediate access to affordable care through programs like Medicaid and essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act. Access to comprehensive maternity coverage is crucial for pregnant women as it improves health outcomes for both mothers and newborns while reducing financial costs. However, certain groups like uninsured women and those with limited health plans may lack access to affordable maternity coverage. Special enrollment periods are especially important for young adults at high risk for unintended pregnancies, who often have catastrophic coverage with fewer benefits and higher deductibles. Timely maternity care is essential for the health of pregnant women and babies. Regular maternity care is essential for pregnant women as it can detect and mitigate serious health complications, reduce preterm births, and lower healthcare costs. Access to affordable maternity care is crucial for improving health outcomes for both mothers and newborns. Affordable maternity care is crucial for pregnant women to prevent health complications and reduce healthcare costs. Intensive maternity care can lead to significant cost savings per birth and is especially beneficial for women with high-risk pregnancies. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all women eligible for coverage through the Exchanges can access affordable health coverage during their pregnancy to protect the health of women and newborns. The Act aims to provide a special enrollment period for pregnant women to access affordable health coverage through the Exchanges. The Public Health Service Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are amended to include a special enrollment period for pregnant women to access health coverage. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow pregnant women a special enrollment period for health coverage under a group health plan. The enrollment period begins when the pregnancy is reported to the plan, and regulations will be issued by the Secretary. The amendments allow pregnant women a special enrollment period for health coverage under a group health plan, with regulations to establish the enrollment time period and effective date. The changes apply to plan years after 2016. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will issue regulations to ensure pregnancy is considered a qualifying life event for enrolling in a health benefit plan under chapter 89 title 5, United States Code. This requirement will apply to contracts under section 8902 of such title starting 12 months after the enactment of this Act."
