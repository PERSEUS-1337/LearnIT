    "content": "This report outlines the process for filling PAS positions requiring Senate approval during the 110th Congress. It includes nominations to full-time positions on various boards and commissions. The President and Senate share the power to appoint principal officers of the United States. The appointment process for Senate-confirmed positions involves selection, clearance, and nomination by the President, followed by consideration by the Senate and appointment by the President. The White House selects and clears nominees before formal nomination to the Senate, with input from interested parties and negotiations for political balance among members. The appointment process for Senate-confirmed positions involves negotiations over nominations with leaders of the opposition party in Congress. This often results in packaging several nominations together for positions in a particular agency, with the Senate confirming them as a group. Sometimes, only one or two nominations are submitted, leading to delays until additional nominations are added. Candidates go through a clearance process and submit various forms before confirmation. The Office of the Counsel to the President oversees the clearance process for National Security Positions, which includes background investigations by various agencies. Once cleared, nominations are submitted to the Senate, but delays can occur, especially at the beginning of an Administration or if conflicts need to be resolved. Candidates for higher-level national security positions are given priority in the clearance process to reduce delays at the beginning of a new Administration. The President typically nominates individuals recommended by Senators from the same party for positions within a state. Before making a nomination to a federal position, the President considers Senate recommendations, as nominees require Senate confirmation for legal authority. A nominee may serve in an advisory capacity if hired as a consultant while awaiting confirmation. Recess appointments may be given by the President under certain circumstances, but they can have political consequences if seen as circumventing the Senate's role. The Senate confirmation process for federal positions involves the Senate determining whether to confirm a nomination based on the nominee's views, political circumstances, and policy implications. The scrutiny of a nominee's qualities is influenced by factors such as the President's party control of the Senate and the President's involvement in supporting the nomination. The process is centered at the committee level. The Senate confirmation process is focused on committees, with nominations being referred to the appropriate committee based on Senate Rule XXV. Most nominations go to a single committee, but sometimes multiple committees are involved. Committee activity includes investigation, hearings, and reporting stages. The nomination process involves investigation, hearings, and reporting stages. Committees gather information from the White House and conduct their own investigations. Hearings allow for public discussion on the nominee and related issues. Senators use hearings to assess qualifications, express policy views, or address oversight concerns. Committees may hold hearings for all or some nominations and can choose to act on a nomination at any point in the process. The Senate committee has three options when reporting a nomination: favorable, unfavorable, or without recommendation. If the committee does not report a nomination, the Senate can discharge the committee to bring it to the floor. Most nominations are confirmed, but some fail in committee due to various reasons. Rejections can occur due to opposition, time constraints, or other factors unrelated to the nomination's merits. After a nomination is reported by the Senate committee, it goes through a process where the Senate must act on it before the end of a Congress. If not, it is returned to the President. The confirmed nominee receives a commission from the President and is sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out their responsibilities. The President can also make limited-term appointments without Senate confirmation during recesses, which expire at the end of the next full Senate session. During the 110th Congress, a recess appointment was made to a regulatory or collegial board position. Presidents have used recess appointments to bypass confirmation processes, leading Congress to restrict this power. If a recess appointee's position becomes vacant while the Senate is in session, they cannot be paid until confirmed, except in certain circumstances. During the 110th Congress, a recess appointment was made to a regulatory or collegial board position. The President generally submits a new nomination for the appointee even when an earlier nomination is still pending. A recess appointee whose nomination to a full term is subsequently rejected by the Senate may continue to serve until the end of his or her recess appointment, but may not be paid after rejection according to the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. The Senate employed a method during the 110th Congress to restrict the President's recess appointment power, based on the idea that appointments could be limited during short recesses. The Constitution does not specify the length of a recess required for a recess appointment, with differing views from the Department of Justice over the last century. In 1993, a Justice Department brief suggested that a recess appointment could be made during a recess of more than three days. During the 110th Congress, the Senate restricted the President's recess appointment power by holding pro forma sessions to prevent recesses longer than three days. This tactic aimed to limit appointments, with the shortest recess for appointments being 10 days in the past 20 years. The Senate's strategy included pro forma sessions during the Thanksgiving holiday in 2007 to block recess appointments, with no business conducted during these sessions. The Senate resumed business on December 3, 2007. During the 110th Congress, the Senate restricted the President's recess appointment power by holding pro forma sessions to prevent recesses longer than three days. Similar procedures were followed during other periods to block recess appointments. The President made no recess appointments between the initial pro forma sessions in November 2007 and the end of his presidency. Federal executive branch boards and commissions discussed in this report share common characteristics. The fixed terms of office for board members have set beginning and end dates to ensure leadership continuity. Terms are staggered to avoid simultaneous departures. Individuals can be nominated to fill unexpired terms or upcoming terms. The President can sometimes submit two nominations simultaneously for a commission - one to complete an unexpired term and the other for the succeeding term. The chair of some commissions requires Senate confirmation and must be chosen from current commissioners. Executive branch boards and commissions have political independence from the President, but he can influence membership by appointing the chair or filling vacancies. President can shape boards and commissions by filling vacancies, resignations, and deaths. President George W. Bush had the opportunity to nominate members for various positions due to existing vacancies. Simultaneous turnover may result from extended periods without nominations or confirmations. Law limits appointed members for some boards and commissions. During the 110th Congress, President George W. Bush submitted nominations for 74 out of 152 full-time positions on 34 regulatory and other boards and commissions. A total of 88 nominations were submitted, with 46 confirmed, 15 withdrawn, and 27 returned to the President. Multiple nominations were submitted for some positions to fill vacancies.

The methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals has been updated to include all days, including those during recesses and between Senate sessions. The methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals was updated to include all days, even during Senate recesses. The rationale for the earlier methodology was that the Senate was unlikely to continue consideration of nominations during certain periods of adjournment. This approach was consistent with Senate rules regarding when nominations are to be returned to the President. The methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals was updated to include all days, even during Senate recesses, unlike the earlier methodology which assumed the Senate would not consider nominations during adjournment periods. This change was influenced by the Senate's practice of breaking longer recesses into shorter ones with pro forma sessions in between. The Senate's methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals was updated to include all days, even during recesses, due to the practice of breaking longer recesses into shorter ones with pro forma sessions. Short recesses created by pro forma sessions are treated as short recesses, maintaining consistency in Senate and President actions. This change affects the comparability of statistics with previous reports. The Senate updated its methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals to include all days, even during recesses, due to the practice of breaking longer recesses into shorter ones with pro forma sessions. This change ensures consistency in Senate and President actions but may affect the comparability of statistics with previous reports. The methodological problem first arose during the 110th Congress and could occur again in the future. Reasons for the change include intentional extensions of Senate consideration for nominations and the fact that work on nominations may continue during recess periods. The Senate updated its methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals to include all days, even during recesses, to ensure consistency in Senate and President actions. This change may affect the comparability of statistics with previous reports. Ongoing activities during recess may include investigatory work and interviews with nominees. Some political scientists do not subtract recess days in their calculations of nomination-to-confirmation intervals. The research presented here employs a new methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals."
