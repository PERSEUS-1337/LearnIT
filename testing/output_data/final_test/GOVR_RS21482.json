    "content": "The Paris Club is where creditor countries renegotiate official sector debts, including the United States and 21 other permanent members. Brazil recently joined, becoming the first developing country to do so in two decades. Other creditors can participate ad-hoc. The London Club is an informal group of private firms that meets in London to renegotiate commercial bank debt at a debtor nation's request. Unlike the Paris Club, there is no permanent membership, and the Club dissolves after a restructuring. The Paris Club operates based on agreed rules and principles for debt relief, with the French Treasury providing a small secretariat. Jean-Pierre Jouyet, Under-Secretary of the French Treasury, currently chairs the Paris Club, which includes representatives from creditor and debtor nations, international financial institutions, and regional development banks. The Paris Club, represented by regional development banks, discusses debtor countries' economic situations. Since 1956, it has reached 433 agreements with 90 countries, covering $583 billion in debt. The Club's rules and principles have evolved through G7/8 Summits, with five principles and four rules governing treatments. Permanent members, major creditor countries, determine practices. Accepting the rules and principles allows countries to become members. The Paris Club, represented by regional development banks, discusses debtor countries' economic situations and has reached 433 agreements with 90 countries since 1956, covering $583 billion in debt. The Club's rules and principles, determined by major creditor countries, govern treatments. Paris Club decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, require full consensus among creditors, and are applied only to countries in need of debt relief with IMF program implementation. Solidarity among creditors is necessary, and treatment comparability is maintained. The 'rules' specify technical details of Paris Club arrangements, covering only medium and... The Paris Club rules cover types of debt, flow and stock treatment, payment terms, and debt swaps. The outcome of meetings is not a legal agreement, but creditor countries sign an 'Agreed Minute' recommending bilateral agreements with the debtor. Congressional involvement is needed to implement agreements, with four types of treatments based on economic circumstances. The Paris Club offers four types of treatments based on economic circumstances: Classic Terms, Houston Terms, Naples Terms, and Cologne Terms. Classic and Houston terms involve debt rescheduling, while Naples and Cologne terms provide debt reduction. Classic terms are the least concessional, rescheduling debts at market rates, while Houston terms offer longer grace and repayment periods for lower middle-income countries. Naples Terms, established in 1994, are for canceling and rescheduling debts of very poor countries with a per-capita GDP below $755. Eligible countries can receive debt cancellation of 50-67% under Naples Terms. Paris Club offers two options for debt reduction: complete cancellation with rescheduling at market rates or rescheduling at reduced interest rates. The Cologne terms, established at the June 1999 G-8 Summit in Germany, offer higher levels of debt cancellation than Naples Terms for countries eligible for the HIPC initiative. Under Cologne terms, 90% of eligible debts can be cancelled. The Paris Club introduced the \"Evian Approach\" on October 8, 2003, allowing for more flexible debt relief levels and cancellation for a broader group of countries. The Evian Approach introduced a new method for debt relief, expanding eligibility beyond HIPC countries. Instead of using economic indicators, countries are now divided into HIPC and non-HIPC categories. HIPC countries receive up to 90% debt cancellation under Cologne terms, while non-HIPC countries undergo IMF debt sustainability analysis for case-by-case assessment. The IMF provides debt relief for countries facing liquidity or debt sustainability issues. If a country has temporary liquidity problems, debts are rescheduled. If there are also debt sustainability issues, the country may be eligible for debt cancellation. The United States has been participating in Paris Club debt forgiveness since 1994, allowing for the cancellation of various loans. The budgeting and accounting for U.S. debt relief is based on the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, requiring valuation of loans on a net present value basis. Prior to the act, debt relief did not require budget authority or appropriations, and debt was accounted for on a cash-flow basis. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed the budgeting and accounting for U.S. debt relief to a net present value basis. A working group called ICRAS was created to assess country risk for foreign loans, chaired by the Office of Management and Budget. The U.S. Export-Import Bank provides risk assessments and recommendations for ICRAS agencies to determine expected loss rates. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the official process for estimating the cost of foreign loans to the United States. OMB's methodology for estimating default probabilities and expected loss rates may not accurately reflect the sovereign debt of emerging economies. GAO recommended that OMB provide technical descriptions of its expected loss methodology to affected U.S. agencies and Congress. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns about OMB's methodology for estimating foreign loan costs. GAO recommended independent review and data validation from U.S. credit agencies. OMB did not commit to increasing transparency or engaging the private sector rating community."
