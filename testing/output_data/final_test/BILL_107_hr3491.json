    "content": "The \"Ballistic Imaging Evaluation and Study Act of 2001\" aims to conduct a study on ballistic imaging technology, evaluate design parameters for cartridge cases and projectiles, assess the effectiveness of the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN), and determine the cost and effectiveness of State-mandated ballistic imaging systems. The Attorney General will arrange a study with the National Research Council to determine design parameters for packing cartridge cases and projectiles, the most effective method for projectile recovery, and which countries are using ballistic imaging systems for investigations. The curr_chunk discusses the costs and implementation of ballistic imaging systems for investigating crimes committed with handguns and rifles in the United States. It includes details on the comprehensive cost for jurisdictions, yearly administration costs, storage of cartridge cases and projectiles, as well as the number of handguns and rifles sold annually. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison between manually operated handguns and rifles versus semiautomatic ones in the NIBIN system, the shift in firearm usage in countries with ballistic identification, and factors that can alter identifying marks on cartridge cases and projectiles affecting their admissibility in court. The curr_chunk discusses the technical improvements needed for database management in the NIBIN system, redundant systems, legal issues at Federal and State levels, and storage procedures for cartridge cases and projectiles. The curr_chunk discusses the need to ensure the integrity of ballistic evidence, including the cost and resources required for ballistic imaging technology, the collection of fired cartridge cases and projectiles from privately owned firearms, and the effectiveness of State-based or Federal ballistic imaging systems. The combination of State and Federal ballistic imaging systems can create a centralized list of firearms owners, with a focus on the cost-effectiveness of using a Federal, NIBIN-based approach compared to State-based initiatives. SEC. 4. CONSULTATION. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences shall consult with various officials and entities involved in budgeting, administering, and using ballistic imaging systems, including law enforcement officials, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of firearms and ammunition. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences will consult with experts in ballistics imaging, including manufacturers, firearm examiners, foreign officials, and individuals with expertise in the field. SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\nWithin 30 days of the National Research Council completing the study, a report with study results and legislative recommendations will be submitted to the Attorney General, who will then present it to Congress. The report will be made public.\n\nSEC. 6. SUSPENSION OF USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR BALLISTIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY. SEC. 6. SUSPENSION OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR BALLISTIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY: States cannot use Federal funds for ballistic imaging technology until the report in section 5 is completed. Waiver authority is available for national interest cases. The Act defines \"ballistic imaging technology\" as software and hardware that records, stores, retrieves, and compares marks on cartridge cases and projectiles from handguns or rifles. It also clarifies the terms \"handgun,\" \"rifle,\" \"cartridge case,\" \"manually operated handgun,\" and \"manually operated rifle.\" The term \"semiautomatic handgun\" refers to a repeating handgun that uses energy from a firing cartridge to extract and chamber the next round, requiring a trigger pull for each shot. The term \"semiautomatic rifle\" is defined in section 921(a)(28) of title 18, United States Code. A \"projectile\" is the part of ammunition expelled through the barrel of a handgun or rifle by explosive means."
