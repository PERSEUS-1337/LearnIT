    "content": "The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 governs the military base realignment and closure process. Congress authorized a fourth round for 2005. The BRAC process involves a complex statutory scheme with various governmental entities recommending bases for closure or realignment. The Base Closure Act establishes selection criteria and mandatory procedures. This report analyzes the availability of judicial review in cases where the DOD, BRAC Commission, or President have allegedly failed to meet certain requirements. The report focuses on potential judicial review of BRAC-related actions due to alleged failures to comply with the Base Closure Act. It discusses three potential bases for judicial review: the Administrative Procedure Act, the Base Closure Act, and the U.S. Constitution. Additional CRS reports on BRAC issues are also available. The APA allows for judicial review of \"final agency action,\" with exceptions for when a statute prohibits review or when agency action is at the discretion of the agency. In Dalton v. Specter, plaintiffs challenged the closure of a military installation under the Base Closure Act, arguing that the Secretary's report and the Commission's report were subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court ruled that these reports were not reviewable under the APA as they were not considered \"final agency actions.\" The Dalton decision affirmed that actions of the Secretary and the Commission were unreviewable under the APA as they did not directly affect the parties. The President's statutory right to affect the BRAC process meant that previous steps were not final. The 1990 Act grants the President power to order the Commission to revise its report and terminate a base closure cycle. A Supreme Court decision deemed BRAC reports as advisory and subject to the President's discretion, making them non-final agency actions. The lack of finality in BRAC actions by the Secretary or Commission precludes judicial review under the APA. Under the APA, judicial review is not available if statutes preclude it. Justice Souter argued that Congress intended for BRAC actions to be quick and final, citing evidence of strict time deadlines for decisions. The BRAC Act imposes strict time deadlines for base-closing decisions, leading to congressional frustration. Nonjudicial opportunities exist for procedural reviews, but judicial review is limited to NEPA objections within a narrow timeframe. The Act does not explicitly provide for other judicial review. The Supreme Court would likely not review the BRAC actions of the Secretary or the Commission under the APA in the 2005 round, as agency actions may be considered committed to agency discretion by law, making them judicially unreviewable. There is a strong presumption for judicial review of administrative action, requiring clear and convincing evidence of contrary congressional intent for an exception to apply. The Supreme Court has not adjudicated whether actions under the Base Closure Act are committed to agency discretion by law. Previous cases like Heckler v. Chaney and National Federation have addressed the issue of agency discretion in non-BRAC contexts. In National Federation, the D.C. Circuit found that the criteria used for BRAC determinations do not provide judicially manageable standards, making it judicially unreviewable under the APA. The Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to judicial review under the APA, including cases involving national security, agency enforcement actions, and agency reconsideration of actions due to material error. The Base Closure Act may not fit these categories, but the D.C. Circuit's interpretation from National Federation could be applied. In Dalton, the Supreme Court ruled that the President's approval of BRAC recommendations is not reviewable under the APA because the President is not considered an agency. The Supreme Court ruled in Dalton that the President's approval of BRAC recommendations is not reviewable under the APA due to separation of powers principles. The Court distinguished between statutory and constitutional claims, stating that not every case of executive official conduct exceeding statutory authority is unconstitutional. The claim in Dalton was characterized as a statutory claim, not a constitutional one. The Supreme Court in Dalton ruled that the President's approval of BRAC recommendations is not judicially reviewable under the APA if the statute commits the decision to the President's discretion. Justice Blackmun attempted to narrow the scope of the decision. Justice Blackmun attempted to narrow the scope of the Dalton decision by defining when judicial review could be allowed for claims related to procedural violations of the Base Closure Act. This conflicts with Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion that the President's authority is not contingent on procedural requirements. The Base Closure Act does not require the President to determine procedural violations in recommendations, nor does it prohibit approval of flawed recommendations. Claims of excess statutory authority differ from claims of unconstitutional actions without authority, as seen in the Dalton Court's distinction from Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. The Base Closure Act provides statutory authority to the President. The Base Closure Act provides statutory authority to the President, and the Dalton Court did not need to examine the President's constitutional powers. Challenges to the Act's constitutionality have been made, but no federal appellate courts have found it unconstitutional."
