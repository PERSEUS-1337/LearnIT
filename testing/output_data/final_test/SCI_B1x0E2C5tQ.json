    "content": "Recent work has shown that contextualized word representations from neural machine translation (NMT) are a viable alternative to simple word prediction tasks due to their comprehensive internal understanding. Computational limitations hinder NMT models from using large vocabularies, leading to the use of subword units and characters. The impact of different units on modeling syntax, semantics, and morphology was studied, revealing that subword representations are better for syntax while character-based representations excel in modeling morphology and handling noisy input. Recent years have seen the rise of deep neural networks and representation learning based on network-internal activations, particularly in fields like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Contextualizing word embeddings has shown significant performance gains by allowing the same word to have different embeddings in different contexts. Recent advancements in NLP have shown that contextualized word embeddings, such as those used in the ElMo model, can yield superior representations for tasks like sentiment analysis and question answering. However, computational limitations currently restrict neural machine translation models to smaller vocabularies, limiting their effectiveness. Neural machine translation models are limited by smaller vocabularies, typically 30-50k words, while NLP applications require handling millions of words. Different units of representation, such as byte-pair encoding or character-based units, have been explored to address this limitation. Previous studies have focused on the quality of translation output, but it remains unclear which input and output units are most effective. In bridging the gap between input and output units for representation learning in NMT models, the study evaluates the impact of words, characters, BPE units, and morphological segments on the quality of learned representations for morphology, syntax, and semantics. It also examines the robustness of these representations to noise and provides practical recommendations based on the findings. Representation analysis in neural networks aims to understand what is learned inside the black-box, focusing on word and sentence embeddings, RNN states, and NMT representations for morphological, semantic, and syntactic tasks. Different granularities of units, such as subword translation units like BPE, morphological segmentation, characters, and hybrid units, are compared for their impact on representation learning and robustness to noise. Unlike previous work on translation quality, this study emphasizes representation learning. In representation learning, robustness to noise is crucial in machine learning. Unlike previous work on translation quality, this study focuses on comparing robustness to noise for units of different granularity. The methodology involves extracting feature representations from different components of a trained model and training a classifier for an auxiliary task to evaluate the quality of the representations. The study focuses on comparing robustness to noise for units of different granularity in representation learning. Feature representations are extracted from different components of a trained model for an auxiliary task using LSTM hidden states. Logistic regression classifier is trained to assign labels to words using representations of words, byte-pair encoding units, morphological units, and characters. The study compares the robustness to noise for units of different granularity in representation learning. Feature representations are extracted from a trained model using LSTM hidden states for an auxiliary task. The number of merge operations in character n-gram sequences is controlled by a hyper-parameter OP, affecting segmentation granularity. Morphologically segmented units are generated using an unsupervised morphological segmenter, Morfessor BID45. Previous work focused on word representations in NMT analysis, but this study includes subword and character units. The study explores the robustness of different granularity units in representation learning, using LSTM hidden states for an auxiliary task. It considers word representations in NMT analysis, including subword and character units. Two simple approximations are used to estimate word representations from subword representations: averaging activation values of all subwords or characters, and considering the activation of the last subword as the word representation. The study examines the robustness of different granularity units in representation learning by analyzing word representations in NMT. It explores using subword and character units, and formalizes the activation of the last subword as the word representation. Various NLP tasks are conducted to analyze character-and subword-based representations at the word level, including morphological tagging for multiple languages, lexical semantics tagging, and syntactic tagging via CCG supertagging for English. The study evaluates the robustness of different representations under noisy input conditions using real and synthetic errors. Small perturbations in the input can significantly impact the performance of deep neural networks. The study evaluates the robustness of different representations under noisy input conditions using real and synthetic errors. Data was created with synthetic noise by inducing two kinds of errors: Swap and Middle. Swap involves neighboring characters being mistakenly swapped, while Middle errors shuffle the middle characters of a word. NMT systems were trained for 4 language pairs using data from WMT and IWSLT campaigns, with MT models trained on NEWS and TED data. Test sentences had n% of words randomly corrupted or replaced, and feature vectors for erroneous words were re-evaluated for prediction capability on linguistic tasks. The study trained NMT systems on NEWS and TED data for 4 language pairs, using synthetic noise to evaluate robustness. Various classifiers were trained and tested on annotated corpora, with RDRPOST and Groningen Parallel Meaning Bank used for tagging. Seq2seq-attn was utilized to train LSTM systems with bidirectional encoders, using 500 dimensions for embeddings and states. Systems were trained with SGD for 20 epochs for feature generation. The study trained NMT systems on NEWS and TED data for 4 language pairs, using synthetic noise to evaluate robustness. Systems were trained with various classifiers and tested on annotated corpora. The classifier used logistic regression with input from hidden states in word-based models or Last/Average representations in character-and subword-based models. The study trained NMT systems on NEWS and TED data for 4 language pairs, using synthetic noise to evaluate robustness. Systems were trained with various classifiers and tested on annotated corpora. The classifiers used logistic regression with input from hidden states in word-based models or Last/Average representations in character-and subword-based models. The encoder models are trained with BPE as target and the decoder models with BPE as a source. Results show that character-based representations consistently outperformed other units in predicting morphological tags. The study compared different units for NMT systems on various language pairs, finding that character-based representations outperformed word-based representations, especially in languages with complex morphology like Czech and Russian. Morfessor was found to give better morphological tagging performance compared to BPE, particularly in morphologically rich languages. The study compared different units for NMT systems on various language pairs, finding that character-based representations outperformed word-based representations, especially in languages with complex morphology like Czech and Russian. Morphological units performed better than BPE-based units in decoder representations. The gap between different representations is inversely related to word frequency, with character-based models excelling on less frequent and OOV words. Decoder-side representations sometimes outperformed encoder-side representations. Representations in NMT systems were compared, with character-based representations outperforming word-based ones, especially in languages with complex morphology. Morphological units were superior to BPE-based units in decoder representations. The gap between representations is linked to word frequency, with character-based models excelling on less frequent words. Decoder-side representations sometimes performed better than encoder-side ones. In semantic tagging tasks, BPE-based representations were more effective for German, while character-based representations were better for morphology prediction. English CCG super-tagging results were evaluated using encoder representations from English\u2192German models. Characters-based representations perform below words and subwords in English\u2192German models, contrary to their superior performance in morphology tasks. The robustness of representations towards noise is evaluated by inducing errors in test sets and characters show better performance on all tasks. Characters-based representations show superior performance on all tasks and languages compared to subword units, with minimal drop in accuracy. In contrast, BPE-based representations sometimes perform worse than word-based representations, especially in tasks like syntactic tagging. This is attributed to BPE segmenting noisy words into subword units that may not accurately represent the actual word, leading to a significant drop in performance. The difference in representation quality remains consistent across BPE and other methods when tested with increased noise in the data. Character-based representations outperform subword units in all tasks and languages, with minimal accuracy drop. BPE-based representations perform better in semantic tagging for German and similarly in English, while Morfessor slightly outperforms others in syntax. Character-based models struggle with capturing long-distance dependencies, affecting performance in tasks like syntactic tagging. The character-based system has access to surrounding word morphology information, which can impact performance in morphological tagging. In comparison to BPE, Morfessor performs better in morphological tagging due to its linguistically motivated units. Subword-based systems generally outperform word-based and character-based systems, but character-based representations excel in morphological tagging tasks. The BPE-based representations are sensitive to noise and may result in less reliable systems. The translation performance of BPE-based systems falls below character-based systems even with 10% noise. The performance of classifiers improved when trained on a concatenation of different representation units, with the best results achieved using all three units together. The impact of using words, characters, BPE units, and morphological segments on representations learned by NMT was studied. The study focused on the impact of using different representation units on NMT. Character representations were found to be better for modeling morphology and more robust to noise compared to subword units. Using all representations together yielded the best results. The findings suggest that character-based representations may be a more viable alternative to BPE segmentation in NMT systems. Future work will explore specialized character-based architectures for NMT. In future work, specialized character-based architectures for NMT will be explored to study the impact of different units on representation quality in non-recurrent models like the Transformer and convolutional architectures."
