    "content": "After a flood event, people may be unsure about federal assistance eligibility and the connection between flood insurance and disaster aid. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) offers assistance to homeowners, distinct from other FEMA disaster aid programs. This report outlines available assistance and provides resources for further guidance on flood insurance and disaster aid. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides federal assistance to homeowners and renters recovering from flood losses. Established in 1968, the NFIP offers primary flood insurance and aims to reduce flood risk through floodplain management standards. With over 5 million policies and $1.28 trillion in coverage, the NFIP saves an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses. Additionally, homeowners and renters can access other federal programs for mitigation. Congress established limits on federal disaster assistance based on flood insurance coverage. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 restricts access to federal financial assistance for acquisition or construction in Special Flood Hazard Areas without flood insurance. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act also plays a role in setting limits on federal assistance. The Stafford Act imposes restrictions on flood disaster assistance, stating that federal aid cannot be used for repair or replacement if the recipient failed to obtain required flood insurance. Participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is voluntary for communities in the United States, allowing access to primary flood insurance. The NFIP provides primary flood insurance to communities that adopt and enforce floodplain management standards. Participation in the NFIP requires communities to adhere to minimum floodplain management standards set by FEMA. The NFIP sets minimum floodplain management standards for participation, enforced by state or local governments. Communities failing to uphold these standards may face probation or suspension from the NFIP, leading to residents being unable to purchase primary flood insurance. Failure to participate in the NFIP or being suspended from it can result in significant uninsured property risk in a community. Without NFIP participation, access to federal assistance for flood hazards becomes limited, as federal aid is not available for properties in floodplains without flood insurance. Property owners in Special Flood Hazard Areas must have flood insurance for federally backed mortgages. Leaving the NFIP voluntarily or being suspended has similar consequences. NFIP flood insurance may not be available in special cases, such as new construction on coastal barriers within the CBRS. CBRS includes System units and OPAs, with System units being undeveloped private lands and OPAs being lands held for conservation purposes. FEMA develops Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) to show flood risk in coordination with communities. Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) identify zones at risk of flooding during a \"1 in 100 year flood\" or greater. Properties in SFHAs must have flood insurance for federally backed mortgages. Property owners in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) must purchase flood insurance for federally backed mortgages, as mandated by lending institutions and government-sponsored enterprises. This requirement does not apply to all mortgages, such as personal loans between private parties. However, the issuing party may still choose to require flood insurance for financial security. Flood insurance can be obtained through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private company, as long as it meets certain criteria. Flood insurance is optional for properties outside Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with federally backed mortgages. Residents in NFIP participating communities outside SFHAs can purchase a lower-cost Preferred Risk Policy (PRP) to reduce financial flood risk. PRP rates are lower due to lower risk profile, but may be denied if significant loss history exists. FEMA encourages PRP purchase to expand NFIP policyholders and improve fiscal soundness. FEMA has discretion to craft flood insurance policies. The NFIP has discretion to create flood insurance policies, including the Dwelling, General Property, and RCBAP forms. These Standard Flood Insurance Policies have various exclusions, such as limited coverage for basements. Policyholders can purchase excess flood insurance from the private market to cover losses beyond the NFIP coverage limits. The NFIP offers flood insurance policies for different occupancy types with maximum coverage limits determined by location. Policyholders can elect coverage for building property and contents, with renters eligible for contents-only coverage. Maximum coverage for single-family dwellings is $100,000 for contents and up to $250,000 for buildings. Other Residential Buildings not covered by RCBAP have different coverage limits. The Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP) provides coverage up to $250,000 for building and $100,000 for contents. This coverage applies to single condominium units, cooperatives, timeshares, and other residential buildings. Individual units not covered by RCBAP can be insured separately under the Dwelling form. The RCBAP allows for insurance coverage for the building and commonly owned contents, with a maximum limit based on replacement cost or $250,000 per unit. FEMA oversees the NFIP, but day-to-day operations and claims are handled by private companies through the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program. The NFIP offers insurance coverage through the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program. Policyholders can file claims with their agent or insurance company, who will provide an adjuster to assess the damage and estimate covered flood damage. A Proof of Loss form, signed by the policyholder, is required before the claim can be paid. Policyholders must submit a signed Proof of Loss form with supporting documentation to the DSA or WYO company within 60 days of the loss. FEMA may grant extensions in severe events, as seen after the Louisiana floods and Hurricane Sandy. Policyholders affected by recent hurricanes have one year to file claims. FEMA can authorize waivers for insurers in certain circumstances. Insurers can provide advance payments to policyholders for flood damage, up to $5000 pre-inspection and up to $20,000 with documentation. Additionally, payments can be made based on a general contractor's estimate of necessary repairs. When a flood insurance inspector inspects the insured property, an advance payment of up to 50% of the general contractor's repair estimate may be authorized. This payment cannot be used for Additional Living Expenses and will be deducted from the final settlement. If the loss is not covered or the advance exceeds the actual loss, repayment is required. The President's declaration of a major disaster under the Stafford Act determines the assistance FEMA will provide, including Individual Assistance for certain declared disaster areas. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) under FEMA provides assistance to individuals and families affected by disasters through housing and other needs assistance. The maximum assistance per household is $34,000, and it is meant to supplement existing insurance coverage. Any FEMA assistance for insured losses is considered an advance and must be repaid upon receiving an insurance settlement. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) under FEMA provides housing assistance for up to 18 months, fully covered by the federal government. Assistance includes monetary aid for temporary housing, direct assistance with temporary housing units, repairs, and replacement. Direct Assistance, such as mobile homes, is rare and not subject to a cost limit per household. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) under FEMA provides housing assistance for up to 18 months, fully covered by the federal government. The majority of disaster housing help comes in the form of temporary rental assistance and repairs to uninsured homes to make them habitable. Repair assistance aims to bring homes up to current building codes for safety and sanitation. FEMA does not pay to return homes to their pre-disaster condition. Replacement Assistance can contribute towards replacing uninsured or underinsured homes damaged in a disaster, with a $34,000 limit on awards. The $34,000 limit for IHP awards may not cover full residence replacement. IHP recipients in Special Flood Hazard Areas must have flood insurance. Other Needs Assistance (ONA) is cost-shared with the state and covers various needs like clothing, furniture, and funeral expenses. Flood insurance may be required for insurable items. The Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) is a temporary assistance offered by FEMA to IHP recipients after major flood disasters. It allows low-income households to acquire flood insurance for a flat fee of $600 per insured household, paid from ONA funds. The policy covers up to $34,000 in IHP awards and has a special deductible of $200 for insured flood damage losses. The GFIP is a temporary flood insurance policy offered by FEMA to IHP recipients after major flood disasters. It covers up to $34,000 in IHP awards, lasts for 36 months, and is nonrenewable. FEMA provides a certificate of coverage and contacts households before expiration to encourage maintaining coverage. Other FEMA programs available include Crisis Counseling, Disaster Legal Assistance, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance. FEMA offers Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) for those unemployed due to disasters, funded federally but administered by state agencies. DUA does not require flood insurance. FEMA also provides Transitional Shelter Assistance (TSA) for disaster survivors unable to return home, offering short-term shelter after congregate shelters close. TSA is part of the Individual Assistance application process and is authorized by the Stafford Act. TSA, authorized by the Stafford Act, is administered through FEMA's Individual Assistance program. It provides funding for hotels or motels as transitional shelters for eligible individuals. After Hurricane Sandy, FEMA implemented the STEP Pilot Program to restore power, heat, and hot water to residential properties, allowing residents to stay in their homes during repairs. The STEP program funded essential repairs for private residences under Section 403 of the Stafford Act. It aimed to reduce the need for FEMA shelters by providing residential electrical meter repairs, shelter essential measures, and rapid temporary exterior repairs. Costs were limited to $10,000 per unit, and applicants could receive direct federal assistance or reimbursement for authorized emergency protective measures. Individual property owners were not eligible to apply directly to STEP. The STEP pilot program provided up to $10,000 per residential unit for essential repairs in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. It aimed to make homes habitable in the short term, unlike IHP which offers more comprehensive assistance. In New York City, the Rapid Repair Program complemented STEP by allowing repairs for multifamily dwellings and meeting building codes. STEP funding did not go directly to individuals. FEMA implemented the Shelter at Home program similar to STEP, providing up to $15,000 for repairs to single-family owner-occupied properties in Louisiana. The program did not impact IA grants or require flood insurance. STEP programs were also initiated in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico after hurricanes, offering assistance without affecting IA grants or mandating flood insurance. The STEP programs were implemented in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands following hurricanes, providing up to $20,000 for repairs to disaster-damaged single-family owner-occupied properties. The programs did not affect eligibility for other FEMA assistance and did not require flood insurance. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act restricts housing assistance in certain areas, but essential assistance is allowed. FEMA discourages sheltering in these areas, but STEP policies do not exclude implementation. The Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program provides direct loans for repairs. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers direct loans to individuals, businesses, and organizations affected by federally declared disasters. Loans include Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. The program provides fixed-rate loans with maturities of up to 30 years. Loan types are determined by five types of declarations, with no impact on loan terms or caps. Personal Property Loans offer up to $40,000 for repairing or replacing personal property in disaster areas. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans to individuals affected by disasters, providing up to $40,000 for personal property repair or replacement and up to $200,000 for primary residence repair. Loans can cover mitigation costs but cannot be used for upgrades or additions unless required by building codes. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides up to $200,000 for home repairs, with a maximum of $40,000 for personal property. Recipients must not receive duplicate benefits and must carry flood insurance for the life of the loan. The Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 made flood insurance requirements applicable to agencies providing government loans like the SBA. SBA loans are not available for properties in the Coastal Barrier Resources System or Otherwise Protected Areas. In addition to NFIP and federal assistance, individuals may access additional federal aid not automatically triggered by disaster declarations. The Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program (CDBG-DR) is not automatically triggered by disasters but is provided at the discretion of Congress to address unmet disaster needs. It aims to help communities with limited resources recover after a disaster. Eligible grantees include states, local governments, Indian tribes, and areas designated as disaster areas by the President. The CDBG-DR program allows communities to use funds for disaster-related needs, benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals. Local and state officials have discretion in choosing eligible activities. Funds can be used for short-term relief, mitigation, and long-term recovery. Communities can amend CDBG plans to address imminent threats. Reimbursement for regular CDBG allocation use is possible. HUD does not directly fund individuals. Following the CDBG-DR program, HUD does not provide funding directly to individuals but offers various eligible activities for disaster relief, such as property buyouts, relocation assistance, home rehabilitation, and homeownership support. Significant CDBG-DR grants have been allocated after major hurricanes, like the $19.7 billion provided after the 2005 hurricane season to states like Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Louisiana and Mississippi received the most substantial funding due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Louisiana and Mississippi received $13.4 billion and $5.5 billion in CDBG-DR funding after the 2005 hurricanes. Louisiana used $3 billion for the Road Home program, providing grants for homeowners to repair or rebuild their homes. Grants were reduced for homeowners without insurance or with unpaid taxes. Homeowners could choose to repair or relocate with 60% of the potential grant amount. After Hurricane Sandy, $16 billion in CDBG-DR funding was awarded to New York City and several states. Louisiana and Mississippi had previously received $13.4 billion and $5.5 billion in CDBG-DR funding after the 2005 hurricanes, with Louisiana's Road Home program offering grants for homeowners to repair or rebuild their homes. Mississippi also had a similar program called the Mississippi Homeowner Grant Program, which provided assistance based on income, property location, and homeowner commitments. The CDBG-DR funding was used in various ways by states like Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island after Hurricane Sandy. New Jersey's Homeowner Resettlement Program provided grants up to $10,000 for homeowners in the most impacted counties to address needs like flood insurance premiums. After the 2017 Hurricanes, CDBG-DR funds were allocated to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Texas received $57.8 million for damages from Hurricane Harvey, with additional allocations in subsequent supplements. The funds were distributed based on FEMA-verified losses and required homeowners to sign a promissory note to stay in the county for three years. In the third supplemental, Congress allocated $28 billion in CDBG-DR funding to HUD. $16 billion was designated for unmet needs from 2017 disasters, with $11 million targeted for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. An additional $12 billion was allocated for mitigation activities for grantees affected by disasters from 2015 to 2017. HUD also made $3.9 billion available for mitigation after addressing 2017 unmet needs. In the third supplemental, Congress allocated $28 billion in CDBG-DR funding to HUD, with $16 billion designated for unmet needs from 2017 disasters. An additional $3.9 billion was made available for mitigation, bringing the total to nearly $16 billion for recent CDBG-DR grantees. Funding was allocated to Puerto Rico, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Florida. Individuals in communities not part of the NFIP face restrictions on buying flood insurance and applying for SBA loans. The summary provides information on available federal assistance for flood victims based on NFIP status. It highlights that FEMA Individual Assistance is limited, and flood insurance may be preferable for governments. The perception of large disaster aid amounts acting as a moral hazard is also discussed. Flood insurance may be preferable for governments and individuals, as policyholders cover costs through premiums and fare better than uninsured households. NFIP policyholders can claim for damages from any flood, regardless of federal disaster declaration. NFIP insurance offers higher coverage limits compared to FEMA disaster assistance, with homeowners eligible for up to $350,000 and renters up to $100,000. After the South Carolina floods in October 2015, households receiving FEMA Individual Assistance (IA) had an average payment of $3,200, while NFIP flood insurance claims averaged $34,934. IA payments do not need to be repaid, but the amount is reduced by any NFIP proceeds received. SBA loans can provide up to $240,000, but must be repaid with interest. The nexus between flood insurance and disaster assistance reveals conflicting aims: encouraging individuals to purchase flood insurance versus providing post-disaster assistance. This raises moral hazard questions about individualistic versus egalitarian approaches to flood risk. The policy question arises whether the federal government should provide assistance to disaster victims without flood insurance. Congress may choose to maintain the current balance between flood insurance and disaster assistance or consider altering it. Significant funding is available through sources like CDBG-DR, offering grants to homeowners in disaster-affected areas. The CDBG-DR funding for disaster recovery is provided through supplemental appropriations by Congress in extraordinary circumstances. HUD cannot establish permanent regulations for CDBG-DR grants due to the special appropriations process, leading to potential delays and confusion in implementation. Recipients of CDBG-DR grants are exempt from purchasing flood insurance unless required by the state. Unequal distribution of CDBG-DR funds may raise equity issues in disaster housing assistance. The availability of NFIP insurance impacts other programs operated by FEMA, SBA, and HUD. Congress may consider revising requirements associated with the Flood Disaster Protection Act and flood insurance. Other sources of disaster assistance are detailed in CRS reports, providing a sampling of commonly used programs. The curr_chunk provides a list of commonly used disaster assistance programs, including the National Flood Insurance Program, FEMA Disaster Housing, SBA Disaster Loan Program, and more."
