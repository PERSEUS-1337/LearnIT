    "content": "Trade data and statistics for the current 27 EU member states (EU27) are presented, excluding the United Kingdom (UK) which exited the EU in January 2020. U.S. trade negotiations with the EU will exclude the UK, which may engage in separate trade discussions with the United States. The data is compiled from USDA trade statistics for \"Agricultural and Related Products,\" encompassing various agricultural and related products. The United States and the EU are significant trade and investment partners. The EU27 is a leading market for U.S. agricultural exports, accounting for about 8% of all U.S. exports in 2019. However, U.S. agricultural imports from the EU27 exceed exports, with U.S. exports totaling $12.4 billion and imports totaling $29.7 billion in 2019. In 2019, U.S. agricultural imports from the EU27 exceeded exports, resulting in a trade deficit of approximately $17.3 billion. Leading U.S. exports to the EU27 included corn, soybeans, tree nuts, distilled spirits, fish products, wine, beer, planting seeds, and processed foods. Top U.S. imports from the EU27 were wine, spirits, beer, drinking waters, olive oil, cheese, and processed foods. Trade data do not include the UK, a major importer of U.S. agricultural products. In 2019, U.S. agricultural exports to the UK equaled imports at $2.8 billion. U.S.-EU trade negotiations face frictions due to tariffs imposed by President Trump. The EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. whiskies and corn. In June 2018, the EU imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. agricultural and non-agricultural products, including whiskies, corn, orange juice, and tobacco. The targeted U.S. agricultural exports to the EU28 were valued at around $1.2 billion in 2018, leading to a 33% decline in the EU28 market. In October 2019, the U.S. escalated tensions by imposing additional tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of certain U.S. imports from the EU. The U.S. imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of certain imports from the EU, following a USTR investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The tariffs were authorized by WTO dispute settlement procedures due to the EU's non-compliance with a ruling on Airbus subsidies. The targeted products include spirits, wine, cheese, dairy products, meat, fish, seafood, fruit, and coffee. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU imports including dairy, meat, fish, fruit, coffee, and bakery goods. Agricultural imports make up 56% of EU products subject to tariffs, with increases limited to 25% on agricultural products targeting France, Germany, UK, and Spain. Whiskies, liqueurs, wine, and other food products are mainly affected. USTR reviewed the list of imports for possible revisions or increased tariff rates in December 2019. In February 2020, USTR made changes to the list, with prune juice being removed from the affected products. The EU will remove prune juice from the list of products subject to additional 25% tariffs effective March 5, 2020. U.S.-EU trade negotiations could be impacted if the EU retaliates with tariffs on U.S. exports in response to U.S. actions or an upcoming WTO decision. Later this year, the EU is expected to seek remedies in the form of tariffs on U.S. exports after a WTO ruling in early 2019 found the U.S. in violation of WTO subsidies rules. USTR announced negotiating objectives for a U.S.-EU trade agreement in January 2019, including agricultural policies such as market access and tariff rate quotas administration. The U.S. objectives in U.S.-EU trade negotiations include harmonizing regulatory processes, addressing SPS standards, protecting generic terms for common use, and reducing the U.S. trade deficit in agricultural products with the EU. The EU's negotiating mandate aims for a limited trade agreement focused on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods only, excluding agricultural products and policies. The EU's negotiating mandate for the U.S.-EU trade talks focuses on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods only, excluding agricultural products. Some Members of Congress oppose this exclusion, stating that a deal without addressing trade in agriculture would be unacceptable. There are signals that the trade talks might include negotiation on SPS and regulatory barriers to agricultural trade, but both sides may not agree on which specific non-tariff trade barriers to address. Specific types of non-tariff trade barriers, such as SPS barriers and GIs, may be part of the U.S.-EU trade talks. The EU has downplayed the inclusion of certain regulatory barriers like biotechnology product permits and food standards in the negotiations. The United States is pushing for more concessions from the EU to ease trade tensions and avoid retaliatory tariffs. Discussions are expected to continue in the spring of 2020. The EU has taken various trade-related measures in response to escalating agricultural trade tensions with the United States, including expanding quotas for beef imports, increasing soybean imports, approving genetically engineered products, and proposing to lift bans on certain American grapes. Additionally, the U.S. has requested an investigation into SPS barriers related to pesticide residue levels in all markets, including Europe. These actions are indirectly related to the ongoing U.S.-EU trade talks, where non-tariff barriers like SPS and GIs are actively debated. During the U.S.-EU trade talks, agricultural issues like regulatory coherence, tariff barriers, and market access were actively debated. Studies showed that removing barriers would benefit both U.S. and EU agricultural sectors. Market access issues, including the EU's use of restrictive tariff rate quotas, remain important for U.S. agricultural exporters. The EU uses tariff rate quotas (TRQs) for certain agricultural products, with higher tariffs applied once the quota is filled. Importers in the EU must obtain licenses from national authorities, and a certificate of origin is required for U.S.-specific TRQs. TRQs are applied to beef, poultry, dairy, cereals, rice, sugar, and fruits/vegetables. Import tariffs for agricultural products entering the EU are higher compared to the United States, with an average tariff of about 13% in the EU and 5% in the U.S. The EU has higher tariffs for agricultural products compared to the U.S., with average rates of 13% and 5% respectively. EU tariffs are particularly high for meat, grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, sugar cane, and sugar beets. The EU has preferential trade agreements with over 35 non-EU countries, giving U.S. export competitors an advantage in markets without such agreements. During the T-TIP negotiations, Senate leadership emphasized the need for tariff elimination on agricultural products like beef, pork, poultry, rice, and fruits and vegetables to gain Congress' support. Regulatory barriers such as the EU's import approval process for biotechnology products and GI protections were also addressed. High tariff barriers, along with non-tariff barriers like SPS measures, may hinder U.S. agricultural exports. Non-tariff measures (NTMs) are policy measures other than tariffs that can negatively impact international trade, including technical (SPS, TBTs) and nontechnical measures like quotas and price controls. These barriers affect agricultural trade by creating obstacles for U.S. exports of grain, oilseed products, meat, poultry, processed foods, animal products, and dairy products. EU regulations also play a significant role in trade barriers. U.S. businesses face challenges in exporting processed foods, animal products, and dairy to the EU due to extensive regulations, lack of up-to-date information, and difficulties in meeting food safety standards. Non-tariff barriers, including SPS measures and differences in food labeling requirements, complicate agricultural trade negotiations between the U.S. and EU. The EU has strict regulations on genetically engineered seed varieties, hormones in meat production, and pathogen reduction treatments in poultry. These regulations limit U.S. agricultural exports to the EU. Other regulations involve pesticide residues, drug residues, and animal welfare standards that differ from those in the U.S. The EU's GI protections also restrict U.S. agricultural exports to the EU and countries with trade agreements with the EU. Trade negotiations between the U.S. and the EU focus on regulatory coherence, transparency, and stakeholder engagement. The goal is to improve cooperation and streamline the regulatory approval process for agricultural exports. Regulatory convergence, cooperation, and harmonization are key terms in these discussions. The USDA estimates the ad valorem equivalent effects of EU non-tariff barriers on U.S. agricultural exports, ranging from 23% to 102% for certain products. SPS and regulatory issues are typically addressed in free trade agreements, while GIs are covered in the intellectual property rights chapter. SPS measures aim to protect human, animal, or plant life from pests. SPS and TBT measures aim to protect human, animal, or plant life from risks associated with pests, diseases, contaminants, and additives in food and non-food traded products. These measures include product standards, quarantine procedures, residue limits for pesticides, and packaging regulations. They are addressed in multilateral trade agreements and regularly debated within the SPS and TBT Agreements. SPS and TBT measures, addressed in multilateral trade agreements, aim to protect human, animal, or plant life based on scientific evidence. Improper use can create trade barriers, and bilateral FTAs often address these matters, reaffirming rights under WTO agreements. Some FTAs establish bilateral committees to enhance understanding and consult on measures under WTO SPS and TBT agreements. Regulatory differences between the US and EU have led to trade disputes over SPS and TBT rules. US has WTO disputes with EU over growth-promoting hormones in meat, chemical treatments on poultry, and other issues. The differences in how the United States and the EU regulate food safety and public health have led to disputes over SPS and TBT measures, including issues like growth-promoting hormones in meat and pathogen reduction treatments in poultry processing. Other disputes involve regulations related to BSE, plant processing, chemical residues, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, antibiotics, and animal welfare. During T-TIP negotiations, differences between the U.S. and EU included various agricultural products, biotechnology regulations, and concerns over SPS barriers. EU's stringent biotechnology framework requires labeling of genetically engineered crops, while U.S. groups pushed for changes. EU reported concerns about perceived SPS barriers to exports of sheep and goat meat and eggs. The EU has reported concerns about perceived U.S. SPS barriers to exports of various agricultural products, including sheep and goat meat, egg products, beef, dairy products, live bivalve mollusks, apples, and pears. They also face difficulties protecting their own GIs on certain food and drinks. Additionally, the EU has raised issues regarding the use of \"Buy American\" restrictions in the United States governing public procurement, which could impact local food procurement. The EU's application of the precautionary principle in food safety and animal and plant health remains a key aspect of their risk management policy. The EU's precautionary principle, established in 2002, allows for rapid response to potential health or environmental risks in international trade. While not meant for protectionist measures, some countries challenge its use as such. The EU continues to invoke this principle to justify regulatory policies. The precautionary principle justifies regulatory policies by allowing countries to set higher standards and take protective actions when scientific evidence is inconclusive about potential impacts on health and the environment, as recognized by the WTO. The WTO acknowledges the need for precautionary actions in food safety and animal health. Some countries apply the precautionary principle in trade, causing contention, especially for the United States. Efforts to exceed WTO rules in previous trade negotiations were made. Efforts to enhance regulatory cooperation and coherence in trade agreements, such as the U.S.-EU trade deal, aim to incorporate \"WTO-Plus,\" \"SPS-Plus,\" and \"TBT-Plus\" rules. These changes could benefit U.S. food and agricultural exporters by aligning SPS and TBT measures with international standards. The USMCA and U.S.-China Phase One Trade Agreement also included similar policy changes, emphasizing transparency and harmonization of SPS measures. The USMCA and TPP agreements aim to harmonize SPS measures and enhance regulatory cooperation. USMCA goes beyond TPP by establishing deadlines for import checks. Both agreements address the use of biotechnology, with potential challenges in modifying the EU's precautionary principle. In previous negotiations like T-TIP, U.S. agriculture and food industry urged addressing the EU's application of the precautionary principle. U.S. agricultural and food organizations criticize the EU's precautionary principle for hindering innovation and imposing unjustifiable restrictions on exports. They advocate for a science-based approach to address SPS concerns, opposing the precautionary principle's bias against new technologies like biotechnology and nanotechnology. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports risk assessment based on scientifically sound standards over the precautionary principle. Many in Congress oppose the adoption of the precautionary principle for regulatory decision making and call for effective rules based on science to resolve international trade differences. Concerns have been raised about the EU's SPS measures not being science-based or aligned with international standards, hindering the views of third countries. U.S. federal agencies, such as USDA's APHIS, regularly address trade concerns related to SPS and TBT measures outside of FTA negotiations. The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees regulatory programs for animal and plant health, quarantine, and pest control. They also manage SPS certification requirements for agricultural goods. Interagency processes led by the USTR address foreign government standards that may hinder trade, with representation from USDA, Commerce, and State Department. USTR chairs a group that reviews SPS and TBT measures notified to the WTO. The USTR tracks issues related to SPS and TBT measures notified to the WTO, while agency officials work with international counterparts on these concerns. GIs protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, allowing producers to differentiate their products in the marketplace and receive relief from infringement. However, GIs can also hinder trade by protecting names considered common or generic in one market. Examples of GIs include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham from Italy. GIs, such as Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham from Italy, are protected intellectual property that has become a contentious international trade issue. The use of GIs is included in the current U.S. trade agenda and was debated during T-TIP negotiations. Laws and regulations governing GIs differ between the United States and EU, complicating the issue. GIs are protected by the WTO Agreement. The United States and EU are bound by the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to protect Geographical Indications (GIs) as intellectual property. TRIPS requires a minimum standard of protection for GIs to prevent misleading the public and unfair competition, with an enhanced level of protection for wines and spirits carrying a GI. This commitment extends to both the United States and EU as signatories of TRIPS. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) oversees the International Register of Appellations of Origin, established in the Lisbon Agreement. The EU's Geographical Indications (GIs) program is a contentious issue for some U.S. producer groups, particularly in the wine, cheese, and sausage sectors. Concerns have been raised about EU protections for GIs creating market and trade barriers, especially regarding terms like parmesan, asiago, and feta cheese, which U.S. producers consider generic. The EU's Geographical Indications (GIs) program restricts the sale of certain cheeses like feta in the US. Studies predict a decline in US cheese exports due to these restrictions. Some US industry groups are seeking similar protections for American agricultural products like potatoes, maple syrup, and wine. The EU's Geographical Indications (GIs) program restricts certain products like cheese in the US. Some US industry groups are seeking similar protections for American agricultural products. In the United States, GIs generally fall under the common law right of possession as trademarks administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Trademarks are distinctive signs that companies use to identify themselves and their products to consumers. In the EU, regulations govern Geographical Indications (GIs) for agricultural and food products, wine, and other items. The US does not have a specific database for GIs, but they can be registered as trademarks, certification marks, or collective marks. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau oversees labeling for certain products in the US. EU farm products hold around 12,000 trademarks, but there is no comprehensive list of registered GIs. The EU regulations governing Geographical Indications (GIs) for agricultural products were updated in 2006 after a WTO ruling. These rules came into effect in January 2013 and provide markers for quality schemes based on the product's geographical origin. GIs are defined as distinctive signs identifying a product's origin in a specific region. EU registered products often receive GI protections in third-country markets. EU registered products often receive GI protections in third-country markets, with some EU GIs trademarked in non-EU countries. This poses a concern for U.S. agricultural exporters due to trade agreements between the EU and countries like Canada and Japan, where certain EU GIs are recognized. These protections could restrict U.S. sales in these markets. The EU is also negotiating FTAs with other U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and the Mercosur states, which would involve protecting selected GIs. The EU has agreements with various countries to protect geographical indications (GIs) for products like foods, wine, and spirits. There are concerns about the impact of GIs on U.S. market access, with the USTR working to ensure that EU GI initiatives do not hinder U.S. producers' trademarks and market access. During U.S.-EU trade talks, concerns have been raised about the impact of EU's geographical indications (GIs) on U.S. market access. U.S. officials aim to protect trademarks overlapping with EU-protected GIs and defend the use of common food names. The U.S. seeks the ability to use trademarked names in third countries and the EU. The USMCA increases transparency for GIs and provides guidelines for determining common use terms. A side letter between the US and Mexico prevents market access restrictions for over 30 cheeses. The U.S.-China Phase One Trade Agreement addresses concerns regarding IPR and GIs, ensuring market access for U.S. exports to China. The recent U.S. FTAs include GI provisions that may conflict with existing EU agreements with Mexico, Canada, and China. The U.S.-EU Trade Agreement negotiations pose a challenge for Congress in addressing food and agriculture issues, focusing on regulatory restrictions and non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural trade. Regulatory restrictions and non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural trade are key concerns for U.S. producers in the U.S.-EU trade talks. The UK's exit from the EU could complicate future negotiations, as some barriers faced during the T-TIP negotiation may persist. Regulatory coherence and cooperation are uncertain to benefit U.S. agricultural exporters. The UK's Food Standards Agency aligns more with the United States than the EU, potentially impacting EU trade gains for U.S. agriculture. The UK's exit from the EU could lead to a more favorable trade situation with the UK, affecting the agricultural trade deficit."
