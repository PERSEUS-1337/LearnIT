It is the only interstate park management agency in the US, attracting over 8 million visitors annually. Sterling Forest, a 17,500-acre area, is biologically diverse. Sterling Forest is a 17,500-acre corporate-owned open space property on the New York/New Jersey border. It is a significant watershed area for northern New Jersey, providing clean drinking water to 25% of the state's population. The land supports a diverse ecosystem with rare wildlife species and is strategically located on a wildlife migratory route. The Appalachian Trail passes through Sterling Forest, administered by the National Park Service. Sterling Forest, located on the New York/New Jersey border, is a critical open space buffer for a densely populated metropolitan region. It is a significant watershed area providing clean drinking water to 25% of northern New Jersey's population. The park shares a boundary with Harriman/Bear Mountain State Parks and the Appalachian Trail, making it a key area for conservation. Additionally, lands managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in New York remain on the tax rolls. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is committed to a willing seller-willing buyer transaction with the corporate owners of Sterling Forest, without using eminent domain authority. The Congress established the Federal Agencies Program for the Land and Water Conservation Fund to address the increasing demand for creating recreation areas easily accessible to the population and to finance the extension of Federal recreational facilities in the East and Midwest. The Federal interest in acquiring land in Sterling Forest is due to its nationally significant watershed, recreational, and wildlife attributes, as well as the lack of open space in the densely populated New York-New Jersey-Connecticut Tri-State Region. The authorization for acquiring land in Sterling Forest is outlined in Section 2. Funding of up to $35,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission for acquiring land in the Sterling Forest area. The funds are to be used for preserving watershed, recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values. The allocated funds are available for expenditure until fiscal year 1999. No provision in the Act allows the United States Government to pay property taxes or relieve the Commission and the State of New York from their obligations under New York State law. The Commission, under New York State law, must pay property taxes or cover management costs for lands acquired in the state. They are responsible for holding and managing all acquired property for specified purposes."
