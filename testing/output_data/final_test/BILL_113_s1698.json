    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act, titled \"Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act,\" defines clean technology as energy production from renewable sources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage improvement, enhanced energy efficiency for buildings and industry, and the development of a Smart Grid integrating renewable energy sources. The Act defines clean technology as involving renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, water security, and advanced manufacturing challenges. A cluster refers to a network involved in the research, development, finance, and application of clean technologies. The Act defines clean technology as involving renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, water security, and advanced manufacturing challenges. A cluster refers to a network involved in the research, development, finance, and application of clean technologies through consortia and projects supported by qualifying entities like research universities, government institutions, and NGOs. Translational research involves coordinating basic or applied research with technical applications to enable discoveries to achieve commercial application. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce. Establishment of Clean Technology Consortia Program. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote the development and deployment of state-of-the-art technologies, leveraging expertise from various sectors to support collaborative research and accelerate the commercial application of innovative clean technologies. The Secretary will oversee the program for clean technology consortia, selecting grant recipients through a competitive process and coordinating innovation activities with other agencies, private industry, and academia. This aims to promote the development and deployment of innovative clean technologies. The curr_chunk summarizes the collaboration between Federal agencies, private industry, academia, and other entities to share research, commercialization results, program plans, and collaboration opportunities. The curr_chunk focuses on the applications of the collaboration between Federal agencies, private industry, academia, and other entities to share research, commercialization results, program plans, and collaboration opportunities. To receive support under this Act, a consortium must submit an application with necessary information. Eligibility requires a consortium to consist of research universities with clean technology research budget and other qualifying entities with expertise in translational research. Members must have a binding agreement documenting the partnership structure. The consortium applying for support must have a partnership agreement, a governance structure for cost-effective implementation, a conflicts of interest policy, an auditable accounting structure, and an external advisory committee. Additionally, the consortium must receive funding from non-Federal sources, be part of an existing cluster or show potential to develop one, and operate as a nonprofit organization or public-private partnership. The consortium applying for support must establish an external advisory committee with relevant expertise to review and ensure the selected projects align with the consortium's plans and criteria. The Secretary may disqualify an application if the conflicts of interest policy is deemed inadequate. The consortium must establish an external advisory committee to review projects for conflicts of interest. The committee includes the Secretary, consortium members, and private industry representatives. SEC. 5. GRANTS. The Secretary will award grants to consortia on a competitive basis for up to 5 years, with a possible extension of 5 additional years. The grant amount shall not exceed $30,000,000 per fiscal year or the contributions of non-Federal entities to the consortium. The Secretary will consider the consortium's translational research capacity when determining the grant amount. The consortium's translational research capacity, financial resources, and cluster affiliation are considered for grant awards. Consortia can request increased grant amounts with extensions. Grants must be used for clean technology research, development, innovation, and commercialization activities. Under this Act, a consortium must develop and publish proposed plans, project selection criteria, and terms for project awards on the Department of Commerce website. They must also establish conflict of interest procedures for employees involved in decision-making roles and prevent the misuse of resources for private gain. The consortium aims to prevent displacement of private sector investment, involve private entities investing in clean technologies in due diligence and award processes, and engage parties with a history of commercial application of clean technologies in consortium projects. The consortium oversees project solicitations, selects projects for awards, and monitors project implementation. A consortium can use up to 10% of awarded amounts for administrative expenses and cannot use funds for constructing new buildings. Audits are required to ensure grant compliance with the Act. The consortium must submit audit reports to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States. They must allow full access to records for review. The Secretary will report annually to Congress including audit copies and program recommendations. The Secretary has the authority to revoke awards. The Secretary has the authority to review and revoke grants awarded under the Act if not used in accordance with the Act. $100,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section, with a rescission of the same amount from available discretionary funds."
