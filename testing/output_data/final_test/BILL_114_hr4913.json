    "content": "The Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 may be cited as the \"Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016\". It includes a section on the repayment of liquidation preference. The Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 mandates the modification of Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements to reduce liquidation preference to zero and redeem Variable Liquidation Preference Senior Preferred Stocks. The Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 requires the redemption of Variable Liquidation Preference Senior Preferred Stocks, resulting in the termination of rights and status of such shares. The Department of the Treasury will retain dividend payments from enterprises before the enactment of the Act. No periodic commitment fee will be required. The Treasury will exercise warrants for the purchase of common stock provided under the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. SEC. 3. REBUILDING OF ENTERPRISE RETAINED CAPITAL. The provisions of this section apply to each enterprise, including during conservatorship. When an enterprise is not fully capitalized, certain regulations do not apply, and the Director must ensure that the net income is retained and maintained each fiscal year. The Director requires enterprises to retain and maintain net income as capital reserves. When fully capitalized, certain regulations apply, and dividends cannot be paid unless fully capitalized. \"Fully capitalized\" means maintaining a specific amount of total capital. The Director mandates enterprises to uphold a level of total capital exceeding 10% of risk-weighted assets. A capital restoration plan must be submitted within 45 days of enactment, complying with specified regulations. Annual updates are required thereafter. After submitting a capital restoration plan, the Director must provide annual updates on progress towards restoring the enterprise's capital. These updated plans are made publicly available. The Director is also responsible for terminating conservatorships of enterprises when necessary. The Director must issue regulations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act to carry out conservatorship provisions for enterprises under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. SEC. 4. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. Any individual or entity affected by the Director or Secretary's actions in violation of specified acts may seek injunctive relief through a civil action. The court can grant equitable relief and award litigation costs to prevailing plaintiffs, with jurisdiction in the district courts of the United States. The court has jurisdiction over proceedings under this section, regardless of whether administrative remedies have been exhausted. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, key definitions include Director as the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Enterprise as defined in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act, Net income as income after expenses, and Risk-weighted as adjusted for risk levels. The term \"risk-weighted\" refers to assets of an enterprise, specifically single family housing mortgages meeting certain requirements, with a risk-weighting of 50 percent. The term \"Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\" pertains to agreements related to senior preferred stock purchases by an enterprise. The Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement was amended multiple times between the Department of the Treasury and the enterprise."
