    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Human Rights in India Act\". The Congress finds that in India, thousands of political prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, are held without charge under special detention laws. These laws grant broad powers to the military and police forces, allowing for arrest, detention, and even shooting to kill with little accountability. Key laws cited include TADA, National Security Act, and various Armed Forces Special Powers Acts. Throughout India, political detainees are held for extended periods without access to legal counsel, family, or friends. The routine torture of detainees has led to deaths in police and military custody, with many political detainees disappearing or being extrajudicially executed by security forces. These actions violate international human rights standards, including the right to liberty, fair trial, freedom of expression, and protection against torture and arbitrary arrest. In Punjab, the government encouraged extrajudicial executions by offering bounties for killing militants. Military and police abuses are widespread in states like Punjab, Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Jammu and Kashmir. Victims often come from underprivileged sections of society, like scheduled castes and tribes. The National Human Rights Commission was established by the Indian government to improve human rights, but many organizations remain concerned. The National Human Rights Commission in India faces limitations on its powers and mandate, raising concerns among human rights organizations. In 1994, the Government of India allowed limited humanitarian assistance by the International Committee of the Red Cross in Jammu and Kashmir, but prohibited other international human rights organizations from conducting independent investigations in the region. In disputed Jammu and Kashmir, the Government of India controls access, limiting it to states like Punjab, Assam, Manipur, and Nagaland with human rights issues. Armed opposition groups in India have committed abuses, prompting calls from human rights organizations to adhere to humanitarian law standards. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR INDIA UNLESS CERTAIN STEPS ARE TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TO IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS IN INDIA. The President must provide a report to Congress certifying that the Government of India meets specific human rights requirements before receiving development assistance. These requirements include releasing prisoners of conscience, ensuring fair trials for political prisoners, eliminating torture practices, impartially investigating allegations of torture, and determining the fate of individuals in custody. The Government of India must ensure the fate of political detainees, prosecute those responsible for torture, allow criticism of the government, protect human rights monitors, and grant access to human rights organizations and media in areas with human rights issues. The Government of India must comply with human rights requirements to receive development assistance from the United States. Assistance can be waived if it is in the national security interest. India must comply with human rights requirements to receive development assistance from the United States. The prohibition on assistance applies to development assistance provided 9 months after the enactment of this Act."
