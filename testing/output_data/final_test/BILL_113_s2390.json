    "content": "The \"Foster Care Tax Credit Act\" is introduced as a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a tax credit for foster care expenses. The \"Foster Care Tax Credit Act\" in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows a tax credit for qualifying foster children residing with eligible taxpayers. The credit amount is $1,000, reduced by $50 for each $1,000 of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeding the threshold amount. The term 'adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income increased by any amount excluded from gross income under specific sections. A 'threshold amount' is defined as per section 24(b)(2). A 'qualifying foster child' is an eligible foster child of the taxpayer who is under 17, a US citizen, resides with the taxpayer for at least one month in a year, and is not eligible for the tax credit under section 24. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to any taxpayer, with restrictions on single households, married individuals filing jointly, and individuals with the highest adjusted gross income in the same household. If a foster child resides with the taxpayer for more than 15 consecutive days in a calendar month, specific rules apply. The foster child shall be treated as residing in the home of the taxpayer for the full calendar month. The aggregate credits allowed to a taxpayer shall be increased by the lesser of the credit allowed without regard to certain limitations or the aggregate amount of credits allowed by this subpart. The credit under section 24(a) may increase if the limitation in section 26(a) is increased by 15 percent of earned income exceeding $10,000 or by the excess for taxpayers with 3 or more qualifying foster children. The taxpayer can claim a credit that exceeds their social security taxes for the year, reducing the overall allowable credit without affecting other credits. Income excluded under section 112 is considered earned income for tax purposes. The $10,000 amount in paragraph (1)(B)(i) is adjusted annually for inflation after 2001. To claim a credit for a qualifying foster child, the taxpayer must include the child's name and taxpayer identification number on their tax return. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item after section 25D. The foster care tax credit under Sec. 25E applies to calendar months after December 31, 2013. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will work with the Treasury to identify tax code provisions benefiting foster families and increase outreach to provide information to foster care agencies and families."
