    "content": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets, preventing speculation, manipulation, and fraud. It oversees industry self-regulatory organizations and requires registration of industry firms. The CFTC, established in 1974, regulates commodities futures and options markets, overseeing industry self-regulatory organizations. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded its jurisdiction to include OTC derivatives, requiring registration of swap market participants and clearing of certain swaps. Newly regulated entities include swap dealers, major swap participants, clearing organizations, execution facilities, and data repositories, subject to new business conduct standards. The CFTC, like the SEC, does not regulate the safety of individual firms except for newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants. Derivatives trading in today's market mostly involves financial variables, with congressional oversight vested in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees due to the market's historical origins in agricultural commerce. Appropriations for the CFTC are under the jurisdiction of specific subcommittees in the House and Senate. The Obama Administration has requested additional funding for the CFTC since FY2011 to meet oversight responsibilities for swaps. The CFTC has requested increased funding since FY2011, with a budget of $322 million and 895 FTEs for FY2016. The actual appropriation was $250 million. For FY2017, the CFTC requested $330 million and 897 FTEs, with a focus on information technology investments and staffing increases in surveillance, enforcement, and analysis. The President's budget request highlighted the need for increased funding for the CFTC due to expanded responsibilities and market changes. The House and Senate appropriations bills for FY2017 would provide $250 million, consistent with the previous year. The CFTC is led by five commissioners appointed by the President for staggered five-year terms. The CFTC is led by five commissioners appointed by the President for staggered five-year terms, with no more than three commissioners from the same political party. The agency is organized around four divisions: Clearing and Risk, Enforcement, Market Oversight, and Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight. The CEA governs futures and swaps markets that the CFTC administers. The CFTC administers futures and swaps markets under the CEA, which requires periodic reauthorization by Congress. Despite the expiration of its authorization in 2013, the CFTC continues to function. The 114th Congress is currently considering new reauthorization bills, which historically have been used to modify the CFTC's regulatory authority. The CFTC reauthorization process is a key way for Congress to evaluate and modify the agency's regulatory authority, especially in light of the Dodd-Frank Act's oversight of the swaps market. Some in Congress see this as an opportunity to reexamine Dodd-Frank provisions, while others are concerned about weakening derivatives oversight. The House passed H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, the House passed H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, reauthorizing appropriations for the CFTC. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The Obama Administration threatened to veto the bill, citing concerns about undermining the CFTC's efficiency. The Senate Committee marked up and ordered to be reported a CFTC reauthorization bill, S. 2917, which was placed on the Senate legislative calendar. Both H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 aim to amend the CEA. H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 aim to amend the short Authorization of Appropriations section in the CEA through 2019. The bills would expand factors for the CFTC to consider in cost-benefit analysis, requiring quantitative and qualitative analysis. The CFTC is required to conduct cost-benefit analysis for regulations under the CEA, but is not subject to general government agency requirements. H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 propose changes to expand factors for analysis, including quantitative and qualitative aspects. The costs and benefits of proposed Commission action are evaluated based on protection of market participants, efficiency of futures markets, price discovery, risk management practices, and public interest considerations. Section 15(a) of the CEA applies to all CFTC rules, with guidance from OMB's OIRA for cost-benefit analysis. The CFTC conducts cost-benefit analyses under the CEA, guided by OIRA. H.R. 2289 expands the CEA's analysis provisions to 12 considerations, including market participant protection and public interest. The CFTC conducts cost-benefit analyses under the CEA, guided by OIRA. H.R. 2289 expands the CEA's analysis provisions to 12 considerations, including market participant protection, market efficiency, liquidity impact, price discovery, risk management, regulatory alternatives, risk assessment, compliance costs, regulatory consistency, and implementation costs. The CFTC conducts cost-benefit analyses under the CEA, guided by OIRA. H.R. 2289 expands the CEA's analysis provisions to 12 considerations, including market participant protection, market efficiency, liquidity impact, price discovery, risk management, regulatory alternatives, risk assessment, compliance costs, regulatory consistency, and implementation costs. The proposed regulation by the Commission staff includes a methodology for quantifying costs, maximizing net benefits, and other public interest considerations. Section 202 requires quantitative as well as qualitative assessments of costs and benefits, raising questions about accurately quantifying benefits involving economic externalities. Negative externalities, such as pollution and risks to the financial system, can have widespread and hard-to-quantify effects on unrelated third parties. Quantifying these externalities may involve estimating the value of intangible benefits, like financial stability or avoiding diseases. Critics argue that measuring the benefits of financial regulation, which can be broadly dispersed and speculative, is challenging. Cost-benefit analysis is a method used to evaluate the benefits and costs of proposed regulations. Critics argue that quantifying the benefits of financial regulation is challenging, while compliance costs are more easily measurable. Proponents believe cost-benefit analysis helps agencies clarify the benefits of their rules and weigh costs against benefits. Some scholars argue that increased use of cost-benefit analysis has slowed down the rulemaking process and led to agencies issuing guidance documents instead of regulations. Sections 301 and 306 of H.R. 2289 aim to expand exceptions from certain Dodd-Frank swaps trading and clearing requirements for nonfinancial companies. Critics argue that relying on cost-benefit analysis for financial rulemakings may overstate costs compared to benefits, leading to potential court challenges and invalidation of regulations. The end-user exception in Section 723 of Dodd-Frank exempts nonfinancial firms from clearing and exchange-trading requirements when using swaps to hedge commercial risks. H.R. 2289 seeks to expand this exception by amending the definition of financial entities and activities eligible for the exception. S. 2917 does not address trading by affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act provides an end-user exception for nonfinancial firms using swaps to hedge commercial risks. Affiliates of end-users can use this exception if they act as agents to hedge the commercial risk of the non-financial entity. The term \"affiliated companies\" loosely refers to related companies, including foreign affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act provides an exception for non-financial firms using swaps to hedge commercial risks, allowing affiliates to use this exception as agents. However, certain entities like swap dealers, hedge funds, and large bank holding companies are excluded from this exception. Proponents argue that corporate treasury units of non-financial parent companies could be affected, as they aggregate risks and engage in swap transactions to mitigate them. Treasury units may also serve other financial functions for the parent company. The Dodd-Frank Act allows non-financial firms to hedge commercial risks using swaps, with affiliates able to act as agents. However, treasury units of non-financial entities may face challenges in using the end-user exception when hedging risks with financial entities, making it more costly for parent corporations to hedge risks using derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act allows non-financial firms to hedge commercial risks using swaps, with affiliates able to act as agents. However, treasury units of non-financial entities may face challenges in using the end-user exception when hedging risks with financial entities, making it more expensive for their parent corporation to hedge risks using derivatives. Policymakers are considering how widely to extend exceptions for affiliates in derivatives clearing and exchange-trading requirements to minimize risks to the financial system or parent companies. The CFTC's 2012 final rule addressed excluding certain financial entities from the end-user exception. The CFTC addressed concerns about the end-user exception for treasury affiliates in non-financial corporations in 2014, stating they would not enforce actions against certain treasury affiliates. Some argued the exception should be limited to businesses dealing with underlying commodities, while others warned of increased financial risks from extending the exception to certain financial entities. The CFTC issued a no-action letter in 2014 for eligible treasury affiliates, outlining conditions for enforcement forbearance. However, some industry participants are not satisfied with the letter as it may technically violate the Dodd-Frank Act's clearing requirement. The CFTC issued a no-action letter in 2014 for eligible treasury affiliates, providing enforcement forbearance. Proponents argue for a statutory amendment to clarify rules for end-users hedging commercial risk. H.R. 2289 aims to address concerns but may expand exceptions beyond CFTC's letter coverage. Congress must consider risks of derivatives trading between affiliates within the same organization. The policymakers need to consider potential incentives for affiliates to trade swaps at the expense of others within a conglomerate. They must also address how to control risks of excessive losses and avoid regulatory concerns about large swap market players using affiliates to bypass U.S. derivatives requirements. Proponents of H.R. 2289 argue that expanding exceptions for inter-affiliate transactions would prevent redundant regulation and unnecessary capital tie-ups. Opponents of expanding the exception in H.R. 2289 argue that it could allow financial firms to bypass key Dodd-Frank risk controls meant for commercial end users. They are concerned about the potential for affiliates to cause significant losses to their parent companies through derivatives trades. Opponents of expanding the exception in H.R. 2289 are concerned about affiliates causing significant losses to their parent companies through derivatives trades. They argue for restrictions on the exception to 100%-owned subsidiaries with strict risk management controls. Section 301 of the bill would potentially expand hedging activities for affiliates of non-financial entities under the end-user exception. Section 301 of H.R. 2289 would allow affiliates of non-financial entities to engage in hedging activities under the end-user exception, expanding their ability to hedge commercial risks independently. This change removes the requirement for affiliates to act on behalf of the non-financial entity, potentially increasing their flexibility in managing risks. Section 301 of H.R. 2289 expands the end-user exception to allow affiliates of non-financial entities to independently engage in hedging activities. This change provides flexibility for affiliates to manage commercial risks without the need to act on behalf of the non-financial entity. The exception does not restrict trading partners for affiliates, potentially allowing affiliated financial firms with less than $50 billion in assets to qualify for the exemption from derivatives requirements. The end-user exception under H.R. 2289 allows affiliates of non-financial firms to independently hedge commercial risks. There is flexibility for affiliates to engage in swaps trading with unaffiliated financial firms, as long as the swap is to hedge commercial risks. The prohibition on certain affiliates in Dodd-Frank may restrict this scenario. The end-user exception in H.R. 2289 allows affiliates of non-financial firms to hedge commercial risks independently. The prohibition in Dodd-Frank may limit certain affiliates from using this exception, but H.R. 2289 could potentially broaden the definition of a financial entity, allowing more companies to claim the end-user exception. Section 306 of H.R. 2289 expands the definition of a financial entity to potentially include certain nonbank entities trading on behalf of others, as long as neither entity is supervised by a prudential regulator. It excludes entities that are commercial market participants or hedge commercial risks for unsupervised affiliates. Entities not supervised by a prudential regulator and not classified as financial entities under the Commodity Exchange Act can qualify for the end-user exception, allowing them to use swaps to hedge commercial risks without meeting affiliate requirements. H.R. 2289 proposes a broader exception from Dodd-Frank requirements for nonbank financial entities, allowing them to use swaps to hedge commercial risks. S. 2917 takes a different approach by modifying the definition of a financial entity. Section 206 of S. 2917 addresses the question of what it means for the purposes of the legislation. Section 206 of S. 2917 modifies the definition of a financial entity by adding a requirement for the CFTC to issue a new rule defining the term \"predominantly engaged in financial activities.\" The rule states that an entity is not predominantly engaged in financial activities if less than 85% of its revenue comes from such activities. S. 2917 introduces changes to the definition of bona fide hedging in the CEA, aligning with H.R. 2289. The concept refers to transactions that genuinely offset commercial risks, guiding the CFTC in determining swap dealer registration, position limits, and large trader reporting. The CFTC uses large trader reporting to monitor position sizes and prevent excessive market power. Position limits set the maximum position one entity can hold in a commodity. Changes in the definition of bona fide hedging in the CEA impact swap dealer registration, position limits, and large trader reporting. The Commission defines bona fide hedging transactions as those economically appropriate for risk reduction in commercial enterprises. Proposed changes could broaden the definition to include managing anticipated risks, not just current ones. The potential changes in the definition of bona fide hedging transactions could expand the types of trades permitted, potentially reducing the impact of registration requirements and position size restrictions. The question of regulating cross-border swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act is significant due to the international nature of the swaps market. Section 722(d) of the Act specified that swaps reforms may not apply to activities outside the U.S. unless they have a direct connection to U.S. commerce. Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the importance of bringing swaps market reform to transactions with overseas branches and affiliates guaranteed by U.S. entities to prevent American jobs and markets from moving offshore. Derivatives trading by overseas affiliates of U.S. financial conglomerates has resulted in significant losses to U.S.-based entities, as seen in examples like AIG's London-based Financial Products Group and J.P. Morgan's \"London Whale\" derivatives trading. The CFTC issued proposed guidance on the cross-border application of Title VII of Dodd-Frank, clarifying who would count as a \"U.S. person\" for meeting requirements. Concerns were raised about the potential migration of swap business away from U.S. financial institutions if CFTC rules were too burdensome. The SEC issued a temporary exemption on December 21, 2012, extending the deadline for cross-border swaps requirements. On May 1, 2013, the SEC proposed a rule on cross-border security-based swaps, taking a narrower approach than the CFTC. The CFTC issued final guidance on July 26, 2013, defining U.S. person and registration requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants. The CFTC issued rules on cross-border trades for swap dealers and major swap participants, including swaps involving non-U.S. persons guaranteed by U.S. persons. They also issued guidance on applying U.S. derivatives requirements to offshore trades involving U.S. personnel. Challenges include the recognition of foreign regulators' clearinghouses and data repositories as equivalent for reporting trades across jurisdictions. The current bill, H.R. 2289, addresses challenges in obtaining equivalence determination from the European Union for U.S. clearinghouses and trading facilities. It mandates that foreign swaps markets' regulatory requirements be comparable to those of the United States within 18 months, unless deemed otherwise by the CFTC. Identifying the eight largest foreign jurisdictions is complex and depends on regulatory treatment. The bill H.R. 2289 addresses challenges in obtaining equivalence determination from the European Union for U.S. clearinghouses and trading facilities. It mandates that foreign swaps markets' regulatory requirements be comparable to those of the United States within 18 months, unless deemed otherwise by the CFTC. Regulators would have to determine where a swap is traded and if it falls under U.S. jurisdiction. If the CFTC does not make a determination of non-comparability, non-United States persons or transactions between them are exempt from U.S. swaps requirements if they comply with permitted foreign jurisdictions. The bill H.R. 2289 aims to address challenges in obtaining equivalence determination from the European Union for U.S. clearinghouses and trading facilities. It mandates that foreign swaps markets' regulatory requirements be comparable to those of the United States within 18 months, unless deemed otherwise by the CFTC. The bill allows for trades involving non-U.S. persons to follow the swaps requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets, unless the CFTC finds a foreign jurisdiction lacking. The CFTC would determine the application of this provision to transactions between non-U.S. persons. The bill H.R. 2289 addresses challenges in obtaining equivalence determination from the EU for U.S. clearinghouses and trading facilities. It mandates foreign swaps markets' regulatory requirements to be comparable to the U.S. within 18 months, unless deemed otherwise by the CFTC. The CFTC would determine the application of this provision to transactions between non-U.S. persons, with some leeway given to the regulator for interpretation. Section 314 includes a definition of a U.S. person and specifies that the location of personnel involved in swaps should not be considered for determining the applicability of U.S. swaps requirements. This provision has drawn criticism in congressional debate. The advisory from the CFTC stated that Dodd-Frank requirements would apply to swaps between U.S. and non-U.S. persons if the foreign swap dealer used personnel in the U.S. to arrange the swap. This advisory faced industry opposition and has been delayed multiple times. H.R. 2289 aims to overturn this advisory and remove a requirement for foreign regulators to indemnify U.S.-based swap data repositories and the CFTC for expenses related to market data litigation. The provision in H.R. 2289 requires foreign regulators to indemnify U.S.-based swap data repositories and the CFTC for expenses related to market data litigation. This provision also mandates written agreements from foreign regulators to abide by confidentiality requirements before sharing information. Dodd-Frank initially required all swaps to be reported to SDRs to improve transparency in the swaps market. The Dodd-Frank provision aimed to encourage foreign regulators to protect shared swap information by making it costly if leaked. However, the indemnification requirement created barriers to sharing with foreign regulators. Removing this provision would facilitate cross-border information sharing, as noted by CFTC Chair Massad. H.R. 1847 in the 114th Congress, similar to H.R. 2289, passed the House to repeal the indemnification provision. The provision in H.R. 2289, passed in the House on July 14, 2015, removed the requirement for foreign regulators to indemnify U.S.-based swap data repositories and the CFTC for expenses related to market data litigation. This change aimed to facilitate cross-border information sharing between U.S. and foreign regulators. The provision in H.R. 2289 and H.R. 1847 repeals the indemnification requirement for foreign regulators, maintaining confidentiality agreements for information sharing. SEC officials recommended removing this barrier to sharing information. Residual interest refers to FCM capital covering margin deficits in customer accounts. Both bills set a deadline for FCMs to deposit capital for residual interest by 6:00 p.m. on the following business day, aligning with CFTC regulations. The CFTC's Regulation 1.22 sets the deadline for posting residual interest, affecting when customers must post collateral for insufficient margin amounts. The final rule on March 17, 2015, amended Regulation 1.22 to prevent the FCM's deadline from becoming earlier without CFTC action. This change aimed to ensure FCMs always held sufficient margin without using one customer's margin to support another. The CFTC's Regulation 1.22 sets the deadline for posting residual interest, affecting when customers must post collateral for insufficient margin amounts. The March 17, 2015, final rule included a plan for the CFTC to study the current rule's effectiveness, the possibility of changing the deadline, and the costs and benefits of any change."
