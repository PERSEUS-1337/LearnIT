    "content": "The \"Aviation Security Enhancement Act of 2002\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that the safety and security of the civil air transportation system is critical to the national defense of the United States. A large percentage of the Nation's airports will have checked baggage explosive detection systems in place by December 31, 2002, but the remaining airports will need to implement expensive interim systems, costing millions of taxpayer dollars and presenting challenges in hiring and training operators within a short timeframe. This will also require unprecedented demands on lobby space in airports. The statutory deadline of December 31, 2002, initially thought to be sufficient for implementing baggage screening, may be inadequate. Flexibility in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act allows current screening practices until explosive detection systems are installed to maintain security. A measured approach to installations will give the Transportation Security Administration leeway. The Transportation Security Administration has flexibility to address airport requirements and accommodate technology improvements. Installations should be completed promptly after planning, ensuring optimal solutions for passenger protection. SEC. 3. EXPLOSIVE DETECTION SYSTEMS. Modification of airport terminal buildings to accommodate explosive detection systems is required by the Under Secretary, who must notify airport owners or operators of the number and type of systems needed by October 1, 2002. This is to ensure all checked baggage can be screened without causing unreasonable delays for passengers. If an airport cannot afford to make necessary modifications to accommodate explosive detection systems by December 31, 2002, the owner or operator must notify the Under Secretary by November 1, 2002. The Under Secretary, in consultation with the owner or operator, must develop a plan by December 1, 2002, to modify airport terminal buildings for explosive detection systems to screen all checked baggage. The plan must include a completion date and be transmitted to Congress upon completion. The Under Secretary must develop a plan to deploy explosive detection systems in non-public areas of airport terminals, with high throughput and low false alarm rates. The plan must be transmitted to Congress and kept confidential for security reasons. \"After December 31, 2002, if explosive detection systems are not screening all checked baggage at certain US airports, alternative screening methods must be used until all baggage is screened by explosive detection systems. The purchase of these systems is mandated to be done by the Under Secretary.\" The term 'explosive detection system' refers to a device that can detect various explosives. The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security is required to conduct demonstration projects for alternative explosive detection systems at specific US airports. Airport owners must submit applications by December 1, 2002, to participate in these projects. The Under Secretary will select airports for demonstration projects based on applications received by March 31, 2003. Criteria for evaluating explosive detection systems include detection probability, false alarm probability, reliability, detection of explosives and hazardous materials, and throughput speed. The Under Secretary will select airports for demonstration projects based on applications received by March 31, 2003. Criteria for evaluating explosive detection systems include detection probability, false alarm probability, reliability, detection of explosives and hazardous materials, and throughput speed. Airport modifications for deployment of explosive detection systems are not required. The Under Secretary may require airports to continue deploying existing inspection systems but cannot mandate additional explosive detection equipment before December 31, 2003. (6) Purchase of alternative explosive detection systems: Any alternative system bought under this project will be purchased by the Under Secretary. (7) Report to Congress: By December 31, 2003, the Under Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the project results and evaluate the systems based on specified criteria. Section 44901(e) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to correct a reference."
