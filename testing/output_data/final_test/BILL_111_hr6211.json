    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Back and Spinal Therapy Act\". It includes findings related to veterans' back and spinal therapy. Congress finds that a significant number of Armed Forces members evacuated from Afghanistan in 2009 suffered spinal injuries, often due to carrying excessive weight. The use of improvised explosive devices by insurgents has also led to an increase in musculoskeletal injuries. Advances in body armor and medical treatment have reduced deaths among deployed Armed Forces members, but there is a rise in spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries. Returning members from Iraq are more likely to have long-term pain from these injuries than battle wounds. Common diagnoses include ruptured spinal discs, compressed discs, and degenerative disc disease. Non-invasive technologies offered by certain Department of Veterans Affairs facilities can effectively treat spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries, reducing long-term costs and improving health outcomes for veterans. Traditional medical approaches often involve surgery and medication, but non-invasive techniques can break the cycle of expensive treatments. Non-invasive techniques like manual physical therapy, core strengthening, water exercise, group exercise, and pain management therapy should be evaluated for effectiveness in treating spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries in veterans. The pilot program aims to provide veterans with non-invasive techniques for spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a pilot program to provide non-invasive techniques for treating spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries in covered veterans. The program will use an evidence-based medicine framework to assess effectiveness and include a representative sample of veterans to determine feasibility and unique considerations for female veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a pilot program to provide non-invasive techniques for treating spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries in covered veterans, with a preference for those who served in specific operations. The program will cater to female veterans, veterans of various ages, and those in different regions of the United States. The Secretary will determine the type of technique to provide and assess the impact of self-referral compared to physician referral. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a pilot program to provide non-invasive techniques for treating spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries in covered veterans. The program will utilize telehealth technology for veterans in rural areas and partner with a university for implementation. Trained individuals will provide non-invasive techniques for pain management. The pilot program aims to effectively treat veterans with spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries using non-invasive techniques. It will recognize the unique experiences of veterans from specific operations and utilize best practices and technologies. The program will start by March 1, 2011, and last for two years. The Secretary is required to submit reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs by June 1, 2012. The pilot program aims to treat veterans with spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries using non-invasive techniques. The report to be submitted will include an analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the techniques, how they would be incorporated at VA medical facilities, cost-savings, and a comparison with other methods. The Secretary will provide a report to Congress on the pilot program for treating veterans with spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries. The report will include recommendations on continuing or expanding the program and suggestions for legislative actions to improve treatment for these injuries. Additionally, a final report with updated information will be submitted by June 1, 2013. In this section, the term \"covered veteran\" refers to a veteran with specific injuries or eligible for certain medical care. The term \"non-invasive techniques\" includes various methods of treatment for spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries, excluding surgery. The Secretary may consider successful methods like recreational therapy at the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center in Palo Alto, California, and the mindfulness based stress reduction program at the Puget Sound Health Care System. Additionally, other effective methods not widely available in VA medical facilities may also be considered."
