Manufacturing contributes 12% to the GDP, two-thirds of U.S. exports, and employs nearly 12 million workers directly, with additional jobs supported in other industries. Manufacturers also contribute significantly to the nation's industrial funding. Manufacturing plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy and national defense, contributing 12% to the GDP, two-thirds of exports, and employing nearly 12 million workers. Manufacturers also fund a majority of the nation's industrial research and development, leading to technological innovation and higher wages for workers. The U.S. relies on its manufacturing base for producing essential equipment for national defense. Analysts have varying opinions on the health of the manufacturing sector, with some seeing it as vibrant and productive. The U.S. manufacturing sector has shown strong growth in output and productivity, with a significant increase in manufacturing employment. However, there are concerns about a potential \"hollowing-out\" of U.S. manufacturing due to companies moving production offshore and other nations' efforts to attract manufacturing operations. In January 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment hit a low of 11.5 million, down over 41% from its peak in 1979. Concerns about the sector's health have increased due to the recent recession and slow recovery. Stakeholders suggest reducing tax and regulatory burdens, while President Obama supports direct federal funding for improvements. President Obama has proposed initiatives like the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation to address concerns about U.S. manufacturing. The National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing aims to bridge gaps in the innovation system and guide federal R&D investments. The proposed National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) aims to bridge the innovation gap in domestic production of goods. Some policy makers have concerns about the federal budget deficit, the role of the government, market distortions, and subsidization of for-profit corporations. President Obama introduced the concept in his FY2013 budget with a request for $1 billion in funding for up to 15 institutes. The Department of Defense also issued a solicitation and made an award in FY2012. President Obama proposed $1 billion in mandatory funding for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in his FY2014 budget to establish up to 15 institutes. The Department of Defense awarded a Pilot Institute for additive manufacturing in FY2012, and President Obama announced plans for three additional institutes in 2013. The NNMI aims to establish 15 institutes to bring together industry, universities, and federal agencies to develop new manufacturing technologies. Each institute will focus on a unique technology and support manufacturing activity in local areas. The goal is to facilitate the commercialization of manufacturing technology and catalyze industry investment. Institutes are expected to become self-sustaining within five to seven years. The NNMI aims to establish 15 institutes to advance technological innovation, improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, and encourage investment. The program will be managed collaboratively by multiple agencies and NIST would receive $1 billion in funding over nine years to support the Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation. The NNMI aims to establish 15 institutes to advance technological innovation and improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Each IMI is expected to become financially sustainable within seven years through income-generating activities. The concept is endorsed by various organizations and is modeled after the German Fraunhofer Institutes. The Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office gathered input from various stakeholders to design the NNMI program. This included holding workshops and publishing a Request for Information, resulting in feedback from 875 attendees and 78 responses. The input was used to prepare a report outlining the principles and characteristics of the NNMI program. The NNMI program, based on input from stakeholders, aims to establish independently managed Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation with specific focus areas to serve as regional innovation hubs. These institutes will function collectively as a network for sharing and collaboration. The NNMI program aims to establish Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation as regional innovation hubs to bridge the gap between R&D and technological deployment in domestic production. These institutes will be long-term partnerships between industry and academia, supported by federal, state, and local governments. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) are regional hubs focused on building advanced manufacturing clusters with expertise from industry, academia, and government. They aim to integrate resources into a national innovation ecosystem, develop next-generation products, and catalyze new innovation clusters. IMIs offer facilities for turning inventions into competitive commercial products. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) aim to accelerate the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises by integrating education and workforce training functions. They are based on concepts of open innovation and partnership, facilitating the formation of effective teams to solve difficult problems and provide shared-use facilities for scaling up technologies. IMIs create new capabilities, products, and processes to impact commercial production. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) aim to accelerate the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises by providing technical assistance, trained personnel, and access to shared equipment and infrastructure. IMIs develop leaders familiar with research applications, new technologies, and production systems. Each IMI has a specific physical location and collaborates with organizations with relevant expertise. Each IMI has a unique focus area, such as a manufacturing process or enabling technology. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) focus on specific areas like manufacturing processes, enabling technologies, or industry sectors. IMIs are selected through a competitive application process managed by AMNPO partner agencies. Proposals are evaluated based on merit, including pre-proposals, site visits, and economic analyses. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) are evaluated based on proposed focus areas, production-scale impact, governance structures, resources, co-investment, engagement with stakeholders, and sustainability. IMIs are led by a U.S. not-for-profit institution with the capacity to lead industry-wide agendas, partnering with manufacturing enterprises, startups, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) involve a diverse range of partners, including startups, research universities, government agencies, and industry associations. IMIs aim to foster collaboration and leverage national and international resources within their focus areas. The Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) aim to leverage industry consortia, regional clusters, and federal programs like the National Science Foundation's Engineering Research Centers and Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers. IMIs are expected to engage with SMEs and utilize existing networks like the NIST Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The Preliminary Design report envisions IMIs assisting SMEs by providing information on technology trends, access to cutting-edge technologies, shared facilities, specialized equipment, technical advice, and a tiered membership structure to encourage SME participation. The NNMI Preliminary Design report outlines participation criteria for non-domestic organizations in institutes, emphasizing economic interest and technology promotion for domestic manufacturing. Funding includes a $1 billion investment from FY2014 to FY2022 to support up to 15 IMIs, with cost-share funding from federal and non-federal sources. Each IMI is expected to have significant economic impacts and address national and regional needs. The federal funding for institutes under the NNMI is determined by the opportunity size, technology maturity, and focus area scope. Each institute is expected to receive $70 million-$120 million in federal funds over five to seven years, with a total capitalization of $140 million to $240 million including non-federal co-investment. Cooperative agreements are likely to be the main funding mechanism, with significant co-investment support required. The institutes under the NNMI are required to demonstrate significant co-investment support from non-federal sources, including cash and in-kind contributions. These contributions must be tangible, meaningful, and substantial to show strong industry, regional, and local partnerships. Funding can come from various sources such as IMI revenues, institute members, state and local agencies, private donations, or other non-federal sources. Federal funding is expected to be larger initially and decrease after the first two to three years. The establishment of institutes under the NNMI requires significant co-investment from non-federal sources, including cash and in-kind contributions. Non-federal support is expected to be large at the time of award, primarily in the form of equipment and buildings. Institutes are expected to be sustainable within seven years through income-generating activities like membership fees and contract research. Competitive federal funds will be awarded among the institutes to encourage transition to sustainability. The funds for IMI projects are awarded competitively based on technical quality, prior performance, and industrial participation. Each IMI is to communicate best practices, coordinate with other institutes, focus on workforce development, and be led by independent institutions. The NNMI aims to coordinate efforts, share best practices, and impact the engineering workforce. The report outlines the governance and activities of an NNMI-wide Network Leadership Council, composed of representatives from IMIs, federal agencies, and other entities. The council oversees the development of consistent approaches for intellectual property, contracts, research metrics, and sharing best practices. IMIs are encouraged to collaborate, share resources, best practices, research results, funding models, and membership information transparently. Each IMI is to focus on component validation, system model or prototype demonstration, system prototype demonstration in an operational environment, and system completion and qualification. Activities may include applied research, development, and demonstration projects to reduce the cost and risk of new technologies in advanced manufacturing. The IMIs focus on developing skills and certifications for the manufacturing workforce, expanding educational opportunities, and enhancing supply chain capabilities. They also aim to reduce commercialization costs, address manufacturing challenges, and support start-up companies. The governance of the IMIs is outlined in the Preliminary Design report. The governance of the IMIs outlined in the Preliminary Design report emphasizes the need for a joint governance model to preserve the interests of industry, academia, and government stakeholders. IMIs are to have autonomy with an independent fiduciary board of directors and a leader for day-to-day operations. Proposals must detail decision-making methods for operations, membership, intellectual property, funding, and sustainability. Common policies will facilitate network operation, SME interaction, collaboration, and service sharing among institutes. The Obama Administration is laying the foundation for the NNMI, a network aimed at sharing services among manufacturing sectors. A pilot institute, NAMII, was established in FY2012, with plans for three more in FY2013. Common policies on intellectual property, research, operations, and marketing will be maintained within the network. President Obama announced the establishment of three new manufacturing innovation institutes in FY2013 using existing appropriations and the authorities of DOD and DOE. The first pilot institute, NAMII, was created in FY2012, with plans for additional institutes. DOD issued a BAA for an Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute as a proof-of-concept for future institutes within the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. The White House announced the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) as a revolutionary suite of manufacturing technologies for building parts in a layer-by-layer fashion. NAMII, led by NCDMM in Youngstown, OH, includes 40 companies, 9 research universities, 5 community colleges, and 11 non-profit organizations in the region. NAMII will receive $30 million in federal funding with an additional $39 million in cost share. The National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) will receive an additional $39 million in cost share, mostly from industry and the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Once established, it could potentially receive up to $15 million in federal funding for specific projects, bringing the total potential federal funding to $45 million. The lead agency for NAMII is the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy. Other agencies partnering with DOD to support NAMII include DOE, NASA, NSF, and NIST. In February 2012, President Obama announced plans to award three new manufacturing institutes using existing funds. Competitions were held for two DOD manufacturing institutes focused on Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation (DMDI) and Lightweight and Modern Metals Manufacturing Innovation (LM3I), as well as a DOE institute for Next Generation Power Electronics Manufacturing. In January 2014, the Next Generation Power Electronics Manufacturing Institute was awarded to a consortium led by North Carolina State University, supported by the DOE Advanced Manufacturing Office as part of the Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative (CEMI). The DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement is linked to the NNMI. The institute will focus on wide bandgap semiconductor power electronics device fabrication and manufacturing. DOE plans to provide $70 million in funding over five years. President Obama proposed funding for new CEMI Institutes in FY2014. The Department of Defense (DOD) is sponsoring the DMDI Institute, focusing on digital thread utilization for integrated manufacturing and design of complex products. Core technology areas include advanced manufacturing, intelligent machines, advanced analysis, and cyber-physical security. The Department of the Army issued a Request for Information (RFI) and a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the DMDI Institute. The DMDI Institute, led by UI Labs, focuses on integrated design and manufacturing of lightweight components for commercial and defense applications. Key areas of interest include production scale-up of innovative alloys, designing affordable metals, developing automated manufacturing processes, and enhancing materials knowledge and skills. The LM3I Institute, sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), focuses on developing tools and skills within the materials design and manufacturing workforce. President Obama announced the selection of a consortium of 60 companies, universities, nonprofits, and research labs to serve as the American Lightweight Materials Manufacturing Innovation Institute. President Obama announced the competition for the Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation Institute, sponsored by the Department of Energy, with a focus on advanced fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The institute will receive $70 million in funding to develop materials that are lighter and stronger than steel. The competition was announced in February 2014 with a closing date in April 2014, as part of the President's plan to launch six manufacturing centers, including the DMDI and the LM3I. The President's plan includes competitions for three additional centers this year. Bills were introduced in the House and Senate to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation. H.R. 2996 was approved by the House in September 2014, and S. 1468 was reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in August 2014. Provisions of H.R. 2996 were incorporated into the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. NIST is authorized $5 million per year for FY2015-FY2024, and DOE can transfer up to $250 million to NIST for advanced manufacturing research and development. The NSTC is required to produce a National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing, with a renewed call for the NNMI in President Obama's FY2014 budget seeking $1 billion in funding. H.R. 2996 and S. 1468 aim to improve US manufacturing competitiveness, stimulate innovation, facilitate technology transition, and provide access to infrastructure. The bills aim to establish a network of centers for manufacturing innovation to accelerate the development of an advanced manufacturing workforce, promote best practices, and reduce the cost and time of commercializing new technologies. The bills aim to establish a network of centers for manufacturing innovation to accelerate the development of an advanced manufacturing workforce, promote best practices, and reduce the cost and time of commercializing new technologies. This includes research and development of materials to solve industrial problems, education and training programs, supply chain integration, outreach to small and medium-sized enterprises, and other activities as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Commerce. The bill aims to establish a network of centers for manufacturing innovation, including various entities like career and technical education schools, federal laboratories, and businesses. It authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide financial assistance for planning and supporting these centers through a competitive selection process. Financial assistance is limited to seven years, and a National Office of the Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program is established to oversee the program. Centers must report annually on their expenditures and performance. The bill aims to establish centers for manufacturing innovation, requiring annual reports to Congress on program performance and triennial assessments by the Government Accountability Office. It authorizes a Network for Manufacturing Innovation Fund with $600 million in appropriations and designates specific manufacturing centers for innovation. The bill S. 1468 aims to establish centers for manufacturing innovation with $600 million in appropriations. It raises issues for Congress regarding the U.S. global competitive position in manufacturing. The U.S. global competitive position in manufacturing is debated, with some saying it is healthy and growing while others claim it is in decline. Factors such as increased globalization and efforts to facilitate trade lead companies to move production outside the U.S. to remain competitive. Some factors in the U.S. market burden manufacturing, while other nations offer incentives to attract U.S.-based companies. Experts argue that U.S. manufacturing capacity is declining as production moves overseas, leaving only a shell of a corporation in the U.S. Manufacturing strength relies on a critical mass of companies engaged in similar activities, creating synergy and increasing overall firm strength. The synergy in manufacturing clusters increases overall firm strength through factors like knowledge sharing and workforce talent attraction. Some fear that as U.S. firms move production overseas, this critical mass will be lost, leading to a decline in manufacturing employment and R&D activities relocating. This \"hollowing out\" may also impact the nation's military capabilities and manufacturing know-how. The federal government's role in supporting the competitive position of the U.S. manufacturing sector is debated. Some advocate for reducing costs and burdens on manufacturers, while others suggest increased federal funding for manufacturing R&D and subsidies for certain products. The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) is a priority for some, but questions remain about its potential duplication of other federal efforts. Some argue for subsidizing production of products with positive externalities to benefit the nation. The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) is debated, with some prioritizing its perceived benefits in advancing research discoveries, while others believe the private sector should take on this role. Some may question the NNMI's duplicative nature and its effectiveness in promoting innovation in the U.S. manufacturing sector. The program is compared to other federal initiatives like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, raising concerns about fragmentation in federal efforts to support manufacturers. The NNMI is distinguished by its large investment in each center, focus on manufacturability, industry leadership, significant industry co-investment, and emphasis on education and workforce training. Congress should consider the importance and effectiveness of these characteristics. Questions remain about the network's functions and the federal government's role. The Administration's FY2013 proposal and the January 2014 Preliminary Design report provided some information on the roles of the federal government in the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. Questions remain about the authorities and funding of the AMNPO in operating the network, as well as the federal government's role and funding after the initial funding is exhausted. Congress may need to explore the network's structure further. Congress may need to explore the structure, funding, and operation of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, including the roles of the federal government and the AMNPO. Questions remain about the form of the network, its functions, agencies involved, and funding sources. Considerations include whether the NNMI should be funded on a mandatory or discretionary basis, and how its performance should be reviewed and funded in the future. The Obama Administration has proposed $1 billion in one-time mandatory funding over nine years for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). Funding could be provided through either mandatory or discretionary means, with mandatory funding requiring offsets from other mandatory programs. Discretionary funding would necessitate cuts from other discretionary spending. Congress would have greater oversight and flexibility with annual appropriations, while mandatory funding would offer more certainty for future funding availability. The Obama Administration's budget request for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) includes $1 billion in one-time mandatory funding over nine years. The funding source is still under consideration, with potential cuts from other discretionary spending. There are differing opinions on the federal government's role in manufacturing-related innovation, particularly in terms of funding for applied research, development efforts, and demonstration projects. Supporters of later-stage federal investments argue that important benefits, such as economic, social, and national security gains, may only be achieved through applied research and development projects. These efforts are necessary due to the absence of market incentives for certain products or services, like drugs for rare diseases, which have positive externalities that companies may not consider in their decision-making. Some economists argue that private sector underinvestment in beneficial R&D may occur if companies do not consider the potential benefits in their decision-making. Public investment may be justified to encourage the development of technologies with shared costs and risks, ensuring U.S. leadership in critical industries. Critics argue that such efforts constitute an industrial policy. Opponents of public funding for R&D argue that it constitutes an industrial policy, distorting markets and capital flows. They believe government decisions are inefficient and can lead to corporate welfare, crony capitalism, and corruption. Some oppose efforts like the NNMI for these reasons. The NNMI faces opposition due to concerns about governmental corruption, fiscal constraints, and the challenge of retaining manufacturing activities in the US. The innovation process is complex, with potential barriers such as technical issues, market disconnect, and regulatory hurdles. US science and technology policy aims to address these challenges and promote the advancement of new ideas. The U.S. science and technology policy focuses on moving new ideas from the lab to the market, but companies now have more options to establish production facilities outside the U.S. The NNMI Preliminary Design report suggests that foreign organizations with U.S. R&D investments must commit to U.S.-based manufacturing for technologies from the institute. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of these requirements in ensuring NNMI technology and innovations. President Obama has proposed funding the NNMI through the National Institute of Standards and Technology with $1 billion over nine years. NIST would lead the initiative, collaborating with other agencies like DOD, DOE, and NSF. NIST has been pivotal in supporting U.S. manufacturing. NIST has played a crucial role in supporting U.S. manufacturing since its establishment in 1901. It has various programs like the Advanced Technology Program, Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, and Manufacturing Extension Partnership to assist U.S. firms. The Department of Defense is involved in the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), specifically awarding the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute. Congress may need to decide on a lead agency for NNMI and its governance structure. Considerations include whether to designate a lead agency or distribute responsibilities among multiple agencies, or provide flexibility to the Administration. Criteria for an institute to be self-sustaining must be met. The Obama Administration expects IMIs to be self-sustaining within seven years of their award date, but has not defined what self-sustaining means or outlined consequences for failure. IMIs may be eligible for funding from other federal programs, raising questions about the requirement for self-sustainability. Previous federal requirements for organizations to become self-sufficient have not always been successful. The Competitiveness Act of 1988 established the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, requiring centers to be self-sufficient within six years. Congress later amended the program to allow federal funding if centers receive a positive evaluation, but limited funding after the sixth year. Congress may need to consider legislative requirements for IMIs to become self-sufficient, the timeframe for achieving this, and consequences for failure. The NNMI would receive a one-time appropriation to be spent over nine years, but the federal government's role after this period is unclear. Congress should consider the government's involvement in sustaining the network and advancing technologies for manufacturing competitiveness. Rapid technological advances are transforming the manufacturing sector with innovations like grid computing and new modeling software. The use of software in design testing allows for cost reduction, increased safety, and new design possibilities in industries like automobile manufacturing. Companies like Ford utilize computer-simulated crash events before physical testing. New technologies and collaborative innovation models may enable low-cost, high-customization production and sharing of proprietary design processes. The potential impact of new technologies on industries, companies, and workers, as well as the competitive position of nations in manufacturing, should be considered by Congress when deciding on authorizing and funding the NNMI. The appropriate role of the federal government in advancing the U.S. position in manufacturing broadly should also be taken into account."
