Congress acknowledges the importance of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro) and the efforts of local and State governments in expanding Metrorail service. Future expansion opportunities include the Orange Line from Vienna to Centreville and the Blue Line from Franconia-Springfield to Prince William. Over 120,000 Federal employees rely on Metro for their daily commute. Metro plays a significant role in reducing traffic congestion and promoting environmental sustainability by taking 580,000 cars off the road daily, eliminating the need for 1,400 lane miles of highway, reducing gas consumption by 75 million gallons annually, and eliminating over 10,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. Additionally, Metrorail stations support transit-oriented development, which is crucial for preserving open space. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transit (VDRPT) completed a Major Investment Study that concluded a multimodal transportation strategy is needed for Interstate Route 66 from Interstate Route 495 to the Centreville and Haymarket communities, areas served by the proposed Orange Line extension. The Route 1 Multimodal Alternatives Analysis endorsed recommendations for transportation improvements in partnership with VDOT, VDRPT, Fairfax, and Prince William counties. The population in the areas served by proposed Metro extensions is expected to grow significantly by 2025, with a need for alternative transit concepts identified in Comprehensive Plans for Fairfax and Prince William counties. Military base realignments have also influenced transportation considerations. As a result of military base realignments, national defense-related jobs will shift from Crystal City to Fort Belvoir and Engineer Proving Ground in southern Fairfax. Department of Defense analysis shows employees are coming from points south and west, with additional job growth along Richmond Highway and Interstate 95 in Fairfax and Prince William counties. Expansion of Metro service in Northern Virginia is urgently needed to accommodate the regional transportation network. Expansion of transit service in Northern Virginia is crucial to accommodate projected growth and should be coordinated with local land use planning, including smart growth principles and transit-oriented development. Expansion of transit service in Northern Virginia is crucial to accommodate projected growth. New fixed guideway capital projects in Northern Virginia include extending the Metrorail Blue Line to Engineer Proving Ground and Interstate Route 95, extending the Orange Line to Centreville, and extending the Yellow Line to the Richmond Highway corridor in Fairfax and Prince William counties."
