    "content": "Chronic political instability in Pakistan raises concerns about the security of the country's nuclear weapons, with fears of terrorists obtaining them. U.S. officials express confidence in Pakistan's nuclear security measures. The collapse of the Pakistani government is seen as the most likely scenario for militants to acquire nuclear weapons. Gary Samore, then-National Security Council Coordinator, stated that Pakistan takes nuclear security seriously and has invested resources in securing their nuclear facilities. The Pakistani government is committed to maintaining control and security of its nuclear weapons despite internal and external stresses. Concerns arise due to broader tensions within Pakistani society, but efforts to improve nuclear security have been ongoing, including cooperation with the United States. The Pakistani government has been cooperating with the United States to improve nuclear security, providing insight into command and control of the arsenal. Efforts have been made to enhance export controls and monitor nuclear personnel following revelations of nuclear proliferation networks. Security challenges include maintaining command structure integrity, ensuring physical security, and preventing illicit proliferation. Concerns also exist about the risk of nuclear war with India. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal expansion and development of new weapons have raised international concerns about safety and security. The country's actions, including producing fissile material and deploying more delivery vehicles, indicate a growing nuclearization of its national security policy. This has sparked worries about the potential for intentional use of nuclear weapons. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal expansion and development of new weapons have raised concerns about potential intentional use of nuclear weapons in a crisis or limited warfare with India. The decision to pursue nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is driven by their troubled bilateral relationship, threat assessments, perceptions of national power, and domestic politics. International pressure has had little impact on their attitudes towards nuclear weapons. Islamabad is expanding its nuclear arsenal and developing new weapons. Pakistan is expanding its nuclear arsenal and developing new types of weapons, raising concerns about the pace and scope of its missile program. The United States is worried about the potential for nuclear use in a conventional conflict in Southwest Asia and the risks associated with Pakistan's evolving doctrine on tactical nuclear weapons. Pakistan's nuclear energy program began in the 1950s, with a secret nuclear weapons program initiated in 1972 after India's 1974 nuclear explosion. Pakistan produced fissile material using gas-centrifuge technology by the mid-1980s. Islamabad obtained uranium enrichment technology from Europe and China to enhance the concentration of uranium-235 for its nuclear weapons program. China provided critical assistance in the production of Pakistan's nuclear facilities, including a plutonium production reactor and ring magnets for the enrichment program. There are reports suggesting that Pakistan procured components for its enrichment program from foreign entities. Pakistan obtained uranium enrichment technology from foreign entities, including Europe and China, to advance its nuclear weapons program. A.Q. Khan confirmed that uranium enrichment began in 1978, leading to the production of highly enriched uranium (HEU) by 1983. Despite initially pledging to produce only low-enriched uranium, Pakistan was found to have enough HEU for nuclear devices by 1986. The main enrichment facility is located at Kahuta, with the capacity to produce one bomb per year as of 1987. Pakistan has multiple enrichment sites, including the Khushab plutonium production reactor and additional heavy-water reactors under construction. There are reprocessing plants at PINSTECH and Chasma, with plans for more facilities. Pakistan was pursuing nuclear weapons designs in the 1970s and 1980s, with estimates that it would take \"at least\" three to five years to produce a nuclear explosive device. By 1991, Pakistan had a viable nuclear weapons design and components to assemble nuclear devices quickly. Pakistan acquired the capability to assemble nuclear devices on short notice by the end of the 1980s. A.Q. Khan stated that Islamabad attained this capability in 1984, and senior Pakistani officials confirmed reaching the nuclear 'threshold' by 1984-85. Former SPD official Feroz Khan mentioned that Pakistan had a nuclear device suitable for testing by the end of 1984. Pakistan's nuclear capability was not yet operational in 1999, despite testing nuclear explosive devices the previous year. President Bush's failure to certify in 1990 led to a cut-off in military and financial aid. Pakistan responded to India's nuclear tests in 1998 with six tests in western Pakistan, with test yields of about 10 kilotons and 5 kilotons. Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998 in response to India's tests, with yields of about 10 and 5 kilotons. The tests aimed to demonstrate the credibility of Pakistan's nuclear deterrent. The United States imposed sanctions, later lifted after 9/11. Pakistan is estimated to have 110-130 nuclear weapons and has produced significant amounts of weapons-grade HEU and plutonium. Islamabad continues to produce both materials for nuclear weapons. Pakistan continues to produce HEU and plutonium for nuclear weapons, with a variety of weapon types including large ones for fighter jets, small ones for ballistic missiles, and even smaller warheads for cruise missiles and tactical nuclear weapons. The country has achieved survivability through a second strike capability, utilizing hard and deeply buried storage and launch facilities, deploying road-mobile missiles, air defenses around strategic sites, and concealment measures. Pakistan has aircraft and land-based missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including F-16 fighter aircraft modified for this purpose. The United States sold and delivered 18 F-16s to Pakistan, with the possibility of more sales in the future. John Hillen informed Congress in July 2006 that transferred F-16s to Pakistan would not have nuclear capabilities. Despite the potential for modification, U.S. monitoring and leverage would prevent Pakistan from carrying out such conversions. The State Department approved the sale of eight additional F-16s to Pakistan in February 2016, with Mirage V aircraft potentially used as delivery vehicles. Pakistan is developing new missile systems to strike targets at ranges of 200-2000 kilometers with both conventional and nuclear payloads. Pakistan continues to develop and upgrade their nuclear delivery systems for a full range of platforms, including ballistic and cruise missiles. Islamabad has various types of nuclear-capable road-mobile ballistic missiles with different ranges. Pakistan has tested multiple nuclear-capable ballistic missiles with varying ranges, including the Shaheen-1A (900 km), Shaheen-3 (2,750 km), and Hatf-II (Abdali) (180 km). These missiles are designed to deter India from using strategic bases for a second strike capability. Pakistan has tested short-range NASR ballistic missile and is developing nuclear-capable cruise missiles Babur and Ra'ad with estimated ranges of 350 kilometers. Pakistan reacted to India's nuclear-powered submarine launch by emphasizing the need to maintain strategic balance in South Asia without entering an arms race. India is also developing its own military capabilities. India and Pakistan are both developing their military capabilities to safeguard security and maintain strategic balance in South Asia. Pakistan is focusing on developing short-range nuclear weapons, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles and tactical nuclear weapons. India is also enhancing its military capabilities, including the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Pakistan conducted the first successful flight test of the Hatf IX (NASR), a road-mobile missile with a range of 60 kilometers carrying nuclear warheads. These tactical nuclear weapons have not been deployed yet, raising concerns about the risk of nuclear conflict with India. Pakistan's strategic posture is influenced by its perception of the threat from India. Pakistan's nuclear posture is driven by the India-Pakistan rivalry, with Islamabad seeking to expand its nuclear infrastructure and stockpiles. They have a doctrine of \"credible minimum deterrence\" and have not ruled out first-use against a nuclear-armed aggressor. Pakistani officials have outlined four policy objectives for their nuclear weapons, aiming to deter aggression, counterforce strategies, and stabilize deterrence in South Asia. Pakistan's nuclear posture aims to preserve territorial integrity against Indian attack, prevent military escalation, and counter India's conventional superiority. Pakistani officials emphasize that their nuclear arsenal is solely for deterring Indian aggression and maintaining regional stability in South Asia. Despite their desire to avoid a nuclear arms race, they have not ruled out first-use against a nuclear-armed aggressor. Pakistan is increasing its nuclear capabilities for deterrence against India, despite wanting to avoid an arms race. The concept of credible minimum deterrence has evolved over time, with ambiguity in defining specific requirements. Pakistani officials argue that various nuclear arsenals could meet deterrence needs, with the exact number of weapons remaining dynamic. Pakistan's nuclear program has evolved from credible minimum deterrence to full spectrum deterrence in response to India's military build-up and pursuit of missile defense systems. General Kidwai highlighted the need for qualitative and quantitative adjustments to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal due to Indian military doctrines advocating rapid conventional military action against Pakistan. The exact number of nuclear weapons required for deterrence is considered dynamic and cannot be quantified. Pakistani officials believe that introducing tactical nuclear weapons increases the credibility of their nuclear deterrent against Indian military operations. General Kidwai emphasized the importance of the NASR missile test in consolidating Pakistan's strategic deterrence capability. Some observers are concerned that Pakistan's introduction of tactical nuclear weapons could heighten the risk of nuclear conflict with India. There are fears that Pakistani military commanders may lose control over these more portable weapons, leading to potential preemptive strikes by Indian forces. Pakistani officials argue that maintaining ambiguity about their no-first-use policy is necessary to deter India's conventional superiority. Some analysts believe that Pakistan's nuclear threshold may be lowered by disturbing the balance with India. Pakistani officials have indicated a high threshold for nuclear weapon use, stating it would be a last resort. There are concerns about the need to increase Pakistan's nuclear arsenal in response to potential Indian plans. Pakistani officials have expressed concerns about the 2008 U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement. The National Command Authority (NCA) expressed concern about the 2008 U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement potentially favoring India over Pakistan. They suggested that Islamabad may need to enhance its nuclear arsenal to maintain credible defense deterrence. The NCA also highlighted India's acquisition of advanced weapons systems and missile defense, as well as the impact of the Nuclear Suppliers Group's decision to exempt India from export guidelines. This could enable India to produce more fissile material for nuclear weapons. Pakistan could potentially increase its nuclear weapons in response to India's acquisition of advanced weapons systems and missile defense. India's access to the international uranium market has resulted in more indigenous uranium available for weapons, as it will not be consumed by safeguarded reactors. This raises concerns for Pakistan, especially with India's stockpile of reactor-grade plutonium. Pakistan is concerned about India's nuclear weapons program, as India has access to more uranium for weapons due to its safeguarded reactors. Estimates suggest that India could potentially produce 280 nuclear weapons annually. Pakistan's intentions to increase its nuclear arsenal are unclear, with General Kidwai stating that the program is not open-ended. Pakistan does not see the need to develop longer-range missiles beyond what it currently possesses. Pakistan has no intention to develop longer-range missiles beyond its current capabilities, as it aims to deter Indian conventional attacks. Despite its growing nuclear arsenal, Pakistan has committed to not be the first in the region to resume nuclear testing and would sign the CTBT if India does the same. Islamabad maintains strict command and control over its nuclear weapons through the National Command Authority (NCA) and Strategic Command Organization. The National Command Authority (NCA) in Pakistan, established in 2000, oversees all organizations involved in nuclear weapons research and development. General Kidwai stated that the NCA and Strategic Plans Division (SPD) have operational control over Pakistan's nuclear weapons, with the prime minister as the chairperson. The NCA includes key officials like the joint chiefs of staff, defense ministers, and military commanders. The National Command Authority (NCA) in Pakistan, established in 2000, oversees all organizations involved in nuclear weapons research and development. The NCA requires consensus for launching a nuclear strike, with the chairperson having the final vote. It consists of two committees, the Employment Control Committee (ECC) and the Development Control Committee (DCC), which have civilian and military officials. The ECC establishes command and control over nuclear weapons, while the DCC controls strategic organizations and modernization of nuclear weapons. The NCA also has a Strategic Command and Control Support System for round-the-clock situational awareness. The Strategic Plans Division (SPD) in Pakistan, under the National Command Authority (NCA), formulates nuclear policy, strategy, and doctrine. It coordinates operational plans with the Army, Air Force, and Navy's strategic force commands. Islamabad requires multiple people to authenticate launch codes for nuclear weapons. The National Command Authority Act, 2010, addresses nuclear expertise proliferation. The National Command Authority Act, 2010, addresses nuclear expertise proliferation and personnel reliability, outlining punishable offenses for breach of confidentiality. The SPD has authority to investigate suspicious conduct, with penalties of up to 25 years imprisonment for offenders. Pakistani officials cite concerns about India's nuclear arsenal expansion as a reason for not supporting negotiations on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament. Pakistan, a key opponent to negotiations on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, argues that the treaty should not only ban new material production but also require states to reduce existing stocks. Islamabad is concerned about India's larger stockpile and production capability, which it believes puts Pakistan at a disadvantage. Pakistan opposes negotiations on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, arguing that it should ban new material production and require states to reduce existing stocks. Islamabad is concerned about New Delhi's larger fissile material stocks and production capability. Islamabad believes that the treaty's scope should be determined before negotiations begin. Pakistani nuclear weapons are stored in component form, with fissile cores separated from non-nuclear explosives at different locations. The 2001 Defense Department report states that Pakistan can assemble its nuclear weapons quickly. Separate storage provides protection but may make it easier for unauthorized access. President Musharraf ordered the redeployment of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal to secret locations amid uncertainty about U.S.-Pakistan relations. During uncertain times, Pakistan's leadership feared US military strikes on its nuclear assets if it didn't assist against the Taliban. President Musharraf highlighted protecting Pakistan's nuclear assets as a reason for policy changes. The 1999 Kargil crisis, 2002 conflict with India, and A.Q. Khan network revelations led to reforms for nuclear security. Despite high alert levels in 2001 and 2002, there were no reports of Pakistan mating warheads with delivery systems. Some observers expressed concern about the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal due to political instability. Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and experts warned that control of the arsenal could weaken during periods of turbulence. U.S. military officials also worried about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons, fearing technology could be sold off by insiders during a crisis. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen expressed U.S. concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons, emphasizing the importance of stable control to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists. U.S. officials have acknowledged limited knowledge of Pakistan's arsenal. U.S. officials have limited knowledge of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal but express confidence in Islamabad's security measures. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Stewart noted Pakistan's efforts to enhance nuclear security and awareness of extremist threats. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also expressed confidence in Pakistan's professional security force. Pakistan's professional security force is highly prioritized for nuclear security, with Washington expressing confidence in their capabilities. Measures taken by the government and military have reduced the likelihood of terrorists obtaining nuclear materials. U.S. officials acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to enhance nuclear security and awareness of extremist threats. International Security Rose Gottemoeller expressed confidence in the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, but raised concerns about the safety of their \"battlefield nuclear weapons.\" Other officials, including Indian National Security Adviser M. K. Narayanan and French Director Erard Corbin de Mangoux, have also commented on the security measures in place for Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Civilian leaders have a \"sense of responsibility\" to maintain control over Pakistan's nuclear weapons for international status. Russian and Indian officials have expressed concerns about the security of Pakistan's arsenal, while Pakistani officials remain confident in its security. Musharraf stated in 2007 that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are under \"total custodial controls.\" Pakistan's nuclear security regime, as stated in the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit, is based on multi-layered defense with a Special Response Force, integrated intelligence system, and force validation exercises. The Security Division has over 25,000 personnel and a Centre of Excellence on Nuclear Security for education and training in various security areas. Pakistan's nuclear security regime includes protection, material control, transport security, cyber security, and personnel reliability. The government is a party to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Prime Minister Gilani assured that the country's strategic assets are well protected. Concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons were raised after the 2011 U.S. strike that killed Osama bin Laden. The security could also be jeopardized by a conflict with India. Michael Krepon argued that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan could lead to an increased risk of accidents and the use of nuclear weapons. Pakistan's nuclear deterrent readiness rises during times of heightened tensions with India, necessitating movement of launchers and weapons to avoid being targeted. This movement makes the weapons less secure and more vulnerable to insider threats and accidents, putting stress on the army's unity of command. Islamabad faces a dilemma due to the less-dispersed nature of its nuclear assets. During times of heightened tensions with India, Pakistan's nuclear deterrent readiness increases, leading to movement of launchers and weapons to avoid being targeted. This movement makes the weapons less secure and vulnerable to insider threats and accidents, stressing the army's unity of command. Islamabad faces a dilemma as less-dispersed nuclear weapons may be more vulnerable to a disarming military strike from India. Secretary Rice acknowledged the risk of a radical Islamic coup in Islamabad and stated that the United States had plans to secure Pakistani nuclear weapons in such an event. Pakistan Foreign Office emphasized that Islamabad's nuclear weapons are under strong multi-layered decision-making and organizational control. Pakistan's nuclear weapons have been under strong multi-layered control since 1998. The issue of U.S. contingency plans to secure Pakistani strategic assets was raised after Benazir Bhutto's assassination, but Pakistan stated they do not require foreign assistance. Secretary of Defense Gates confirmed in January 2010 that the United States had plans to secure Pakistani nuclear weapons in case of a radical Islamic coup. The United States has offered nuclear security assistance to Pakistan since 2001, focusing on best practices, technical measures, and physical security of nuclear weapons. Islamabad requires multiple authentications for launch codes and has a 10,000-member security force overseeing nuclear sites. Former Pakistani military officials mention the development of Permissive Action Links (PALs) for warheads. Pakistan has developed Permissive Action Links (PALs) for its warheads without U.S. assistance, ensuring security through code authentication. Former U.S. officials have acknowledged American support in securing Pakistani nuclear weapons, emphasizing the effectiveness of their security mechanisms. Despite limited transparency in how U.S. funds are utilized, observers believe Pakistan's nuclear weapons are well-guarded. Pakistan has some transparency into how Islamabad spends U.S. funds, with a Pakistani official stating they reserve the right to choose nuclear security measures. The extent of information sharing about Pakistan's nuclear arsenal with the U.S. is unclear, with conflicting statements from officials. Pakistan has some rudimentary equipment and training from the U.S. but considers access to its nuclear facilities a \"red line.\" The U.S. has offered assistance to secure radioactive materials and ship out highly enriched uranium from Pakistan. There are concerns about the security of spent fuel from Pakistani nuclear power plants. Pakistani officials are confident in the security of their nuclear facilities and have no plans to transport spent fuel. The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority has a Nuclear Security Action Plan that follows IAEA standards. Concerns persist about the potential for proliferation networks to obtain nuclear weapons material or expertise from Pakistan. Pakistan used clandestine procurement networks in the 1970s to obtain technology for its nuclear weapons program. A.Q. Khan directed this procurement and later supplied designs and materials related to uranium enrichment to Libya, North Korea, and Iran. The current status of Pakistan's nuclear export network is unclear, but it has been significantly damaged according to U.S. reports. The A.Q. Khan network, responsible for nuclear proliferation, has been significantly dismantled according to U.S. reports. However, there are concerns that some elements may still exist in Pakistan. The A.Q. Khan network, responsible for nuclear proliferation, has been significantly dismantled according to U.S. reports. Some of Khan's associates may have escaped law enforcement attention and could resume their black-market business. Sanctions were imposed on individuals and companies involved in the network under various laws and executive orders. The Pakistani government considers the Khan investigation closed, but the network is still being monitored for any potential resurgence. The A.Q. Khan network, responsible for nuclear proliferation, has been significantly dismantled according to U.S. reports. The 2013 report stated that there is no indication of the Pakistani government supplying nuclear weapons-related materials since the network was shut down in 2004. Islamabad has cooperated with the IAEA's investigation of Iran's nuclear program, with Khan answering questions through secret channels. The United States obtained information about the Khan network without direct access to A.Q. Khan. Al-Qaeda sought nuclear weapons assistance from the network but received limited help from other groups in Pakistan. Retired Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission scientists and Islamic fundamentalists may have provided assistance to al-Qaeda through the Umma Tameer-e Nau (UTN) organization related to weapons of mass destruction. Details are scarce on the extent of the transfers following the September 11, 2001, attacks. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Mahmood and Majeed met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan to discuss nuclear weapons infrastructure and bomb design. Mahmood, known for his radical views, was detained by Pakistani authorities after the US briefed them on UTN's work with al-Qaeda on biological weapons. After interrogations and searches in Afghanistan, UTN's collaboration with al-Qaeda on biological and nuclear weapons technology was exposed. Pakistani government did not press charges but placed the scientists under house arrest in 2002. This incident highlighted the \"insider threat\" and prompted changes in Pakistani security policy. Concerns were raised about other groups providing nuclear expertise to terrorists. The Bush Administration urged Pakistan to prevent the reemergence of such networks. Pakistan has since increased efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Pakistan has increased efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation, with Ambassador Olson noting progress in nonproliferation efforts. Islamabad has implemented new national export controls legislation to prevent further proliferation of nuclear-related technologies and materials. Pakistan has revised its export control lists in 2011 and 2015 to align with multilateral export control regimes. The 2015 revisions cover the scope of export controls maintained by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime. The legislation also includes a catch-all clause for exporters to notify the government of any suspicions regarding the use of goods or technology in nuclear, biological weapons, or missiles. Pakistan has implemented legislation to prevent the misuse of goods or technology for nuclear, biological weapons, or missiles. The legislation includes end-use and end-user certification requirements, penalties for violators, and the establishment of the SECDIV and Oversight Board. Pakistan has also taken steps to improve nuclear security, such as implementing a National Security Action Plan with IAEA assistance and joining the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. The December 2007 National Command Authority Ordinance includes measures to prevent nuclear terrorism by improving personnel reliability and controlling nuclear expertise in Pakistan. Despite efforts to enhance security clearance procedures, more improvements are needed according to officials. Concerns have been raised about Pakistan's ability to vet security personnel properly, highlighted by the shooting of the governor of Punjab province in January 2011. The United States has provided export control assistance to Pakistan. Pakistan received export control assistance from the United States, with efforts described in testimonies and reports. The country views nuclear power as crucial for economic development and energy security, currently generating 5% of its power from nuclear energy. Plans are in place to increase nuclear energy production significantly by 2030 and 2050. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission oversees nuclear research and development. Pakistan aims to increase nuclear energy production significantly by 2030 and 2050. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission oversees nuclear R&D and operates three civilian power reactors under IAEA safeguards. Additional reactors are being constructed at various sites with assistance from China. Plans for further expansion include the construction of new reactors in central Pakistan. China's construction of Chasma-3 and -4 nuclear reactors in Pakistan has raised concerns among U.S. officials and NSG members due to potential violations of NSG guidelines. The contracts for these reactors were initiated in response to the U.S.-India Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, but China's argument of grandfathered contracts is disputed by NSG Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman. The NSG did not agree to grandfather any additional reactors beyond Chasma-1 and -2, which were initiated before China joined the NSG in 2004. The NSG changed guidelines in 2008 to allow nuclear trade with India but not Pakistan. China plans to sell nuclear reactors to Pakistan. Pakistan operates two research reactors, one converted from highly-enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium fuel. Legislation authorizes U.S. assistance to Pakistan related to its nuclear weapons program. The legislation passed on October 15, 2009 authorizes various forms of U.S. assistance to Pakistan, including support for democratic institutions, law enforcement, economic development, education, human rights, and healthcare. The President must certify Pakistan's cooperation in efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons-related supplier networks. A Semi-Annual Monitoring Report is required to assess Pakistan's nuclear non-proliferation efforts and determine if U.S. assistance has indirectly aided Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. The Joint Explanatory Statement clarified that the legislation does not compromise Pakistan's sovereignty or national security interests. It also highlighted the reporting requirements for nuclear nonproliferation cooperation to assess the effectiveness of U.S. funds and Pakistan's efforts in advancing mutual goals. The U.S. government has taken steps to advance mutual interests with Pakistan in countering extremism and nuclear proliferation, while ensuring no interference in Pakistani internal affairs. Certain U.S. funds to Pakistan require certification that they are preventing nuclear proliferation, with waiver provisions available. Pakistani officials have shown interest in a nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S., subject to congressional approval. Pakistan has expressed interest in joining the NSG, citing its qualifications and potential as a civil nuclear goods exporter. Islamabad argues that exclusion from the NSG would impact regional peace and global non-proliferation efforts. The U.S. could potentially support Pakistan's NSG membership. The United States could potentially support Pakistan's NSG membership in exchange for actions to reduce nuclear weapons program risks. The United States could potentially support Pakistan's NSG membership in exchange for actions to reduce nuclear weapons program risks. Pakistan and the US have discussed Pakistan's NSG membership and concerns about its nuclear arsenal, but no agreement has been reached. Pakistan stated it cannot take unilateral steps not matched by India. The US stated that any country can apply for NSG membership, and it will be considered based on a consensus decision."
