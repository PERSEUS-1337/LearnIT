    "content": "The Administrator of the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone and PM in July 1997, sparking debate over the standards' stringency and health protection. Litigation led to a Supreme Court ruling in 2001 upholding NAAQS setting procedures and rejecting cost considerations. However, questions arose regarding the implementation of the new ozone standard. The EPA's new ozone standard sparked controversy and may lead to Congress amending the Clean Air Act. The decisionmaking process for NAAQS may be revisited, focusing on scientific evidence and cost considerations. This report provides background on setting and revising NAAQS to aid understanding. The process of setting and revising NAAQS under the Clean Air Act evolved over many years, initially focusing on federal support for state programs and research efforts. The EPA's decision-making process for ozone and PM NAAQS is not evaluated in this report, which aims to aid understanding of the Act's policy for NAAQS. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 expanded the federal role in controlling air pollution, leading to the creation of the EPA. The federal government became responsible for establishing national ambient air quality standards, while states were tasked with developing implementation plans to meet those standards. Subsequent amendments in 1977 and 1990 further refined the NAAQS setting and implementation process. The 1977 amendments established the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and the 5-year review process for setting and revising NAAQS. The 1990 amendments increased federal guidance to states in implementing existing NAAQS. The process for setting and revising NAAQS consists of statutory steps incorporated in the Clean Air Act over a series of amendments, along with additional steps added by the EPA, executive orders, and regulatory reform enactments by Congress. The pollutants for which NAAQS are set are often called \"criteria pollutants.\" The Air Quality Act of 1967 required the Federal government to list air pollutants and prepare \"criteria\" reports summarizing their health effects. The Clean Air Act later specified the listing of \"criteria\" air pollutants based on their impact on public health and welfare. The Clean Air Act of 1970 gave the EPA authority to set national ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants. These pollutants include particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and lead. The EPA can assist states in meeting these standards and impose sanctions for non-compliance. The Clean Air Act of 1970 authorized the EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants, including particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and lead. These standards aim to protect public health and welfare by setting maximum permissible concentrations of pollutants in the ambient air. The Act includes primary standards for health protection and secondary standards for welfare protection. The Clean Air Act of 1970 authorized the EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants to protect public health. A NAAQS defines acceptable pollutant concentrations in ambient air to safeguard health. Compliance designates areas as \"attainment\" or \"nonattainment.\" Primary standards prioritize health protection without considering costs. The Clean Air Act of 1970 authorizes the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants to protect public health. Compliance designates areas as \"attainment\" or \"nonattainment.\" The Act outlines the process for implementation, including monitoring air quality, state implementation plans, and federal measures like new source performance standards and mobile source emission standards. In attainment areas, a program is established to maintain air quality above NAAQS. The Clean Air Act of 1970 authorizes the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants to protect public health. In attainment areas, a program is established to maintain clean air quality above NAAQS by considering margins of safety. Margins of safety are crucial for providing protection against hazards that research has not yet identified. The phrase \"margin of safety\" has been central to debates regarding NAAQS thresholds. The Administrator determines the \"no effect\" threshold for pollutants based on scientific evidence and adds a safety factor to establish a margin of safety. Scientists find no clear thresholds for air pollutants, suggesting a need for tighter standards to provide a larger margin of safety. The inability of scientists to find a threshold for adverse health effects from pollutants has led to contention in setting NAAQS standards. Some argue that without a threshold, the whole process becomes a risk management decision, while others advocate for the tightest possible standards. The debate over setting NAAQS standards includes arguments for the tightest possible standards and concerns about the \"margin of safety\" phrase potentially endorsing cost considerations. The legislative history of the Clean Air Act briefly touches on the \"margin of safety\" phrase. The \"margin of safety\" in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 is designed to protect against adverse effects at pollutant concentrations below harmful levels. The House Report 95-294 suggests greater control of emissions may be necessary due to the lack of evidence for thresholds. The precautionary premise of the act is evident in the emphasis on the \"margin of safety.\" The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 emphasize the \"margin of safety\" to protect against adverse effects from pollutant concentrations below harmful levels. The national secondary ambient air quality standard specifies the level necessary to safeguard public welfare from known or anticipated adverse effects. This includes effects on various aspects such as soils, water, crops, wildlife, visibility, property damage, economic values, and personal well-being. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 prioritize protecting public welfare from adverse effects of air pollutants. Secondary NAAQS are set to safeguard against harm to various aspects like soils, water, wildlife, and personal well-being. The process for setting NAAQS involves regular review every 5 years based on the most recent scientific information. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 prioritize protecting public welfare from adverse effects of air pollutants by setting NAAQS to safeguard against harm to various aspects. The process for setting NAAQS involves the preparation of a \"criteria document\" summarizing scientific information, review by an independent scientific committee, and the use of criteria by the Administrator in deciding on the final standard. Additionally, there is a requirement for a \"staff paper\" summarizing the criteria document and laying out policy options, as well as a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) mandated by Executive Order 12866. Regulatory assessment requirements in law also impact the process but have limited substantive impact on the decision itself. The \"criteria document\" is essential for setting NAAQS under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970. It represents scientific knowledge on the effects of pollutants on various aspects. Criteria are used to develop air quality standards, with criteria being descriptive while standards are regulatory. Air quality criteria are descriptive and reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the effects of pollutants on public health. The \"criteria document\" is crucial for setting NAAQS under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970. The preparation, review, and use of the \"criteria document\" for setting NAAQS under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 is objective and scientifically validated. The document is peer-reviewed by an advisory committee and federal departments, with much of the process open to the public. The final criteria document is prepared by EPA scientists and includes information on the effects of pollutants on public health. The criteria document for setting NAAQS under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 involves assessing effects of pollutants on public health through various studies like epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies. These studies are peer-reviewed and published in open literature, with criteria documents being extensive evaluations of scientific evidence. The 1996 PM criteria document evaluates numerous studies over 2,400 pages, taking about two years to complete. A staff paper is then prepared to bridge the gap between scientific review and setting ambient standards for particulate matter. This paper identifies key conclusions and uncertainties for consideration in selecting pollutant indicators, forms, averaging times, and levels for health and welfare standards. The staff paper prepared by the Office of Air and Radiation outlines options for NAAQS standards, including setting levels and compliance measures. It is reviewed by a scientific advisory committee and an independent clean air scientific review committee is appointed by the Administrator. The scientific advisory committee advises the Administrator on national ambient air quality standards, research needs, sources of air pollution, and potential impacts of strategies for meeting standards. The 1967 Air Quality Act required consultation with advisory committees when preparing criteria documents. A National Air Quality Criteria Advisory Committee was established with broad representation. In 1977, specific requirements created CASAC to review the scientific basis of NAAQS decisions. CASAC was intended to be independent. The CASAC, established in 1977, is intended to have complete independence to evaluate pollutants' impact on public health and the environment. The seven-member CASAC creates panels to review NAAQS, with expert consultants ensuring comprehensive assessment. Panel members meet to review criteria documents and staff papers, recommending improvements before signing off. The CASAC panel ensures independence in evaluating pollutants' impact on public health and the environment. Panel members review criteria documents and staff papers, recommending improvements before signing off. The closure documents become part of the record for rulemaking, aiding regulatory decision-making. The CASAC panel reviews criteria documents and staff papers to evaluate pollutants' impact on public health and the environment. The closure letters confirm that the documents provide an adequate scientific basis for regulatory decisions on ozone and related photochemical oxidants. The CASAC panel evaluates criteria documents and staff papers to assess pollutants' effects on public health and the environment, providing a scientific basis for regulatory decisions on ozone. EPA's interpretation of the criteria has faced challenges, including litigation on a different part of the Clean Air Act. One key issue arose from litigation concerning the Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1977, leading to amendments clarifying provisions related to NAAQS. The landmark case Ethyl Corp. v. EPA challenged the Administrator's regulation of lead in fuels under \u00a7 211 of the CAA. The court ruled that the Administrator had to show actual harm, not just the threat of harm, to justify the standard. The initial decision was vacated, but on rehearing en banc, the full court upheld the regulations on a 5-4 vote, stating that \u00a7211 sets a precautionary standard. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act addressed issues raised by the Ethyl Corp. v. EPA case, including whether the Administrator could act preventatively, assess risks, consider cumulative risk, apply different standards of proof, and protect public health. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act addressed issues raised by the Ethyl Corp. v. EPA case, including the Administrator's ability to act preventatively, assess risks, consider cumulative risk, apply different standards of proof, and protect public health by using a standardized basis for future rulemaking. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act emphasized preventative measures, authorized risk assessment and future trend projections, considered cumulative impacts of pollutants, provided a standardized basis for regulation, and aimed to protect public health. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for a standard of proof in regulating air pollutants, ensuring the health of susceptible individuals, acknowledging uncertainties in data, and granting the Administrator authority to make judgment calls. This is in line with the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act, which focused on preventative measures, risk assessment, and protecting public health. The curr_chunk discusses the Administrator's authority to make judgment calls based on criteria outlined in the Clean Air Act, ensuring air quality criteria reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the effects of pollutants on public health and welfare. The language emphasizes the need for reasoned decision-making and prohibits speculative judgments. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria agencies must consider when regulating air pollutants to protect public health and welfare. Decisions must be based on scientific, technical, and economic information. The evidence for NAAQS decisions is found in criteria documents, staff papers, CASAC letters, and public comments. Regulatory Impact Analysis provides additional information. E.O. 12866 directs agencies to make decisions based on the best available information. The CAA specifies health protection as the criterion for setting the primary NAAQS. The Administrator must consider crucial policy issues such as defining whose health to protect, adverse health impacts, evaluating exposure and risk, and providing an adequate margin of safety. The statute and legislative history offer guidance on these considerations. The Senate Report on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 provides guidance on whose health should be protected by national ambient air quality standards, emphasizing the need for standards to protect sensitive populations. The Senate Report on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 emphasizes the need for ambient air quality standards to protect sensitive populations such as bronchial asthmatics and emphysematics. The standards should be based on a representative sample of persons in sensitive groups rather than a single individual. The goal is to ensure that ambient air quality does not have adverse effects on the health of these individuals. The Clean Air Act amendments focus on ensuring that the health of susceptible individuals, including bronchial asthmatics and emphysematics, is encompassed in the term 'public health'. The Act does not define adverse health effects, as attempting to specify them could hinder the identification of unanticipated effects. Most air pollutants impact public health in multiple ways, requiring the EPA to consider all factors before setting or revising air quality standards. Before setting or revising air quality standards, the EPA must have all relevant scientific information on the health effects of pollutants. Primary NAAQS protect health, while secondary NAAQS protect welfare, including personal comfort. Hazardous air pollutants may cause an increase in mortality or serious illness, indicating health effects. Exposure evaluation and risk assessment are crucial in determining adverse health effects of pollutants. The committee emphasizes the precautionary approach by considering potential harm before it occurs. The concept of endangerment to health is retained, with added emphasis on the words 'may reasonably be anticipated'. The committee emphasizes the precautionary approach in exposure evaluation and risk assessment, considering all sources of contaminants contributing to air pollution and sources of exposure to determine health risks. The Administrator may set NAAQS in \"reasonable\" anticipation of public health endangerment, allowing a \"weight of evidence\" approach to be used. The EPA uses a \"weight of evidence\" approach to set NAAQS, without needing to prove immediate health effects or direct causation by air pollutants. The margin of safety requirement addresses uncertainties and provides protection against unidentified hazards. The EPA sets NAAQS using a \"weight of evidence\" approach, considering uncertainties and providing protection against unidentified hazards. The Administrator selects primary standards with a margin of safety to prevent harmful pollution levels and lower levels that may pose an unacceptable risk of harm. Factors like health effects, sensitive populations, and uncertainties are considered in determining the margin of safety. The \"margin of safety\" requirement allows the Administrator to consider uncertainties and policy choices in setting NAAQS levels to protect public health. EPA's view is that this margin of safety factor accounts for dimensions of the decision that scientific data cannot resolve, as supported by the Courts. The NAAQS is set at a level deemed necessary to protect public health with a margin of safety, considering scientific uncertainties. The debate on whether costs should be considered in setting NAAQS has been ongoing. The National Commission on Air Quality stated that economic factors are not taken into account in setting national ambient air quality standards. The costs of complying with national air quality standards can impact the level of protection provided, with high costs in heavily polluted areas potentially leading to less protective standards. Balancing health benefits and costs is more effective at a local level than with national standards. Considerations of technology and economic feasibility were deferred in the setting of NAAQS, prioritizing health protection. Considerations of technology and economic feasibility should not be used to compromise public health and welfare when developing air quality plans. Senator Muskie emphasized the importance of prioritizing health standards over costs in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970. The proposed legislation prioritizes public health over economic considerations in setting National Air Quality Standards. The D.C. Circuit Court's decision clarified that economic factors should not influence the establishment of ambient air quality standards. The Administrator is not to consider economic or technological feasibility in setting air quality standards, as Congress prioritized health goals over such concerns. The EPA's position that costs should not be considered in setting NAAQS was challenged in court. The D.C. Circuit Court and Supreme Court ruled that the EPA cannot consider implementation costs when setting NAAQS under the Clean Air Act. The process for promulgating or revising NAAQS is outlined in the CAA, with other statutory requirements also impacting regulations. The process for promulgating or revising Clean Air Act (CAA) rules is influenced by various regulations and executive mandates, including the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, Executive Order 12866, and Executive Order 12848. Section 307 of the CAA modifies the Administrative Procedure Act procedures for rulemaking, requiring the EPA to establish a public docket containing all relevant information for the Administrator's decision. The rulemaking process for Clean Air Act (CAA) rules involves key steps such as notice of proposed rulemaking, public comment period, promulgation of the rule with responses to significant comments, and judicial review opportunities. The Administrator must publish proposed national ambient air quality standards simultaneously with criteria documents. Notice of proposed rulemaking must be published in the Federal Register with a statement of basis and purpose, specifying the period for public comment and docket information. The EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone and Particulate Matter, outlining the decision-making process and major options. Proposed Rules for ozone and PM were released with a 60-day public comment period. Interested persons were given time to submit written comments before promulgation of the NAAQS. In promulgating a NAAQS, the Administrator allows written comments, data, and oral presentations from interested persons. For the ozone and particulate matter NAAQS proposed in December 1996, EPA received over 25,000 comments and held 4 public hearings. After a reasonable time for comments, the Administrator will promulgate the standards with modifications as deemed appropriate. The promulgated rule must include a statement of basis and purpose, along with an explanation of the reasons for any modifications. The promulgated rule must include a response to significant comments, criticisms, and new data submitted during the comment period. The ozone and particulate matter final decisions were signed by the Administrator on July 16, 1997 and published on July 18, 1997. Each final rule contained discussions of issues raised by commentators and the EPA's final disposition of them. Each agency must assess both the costs and benefits of the intended regulation for a significant regulatory action. The regulatory action must include a quantification of benefits and costs, including direct costs to the government and businesses, adverse effects on the economy, health, safety, and the environment. An assessment of costs and benefits of potentially effective measures is also required. EPA has concluded that NAAQS reviews are \"significant\" regulatory actions requiring preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). The 1996 ozone and PM NAAQS proposals are the first NAAQS rulemakings undertaken since enactment of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). EPA concluded that the proposals were \"significant regulatory actions\" as defined by E.O. 12866, but the proposals do not trigger the regulatory analysis. EPA concluded that the proposals do not trigger the regulatory analysis provisions of UMRA or RFA. Before promulgating any rule with a Federal mandate exceeding $100,000,000, the agency must prepare a statement assessing costs, benefits, and impacts on health, safety, and the environment. The EPA concluded that the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does not apply to setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The agency acknowledged that revisions to State implementation plans and air quality surveillance requirements may have unfunded effects. EPA will address unfunded mandates when proposing revisions to 40 CFR parts 51 and 58, despite denying the need for an analysis in the PM RIA. This denial was challenged in court in American Trucking Associations v. U.S. E.P.A. The Mandates Reform Act states that a failure to prepare an impact analysis does not affect agency rules. The court ruled that not preparing a regulatory impact statement does not make the NAAQS arbitrary and capricious. Agencies must provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for proposed rules impacting small entities. The EPA promulgates a final rule after publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking. The rule will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. The NAAQS will establish air quality standards for states to achieve through specific control measures. The EPA certifies that the proposed rule on National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. The EPA acknowledges potential impacts and conducts a Screening Analysis to evaluate impacts on industries. The agency notifies the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel before conducting an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The Small Business Administration Chief Counsel is provided with information on the potential impacts of a proposed rule on small entities. Within 15 days, individuals representative of affected small entities are identified for advice. A review panel consisting of federal employees reviews materials prepared for the proposed rule. The Small Business Administration Chief Counsel gathers information on the impacts of proposed rules on small entities. Within 15 days, small entity representatives are identified for advice. A review panel reports on their comments and findings within 60 days, with potential modifications to the proposed rule. EPA concludes that SBREFA small-entity provisions do not apply to NAAQS decisions. The EPA concludes that the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) provisions do not apply to National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) decisions. The D.C. Circuit Court upheld EPA's argument that setting NAAQS does not directly impact small businesses, as states determine affected sources through the State Implementation Plan (SIP) process. EPA voluntarily works with the Small Business Administration to gather comments and advice from small entity representatives. The EPA addresses regulatory impact assessments required by statutes, Paperwork Reduction Act provisions triggered by reporting requirements, and Executive Order 12848 on environmental justice. Analysis of effects on minorities and low-income populations will be examined during the implementation process. The EPA's regulatory impact assessments for NAAQS decisions are subject to OMB review, with changes made in response to OMB suggestions documented in the public docket. The EPA's NAAQS rulemaking process involves public inspection of dockets, circulation of drafts for review, and potential White House adjudication in cases of controversy. Judicial review of the Administrator's actions in promulgating air quality standards is limited to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. EPA's regulatory impact assessments for NAAQS decisions are subject to OMB review, with changes made in response to OMB suggestions documented in the public docket. The Clean Air Act outlines the requirements for public notice and participation in the rulemaking process, with the final rule needing to be supported by data in the rulemaking docket. It must also include a statement of basis and purpose, detailing the factual data, methodology, legal interpretations, and responses to comments. Judicial review may consider alternatives the agency considered or should have considered. The court may reverse rulemaking actions if found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law. Lawsuits challenging ozone and PM NAAQS were filed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1997, with 38 suits in total. These suits were consolidated in American Trucking Associations v. U.S. E.P.A., which was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court decided on the constitutionality of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and that costs could not be considered in setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The D.C. Circuit Court upheld the EPA's particulate and ozone standards, allowing small entities affected by agency actions to seek judicial review. The EPA's decisions on ozone and PM NAAQS were challenged in court, but upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The publication of final decisions triggered a Congressional review under SBREFA. In July 1997, the Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking provision of SBREFA was triggered, allowing Congress to consider a joint resolution of disapproval for new standards. Bills were introduced to delay the standards, but no bill to rescind the new NAAQS was reported from committee."
