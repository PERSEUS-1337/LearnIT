    "content": "Ten years after the 9/11 attacks, policymakers are still defining homeland security. The strategic process post-9/11 led to the development of homeland security policy and the creation of multiple federal entities with homeland security responsibilities. These entities, excluding DHS, receive annual funding with the Department of Defense receiving 26% and DHS receiving 52%. Congress and policymakers are tasked with funding homeland security priorities. Homeland security funding is currently not based on clearly defined priorities. An ideal scenario would involve consensus on homeland security definition, prioritized missions, and a process for adapting to new situations. This report examines how evolving definitions and missions impact national policy prioritization and funding. It analyzes strategic documents with varying definitions and missions to address this issue. The concept of homeland security has evolved over the last decade, precipitated by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Policymakers established a new approach post-9/11, leading to the creation of a presidential council and department, along with issuing presidential directives in the name of \"homeland security.\" Responses to disasters like Hurricane Katrina further expanded the concept to include significant disasters and major public emergencies. Katrina expanded homeland security to include disasters, public health emergencies, and threats to the US. This solidified it as distinct from homeland defense, focusing on law enforcement, disaster, immigration, and terrorism issues. The evolution of homeland security post-9/11 led to a coordination of efforts at all levels of government, involving both civilian agencies and the military in response to international terrorist attacks. Strategic documents provide guidance to federal entities in addressing homeland security challenges. Strategic documents guide federal entities in addressing homeland security challenges, with varying definitions and missions. Natural disasters are recognized as part of homeland security in most documents. The lack of consensus on including border and maritime security and immigration in the definition of homeland security could have negative consequences. A clear prioritization of strategic missions is needed to focus federal entities' activities and guide Congress in funding decisions amidst deficit reduction pressures. With reduced federal spending, Congress must prioritize homeland security funding, emphasizing organization, focus, and clarity in national security policy objectives. Limited resources underscore the need for efficient spending and clear prioritization. Unclear policy priorities may hinder Congress's ability to provide effective oversight. Strategy development involves identifying national interests, prioritizing missions, and aligning national power instruments. Strategy must reflect the current world and shape it towards desired outcomes. Developing strategy for homeland security involves recognizing the world as it is and shaping it towards desired outcomes. Prior to 9/11, responses to domestic terrorist attacks were ad hoc, with examples like the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. President Clinton coordinated the response to this attack, highlighting the need for clear strategic missions and alignment among federal entities. Following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton directed the Department of Justice to assess federal facilities' vulnerability to terrorist attacks and develop security standards. However, this did not lead to a comprehensive homeland security strategy. It was the 9/11 attacks that prompted the debate and development of a broader strategy. The 9/11 terrorist attacks prompted the development of a broader homeland security strategy. The response to the attacks involved federal, state, and local government entities coordinating their efforts. It was determined that there was a need to reorganize the government to better prepare for future attacks, leading to an evolution of homeland security definitions. The decision to reorganize the government post-9/11 led to an evolution of homeland security definitions and missions. The debate over these definitions persists as different strategic documents define homeland security efforts in varying terms. The 2003 National Strategy for Homeland Security focused on terrorism, while the 2008 Strategic Plan included references to all-hazards and border security. The 2003 National Strategy for Homeland Security focused on terrorism post-9/11, while the 2008 Strategic Plan included all-hazards and border security. The White House and DHS are key sources of homeland security strategies, with the 2010 National Security Strategy addressing all-hazards. DHS's strategic documents include the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, the 2010 Bottom-Up Review, and the 2012 Strategic Plan, nested within the 2010 National Security Strategy. The 2010 National Security Strategy guides federal homeland security activities and funding allocation. Congress requires OMB to include a homeland security funding analysis in each presidential budget to measure federal funding. The 2003 National Strategy for Homeland Security mission areas were consolidated into three in the 2007 revision: prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks, protect critical infrastructure, and respond to incidents. The 2010 National Security Strategy supersedes the 2007 strategy. The 2010 National Security Strategy supersedes the 2007 National Strategy for Homeland Security. In FY2012 appropriations, 30 federal entities receive homeland security funding, with DHS receiving approximately 52%. Approximately 50% of federal homeland security funding is not allocated for DHS missions, indicating a need for a comprehensive national homeland security definition to prioritize activities and funding. Homeland security activities require seamless coordination among federal, state, and local governments to prevent, protect against, and respond to threats and natural disasters. The concept of homeland security has evolved from pre-9/11 law enforcement and emergency management, leading to a proliferation of responsibilities. Policymakers adjust strategies, plans, and operations in response to events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters. The definition of homeland security evolves with adjusting strategies, plans, and operations. Strategic documents highlight the importance of coordination in the homeland security enterprise, encompassing federal, state, local, tribal, and private sector approaches. Activities involve securing against hazard-specific and all-hazards threats, emphasizing coordination but not implying total protection. Homeland security efforts focus on preventing, responding to, and recovering from terrorist attacks. The definition varies across strategy documents, with some including natural disasters and others emphasizing border security and immigration. The 2012 Strategic Plan broadens the scope to include \"other hazards\" beyond terrorism. The absence of consensus on including policy areas other than terrorism in the homeland security definition may lead to unintended consequences for national operations. Without a succinct concept, coordination among policymakers and entities with homeland security responsibilities may be compromised, hindering the prioritization of necessary activities. The coordination among federal agencies, state, and local partners in homeland security is crucial. Without a clear definition that includes all relevant areas like immigration and natural disaster response, there may be a lack of focus and resources on these activities. This could lead to Congress funding programs that do not align with the priorities of the Department of Homeland Security. The complexity of defining homeland security is evident in varied definitions across documents, with DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Lute highlighting the operational nature of homeland security compared to the strategic nature of national security. This reflects challenges in establishing a common understanding among stakeholders. The homeland security stakeholders, including federal departments, state and local governments, and non-profit organizations, execute strategic missions such as terrorism prevention, response and recovery, critical infrastructure protection, emergency management, and border security. These missions aim to protect the nation's populace, critical infrastructure, and key resources from terrorism. No specific federal entity is tasked with overall homeland security responsibilities. The nation's populace, critical infrastructure, and key resources require protection from terrorism and disasters, which is a key strategic homeland security mission. Some documents address missions related to border security, immigration, the economy, and general resilience. Senator Susan Collins criticized the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and Bottom-Up Review for not effectively communicating priorities compared to the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review missions differ from the 2007 National Strategy for Homeland Security missions and do not identify priorities or resources for DHS or other federal agencies. Critics found the Bottom-Up Review lacking in detail and failing to meet its intended purpose, with congressional criticism noting the absence of a single DHS strategy. Chairman Michael McCaul stated that DHS needs a strategic process to achieve its missions. Chairman Michael McCaul emphasized the need for a single strategic document for DHS to effectively implement its missions, aligning with the National Security Strategy. The Council on Foreign Relations highlighted gaps in the 2010 National Security Strategy, emphasizing the importance of resilience in the face of potential attacks. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of coordination and communication in managing risks for homeland security. Policymakers must develop common definitions and ensure stakeholders are prepared to meet assigned missions. This strategic process is crucial for accurate risk management and to prevent significant human and financial costs. The curr_chunk highlights the lack of alignment in definitions and missions among federal entities at the national level, with DHS attempting to align its definition and missions but not prioritizing them. There is a lack of clarity in national strategies regarding roles and responsibilities, and funding may be driving priorities instead of the other way around. DHS is working on aligning its definition and missions through various reviews and plans, but there is still no single national homeland security definition or prioritization of missions. The existing homeland security strategic documents lack alignment and prioritization of missions, leading to haphazard responses and inconsistent plans. Without clear resource allocation, funding tends to dictate priorities. Congress may need to address these issues to prevent future significant events like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Many observers highlight the policy issues stemming from varied definitions and missions in national strategic documents, which fail to consistently address risk mitigation for all homeland security threats. They suggest developing a more concise national homeland security strategy to prioritize missions and allocate resources effectively. This could involve a total rewrite of the current strategy, similar to past revisions in 2002 and 2007. The Bush Administration issued national homeland security strategies in 2002 and 2007. A more concise strategy with clear mission priorities could help Congress and policymakers make decisions. Options include a separate strategy from the National Security Strategy or building upon the current approach. Congress may find the current inclusion of homeland security guidance in the National Security Strategy sufficient. The national homeland security guidance in the National Security Strategy may focus solely on DHS activities. It is essential for homeland security to prioritize coordination among stakeholders and risks. Without a consensus on the definition and missions of homeland security, there is a risk of disjointed approaches to national security. The consensus on homeland security concept starts with a defined list of missions that adapt to emerging threats in the 21st century."
