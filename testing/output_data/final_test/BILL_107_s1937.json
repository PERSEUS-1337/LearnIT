The Act applies to non-US citizens involved in al Qaeda or international terrorism who have committed specific offenses and are deemed to be subject to trial by a military commission. The military commission can only adjudicate violations of the international law of war. SEC. 5 of the Act states that a military commission must consist of at least five members. Members cannot be absent or excused once the commission is assembled, unless excused by the Secretary of Defense. If the commission falls below five members, new members must be detailed by the Secretary of Defense before the trial can proceed. SEC. 6. REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL. SEC. 6. REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL. A defendant in a military commission has the right to representation by counsel similar to a general court-martial. Civilian counsel must obtain security clearance for access to necessary materials. The Secretary of Defense determines eligibility for civilian counsel with security clearance for representation before a military commission. The Secretary's decision is final and not subject to appeal. Travel expenses for civilian counsel are paid based on authorized rates for government employees. SEC. 7. TRIAL PROCEDURES. Each trial by a military commission consists of two phases: a hearing on guilt and a hearing on sentencing. Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and examine all evidence presented against them. Capital offenses must be notified for trial by a military commission. In a military commission trial, the charge for a capital offense must specify aggravating factors for a death sentence. The burden of proof lies with the prosecution, who must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including aggravating factors for capital offenses. In a military commission trial, the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and establish aggravating factors for a death sentence. Voting on the issue of guilt for capital offenses requires unanimous agreement on guilt and the presence of aggravating factors justifying the death penalty. In a military commission trial, all members must vote for a guilty finding. For offenses not punishable by death, at least 2/3 of members must vote guilty. The sentence requires all members for death penalty and a majority for confinement over 10 years. In a military commission trial, the majority vote is required for a guilty finding. For sentences involving confinement for life or more than 10 years, at least 3/4 of members must vote, while for other sentences, at least 2/3 of members must vote. A record of trial must be prepared promptly after the trial, including a verbatim transcript of all sessions except for closed deliberations and voting. The record of trial in a military commission includes all exhibits and evidence, with photographs allowed as substitutes. Classified information admitted as evidence must be included in the record submitted to an appellate court. SEC. 8. EVIDENTIARY MATTERS. In a trial by a military commission, statements made by the defendant are admissible regardless of any failure to advise the defendant under section 831 of title 10, United States Code. Defendants cannot be compelled to testify, and no evidentiary inference can be drawn from their decision not to testify. Defendants have the right to discover and present exculpatory evidence. In a military commission trial, classified information can be admitted by the prosecution after submitting a summary to the commission and defendant. The commission will review the classified information ex parte and in camera before considering it as evidence. The military commission must approve a summary of classified information if it ensures the defendant can defend against the charges effectively. If the summary is disapproved, it is returned to the prosecution and defendant. Upon disapproval of a summary of classified information, the prosecution can submit a revised summary within 15 days. The prosecution has the authority to appeal any disapproval to the United States Court of Appeals for Military Commissions. The prosecution can appeal any disapproval of a summary or revised summary of classified information to the United States Court of Appeals for Military Commissions within 15 days. The appeal must include the classified information, summaries, and other evidence intended to be offered by the prosecution. The appellate court conducts a de novo review of the summaries and issues a final ruling on the interlocutory appeal within 45 days. SEC. 9. APPEAL. Any individual convicted by a military commission is entitled to a review of that conviction by the United States Court of Appeals for Military Commissions, which is composed of three judges designated by the Chief Justice of the United States from different courts of appeals. The United States Court of Appeals for Military Commissions, composed of three judges designated by the Chief Justice of the United States, fills vacancies in the same manner as the original designation. The Court continues until all matters under its jurisdiction are resolved, establishing rules consistent with applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the rules of procedure prescribed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The United States Court of Appeals for Military Commissions has jurisdiction to review interlocutory appeals of disapproval of summaries of classified information and appeals of convictions by military commissions. Proceedings for appeals of convictions are to be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Decisions by the Court are subject to review by the Supreme Court through a writ of certiorari. An individual can petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari without prepayment of fees, costs, or security, and without filing the required affidavit."
