    "content": "The House approved $43.8 billion for agencies funded through the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill, a $3.1 billion increase over FY2007 enacted funding. The Senate recommended $44.2 billion in appropriations, a $3.4 billion increase over FY2007 enacted funding. The Senate did not take further action on H.R. 2829, leading to FSGG agencies being funded at FY2007 rates until December 31, 2007. The FSGG appropriations were eventually included in a consolidated appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, which was signed into law by President Bush on December 26, 2007. The total funding for FSGG agencies in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 was $43.3 billion, $2.6 billion more than FY2007, but less than the President's request and the amounts approved by the House and Senate. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 2764) allocated $20.6 billion in discretionary spending, $1.1 billion more than FY2007 but $1.1 billion less than the President's request. The funding was $1.1 billion below the Senate Appropriations Committee's recommendation and $883 million less than the House's approval. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized subcommittee structures in early 2007, creating a new Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government (FSGG). The reorganization of subcommittee structures in early 2007 led to the creation of a new Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government (FSGG), which absorbed agencies from various existing subcommittees including the Judiciary, District of Columbia, Independent Agencies, Commerce, Justice, Science, Transportation, Treasury, Housing, and Urban Development. The House and Senate FSGG subcommittees have similar jurisdictions after a reorganization. Appropriations provisions for FSGG agencies are in Division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, which includes funding through five titles and government-wide general provisions. House funding figures are from the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, while Senate figures are from S.Rept. 110-129. Other sources include the President's FY2008 budget request and the House Appropriations Committee. The House approved $43.8 billion for FY2008 appropriations for FSGG agencies, with increases proposed for various departments and agencies compared to FY2007 enacted amounts and the President's FY2008 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FSGG appropriations bill on July 12, 2007. The Senate bill proposed increased funding for each of the five titles, with the largest gains for Independent Agencies and the smallest for the Executive Office of the President. Funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Judiciary, and the District of Columbia would also see increases. Compared to the President's FY2008 request, the Senate bill would have increased funding for certain departments and agencies. The FSGG appropriations bill agencies were funded through a series of continuing resolutions until December 31, 2007. Ultimately, they were funded through H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, signed by President Bush on December 26, 2007. The Senate did not take further action on H.R. 2829. The FY2008 FSGG appropriations bill encompassed funding for various government branches and agencies, including the Department of the Treasury and the Executive Office of the President. Key issues included funding for IRS enforcement, taxpayer services, and EOP budget consolidation. The FY2008 FSGG appropriations bill covers funding for the Treasury Department, IRS, and the Executive Office of the President. Key questions include funding for judicial security enhancements, pay raises for judges, USPS budget, and IRS operations. The Treasury Department, recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee, performs various governmental functions such as protecting the financial system, collecting tax revenue, enforcing tax laws, managing federal debt, regulating financial institutions, and producing coins and currency. Treasury consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with bureaus accounting for over 95% of funding and workforce. The Treasury Department's bureaus account for over 95% of its funding and workforce. Bureaus are divided into financial management and regulation, and law enforcement functions. Financial management bureaus include the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Law enforcement bureaus include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, U.S. Secret Service, and U.S. Customs Service. Since the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, Treasury's direct involvement in law enforcement has decreased significantly. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stands out as an exception, as it is responsible for tax collection and enforcement. While many bureaus rely on annual appropriations for funding, some, such as the U.S. Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, finance their operations through fees for services and products. In FY2007, Treasury received $11.624 billion in appropriated funds, with most going to finance the operations of the IRS. Other bureaus and offices received smaller amounts, totaling $1.027 billion. For FY2008, the Bush Administration requested $12.141 billion in funding for Treasury. The Bush Administration requested $12.141 billion in funding for Treasury for FY2008, with most of the funds allocated to the IRS. Other bureaus and offices would receive smaller amounts, including departmental offices, OIG, TIGTA, CDFI, FinCEN, FMS, ATB, and Bureau of the Public Debt. The Bush Administration requested $12.141 billion in funding for Treasury for FY2008, with most of the funds allocated to the IRS. Other bureaus and offices would receive smaller amounts, including departmental offices, OIG, TIGTA, CDFI, FinCEN, FMS, ATB, and Bureau of the Public Debt. Under the Administration's budget proposal, total full-time equivalent employment at Treasury was projected to rise from 107,734 in FY2006 to 108,965 in FY2008 to support strategic objectives. The Bush Administration's budget proposal for FY2008 allocated $12.141 billion to Treasury, with a focus on IRS funding. Other bureaus and offices received smaller amounts. The proposal aimed to support strategic objectives such as national security, managing finances, strengthening financial institutions, and improving Treasury operations. The budget would increase resources for international economic policy coordination and eliminate funding for the Bank Enterprise Awards program. Additionally, funding for TFI and FinCEN would be increased to combat money laundering. The Administration requested increased funding for the Treasury's Financial Intelligence (TFI) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to combat money laundering and enforce economic sanctions. The proposed budget aimed to enhance TFI's capacity to identify national security threats, improve infrastructure, and deepen involvement in the Intelligence Community. FinCEN's main task is administering the Bank Secrecy Act to protect the financial system from crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing. The Administration requested increased funding for FinCEN to upgrade electronic filing systems for BSA forms and critical IT systems. The budget proposal also supported IRS's budget for enforcement and taxpayer compliance initiatives. No appropriated funds directly support the fourth objective of ensuring financial institution integrity. The U.S. financial institutions, including the Office of the Comptroller and the U.S. Mint, rely on fees for funding. The Administration requested funding for various projects in FY2008, including a pilot project for Enterprise Content Management and improving compliance with security regulations. The House passed a spending measure providing $12.257 billion for the Treasury Department's operations in FY2008. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $251 million in appropriated funds for Treasury departmental offices in FY2008, with additional funds allocated to the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the Office of Financial Education. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) would receive $100 million, with a portion designated for administrative costs and the Bank Enterprise Award program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $251 million for Treasury departmental offices in FY2008. The IRS would receive $11.147 billion, with additional funds for the Bank Enterprise Award program. FinCEN would get $83 million, while FMS would receive $234 million, including $9 million for information systems modernization initiatives. Six Treasury accounts would receive the same funding as requested in the Administration's budget. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $251 million for Treasury departmental offices in FY2008, with specific allocations for IRS, FinCEN, and FMS. The version of H.R. 2829 passed by the House included requirements for the Treasury Department to submit an \"operating plan\" detailing funding, employment figures, and program information. Members of the House adopted a controversial amendment regarding U.S. agricultural product sales to Cuba, while the Senate Appropriations Committee reported an amended version of H.R. 2829 with $12.249 billion in appropriated funds for the Treasury in FY2008. The IRS would receive $11.142 billion, departmental offices $252 million, and department-wide systems and capital investments program $19 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported an amended version of H.R. 2829 with appropriated funds for the Treasury in FY2008. The committee endorsed the Administration's request to spend $56.2 million on the Office Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, with additional funding for various departments under its direction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended additional funding for various departments under the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in FY2008, including $1.4 million for the Office of Foreign Assets Control, $2.0 million for the Office of Intelligence Analysis, and $0.6 million for the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. The committee urged Treasury to take a stronger leadership role in the intelligence community on illicit finance issues and directed the Department to collaborate with the Director of National Intelligence to develop a mission plan for financial intelligence. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended additional funding for various departments under the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in FY2008. The committee opposed proposed reductions for CDFI programs, highlighting their importance in providing financial services to underserved communities. $8 million of the approved $90 million for CDFI would benefit Native American, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiian communities. A controversial amendment was approved to limit Treasury's enforcement of regulations on sales of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba and ease barriers for selling agricultural and medical products there. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 includes $11.996 billion in funding for the Treasury Department, with allocations for various departments within Treasury. The funding amounts differ from the Bush Administration's requests, with some departments receiving less than requested while others receive more. Notable allocations include $10.892 billion for the IRS, $94 million for CDFI (above the Administration's request), and a recapture of $4 million in previously allocated funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 includes $57 million in appropriated funds for Treasury programs dealing with terrorism and financial intelligence. This includes $300,000 for a permanent office within TFI for managing information technology systems and $250,000 for OFAC to reduce Freedom of Information request backlog. Additionally, the act specifies conditions for the use of funds allocated for CDFI in FY2008. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 allocates funds for various Treasury programs, including direct loans, administrative expenses, and support for Native American communities. The act also mandates spending on the Black Enterprise Award program. The federal government finances its operations through income taxes, social insurance taxes, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and other taxes and fees, collected by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS collects taxes, provides taxpayer services, and operates on funding from appropriated funds, user fees, and reimbursables. In FY2006, the agency collected $2.537 trillion, with individual income tax revenue being the largest component at $1.236 trillion. Appropriated funds make up 98% of the IRS's operating budget, with user fees and reimbursables each contributing 1%. In FY2007, the IRS received $10.597 billion in appropriated funds, with allocations for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, business systems modernization, and health insurance tax credit administration. In FY2007, the IRS received $10.597 billion in appropriated funds for various purposes, including taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, business systems modernization, and health insurance tax credit administration. The funding was governed by a year-long continuing resolution that carried over restrictions from FY2006, such as limitations on workforce reorganization without congressional approval. The IRS received $10.597 billion in FY2007 for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, business systems modernization, and health insurance tax credit administration. In FY2008, the Bush Administration requested $11.095 billion for IRS operations, with allocations for various purposes including taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, business systems modernization, and health insurance tax credit administration. Total full-time equivalent employment at the IRS was projected to increase slightly from 92,404 in FY2007 to 92,814 in FY2008. The FY2008 budget proposal for the IRS aimed to support three strategic goals: bolster taxpayer compliance, improve service delivery, and invest in information technology. The Administration also requested legislative proposals to enhance taxpayer compliance through expanded information reporting and mandatory electronic filing for certain large businesses. The FY2008 budget proposal for the IRS aimed to support strategic goals such as bolstering taxpayer compliance, improving service delivery, and investing in information technology. Key objectives included expanded information reporting, mandatory electronic filing for certain large businesses, and increased penalties for fraudulent actions by tax preparers and erroneous refund claims. Challenges facing the agency included improving compliance rates, generating reliable estimates of non-compliance among business taxpayers, increasing electronic tax returns, upgrading computer systems, managing private tax debt collection, and hiring and training enough enforcement agents. The IRS Oversight Board oversees the administration of the federal tax code and ensures the agency has necessary resources. It reviews and approves annual budget requests and assesses if they support the agency's strategic plans. The Board released its assessment of the Administration's FY2008 budget request in April 2007, favoring a larger budget for the IRS. The IRS Oversight Board commended the Administration for seeking a 4.7% increase in the IRS's budget for FY2008, recognizing the importance of the IRS' mission to the nation's fiscal well-being. Both the Board's and Administration's budget proposals aimed to improve the IRS's ability to reduce the tax gap, with the Board emphasizing the need for more funds for enforcement and infrastructure. The IRS Oversight Board recommended more funds for enforcement and infrastructure than the Administration proposed. Specifically, they called for $105 million more for enforcement initiatives and $205 million more for projects related to the BSM and information systems. This additional spending was seen as crucial for improving taxpayer compliance and reducing the tax gap. The House passed a spending measure (H.R. 2829) providing $11.147 billion for the IRS in FY2008, $52 million more than the Administration's request, with the difference allocated to taxpayer services. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $2.155 billion for taxpayer services in FY2008, with increases in funding for various programs such as low-income taxpayer clinic grants, Tax Counseling for the Elderly, Taxpayer Advocate Service, pre-filing services management, taxpayer communications and education, media and publications, and account management and assistance. This increase in spending aimed to counter recent reductions in taxpayer services. The recommended increase in spending on taxpayer services in H.R. 2829 was intended to strengthen, improve, and expand taxpayer service. The bill allocated funds for enforcement, operations support, the BSM program, and the administration of the health insurance tax credit. A controversial provision would have limited funding for the private tax debt collection program, potentially ending it. Representative Jose Serrano raised concerns during the House debate on the bill. During the House debate on H.R. 2829 in 2004, Representative Jose Serrano agreed to remove a provision capping funding for the private tax debt collection program due to opposition from some Republicans. Representative Jim McCreary raised a budget point of order, arguing that such measures should be under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of the bill would have provided $11.142 billion for the IRS in FY2008, slightly more than the Bush Administration's request but less than the recommended amount. The House bill for H.R. 2829 allocated $11.142 billion for the IRS in FY2008, with specific amounts designated for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, BSM, and health insurance tax credit administration. The committee expressed concerns about the IRS's readiness to address key issues, including the tax gap. The House bill for H.R. 2829 allocated $11.142 billion for the IRS in FY2008, with specific amounts designated for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, BSM, and health insurance tax credit administration. The committee expressed concerns about the IRS's readiness to address key issues, including the tax gap, which amounted to $345 billion in 2001. The committee added a provision to H.R. 2829 requiring the IRS to develop a plan to reduce the tax gap without specifying a deadline. The House bill for H.R. 2829 allocated funds for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, BSM, and health insurance tax credit administration. Specific amounts were set aside for tax counseling for the elderly, low-income taxpayer clinic grants, and a matching grant program for tax return preparation assistance. The committee directed the IRS to submit an annual update of its five-year strategic plan for taxpayer services and develop a plan to increase electronic filing to meet the 80% goal by 2007. The IRS was directed to submit a detailed research plan to address issues with its National Research Program by March 1, 2008. Concerns were raised about the quality of data from the NRP and gaps in its coverage, as well as the misclassification of workers leading to loss of tax revenue. More enforcement resources were to be focused on specific industries. The IRS was directed to focus more enforcement resources on industries with widespread misclassification. A provision in the bill aimed to reduce funding for the PDC program to $1 million, potentially suspending the program. The wording of the provision was adjusted in the Senate version to allow the program to fund itself through delinquent taxes collected. The consolidated appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) enacted in December 2007 includes $10.892 billion in funding for IRS operations in FY2008. This includes $2.150 billion for taxpayer services, $4.780 billion for enforcement, $3.680 billion for operations support, $267 million for BSM, and $15 million for administering the health insurance tax credit. The funding for taxpayer services does not include $94.5 million in user fees that the IRS hopes to collect. The IRS funding in FY2008 includes $94.5 million in user fees to supplement its budget for taxpayer services. Congress has specified that a portion of this funding must be used for various programs such as taxpayer assistance, Tax Counseling for the Elderly, low-income taxpayer clinic grants, Taxpayer Advocate Service operating costs, and a matching grant demonstration program for Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs. The IRS is directed to administer a demonstration program for Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs in consultation with the TAS. Any proposed reductions in taxpayer service must be justified and proven not to result in a decline in voluntary compliance. The IRS released a five-year plan to revamp taxpayer services, addressing cost-effectiveness, challenges, and possible improvements. The IRS is facing challenges in improving taxpayer service and is working on measuring its performance. Funds for enforcement in FY2008 will be transferred to the Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement program. The IRS is required to develop a five-year strategic plan for research and issue reports on taxpayer compliance factors and problems with the NRP. Additionally, the IRS has funding to enlarge its workforce for the Automated Collections Systems. The IRS received $7.35 million to expand its workforce for the Automated Collections Systems (ACS) program, which could potentially increase the collection of delinquent tax debt. This expansion could result in collecting $146 million in delinquent tax debt, significantly more than the expected revenue from the PDC program in FY2008. The budget for enforcement in FY2008 approved by Congress raises questions about its impact on initiatives to improve taxpayer compliance and reduce the federal tax gap. The IRS requested $246 million in FY2008 for various initiatives, including increased audits and collection activities for small firms and self-employed individuals, an expansion of the Automated Underreporter program, and research on taxpayer compliance behavior. However, only $101 million was appropriated for enforcement, $145 million less than requested. The act imposes no specific conditions on how the IRS uses its funds for operations support but requires quarterly briefings on IT systems status. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is required to report to the IRS Oversight Board and TIGTA on the status of its information technology systems and any potential cost overruns or delays in projects. The Administration requested over $737 million for the EOP in FY2008, a 2.4% increase from the previous year. Funding for all \"White House\" accounts was set to increase by 8.3% according to the Consolidation Proposal. The proposed FY2008 budget included an increase in funding for all \"White House\" accounts by 8.3%, while funding for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) would have decreased. The reductions in OMB and ONDCP funding were due to the transfer of funds to the Office of Administration for the enterprise services initiative. Additionally, changes in funding were requested for federal drug control programs, with increases in Other Federal Drug Control Programs (+16.3%) and decreases in the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (-75%). The President's FY2008 budget proposed consolidating and realigning several White House accounts, including Compensation of the President, White House Office, and National Security Council, into a single annual appropriation called \"The White House.\" This consolidated appropriation would total over $187 million in FY2008, an 8.3% increase from the previous year. In FY2008, the President's budget proposed consolidating White House accounts into \"The White House\" with a total appropriation of over $187 million, an 8.3% increase from FY2007. Funding for various White House offices would have varied, with some seeing increases and others decreases. The EOP budget submission emphasized consolidation for realigning resources to meet changing needs. Congressional oversight continued with separate appropriations for EOP accounts in previous years. The FY2008 budget proposed consolidating White House accounts into \"The White House\" with over $187 million in total appropriations, an 8.3% increase from FY2007. The budget requested authority for the EOP to transfer 10% of funds among various accounts, including the White House, Office of Management and Budget, and Office of National Drug Control Policy. The FY2008 budget proposed consolidating White House accounts into \"The White House\" with over $187 million in total appropriations, an 8.3% increase from FY2007. The budget requested authority for the EOP to transfer 10% of funds among various accounts, including the White House, Office of Management and Budget, and Office of National Drug Control Policy. The OMB Director would have been able to transfer up to 10% of any appropriation to another appropriation, with limits on the increase to 50%. This transfer authority was intended to address emerging priorities and improve efficiency within the EOP. The authority for transferring funds within the EOP was not meant for new missions or programs but to address emerging priorities and administrative efficiencies. Legislation such as P.L. 108-447 and P.L. 109-115 authorized transfers of up to 10% of appropriated funds among specific accounts for the White House Office, OMB, ONDCP, and the Special Assistance to the President and Official Residence of the Vice President. The FY2008 budget request included an enterprise services initiative to streamline common services in the EOP. This initiative would have expanded to include burn bag pickup costs, employee transportation subsidies, and Flexible Spending Account administrative fees. Budgets for various EOP components would have been moved into the Office of Administration for efficiency. The House Committee on Appropriations report stated that the reduction in the OA appropriation was due to keeping rental payments to GSA for OMB and ONDCP under salaries and expenses accounts. The $7.5 million for OMB rental payments was restored. The $7.5 million was restored to OMB salaries and expenses for rental payments to GSA, leading to an increase in the agency's appropriation. The committee expressed concerns about OMB's use of the E-Government initiative to impose its management priorities on agencies, urging collaboration with appropriations subcommittees for approved e-Government transfers. The House report directed OMB to report on reducing fraud in the federal transit benefit program. ONDCP was allocated $2.8 million for rental payments to GSA. Directives included reporting on the aerial eradication program in Columbia and updating illicit drug prices. H.R. 2829 required the President to submit a financial plan before ONDCP funds could be used for FY2008. The HIDTAP plan for FY2008 required updates every six months, with new projects needing prior approval. HIDTAP received $6 million above the President's request, with specified funding levels for auditing services. Other federal drug control programs saw a $26.7 million decrease in funding, citing lack of evidence for increased funding for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. ONDCP was directed to provide recommendations. The report directed ONDCP to provide recommendations within 90 days on improving measurements for the effectiveness of the media campaign influencing youth and parent behavior. The $197.8 million appropriation for federal drug control programs included allocations for Drug Free Communities, training for drug court professionals, demonstration programs for hard-drug users, and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The CTAC, established in 1990 and reauthorized in 1998, received funding restoration for the Technology Transfer Program. The House committee report also addressed concerns about unobligated balances in the White House Office account and the Administration's editing of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report to Congress. The House-passed bill would have provided $1.5 million for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. The Senate's version of the bill allocated $2 million for the board in a separate account. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed the EOP to include detailed budget information for the board in the FY2009 budget justification. The Senate committee directed the OMB Director to report on the allocation of directed funding by executive departments and agencies. ONDCP's $25.2 million appropriation included funds for salaries, expenses, rental payments to GSA, and an independent study of organization and management. The Senate committee allocated $1.5 million for an independent study of ONDCP's organization and management by NAPA. The bill included provisions on financial planning, transfer authority, reprogramming, and budget estimates for ONDCP. The committee disagreed with the office's proposal to reorganize components and required quarterly reports to be submitted to the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations. The ONDCP Director must submit quarterly reports on travel expenditures and staffing levels to the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations. The committee allocated $15 million more for HIDTAP than requested by the President and directed the ONDCP Director to ensure timely transfer of HIDTA funds to drug control agencies. Specific directions were given on the allocation and use of HIDTA funds. The ONDCP must ensure entities use HIDTA funds strictly for implementing drug control strategies, without supplanting existing support. HIDTA funds can be withheld from a State until financial obligations are met. The Senate expressed concerns about the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. Other federal drug control programs would have been funded at $204.7 million, $19.8 million less than requested. The Senate did not allocate funding for the CTAC program in H.R. 2829, expressing disappointment in the program director and questioning the value of research and development. Unexpended balances were deemed sufficient to fund the program, despite congressional direction to reinstate previous programs. The Senate committee found adequate unexpended balances to fund the program in FY2008. They expected to be informed of any renovations to the Vice President's residence by the Navy. A provision in H.R. 2829 aimed to reduce funding for the Vice President's Office unless they complied with an executive order on classified information, which the Office sought to be exempted from. Senator Sam Brownback's amendment to strike this provision was approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The Senate committee approved an amendment by Senator Sam Brownback to strike a provision from the bill related to funding for the Vice President's Office. The amendment also urged the President to amend Executive Order 12958 to exempt the Office of the Vice President. The law allocates $682 million for accounts under the EOP and funds appropriated to the President, with specific funding levels for various agencies including WHO, OA, and OMB. The appropriation for OMB is $78 million, $394,000 less than recommended by the House and Senate. Administrative provisions direct OMB to allocate appropriations according to specific terms and conditions. OMB is required to publish reasons for IT projects on High Risk or Management Watch lists. The federal drug control accounts receive a total of $421.7 million, allocated to various specific accounts. The ONDCP receives $1 million CTC, $230 million HIDTA, and $164.3 million from other federal drug control programs. Administrative provisions include a requirement for a financial plan submission and restrictions on transferring appropriations. The judiciary presents its budget to the President, who transmits it to Congress unchanged. Appropriations for the judiciary are divided into budget groups and accounts. The judiciary's budget is divided into budget groups and accounts. Two accounts fund the Supreme Court, making up about 1.2% of the total judiciary budget. The rest of the budget funds the \"lower\" federal courts and related judicial services, with the largest account covering salaries for various judicial positions. The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the care of the Supreme Court building and grounds. The judiciary budget covers expenses for judges, magistrate judges, and other federal judiciary officers and employees, as well as necessary court expenses. It does not fund special courts like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, U.S. Tax Court, and U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or federal courthouse construction. Non-appropriated funds, mainly from court filing fees, are used to offset expenses, with some funds carrying forward from year to year. The judiciary's savings result from budgeted costs not materializing, which are not always under its control. They will keep Congress informed of changes in non-appropriated funds and adjust budget requests accordingly. The judiciary also has \"encumbered\" funds for specific purposes, used when expenses are delayed. The judiciary's FY2007 appropriations were not frozen like other federal entities. Judge Julia S. Gibbons testified about maintaining staffing levels and addressing immigration caseloads in FY2008 budget request. All budget items are essential for court operations and preserving the judicial system. Judge Gibbons highlighted the Judicial Conference's efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity in the federal judiciary, including capping courthouse rent growth and identifying overcharges. The judiciary is also working with GSA to change how courthouse rent is determined. Efforts to contain costs in the federal judiciary include capping courthouse rent growth and using technology to increase efficiency. Judicial security remains a concern, with recent incidents prompting legislation to enhance security measures. The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 was introduced in the 110th Congress to strengthen judicial security. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved S. 378 in March 2007, and the Senate passed it unanimously in April 2007. The House Judiciary Committee amended H.R. 660 in June 2007, and the House approved it in July 2007. The legislation allocated $11.9 million to the U.S. Marshals Service for intrusion detection systems in federal judges' homes. By October 26, 2007, 97% of judges who requested alarm systems had them installed. The Judiciary Committee approved legislation allocating $11.9 million for intrusion detection systems in federal judges' homes. 97% of judges who requested alarm systems had them installed. The Judiciary is experiencing security and billing issues with the Federal Protective Service. The Judicial Conference endorsed transferring security functions to the U.S. Marshals Service. President's FY2008 budget request for border security would increase judiciary's caseload. Immigration-related cases now make up 25% of district courts' criminal caseload. The Judiciary Committee approved legislation allocating $11.9 million for intrusion detection systems in federal judges' homes. The workload in the judiciary's probation and pretrial services programs continues to grow. The Judicial Conference voted to ask Congress to create 67 new federal judgeships. Since the 1990 omnibus judgeship bill, the number of courts of appeals judges has remained the same, while federal appellate court case filings increased by 55%. The number of district court judgeships increased by 4%, while case filings increased by 29% over a 17-year period. The judiciary is advocating for a significant increase in judicial pay, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. highlighted the issue in 2006. Failure to raise judicial salaries is seen as a threat to the strength and independence of the federal Judiciary. Senator Patrick J. Leahy also addressed the issue in 2007. Senator Patrick J. Leahy and Representative John Conyers Jr. introduced bills in 2007 to increase salaries for federal justices and judges. The bills proposed pay adjustments ranging from 28.7% to 41.3%. Senator Richard J. Durbin also introduced a bill for a 16.5% salary increase for various judicial positions. S. 2353 is pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee for increasing fees for bankruptcy trustees. House Appropriations Subcommittee held hearings on Supreme Court budget requests for FY2007, discussing issues like building modernization, workload, technology, security, clerk hiring, and televising proceedings. Another hearing featured testimony on federal judiciary budget requests from Judge Julia S. Gibbons. Judge Julia S. Gibbons and James C. Duff testified at hearings regarding the judiciary's budget request for FY2008, emphasizing the importance of fully funding the judiciary to avoid staff cuts and service reductions. The judiciary requested $6,511.5 million in total appropriations, an 8.9% increase over the previous year.

In H.R. 2829 and P.L. 110-161, provisions such as Section 809 and Section 819 are noted, which prohibit payment to political appointees filling positions for which they have not been confirmed and restrict the use of appropriated funds for employee training that does not meet specific criteria. Section 718 of the bill prohibits content related to religious beliefs or offensive material in the workplace. Section 820 prohibits non-disclosure agreements without whistleblower protection. Section 823 requires approval for releasing non-public information. Section 834 recognizes the United States Congress. Section 834 of the bill recognizes the United States Anti-Doping Agency as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American, and Paralympic sports in the United States. Section 836 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to enforce restrictions on the Coast Guard Congressional Fellowship Program or OPM's proposed regulations. Section 837 would have required agencies to report acquisitions from entities outside the United States, but this provision was not included in the final bill. Section 839 of the bill requires executive department heads to transfer funds to ensure the operation of the Midway Atoll airfield. Section 840 outlines requirements for public-private competitions for non-inherently governmental activities. Section 842 prohibits the use of funds for certain purposes. Section 842 of the bill prohibits the use of funds to convert an activity or function of an executive agency to contractor performance if more than 10 federal employees perform the activity, unless savings exceed 10 percent of personnel-related costs or $10 million. Section 845 precludes contravention of the Privacy Act and includes provisions for agency Inspectors General reviews of privacy and data protection policies. The FY2008 budget proposed a 3.0% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, while H.R. 2829 and P.L. 110-161 provided a 3.5% pay adjustment for employees in the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense represented by a labor organization. Locality pay increases are based on pay gaps, with the largest gaps receiving the largest increases. Executive Order 13454 issued by President Bush in January 2008 provided federal white-collar employees with pay adjustments of 4.49% in Washington, DC and 2.99% in the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area. New provisions in the bill required budget reports on Great Lakes ecosystem health and mandated departments to link to their Inspectors General websites for public reports and audits. The P.L. 110-161 law mandates posting public reports and audits on IG websites with a link for anonymous reporting of waste, fraud, and abuse. It also prohibits using funds for public-private competitions related to Human Resources LOB until a reporting requirement is met. The Director of OMB must submit a report to Congress before funds can be used. Additionally, the House-passed bill would have prohibited funds for implementing Executive Order 13422. The bill prohibited funds for implementing Executive Order 13422 related to the President's authority over executive agency rulemaking. An amendment struck this provision from the Senate version of the bill. Competitive sourcing, which began in 1966, involves public-private competitions guided by OMB Circular A-76. Competitive sourcing legislation in the late 1990s led to changes in conducting these competitions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 prohibits the conversion of agency activities involving 11 or more federal employees to contractor performance without meeting certain conditions. Public-private competitions must include a staffing plan (MEO), show cost savings of at least $10 million or 10% of personnel costs, and ensure contractors do not provide lesser benefits than federal employees. These conditions distinguish standard competitions from streamlined competitions. Under Circular A-76, agencies must develop an MEO and apply the conversion differential for standard competitions, while streamlined competitions do not require an MEO or calculate the conversion differential. The third condition aims to prevent contractors from gaining a cost advantage by paying less for benefits, potentially restricting their ability to prepare proposals. Circular A-76 exempts certain organizations like the Department of Defense from Section 739(a) restrictions. While it doesn't explicitly prohibit public-private competitions, the language emphasizes competitions for work done by federal employees. The policy statement highlights the government's reliance on the private sector for commercial services and the need to identify activities as commercial or inherently governmental. Section 739(b) of Circular A-76 allows competitions for work performed by contractors and outlines procedures for these competitions. Section 739(c) permits protests for competitions and decisions to outsource work without a competition, allowing representation for affected employees. The ATO or selected individuals can file protests on behalf of employees. Section 739(c) allows representation for employees in civil actions challenging provider selection at the end of a competition. An ATO can file a protest unless the agency official deems it unreasonable, raising concerns about adequate representation for agency employees. The private sector argues that allowing the ATO to file a protest is sufficient protection for agency employees. Contractors note that their employees cannot select a representative for a protest. Funds from the act cannot be used for directing agencies in public-private competitions or converting government activities. This provision applies to FY2008 and succeeding fiscal years. U.S. policy towards Communist Cuba has been in place since the early 1960s. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Communist Cuba has focused on isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions. Travel restrictions have been a contentious part of this policy, with regulations allowing certain categories of travelers to visit Cuba under general or specific licenses granted by OFAC. U.S. exports to Cuba have been allowed since 2001 under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, with restrictions and licensing requirements. Transactions must be in cash or financed from third countries. Exports have totaled over $1.9 billion, mostly in agricultural products, with a peak of $404 million in 2004. In 2005 and 2006, U.S. exports to Cuba amounted to $340 million and $377 million, respectively, with a majority in agricultural products. Sanctions were tightened in 2005, requiring payment in advance for agricultural sales to Cuba, causing objections from exporters and some Members of Congress. Since 2000, efforts to ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba, particularly on travel and agricultural exports, have been approved by Congress but not enacted. The Administration has consistently threatened to veto such legislation. In 2007, a provision in the FY2008 appropriations bill aimed to block funds for implementing a regulation requiring advance payment for U.S. agricultural goods shipped to Cuba. The House and Senate included provisions in the FY2008 appropriations bill regarding cash in advance for U.S. agricultural goods shipped to Cuba. The Senate also included a provision for travel to Cuba under a general license. The Administration threatened to veto any legislation that weakened current restrictions against Cuba. Ultimately, Congress dropped these provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008."
