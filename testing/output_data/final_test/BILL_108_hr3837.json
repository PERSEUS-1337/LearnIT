The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes a special rule for contributions of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and similar properties to qualified research organizations. A qualified research organization is defined as an organization that applies its expertise to the scientific and commercial development of qualified contributions. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has a special rule for contributions of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and similar properties to qualified research organizations. The contribution must be a gift of all rights to the property, with limitations on the use of cash or cash equivalent, and disclosure requirements set by the Secretary. The Secretary of the Treasury will require donors of property to obtain qualified appraisals for fair market value by qualified appraisers. The term \"qualified appraiser\" refers to an appraiser with valuation credentials and experience, not affiliated with the donor or donee, meeting professional valuation education requirements. A \"qualified appraisal\" is an appraisal meeting the requirements for a qualified appraisal under section 170(a)(1) of the Code, with specified modifications. The appraisal for donated patents considers competitive patent environment, remaining life, and potential use by qualified donees for technology development and commercialization. A second appraisal is required if the property value exceeds $5,000,000, conducted by a qualified appraiser independently selected by a designated professional organization. The donee must acknowledge receipt of the property. The donee must acknowledge receipt of the appraisal summary and any cash grants described in the information returns. The Secretary may create regulations to prevent abuse of the deduction reduction. The section addresses potential abuses in charitable contributions involving patents or similar property, including circumventing deduction reductions, manipulating property basis, and changing property form to maximize deductions. The amendments apply to contributions made after the enactment date.
