    "content": "The \"Gateway Communities Cooperation Act of 2002\" aims to improve the relationship between federal land managers and gateway communities to support compatible land management of federal and adjacent lands. The Congress finds that communities near Federal lands play a vital role in providing necessary services for visitors and employees. Gateway communities play a crucial role in providing essential services for visitors to Federal lands. These communities serve as entry points for visitors and offer services such as lodging, food, fuel, and emergency assistance. The development in gateway communities can impact the management and protection of Federal lands, depending on the coordination between local development planning and Federal land managers. Gateway communities are impacted by the decisions of Federal land managers, which can have unintended consequences if not communicated effectively. Experts in land management planning are available to Federal managers but may not be readily accessible to small gateway communities. Interagency coordination of policies and actions between Federal land agencies and gateway communities would benefit both parties. The Act aims to improve communication, coordination, and cooperation between Federal land managers and gateway communities to enhance relationships, facilities, services, and local land use planning. The term \"gateway community\" refers to a subdivision of a state or federally recognized tribe significantly affected by planning decisions regarding Federal lands. Federal land agencies include the National Park Service, US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Federal land agencies, including the Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management, define a \"Federal land manager\" as various officials overseeing different types of federal lands. These agencies are required to involve elected and appointed officials from local gateway communities in the planning and decision-making processes for land use. The Federal land agencies must involve local gateway communities in plans, decisions, projects, and policies for Federal public lands. They should provide officials with a summary of the plan's goals, objectives, and anticipated impacts in non-technical language. Additionally, early public notice of proposed decisions should be given to gateway communities. The Federal land agencies must involve gateway communities in plans, decisions, and policies for Federal public lands. They should provide training sessions and technical assistance to help officials participate meaningfully in the development of agency plans. The Federal land agencies work with gateway communities to develop data and analysis for agency plans and decisions. Federal land managers assist gateway communities in reviewing land use and transportation plans that may impact them. Additionally, Federal land managers can enter into cooperative agreements with gateway communities for coordination of land use activities on Federal lands. Interagency cooperation and coordination are essential for Federal land agencies to consolidate and coordinate their plans with other agencies and governments in the vicinity of the Federal lands. Gateway communities play a crucial role in the planning processes and should be involved in decision-making. The Federal land agencies must actively involve gateway communities in environmental impact statement preparation and planning processes under the National Environmental Policy Act. Grants can be provided to gateway communities for participation in land planning and management processes. To address public infrastructure impacts from Federal land management decisions, grants can be provided to gateway communities with populations under 10,000. Funding can come from general agency funds for public information services about Federal lands. Federal land managers can use funds for planning, construction, or project development to support programs and grants under subsection (d) and (e). Managers from different agencies can combine resources for grants under subsection (e)."
