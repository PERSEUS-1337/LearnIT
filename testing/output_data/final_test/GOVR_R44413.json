    "content": "The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) programs were reorganized in FY2016, with two main mission areas: Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program and Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR). NCTIR was previously funded under Weapons Activities. The DNN Program is now divided into six functional areas, including Materials Management and Minimization (M3) which works to reduce weapons-useable material worldwide. Global Material Security focuses on international nuclear security, radiological security, and nuclear smuggling detection. It includes activities such as equipment provision, training, workshops, and collaboration with international organizations. Nonproliferation and Arms Control programs aim to strengthen nuclear safeguards, control dual-use technologies, and verify compliance with treaties. National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development examines nuclear materials, devices, and post-detonation debris through nuclear forensics development. The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development program focuses on detecting and characterizing global nuclear security threats. It includes field response capabilities for nuclear or radiological incidents. The Nonproliferation Construction program includes projects like the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Project and the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility. The Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program evaluates nuclear and radiological threats. The FY2021 request for DNN appropriations totaled $2.031 billion, reflecting a 6.2% decrease from FY2020-enacted levels. The budget justification cites the completion of funding for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project at the Savannah River Site as the main reason for the decrease. Funding for the MOX project was decreased by 50% (-$150 million), while the Global Material Security program saw a $42 million, or 9.65%, decrease due to increased funds in FY2020 for the Cesium Irradiator Replace Program. The budget proposal includes a $37.2 million, or 10%, increase in funding for the Material Management Minimization program, mainly in the conversion subprogram. The FY2021 budget includes a $40 million funding shift to the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development program from the DNN R&D Nuclear Detonation Detection subprogram. The budget justification also requests funds for the U.S. plutonium disposition program in the M3 Material Disposition subprogram and Nonproliferation Construction Surplus Plutonium Disposition subprogram. The United States pledged to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus weapons plutonium, originally intended for conversion into fuel for commercial power reactors. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) in South Carolina, which faced escalating costs, was terminated in 2018. The Dilute and Dispose (D&D) method is now being pursued, involving blending plutonium with an inert mixture for safe storage and disposal in a geologic repository. The Nonproliferation Construction account proposed a $150 million decrease in funding. The FY2021 request includes a proposed decrease of $150 million in the Nonproliferation Construction account, reflecting the completion of the MOX contractual termination settlement. The requested $148.6 million would be used for the Surplus Plutonium Disposition (SPD) project, supporting the D&D method for disposing of surplus weapons plutonium. Activities for FY2021 would involve early site preparation, long lead procurements, and design maturation for plutonium processing gloveboxes."
