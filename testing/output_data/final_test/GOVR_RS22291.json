    "content": "In the 2005 BRAC round, the Department of Defense recommended 190 closures and realignments. The BRAC Commission approved 119 with no changes and accepted 45 with amendments, representing 86% of DOD's proposed recommendations. The Commission rejected 13 DOD recommendations entirely and significantly modified another 13. The total savings of the Commission's recommendations over the next 20 years are estimated at $35.6 billion, lower than DOD's initial estimate of $47.8 billion, sparking controversy. The 2005 BRAC Commission had minor success in promoting increased jointness with its recommendations, mostly consolidating within military departments. The Commission faced difficulties with DOD's proposals to close or realign Air National Guard bases. The process was open, transparent, and fair, with site visits, regional hearings, and deliberative hearings for public input. DOD adopted an approach supporting joint operations in 2005. In 2005, the BRAC Commission made changes to the selection criteria and process, including elevating Joint Cross-Service Groups to peers of military departments and extending the time horizon for assessing future threats to 20 years. The Commission consisted of nine members to avoid tie votes and emphasized considering the impact of costs related to environmental restorations in base closure decisions. The 2005 BRAC Commission made changes to the selection criteria, including adding economic impact on local communities and homeland defense. Previous commissions added numerous bases to the DOD list, but the 2005 Commission only added 8. They recommended changes to the BRAC law, expanding the Commission's lifespan and mission. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommended changes to the BRAC law, expanding the Commission's lifespan and mission. It would link defense infrastructure reconsideration to security threat analysis by the DNI and the Quadrennial Defense Review. The legislation would authorize a 2014-2015 BRAC round if necessary and suggest new ways for property disposal. The recommended legislative language expands Department of Defense release requirements, strengthens penalties for non-compliance, increases General Counsel responsibilities, exempts the Commission from FACA, and makes temporary authority for environmental agreements permanent. It retains some features from the 2005 round but repeals others. The 2005 BRAC round differed from previous rounds by emphasizing joint evaluation of installations and projecting defense needs for 20 years. The Commission recommended legislative changes to enhance Department of Defense release requirements and make temporary environmental agreements permanent. The Commission recommended legislative changes to enhance Department of Defense release requirements and make temporary environmental agreements permanent. The proposed legislation would extend the life of a subset of the BRAC Commission to monitor and report on a potential 2014-2015 BRAC round. The proposed legislation would extend the life of a subset of the BRAC Commission to monitor and report on the use of BRAC appropriations, implementation of 2005 BRAC recommendations, privatizations-in-place at BRAC sites, environmental remediation, and impact on international treaty obligations. The Commission would be required to submit three reports to Congress and the President: an Annual Report, a Special Report (due on June 30, 2007), and a Final Report (due on October 31, 2011). The proposed legislation aims to extend the BRAC Commission's monitoring of BRAC appropriations, implementation of 2005 recommendations, privatizations-in-place, and environmental remediation. The Commission would submit three reports, including a Special Report focusing on properties requiring special financing and NPL sites. The 2005 Commission report suggested studying ways to expedite the disposal of challenging properties through partnerships with private environmental insurance carriers or creating public-private partnerships. Other options included forming limited-liability corporations or independent trusteeships to manage properties. The Commission would consult with various government agencies in preparing its study and report on BRAC implementation actions. The recommended legislation would require a final report by October 31, 2011, and include provisions based on the 2005 round's experience. The Secretary of Defense must release certified data within seven days. The 2005 Commission recommended the Secretary of Defense to release certified data within seven days of forwarding base closure recommendations to Congress and the Commission. Delays in staffing and data release shortened the Commission's work time, leading to a proposal to extend the period to seven months. They also suggested granting the Commission power to subpoena witnesses and designated its General Counsel as the sole ethics counselor. The 2005 Commission recommended legislation to make documents available for public inspection, open hearings to the public, and provide official transcripts. The 2005 Commission recommended legislation to repeal sections of the existing law that authorized the 2005 round and included installation selection criteria."
