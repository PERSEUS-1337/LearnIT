    "content": "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain non-U.S. nationals arrested for immigration violations. Detention ensures presence at removal hearings and quick removal if ordered, and may also address any threat to community safety. The detention framework varies based on factors like admission status and criminal history. The detention of aliens by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is governed by statutory and regulatory frameworks. Detention may be discretionary or mandatory based on factors like criminal offenses and security risks. The report outlines when aliens may be released on bond or supervision pending removal proceedings, and when they must be detained until removal from the United States. The detention of aliens by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is governed by statutory and regulatory frameworks, outlining when aliens may be detained or released. The Supreme Court has recognized the government's broad power over immigration, including the authority to detain aliens pending removal decisions. This authority is based on the government's sovereign control over borders and relations with foreign nations. The Supreme Court has emphasized Congress's complete legislative power over the admission of aliens, stating that aliens in the US are protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This includes the right to a hearing before deprivation of liberty and freedom from bodily restraint. The Supreme Court has recognized that due process considerations may constrain the federal government's exercise of its immigration power, especially for aliens seeking initial entry into the United States. Aliens seeking entry have limited constitutional protections, with no rights regarding their admission applications. In Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, the Court upheld the indefinite detention of an alien denied admission, ruling that detention authority in such cases is least constrained by due process considerations. The Supreme Court ruled that aliens seeking initial entry into the United States have limited constitutional protections. In the case of Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, the Court upheld the indefinite detention of an alien denied admission, stating that detained arriving aliens may have some level of habeas corpus protection. Some lower courts have also recognized due process protections for arriving aliens against unreasonably prolonged detention. Once aliens physically enter the United States, they are considered \"persons\" under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The level of constitutional protections may vary depending on the alien's status and circumstances, such as admission or ties to the country. The government's authority to detain aliens in the U.S. is not absolute. The Supreme Court has determined that the government's authority to detain aliens in the U.S. is subject to important constitutional limitations, with the Due Process Clause limiting detention to a period reasonably necessary for removal. While the Court has recognized the authority to detain aliens pending removal proceedings, it has not addressed whether extended detention during those proceedings could violate due process protections. Lower courts have found that such extended detention may raise due process concerns. The government's authority to detain aliens in the U.S. is subject to constitutional limitations, with the Due Process Clause restricting indefinite detention. Lower courts have found that due process constraints apply to some categories of aliens pending removal from the United States. Constitutional constraints on immigration power are most significant for lawfully admitted aliens within the country. Federal immigration laws have historically allowed for the detention of aliens subject to removal, with the Alien Enemies Act in 1798 being the first law on alien detention. In 1875, Congress began enacting laws restricting entry for certain aliens and mandating their detention until removal. The Supreme Court affirmed the government's detention authority in 1896. Congress continued passing laws for the detention and exclusion of aliens, leading to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. In 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which differentiated between aliens physically arriving in the US and those already present. Aliens subject to exclusion were detained, while deportable aliens could be released on bond or conditional parole. Later amendments required the detention of aliens convicted of aggravated felonies in deportation proceedings. In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which replaced the INA's exclusion/deportation framework with a new framework based on lawful admission into the country. Aliens who had not been admitted could be barred entry or removed based on specified grounds of inadmissibility. The IIRIRA established a new \"expedited removal\" process for certain inadmissible aliens, including arriving aliens and those who entered without inspection. Immigration authorities were authorized to detain removable aliens pending formal removal proceedings, with the option for release on bond or conditional parole. Detention was required for aliens inadmissible or deportable for specific crimes. The IIRIRA established mandatory detention for certain inadmissible or deportable aliens based on specific crimes or terrorist-related grounds, with no possibility of release. It also created a detention scheme for aliens with final removal orders, allowing for detention during a 90-day period. The government could choose to continue detaining some aliens after this period. Since the enactment of IIRIRA, immigration detention laws have remained largely constant. The detention framework is complex, with rules based on various factors such as the alien's admission status, criminal history, and removal orders. The current immigration detention scheme is governed by four main provisions, including INA Section 236(a) allowing for detention pending removal proceedings and potential release on bond, and INA Section 236(c) mandating detention for aliens with criminal or terrorist-related grounds. The immigration detention framework is governed by four main provisions under the INA. These include detention for applicants for admission under INA Section 235(b), mandatory detention for aliens subject to removal under INA Section 241(a), and detention authority that shifts as aliens progress through different phases of review. These statutes and regulations dictate the detention of aliens based on various factors such as criminal history and removal orders. The INA Section 236(a) is the default rule for aliens in removal proceedings, administered by ICE. It allows for discretionary arrest and detention of aliens pending formal removal proceedings, with exceptions for mandatory detention of certain criminal aliens. ICE has two options when detaining aliens under INA Section 236(a): continue detention or release on bond or conditional parole. Work authorization may not be granted upon release, and ICE can revoke bond or parole at any time. ICE may enroll released aliens in an Alternatives to Detention program for monitoring. ICE has the authority to monitor and supervise released aliens to ensure their appearance at a removal proceeding. An immigration officer must make a custody determination within 48 hours of an alien's arrest, unless there is an emergency or extraordinary circumstance. After ICE's initial custody determination, an alien may request a bond hearing before an immigration judge (IJ) within the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review. The IJ has the authority to determine whether to keep the alien in custody or release them, and to set the bond amount. The immigration judge (IJ) has the authority to release the alien and set the bond amount. The alien can request a later bond redetermination only if their circumstances have materially changed. Appeals can be made to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), but filing an appeal does not usually stop the IJ's decision. The BIA can stay the IJ's custody determination on its own motion or if DHS appeals. If ICE had set bond at $10,000 or more, any release order by the IJ is automatically stayed upon DHS's notice of intent to appeal. Following the enactment of IIRIRA, regulations were established by the DOJ for discretionary detention and release decisions under INA Section 236(a). The burden is on the alien to prove they do not pose a danger to the community and are likely to appear for future proceedings in order to be released from custody. Some federal courts have ruled that an alien must demonstrate they do not pose a danger to the community before the IJ can assess the flight risk posed by the alien. Some federal courts require a bond hearing for prolonged detention under INA Section 236(a) to determine if the government must prove continued detention is justified. The burden of proof for custody determinations remains unresolved by the Supreme Court, with due process considerations potentially impacting the allocation of this burden. The Court has not decided if due process requires the government to prove prolonged detention is justified. INA Section 236(a) sets standards for release from ICE custody but doesn't specify factors for assessing danger or flight risk. The BIA allows consideration of various factors for custody status, such as residence length, family ties, employment history, court appearances, criminal record, and immigration history. The BIA and other authorities consider factors like criminal offenses, immigration violations, attempts to flee, and manner of entry when reviewing custody determinations. Evidence in the record can be used to assess an alien's danger to the community or flight risk. Direct and circumstantial evidence, including national security considerations, are considered in determining dangerousness. Evidence from removal hearings can be used in custody hearings. During a custody hearing, evidence from a removal hearing can be considered if it is part of the bond record. Immigration Judges (IJ) cannot determine custody conditions for certain classes of aliens, as ICE has exclusive authority over their custody status. This applies to arriving aliens in formal removal proceedings, those deportable for security reasons, and those subject to mandatory detention for specific crimes under the INA Section 236(c). Aliens falling into these categories cannot request a custody determination. Aliens detained under INA Section 236(c) based on criminal or terrorist-related conduct may seek a redetermination of custody conditions from ICE. They can request a determination by an IJ that they do not properly fall within the designated category and are entitled to a bond hearing. An alien can request review of ICE's custody determination at a bond hearing before an IJ and appeal the IJ's custody decision to the BIA. INA Section 236(e) bars judicial review of a decision whether to detain or release an alien subject to removal. The Supreme Court has ruled that INA provisions do not prevent judicial review in habeas corpus proceedings for an alien's challenge to detention, despite INA Section 236(e) limiting judicial review. This allows federal courts to review statutory or constitutional challenges to an alien's detention, distinguishing it from discretionary decisions on detention. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal courts can review statutory or constitutional challenges to an alien's detention in habeas corpus proceedings, despite limitations on judicial review under INA Section 236(e). The Supreme Court allows federal courts to review challenges to an alien's detention in habeas corpus proceedings, despite limitations on judicial review under INA Section 236(e). INA Section 242(b)(9) restricts review of specific actions related to removal, but does not bar claims challenging the government's authority to detain aliens. INA Section 236(a) allows immigration officials to detain aliens pending removal proceedings, while Section 236(c) mandates detention for aliens with criminal or terrorist-related grounds for removal. Section 236(c)(1) specifies four categories of aliens subject to detention, including those convicted of certain crimes like moral turpitude, drug offenses, and human trafficking. The statute instructs ICE to detain aliens convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude, controlled substance violations, firearm offenses, or terrorist activities upon their release from criminal custody. ICE is required to detain aliens convicted of certain crimes upon their release from criminal custody. However, they may be released if necessary to protect witnesses or if they do not pose a danger and are likely to appear for proceedings. The severity of the offense committed is considered in the decision-making process. The detention of aliens under INA Section 236(c) is mandatory without special circumstances, with no right to a bond hearing before an IJ. However, the alien can request a determination from an IJ that they are not properly subject to mandatory detention. The IJ should conduct an independent assessment of DHS's decision to charge the alien with specified criminal or terrorist-related grounds of removability. The BIA clarifies that an alien may not be subject to mandatory detention under INA Section 236(c) if it is unlikely that DHS can prove the charges. If the alien is not included in this section, the IJ can consider bond eligibility under INA Section 236(a). Challenges to the constitutionality of mandatory detention under INA Section 236(c) have not been successful so far. In Demore v. Kim, an LPR argued that his detention violated due process as no determination of danger or flight risk was made. The Ninth Circuit ruled INA Section 236(c) unconstitutional as it denied due process to LPRs like Kim by not allowing them to seek bail. However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision, stating that mandatory detention of certain aliens during removal proceedings is constitutionally permissible. The Court emphasized Congress's authority to establish rules for aliens that may not apply to citizens and the government's right to detain deportable aliens temporarily for removal proceedings. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory detention for certain aliens during removal proceedings, emphasizing Congress's authority to establish rules for aliens. This decision overturned the Ninth Circuit's ruling that denied due process to lawful permanent residents like Kim by not allowing them to seek bail. In Zadvydas, continued detention of aliens after completion of proceedings was deemed impractical and not serving its immigration purpose. Unlike Zadvydas, INA Section 236(c) detention has a definite endpoint at the end of removal proceedings. While Demore upheld mandatory detention, limits on the duration of detention under INA Section 236(c) remain unresolved. Lower courts have interpreted Demore to apply to brief detention periods. Jennings v. Rodriguez affirmed DHS's authority to indefinitely detain aliens pending removal. In Nielsen v. Preap, the Supreme Court affirmed DHS's authority to indefinitely detain aliens pending removal proceedings under INA Section 236(c)(1) and (2), regardless of when the alien was released from criminal custody. The Court clarified that the mandatory detention scheme applies to aliens who have committed specified criminal or terrorist-related offenses. The Supreme Court affirmed DHS's authority to detain aliens under INA Section 236(c)(1) regardless of when they were released from criminal custody. The Court clarified that the mandatory detention applies to aliens who committed specified offenses, and the timing of release does not affect the detention requirement. The Supreme Court affirmed DHS's authority to detain aliens under INA Section 236(c)(1) regardless of when they were released from criminal custody. The Court reversed a Ninth Circuit decision and clarified that the mandatory detention applies to aliens who committed specified offenses, with timing of release not affecting the detention requirement. The Supreme Court affirmed DHS's authority to detain aliens under INA Section 236(c)(1) regardless of when they were released from criminal custody. The Court clarified that mandatory detention applies to aliens who committed specified offenses, with timing of release not affecting the detention requirement. The ruling does not prevent constitutional challenges to the statute's application. Under INA Section 235(b), an \"applicant for admission\" is detained pending a determination on their admissibility into the United States, covering aliens arriving at the U.S. border or those apprehended within the country. The mandatory detention scheme applies to applicants subject to expedited removal or formal removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security can use expedited removal for aliens who lack valid entry documents or have attempted fraud, mainly targeting arriving aliens, those who arrived by sea in the last two years without admission, and those found within 100 miles of the border within 14 days without admission. The Department of Homeland Security can use expedited removal for aliens who lack valid entry documents or have attempted fraud, mainly targeting arriving aliens, those who arrived by sea in the last two years without admission, and those found within 100 miles of the border within 14 days without admission. An alien subject to expedited removal may be removed without a hearing or further review unless indicating an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution. If a credible fear is established, the alien will be placed in formal removal proceedings under INA Section 240 to pursue asylum and related protections. DHS regulations state that aliens can be detained pending expedited removal determination, including during credible fear assessment. If no credible fear is found, the alien remains detained until removal. Aliens are initially detained by CBP for processing and then transferred to ICE custody for credible fear determination if seeking asylum. DHS may parole aliens for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit on a case-by-case basis. Based on DHS regulations, aliens in expedited removal proceedings can be paroled for medical emergencies or law enforcement objectives. Those with credible fear of persecution or torture are detained for further asylum consideration. DHS may parole applicants for admission if they meet certain criteria, such as serious medical conditions or urgent humanitarian reasons. Under DHS regulations, aliens in expedited removal proceedings can be paroled for medical emergencies or law enforcement objectives. Parole may be granted to individuals with serious medical conditions, pregnant women, juveniles, witnesses in legal proceedings, and those not deemed a flight risk. The grant of parole ends upon the alien's departure from the United States or when DHS determines it is no longer necessary. Aliens apprehended after unlawfully entering the United States, who were screened for expedited removal and placed in formal removal proceedings following a positive credible fear determination, were not subject to mandatory detention under INA Section 235(b)(1). The BIA determined that these aliens could be released on bond under INA Section 236(a) because they did not fall within the designated classes of aliens ineligible for bond hearings. However, in 2019, AG William Barr overturned this decision, ruling that INA Section 235(b)(1)'s mandatory detention scheme applies to all aliens in formal removal proceedings after a positive credible fear determination, regardless of their manner of entry. AG William Barr overturned the BIA's decision in 2019, ruling that all aliens in formal removal proceedings after a positive credible fear determination, regardless of their manner of entry, must be detained until completion of their formal removal proceedings. This decision was based on INA Section 235(b)(1) and the Supreme Court's interpretation in Jennings v. Rodriguez. Despite DOJ regulations not expressly barring nonarriving aliens from seeking bond, the AG concluded that the regulatory framework does not provide an exhaustive list of aliens ineligible for bond. The court ruled that aliens apprehended in the US, screened for expedited removal, and placed in formal removal proceedings after a positive credible fear determination are entitled to a bond hearing. The government was ordered to provide bond hearings within seven days of a request, release detainees exceeding the time limit without a hearing, and require DHS to prove the need for continued detention. The DOJ has appealed the decision. The DOJ has appealed the district court's ruling to the Ninth Circuit, which has stayed the injunction requiring bond hearings within seven days for aliens in formal removal proceedings. The court upheld the order granting bond hearings to aliens initially screened for expedited removal and placed in formal removal proceedings after a positive credible fear determination. The district court's ruling allows aliens apprehended in the US to seek bond for formal removal proceedings after a positive credible fear determination. Arriving aliens in formal removal proceedings are not covered and must remain detained unless granted parole by DHS. INA Section 235(b)(2) covers applicants for admission not subject to expedited removal, including unadmitted aliens inadmissible for various reasons. The statute covers aliens who entered the US without inspection but were not apprehended within two years. They may be detained pending removal proceedings, with parole possible in certain circumstances. Without parole, these aliens must be detained and cannot seek release on bond. INA Section 241(a) governs detention after removal proceedings for aliens with a final removal order. The Supreme Court has interpreted the post-order of removal detention statute to have implicit temporal limitations. INA Section 241(a)(1) requires DHS to remove an alien ordered removed within a 90-day \"removal period.\" The removal period begins on the date the order of removal becomes final, the date of a court's final order if a stay is ordered, or the date of release from nonimmigration detention. Certain aliens may be subject to detention beyond the 90-day period. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) Section 241(a)(2) mandates DHS to detain aliens during the 90-day removal period, prohibiting their release if found inadmissible or deportable on criminal or terrorist-related grounds. The former INS guidance allowed for the detention of non-criminal aliens during this period, but current policy emphasizes the detention of terrorists and criminal aliens. The Immigration and Nationality Act mandates the detention of terrorists and criminal aliens during the 90-day removal period, but allows for release if the alien has been granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. If the alien fails to make timely application for necessary documents for departure, detention may be extended beyond 90 days. If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, they will be released. If an alien with a final removal order does not leave or is not removed within the 90-day removal period, they will be released under supervision. The order of supervision includes reporting to an immigration officer, efforts to obtain a travel document, mental or physical examination, travel approval, and address updates. INA Section 241(a)(6) allows for detention beyond the removal period if necessary. INA Section 241(a)(6) allows for detention beyond the 90-day removal period for certain categories of aliens, including those who are inadmissible, deportable for specified crimes, or deemed a risk to the community. ICE conducts a custody review before the end of the removal period for these individuals. ICE conducts a custody review before the end of the removal period for certain categories of aliens, including those who are inadmissible, deportable for specified crimes, or deemed a risk to the community. Factors considered for further detention include the alien's disciplinary and criminal record, mental health reports, and family ties in the United States. ICE may release the alien after the removal period if travel documents are unavailable, the alien is non-violent, unlikely to endanger the community, and does not pose a significant flight risk. ICE may impose conditions upon an alien's release, including periodic reporting requirements. If custody is maintained, ICE can retain authority for up to three months after the removal period. After this, the alien may be released or referred for further custody review. If detained, reviews must be conducted annually. After a final order of removal, DHS can detain an alien annually, with a limit of six months post-order of removal detention based on Zadvydas v. Davis case. This limitation is to comply with due process principles and avoid constitutional concerns. The Court determined that indefinite detention of aliens after removal raises serious constitutional concerns under the Due Process Clause. Freedom from government custody is a core liberty protected by the Clause, and the Court found no justifications for such detention. The Court concluded that the statute could not be lawfully construed as authorizing indefinite detention. The Zadvydas Court rejected the government's argument for indefinite detention pending removal, citing the Due Process Clause's protection for all persons in the US. They found no indication that Congress intended to allow indefinite confinement for individuals ordered removed. The Supreme Court in Zadvydas v. Davis ruled that individuals ordered removed cannot be indefinitely detained. The Court interpreted INA Section 241(a)(6) to authorize detention only for a period necessary for removal, with a six-month limit after a final removal order. If the six-month period passes, the alien must be released if removal is unlikely in the foreseeable future. The Supreme Court in Martinez v. Greene extended the six-month time limitation from Zadvydas to inadmissible aliens, stating that the provision should be interpreted the same for both admitted and nonadmitted aliens. Justice Scalia, who dissented in Zadvydas, wrote the majority opinion relying on statutory construction principles. The Supreme Court extended the six-month time limit from Zadvydas to inadmissible aliens, rejecting the government's argument for a different interpretation. Regulations were issued for aliens detained beyond the 90-day removal period to request release if removal is not likely in the foreseeable future. The HQPDU considers alien's request and decides on likelihood of removal. If no significant likelihood, ICE releases alien with conditions. If significant likelihood, alien remains detained. Special circumstances may warrant continued detention for aliens with contagious diseases, adverse foreign policy consequences, and other specified reasons. The release of aliens with significant threats to national security or risk of terrorism may have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States. Some courts have ruled that the INS exceeded its authority by allowing continued detention of aliens in special circumstances. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits concluded that the Supreme Court did not create an exception for indefinite detention of particularly dangerous aliens post-order of removal. Congress has the power to enact laws allowing prolonged detention of certain types of aliens, but INA Section 241(a)(6) does not limit this authority. The Tenth Circuit ruled that INA Section 241(a)(6) allows indefinite detention in special circumstances. DHS has broad authority to detain aliens subject to removal, with mandatory detention for certain classes of aliens. The Supreme Court has not yet decided on indefinite post-order removal detention. The INA provisions allow indefinite detention of aliens during removal proceedings, which has raised constitutional concerns. The Flores Settlement limits the detention of alien minors, and there are criticisms regarding the lack of regulations for confinement conditions. Legal challenges have been raised against DHS's authority to detain aliens for immigration enforcement purposes. In Zadvydas v. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that indefinite detention of aliens after removal proceedings raised constitutional issues, with a six-month time limitation implied. Demore v. Kim in 2003 found mandatory detention of aliens pending removal proceedings constitutionally permissible, but the duration of such detention was not addressed. Lower courts later ruled that prolonged detention of aliens pending removal proceedings raised similar constitutional concerns as post-order detention. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in Jennings v. Rodriguez that the government can indefinitely detain aliens pending removal proceedings, but left constitutional questions unresolved. The case involved aliens detained under various INA sections, with a class action claiming prolonged detention without a bond hearing violated due process rights. The Ninth Circuit upheld a permanent injunction in 2015, requiring individualized bond hearings for aliens detained longer than six months. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the INA's detention statutes should have implicit time limitations, interpreting mandatory detention provisions to expire after six months. This decision was made in response to concerns about indefinite detention of aliens pending removal proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ruled that INA Section 236(a) requires bond hearings every six months, with continued detention only if DHS proves it necessary. The Supreme Court in Jennings rejected the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, stating it couldn't rely on the constitutional avoidance doctrine. The Court distinguished Zadvydas, as the post-order of removal detention statute didn't clearly mandate detention after the 90-day removal period. The Jennings Court differentiated the ambiguity of the detention statute from INA Sections 235(b) and 236(c), which require detention of covered aliens until removal proceedings are completed. It stated that INA Section 236(a) does not mandate bond hearings or require the government to prove the necessity of continued detention after six months. The Ninth Circuit's interpretation was rejected by the Court. The Jennings Court remanded the case to address the plaintiffs' claim of unconstitutional indefinite detention during removal proceedings. The Court held that the government can detain aliens indefinitely but did not rule on the constitutionality of such detention. After the Jennings decision, lower courts have ruled that prolonged detention of aliens during removal proceedings without a bond hearing may violate due process. Some courts have extended these constitutional limitations to aliens arriving in the United States, stating they have sufficient due process rights to challenge prolonged detention. This interpretation has considered the Supreme Court's 1953 decision in Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei. Some courts have ruled that prolonged detention of aliens during removal proceedings without a bond hearing may violate due process. The Supreme Court may decide on the constitutionality of indefinite detention of aliens pending removal proceedings, potentially reassessing constitutional protections for arriving aliens seeking entry into the United States. The Supreme Court may clarify the federal government's detention authority for arriving aliens seeking entry into the United States. The Court may address whether due process requires the government to justify continued detention at a bond hearing. The Flores Settlement limits the detention period for alien minors, while unaccompanied alien children are typically placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement during removal proceedings. The Flores Settlement, originating from a 1985 class action lawsuit by UACs challenging detention conditions, limits detention periods for alien minors. In 1993, the Supreme Court upheld the INS's policy of releasing UACs only to parents or guardians, stating no constitutional right to release to any available adult. In 1997, a settlement agreement was reached creating a policy favoring the release of alien minors in INS custody. The Flores Settlement requires transfer of detained minors to a qualifying adult or facility within five days, with exceptions for emergencies or influx of minors. In 2001, it was stipulated that the Flores Settlement would terminate after final regulations were implemented. Congress partially codified the Flores Settlement in the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. The TVPRA of 2008 partially codified the Flores Settlement by setting standards for the treatment of unaccompanied minors. It requires UACs to be placed in ORR custody within 72 hours and placed in the least restrictive setting. In 2015, the Flores plaintiffs accused DHS of violating the settlement by implementing a no-release policy for Central American families. The Flores Settlement applies to both accompanied and unaccompanied minors, requiring accompanying parents to be released with their children. The court allowed DHS to exceed the five-day detention limit in cases of an influx of minors, suggesting 20 days may be reasonable. The Ninth Circuit upheld that the settlement applies to minors but does not require parents to be released with their children. The Flores Settlement requires family units to be released together pending removal proceedings, as releasing children only poses risks. A federal court ruled that family separation without cause violates due process. DHS published a final rule creating a federal licensing scheme for family detention facilities to detain minors with their parents during removal proceedings. The Flores Settlement requires family units to be released together pending removal proceedings, but DHS argues that detaining families together is necessary due to increased family unit apprehensions. The key question in the Flores litigation will be whether the final rule implements the Agreement, potentially leading to the termination of the settlement. The DHS rule may supersede the Flores Settlement if it meets certain criteria. While the rule modifies the settlement to some extent, it largely incorporates its terms. DHS's detention authority over alien minors would still have constraints if the rule is upheld. ICE has developed standards for the treatment of detained aliens, including clean and safe facilities. The PBNDS and CBP standards outline various requirements for immigration detention facilities, including clean and safe conditions, access to medical care, communication assistance, visitation rights, and legal materials. While the Supreme Court has addressed challenges to the duration of immigration detention, lower courts have considered challenges to the conditions of confinement. Constitutional challenges to conditions of confinement in immigration detention facilities are typically evaluated under the standard applicable to pretrial detention in criminal cases. To establish a violation of due process, detainees must show that the conditions amount to \"punishment\" and are not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective. Courts often use the \"deliberate indifference\" standard in cases involving inadequate medical treatment, which looks at whether the detaining authority disregards a risk to inmate health or safety. Despite lesser constitutional protections for aliens seeking entry into the U.S., some courts have held that aliens detained at the border have rights. Some courts have recognized that aliens detained at the border have substantive due process protections, including the right to be free from inhumane treatment. While some challenges to immigration detention conditions have been rejected, detainees may sometimes challenge the conditions of their confinement. Loss of freedom and privacy are inherent in confinement, and discomfort does not necessarily constitute a due process violation. Some courts have ruled unconstitutional conditions of immigration confinement, such as deprivation of medical care. The Flores Settlement mandates minors be detained in \"safe and sanitary\" facilities, with routine medical care and education provided. Congress has also imposed requirements on detention conditions. Congress has imposed requirements on detention conditions, including reporting compliance with standards and providing detention-related information. ICE may detain aliens pending removal decisions, and use immigration detainers if aliens are in criminal custody by local law enforcement. ICE can take custody of aliens through immigration detainers issued to local law enforcement. These detainers request actions to facilitate removal, authorized by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. INS regulations govern detainers for aliens arrested for controlled substance offenses and other criminal offenses. The INS regulations govern detainers for aliens arrested for controlled substance offenses and other criminal offenses. The detainer regulation allows immigration officers to issue a Form I-247 to request custody of an alien held by another law enforcement agency for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien. The regulation specifies that the law enforcement agency must maintain custody of the alien until ICE can assume custody. The regulation instructs that law enforcement officers must maintain custody of an alien for up to 48 hours after issuance of a detainer for transfer to ICE. However, courts have interpreted the detainer as a request rather than a mandatory order, citing anti-commandeering principles of the Tenth Amendment. Some state and local jurisdictions restrict compliance with detainers, despite ICE issuing detainers regardless of cooperation. Courts have addressed legal challenges to detaining aliens released from criminal custody. Courts have addressed legal challenges to detaining aliens released from criminal custody, such as cases where ICE issued detainers based on questionable grounds. For example, in Moreno v. Napolitano, a court ruled that ICE exceeded its authority by issuing detainers without an administrative arrest warrant. In Morales v. Chadbourne, the First Circuit held that a detainer constitutes a new arrest. In response to court rulings, ICE created new immigration detainer guidelines in 2017. Officers must establish probable cause before issuing a detainer, which must be accompanied by an administrative arrest warrant or a removal warrant signed by an authorized ICE officer. Despite the revised policy, some courts have held that detainers without proper basis are unconstitutional. Some courts have ruled that immigration detainers supported by probable cause do not justify an alien's continued detention by state or local law enforcement unless there is probable cause of a criminal offense. This is influenced by the Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States, which stated that only federal immigration officers have the authority to enforce civil immigration laws. State and local law enforcement lack this authority, so they may not hold an alien under an immigration detainer without independent probable cause. In City of El Cenizo v. Texas, the Fifth Circuit ruled that state and local law enforcement officers can hold an alien under an immigration detainer without probable cause of a crime. This decision is in contrast to other courts that require probable cause for continued detention. The debate over the legality of immigration detainers under the Fourth Amendment remains unresolved. Some courts debate whether immigration detainers require probable cause of criminal activity or just removability under the Fourth Amendment. This split could impact ICE's enforcement policies. DHS has authority to detain aliens subject to removal, but laws may vary based on circumstances like initial admission or type of removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to detain aliens based on various factors such as criminal activity, type of removal proceedings, and special categories like Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). Detention may be mandatory in certain cases, like for aliens who have committed specified crimes or are in expedited removal proceedings. Aliens in formal removal proceedings may be released on bond, recognizance, or supervision pending the outcome. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to detain aliens for up to 90 days after final removal orders, with discretion to detain certain classes of aliens beyond that period. The Supreme Court has raised concerns about indefinite detention, especially for lawfully admitted aliens. Lower courts have required bond hearings for detained aliens after prolonged periods to justify continued detention. The Department of Homeland Security's detention power is limited by the Flores Settlement, which restricts the length of detention for alien minors. Court battles over detention have focused on duration and conditions, with recent restrictions on DHS's ability to take custody of aliens from state or local law enforcement. Congress may consider proposals to either limit or expand detention authority, including bills to end mandatory detention, allow release on bond, and require proof for continued detention. Some bills propose regulations for detention facilities, periodic inspections, and standards for conditions of detention. They suggest considering alternatives to detention, releasing vulnerable aliens, and limiting bond amounts. Other bills create time limits for bond hearings and allow indefinite detention pending removal. Some bills propose expanding classes of aliens subject to mandatory detention, overriding the Flores Settlement, and clarifying DHS's detainer authority. Congress may consider additional legislative options to inform the scope of detention authority as reviewing courts test the limits.
