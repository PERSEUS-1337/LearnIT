    "content": "Section 1 introduces expensing and rapid amortization for certain environmental remediation expenditures under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The taxpayer can elect to treat qualified environmental remediation expenditures as expenses not chargeable to capital account, allowing them as a deduction. There is a $500,000 limitation for expenses on qualified contaminated sites. Controlled groups follow similar rules as section 179(d). Additionally, there is an option for a 60-month amortization of remaining environmental remediation expenditures. Qualified environmental remediation expenditures can be treated as deferred expenses by the taxpayer, allowing for a deduction over a period of not less than 60 months. These deferred expenses are considered capital expenditures for tax purposes. The taxpayer may not be eligible for treatment under this section for a qualified contaminated site if they were the owner or operator of a business on the site before the enactment of the section, or if they arranged for disposal of hazardous materials at the site. For qualified environmental remediation expenditures, taxpayers can claim expenses for cleaning up contaminated sites they own. The definition of a qualified contaminated site is determined by environmental conditions certified by the appropriate agency. The environmental conditions on a qualified contaminated site include a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, storage tanks with hazardous substances, and illegal disposal of solid waste. Sites listed on the National Priorities List are excluded. The appropriate agency determines the certification of environmental conditions. The site designated by the Administrator of the EPA or a local government agency is considered hazardous if it meets criteria under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The term 'environmental remediation' refers to removal or remediation activities, restoration of natural resources, and mitigation of losses incurred in connection with hazardous substances like petroleum, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and urea formaldehyde foam insulation. The term 'environmental remediation' includes activities such as health assessments, environmental investigations, off-site contamination remediation, and other necessary costs related to site conditions. Persons are considered related if they are treated as a single employer or have specified relationships under regulations. The section excludes expenditures for land acquisition or improvement, and property subject to depreciation or depletion allowances. Conforming amendments include adding qualified environmental remediation expenditures to the list of allowable deductions. The Code is amended to include qualified environmental remediation expenditures as allowable deductions. Amendments are made to various subparagraphs in the Code to reflect this change. Sec. 198 allows for expensing and rapid amortization of certain environmental remediation expenditures for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
