    "content": "The \"Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act of 2005\" is cited as the short title. It includes an exclusion of gain from the sale of qualified farm property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act of 2005\" excludes a percentage of gain from the sale of qualified farm property for first-time farmers and others meeting certification requirements. The exclusion is limited to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately) per taxable year. The exclusion under the \"Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act of 2005\" for first-time farmers is limited to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately) per taxable year. The amount of the exclusion on a joint return is allocated equally between spouses for future taxable years. The definition of a first-time farmer is based on specific criteria outlined in the Act. The material and substantial participation standard for a qualified farm is met if a first-time farmer performs 1,000 hours of service or provides half the required management and labor. Qualified farm property is real property used for farming purposes for at least 3 years out of the last 5 years. The taxpayer must have materially participated in the operation of the farm for at least 3 years out of the last 5 years to qualify for certain benefits. The terms 'member of the family', 'farm', 'farming purposes', and 'material participation' are defined in section 2032A(e). The certification requirement for qualified farm property is that it must be used for farming purposes for a minimum of 10 years. Special rules apply, similar to those in other sections. If there is a recapture event with the property, certain consequences will follow. If property is transferred in a sale or exchange as described in subsection (a), the taxpayer's tax under this chapter for the taxable year will increase by the applicable recapture percentage multiplied by 10% of the adjusted basis in the property. The applicable recapture percentage is determined from a specific table. The applicable recapture percentage varies depending on the number of years since the sale or exchange, starting at 100% for years 1-5 and decreasing to 0% for years 10 and beyond. A recapture event is defined as the cessation of operation. The cessation of operation of a property described in subsection (a) as a farm for farming purposes triggers recapture, unless the new owner agrees to assume the recapture liability. The new owner of a property must agree in writing to assume recapture liability if the property ceases to operate as a farm for farming purposes. The person acquiring the property will be treated as the taxpayer for assessing any recapture liability, with special rules in place to prevent tax credits and recapture due to hardship. The increase in tax under this subsection shall not apply to any disposition of property or cessation of the operation of any property as a farm for farming purposes by reason of any hardship as determined by the Secretary. Sec. 121A. Exclusion of gain from sale of qualified farm property. The amendment applies to sales or exchanges after the enactment date, in taxable years ending after that date."
