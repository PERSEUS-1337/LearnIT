    "content": "The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017\" may be cited as the Act. It includes provisions for compensatory time. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to allow private employees to receive compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime compensation, at a rate of one and one-half hours for each hour of overtime worked. This can only be provided under certain conditions, such as through a collective bargaining agreement. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 allows private employees to receive compensatory time off instead of monetary overtime compensation under specific conditions, such as through a collective bargaining agreement or a pre-agreed employer-employee arrangement. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 allows private employees to receive compensatory time off voluntarily, not as a condition of employment. Employees must have worked at least 1,000 hours in a 12-month period before receiving compensatory time off. An employee can accrue a maximum of 160 hours of compensatory time and must be compensated for any unused time by January 31 of each year. An employer may provide monetary compensation for an employee's unused compensatory time in excess of 80 hours at any time after giving the employee at least 30 days notice. Such compensation shall be provided at the rate prescribed by paragraph (6). An employer offering compensatory time can discontinue the policy with 30 days notice. Employees can withdraw from the agreement or request monetary compensation for unused compensatory time. The employer must provide the compensation within 30 days of the request. Employees cannot be intimidated, threatened, or coerced to use compensatory time off instead of monetary overtime pay. Upon termination, employees must be compensated for unused compensatory time at the same rate. Employees must be compensated for unused compensatory time at a rate not less than their regular rate when the time was accrued or when the payment is received, whichever is higher. This payment is considered unpaid overtime compensation. Employees who have accrued compensatory time off are allowed to use it within a reasonable period after requesting it, as long as it does not disrupt the employer's operations. The term 'employee' excludes public agency employees, and 'overtime compensation' and 'compensatory time' have specific meanings as defined in subsection (o)(7). SEC. 3. REMEDIES.\n\nAmends the Fair Labor Standards Act to hold employers liable for compensatory time violations.
