    "content": "Dreams and our ability to recall them are puzzling questions in sleep research. This study used deep convolutional networks on sleep EEG recordings to classify high and low dream recall groups. The model achieved significant accuracy levels, revealing subtle signatures of dream recall in sleep microstructure. Visualizing the feature space confirmed subject-specific differences and highlighted discriminant features. This is the first study to apply deep learning to classify dream recall groups using sleep EEG data. In this study, guided backpropagation was used to visualize discriminant features in different sleep stages. Deep learning methods were employed to identify optimal patterns in pre-processed EEG data for classification into HDR and LDR groups. The interpretability of deep models in neuroimaging applications remains a challenge. The study involved 36 participants, and a CNN was used for classification. Various techniques were explored to visualize the learned features. The preprocessed data is passed through an extractor to capture spatial patterns. A leave 2-subjects-out strategy was used to test cross-subject accuracy. t-SNE plots were generated to visualize the feature space learned by the model, showing no visible clusters. The study used deep learning to analyze neural activities of HDR and LDR. A deep CNN was trained to classify between the two groups with significant decoding accuracies. The feature space learned did not show subject-specific clusters, indicating population-level differences. tSNE was used to check for subject overfitting and GB to identify group-specific brain regions. The study utilized deep learning to analyze neural activities of HDR and LDR, training a deep CNN to classify between the two groups with significant decoding accuracies. Visualisation tools were used to check for subject overfitting and identify group-specific brain regions. Future work will explore other dimensions, such as frequency components contributing to classification."
