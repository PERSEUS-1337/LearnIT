SEC. 5 confirms and validates all past actions taken by public bodies regarding annexation, inclusion, detachment, consolidation, merger, or dissolution of territories or public bodies. SEC. 6 authorizes, confirms, and validates all past actions related to the issuance of bonds by public bodies for public purposes. All bonds issued by public bodies are legally binding obligations, whether previously issued, awarded and sold, authorized by ordinance, resolution, order, or through election. Bonds authorized by a public body through election are legally binding obligations when issued and delivered in accordance with that authorization. SEC. 7 of this act validates acts and proceedings previously taken under legislative authorization, limited by the California and United States Constitutions. It does not legalize any contested matters in legal proceedings within 30 days of the act's effective date. SEC. 8 of the act does not authorize or legalize any act, proceeding, or contract that has been previously determined to be illegal or void. Any challenge to the validity of actions taken under laws for the formation, organization, or changes to public bodies must be filed within six months of the effective date of this act. Otherwise, such actions will be considered valid and legally binding. This act does not extend the time limit for legal action beyond what is already barred by statutes of limitations or laches. The curr_chunk discusses the time limit for legal action, extending it beyond the existing statute of limitations. The curr_chunk clarifies that the creation or boundary changes of public bodies must be filed in accordance with specific government code sections for assessment or taxation purposes. It also states that the act is urgent for validating public bodies promptly."
