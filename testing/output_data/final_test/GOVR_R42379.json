    "content": "The roles of Congress in influencing government performance are extensive and significant. Congress can establish agencies, their missions, processes, priorities, and resource levels through law. It can also influence agencies and OMB through non-statutory means, conduct oversight, and study policy problems. Congress may cooperate or compete with the President to shape public policy implementation. GPRAMA, like GPRA 1993, focuses on goal-setting, measurement, and evaluation, which can be politically contested. Success definitions for program performance assessment may also be disputed. Program evaluations and performance measurement are tools used to assess program performance. Program evaluations assess how programs achieve objectives or cause unintended consequences, while performance measurement involves periodic data collection related to programs. Performance measures alone may not reflect program effectiveness due to external factors. Combining measurement and evaluation can inform policy making along with other analyses and considerations. Congress may use performance information to inform its policy making, oversight, and thinking. Challenges include bias scrutiny and relevance of information to policy problems. Congress may also establish federal policies related to goal-setting, planning, and evaluation processes. The government's goal-setting, planning, and evaluation processes are guided by policies like GPRA 1993 and GPRAMA. Congress may require agencies to involve stakeholders in goal-setting and act transparently. These policies aim to provide useful information for Congress, agencies, the President, and the public to inform policy making and oversight. This CRS report focuses on the information and opportunities generated by GPRAMA. GPRAMA significantly modified and expanded upon the framework established by GPRA 1993, drawing from various sources including the views of the law's authors, the Obama and Bush administrations, a Senate Budget Committee task force, and the Government Accountability Office. These influences, along with the government's experience with GPRA 1993, may offer insights into current issues with GPRAMA's design and implementation. This report focuses on GPRAMA's statutory requirements and the information it may provide for Congress. GPRAMA builds upon GPRA 1993 by introducing new agency-level products and processes, executive branch-wide changes, and institutional modifications. The law retains three agency-level products with new names and additional requirements. One of these products is the Agency Strategic Plan (ASP), which must be posted on the agency's website for four years. GPRAMA introduces new requirements for Agency Strategic Plans, aligning their development with presidential terms and budget proposals. Plans must cover four fiscal years and be updated every four years, with a deadline set for the first Monday in February. Agencies are also required to describe how they collaborate with other agencies to achieve goals. GPRAMA requires agencies to adjust their Strategic Plans to conform to its requirements by the deadline for the President's FY2013 budget proposal. Agencies must consult with Congress and stakeholders, following specific requirements for consultation with Congress during plan development or adjustment. GPRAMA mandates agencies to consult with Congress and stakeholders when developing or adjusting an Agency Performance Plan (APP). The plan must include performance goals and indicators for measuring progress. Under GPRAMA, the Agency Performance Plan (APP) must include performance goals, indicators, and new requirements such as addressing management challenges, identifying low-priority activities with justification, and assigning goal leaders. The plan covers the forthcoming fiscal year and the current year it is submitted, making it a two-year goal-setting product. The Agency Performance Update (APU) under GPRAMA provides performance indicators from the Agency Performance Plan, compares goals with actual results, and explains reasons for unmet goals. It must also offer data of significant value more frequently if feasible. The Agency Performance Update (APU) under GPRAMA is expected to be available within 150 days after the fiscal year ends. Agencies are likely to meet this deadline sooner. GPRAMA introduces new requirements for goal-setting, implementation reviews, and plans and reports at the agency level. Every two years, certain executive agencies must identify a small subset of performance goals as \"agency priority goals\" (APGs). GPRAMA requires agencies to set \"agency priority goals\" (APGs) in their Agency Performance Plans, with OMB playing a central role in determining the total number of goals and their development. The goals must reflect the agency's highest priorities as determined by the agency head, informed by OMB's \"federal government priority goals.\" GPRAMA requires agencies to set \"agency priority goals\" in their Agency Performance Plans, with OMB determining the total number of goals. Quarterly reviews are conducted to track progress towards achieving these goals, modeled after the Obama Administration's HPPG initiative. Timing requirements for the reviews were set starting from the third quarter of FY2011. GPRAMA requires agencies to set \"agency priority goals\" in their Agency Performance Plans, with OMB determining the total number of goals. Transparency is not required for the reviews, but some information about APGs must be included on an OMB website. Reports and plans are generated annually to address unmet goals, including agency priority goals. GPRAMA requires agencies to list all plans and reports produced for Congress annually, identifying a minimum percentage as \"outdated\" or \"duplicative.\" OMB determines the minimum percentage, starting at 10% in the first year. Agencies consult with congressional committees to determine if products are no longer useful. GPRAMA also adds new requirements for goal-setting, plans, implementation reviews, and reports at the executive branch level. Federal government priority goals (FGPGs) are outcome-oriented goals developed in two categories: policy areas cutting across agency boundaries and goals for management improvements. These goals include financial management, human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management. GPRAMA aligns the development of FGPGs with the President's budget proposal deadline, requiring updates every four years. GPRAMA requires OMB to consult with Congress periodically when developing or adjusting FGPGs. OMB is also required to coordinate with agencies to develop an annual Federal Government Performance Plan (FGPP) and submit it to Congress with the President's budget proposals. The FGPP must establish federal government performance goals for each priority goal. The Federal Government Performance Plan (FGPP) is a two-year plan that outlines goals for federal government priority goals. It designates a lead Government official for each goal and requires quarterly progress reviews. The reviews began in the third quarter of FY2012 and are not required to be transparent to Congress or the public. GPRAMA mandates OMB to establish a performance website for reporting on federal government priority goals. GPRAMA requires OMB to establish a performance website by October 1, 2012, accessible to Congress and the public. The website must provide information on agency and federal government priority goals, Federal Government Performance Plan details, Agency Strategic Plans, Performance Plans, Updates, and program explanations. GPRAMA requires the OMB performance website to be updated quarterly, but it is unclear which data categories will be updated on that schedule. The website does not need to show transparency into the quarterly reviews conducted by OMB and agencies for priority goals. The President's budget proposal must include a list of outdated or duplicative plans and reports agencies produce for Congress. GPRAMA requires agencies to identify outdated or duplicative reports and plans, consult with OMB and Congress, and may lead to draft legislation for elimination or consolidation of these products. The process involves institutional changes and consultations with officials and organizations. GPRAMA mandates institutional changes involving officials and organizations, with specific duties assigned to Chief Operating Officers (COOs) and Performance Improvement Officers (PIOs) in each agency. COOs are responsible for enhancing agency management and performance, while PIOs are designated to oversee performance improvement efforts. The Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) in an agency, whether a career civil servant or political appointee, reports directly to the agency's Chief Operating Officer. Their primary duties involve advising and assisting agency heads in goal-setting, planning, and performance measurement. The PIO also assists in quarterly reviews of progress towards goals and the development of performance measures. GPRAMA does not explicitly address transparency outside the executive branch regarding PIO activities. Additionally, GPRAMA establishes a Performance Improvement Council (PIC) with membership including OMB's Deputy Director for Management (DDM). The Performance Improvement Council, chaired by OMB's Deputy Director for Management, includes Performance Improvement Officers from CFO Act agencies. Its duties involve assisting OMB with GPRAMA topics, developing recommendations for OMB's Director or the President, and addressing crosscutting performance issues. The council's agenda and work are directed by OMB's DDM. GPRAMA does not provide transparency into the PIC's activities. Agency personnel are directed by OMB to serve on the Performance Improvement Council. The Performance Improvement Council, chaired by OMB's Deputy Director for Management, includes Performance Improvement Officers from CFO Act agencies. Agencies are required to provide personnel authorizations to support the PIC's duties and the President's performance-related agenda. GPRAMA mandates identifying officials responsible for specific goals and topics in Agency Performance Plans. GPRAMA requires agencies to designate goal leaders for achieving performance goals, lead government officials for federal government priority goals, and officials for resolving major management challenges. When goals are unmet, agencies must appoint senior officials to oversee performance improvement strategies. GPRAMA requires agencies to appoint officials to oversee performance improvement strategies for each goal. Various products and processes will be presented to Congress, with timelines aligned to coincide with the President's budget proposal. Figure 1 provides a visual timeline of GPRAMA's implementation requirements. GPRAMA requires agencies to submit products or processes by specific deadlines. Changes from prior practices include new names, modified contents, and extended coverage periods for Agency Performance Plans. Agency Strategic Plans must align with the President's budget proposal and be submitted on a four-year schedule. Quarterly reviews of high-priority performance goals were mandated starting in FY2011. GPRAMA requires agency priority goals to be included in FY2013 Agency Performance Plans and subject to quarterly reviews thereafter. The schedule for establishing and revising agency priority goals may vary over time and differ among Presidents. Deadlines align with submission of the President's budget proposal. A one-year transition from GPRA 1993 takes place, with some goals and plans characterized as \"interim\" or \"adjusted.\" Full implementation begins with the President's budget proposals for FY2014 and FY2015. The President's budget proposals for FY2014 and FY2015 align with GPRAMA requirements for Agency Strategic Plans and federal government priority goals. These products are submitted to Congress as inputs for its work, providing detailed information on agency goals, operations, and results. Viewing the interrelationships between products and processes can offer additional perspective. Figure 2 illustrates some of these interrelationships. Figure 2 illustrates how GPRAMA's products and processes reflect goal-setting at both the executive branch-wide and agency levels, with quarterly reviews of priority goals and information required to be included on the OMB website. GPRAMA requires OMB to establish federal government priority goals, such as FGPG 2 for food safety. The Federal Government Performance Plan must have performance goals for each FGPG, with quarterly progress reviews conducted by OMB. Results achieved for FGPG 2 are posted on the OMB website. OMB is required to post quarterly results for FGPG 2. Agency Strategic Plans must align agency goals with federal government priority goals. Agency Performance Plans outline how performance goals contribute to overall agency and government goals. Quarterly progress reviews are required for agency priority goals. GPRAMA establishes minimum expectations for OMB and agencies to post quarterly results online for each agency priority goal. The law brings additional attention to policy implementation and oversight, requiring Agency Performance Plans to be updated to reflect congressional action. Quarterly reviews focus on achieving goals during policy implementation. GPRAMA emphasizes goal-setting and performance measurement, with little focus on program evaluations. It provides a means for Congress to interact with agencies about specific tasks, but may not always clarify program performance or reasons for goal achievement. The law highlights the importance of goal-setting and performance across various areas. GPRAMA emphasizes goal-setting and performance measurement across federal programs and agencies. It establishes executive branch-wide products and processes, with provisions focusing on crosscutting policy areas. Assessments are required to determine if activities contribute to achieving goals, with agencies and OMB potentially using program evaluations or logic modeling for this purpose. The law also specifies requirements for agency and OMB interactions with Congress. GPRAMA mandates agency consultations with Congress to include majority and minority views from various committees. It also requires OMB to periodically consult with specific committees when coordinating federal government priority goals. Accountability is ensured through reporting on how congressional views were incorporated into goals. The implications of GPRAMA on working relationships and power dynamics in Congress remain to be seen. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plays a crucial role in implementing the President's vision across the Executive Branch. GPRAMA grants OMB statutory authorities to influence various products, processes, and institutions. If these reflect primarily the President's policy preferences, it may impact working relationships and power dynamics among Congress, agencies, OMB, the President, and the public. GPRAMA aligns products and processes with presidential terms and budget proposals, potentially impacting agencies' responsiveness to Congress. OMB's influence on agencies' goal-setting in Agency Strategic Plans may increase, as all agencies are required to submit draft ASPs for clearance simultaneously in the first year of a new President's term. This could enhance OMB's ability to direct agency choices and information presentation. GPRAMA's specific requirements for congressional consultations and transparency from the OMB performance website could impact power relationships. Congressional consultations may influence agency choices and foster collaboration. Specific issues for Congress during GPRAMA implementation include defining \"success\" and questions to consider. During GPRAMA implementation, Congress should consult with OMB on Agency Strategic Plans and federal government priority goals. Committees need to ensure meaningful consultations occur during plan formulation and assess agency responsiveness. Congress should also review the definition of \"program\" for OMB's performance website. It is crucial for goals to align with current law and congressional intent, and for plans to be well-coordinated and formulated. GPRAMA requires products to be submitted to Congress for policy deliberations. The credibility of agency representations on performance, appropriate definition of \"success,\" and use of policy analysis methods are key considerations. Congress should utilize resources for scrutiny and consider policy implications of evidence. Oversight, transparency, and public participation are essential. Recent activities of Performance Improvement Officers and the Performance Improvement Council, quarterly reviews, and the effectiveness of agencies and OMB in achieving goals are key areas of focus for oversight and transparency in policy development and implementation. The OMB performance website's provision of required information and record-keeping of goal revisions are also important considerations for Congress. The oversight and transparency in policy development and implementation focus on consulting with non-federal stakeholders, agency strategic plans, OMB and agency collaboration with Congress, and GPRAMA implementation for agency program managers and staff. Congress and observers are interested in crosscutting policy areas that involve collaboration or potential duplication of efforts among multiple agencies or programs. The OMB is required to provide information on agency programs and their contributions to agency goals. GAO reports on potential duplication and fragmentation, recommending further analysis and coordination. The effectiveness of agencies and OMB in using analytical resources and tools for coordination is questioned, along with implications for congressional committees and GPRAMA implementation. The phase-in period for GPRAMA is shorter compared to GPRA 1993. The implementation of GPRAMA is being questioned in terms of its design and execution by OMB and agencies. Key questions include how well GPRAMA serves Congress, agency personnel, the President, and the public, and whether agencies and OMB are complying adequately. The capacity of agencies to meet the law's requirements is also a concern, along with the need for potential enhancements in design or implementation. The CRS report lists acronyms used in government processes, including those related to GPRAMA and other laws. A glossary in Appendix B provides more information on these terms, which are often technical and interrelated. The glossary in Appendix B provides capsule summaries and statutory citations for terms related to GPRAMA, assisting in navigating through its products and processes."
