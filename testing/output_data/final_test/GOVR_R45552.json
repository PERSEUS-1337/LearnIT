    "content": "The 104th Congress added a provision to House Rule X requiring standing committees to adopt oversight plans. H.Res. 5 in the 115th Congress requested committees to review authorizations for programs. A provision in the 105th Congress allowed the Ways and Means Committee chair to request dynamic revenue estimates. In the 108th Congress, a point of order was established against tax legislation without a macroeconomic impact report. In the 114th Congress, a requirement was added for budget estimates to include a macroeconomic impact analysis. This provision was dropped in the 116th Congress. Additionally, a three-fifths majority vote was required to approve a federal income tax rate increase in the 104th Congress. In the 116th Congress, a former House rule known as the ''Gephardt rule'' was dropped, which allowed for automatic engrossment of a debt measure without a separate vote on the debt limit. This rule was first added in the 96th Congress. In the 116th Congress, the \"Gephardt rule\" allowing automatic engrossment of a debt measure without a separate vote on the debt limit was dropped. This rule was first added in the 96th Congress as Rule XLIX, renumbered as Rule XXVIII in the 106th Congress. It was suspended in the 104th-106th Congresses based on changes in public debt in concurrent resolutions, repealed in the 107th Congress, reinstated in the 108th Congress, and repealed again in the 112th Congress. H.Res. 6 in the 108th Congress established a similar requirement under House Rule XXVIII, allowing a measure to be engrossed and deemed passed by the House with the same vote as the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget setting a different public debt level. This measure suspends the debt limit through the end of the budget year. The new PAYGO rule in the House prohibits direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase the deficit in specific time periods. It applies to various types of legislative actions and is in effect for the current fiscal year and the following years. The House PAYGO rule replaces the previous CUTGO rule and applies to legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. Provisions can be exempted by designating them as an \"emergency.\" The House PAYGO rule allows exemptions for emergency designations and flexibility for combining measures to offset each other. It prohibits legislation causing long-term spending increases and has been adopted in previous Congresses. The House PAYGO rule includes exemptions for emergencies and allows flexibility in offsetting measures. It prohibits legislation causing long-term spending increases. The 113th and 114th Congresses had language requiring CBO to estimate spending increases exceeding $5 billion over 10-year periods. This language was not included in H.Res. 6. Advance appropriations refer to funds available for obligation in future fiscal years. In the House, limits on advance appropriations have been established in various ways, such as through budget resolutions or separate orders in the chamber's rules. In the 116th Congress, a separate order sets limits on advance appropriations for FY2020. The provision allows for advance appropriations for programs and activities under \"Veterans Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations\" starting from FY2019. A point of order under Section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act restricts measures or amendments that would exceed allocated funding. Members can only offer amendments to increase budget authority if it falls below the allocated suballocation or is accompanied by offsetting provisions. The House previously enforced budget restrictions through separate orders, including one prohibiting amendments that would increase budget authority in appropriations bills without an offset. This provision was in place for several Congresses but is not applicable for the current 116th Congress. The House previously enforced budget restrictions through separate orders, including one prohibiting amendments that would increase budget authority in appropriations bills without an offset. This provision was in place for several Congresses but is not applicable for the current 116th Congress. The order required any general appropriations bill to include a spending reduction account, serving as a temporary deposit box for amendments transferring budget authority. This language was not included in H.Res. 6. The \"Holman rule\" allows for legislative language in general appropriations bills to retrench expenditures by reducing amounts of money covered by the bill. This exception, named after Representative William Holman, was adopted in the 115th Congress to apply to reductions in bill amounts, officer salaries, and compensation paid out of the Treasury. The \"Holman rule\" was adopted in the 115th Congress to allow for reductions in bill amounts, officer salaries, and compensation. It was initially applicable to the first session of the 115th Congress and later extended to the second session, but is not applicable in the 116th Congress."
