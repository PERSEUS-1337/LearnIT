    "content": "This report examines the proposed nomination of General (Ret.) James Mattis as Secretary of Defense and its potential impact on civilian-military relations and the principle of civilian control of the military. It discusses the history of statutory restrictions and broader questions surrounding the balance between national security and democratic principles. The principle of civilian control of the military in the U.S. ensures that civilian leadership has ultimate authority over the armed services, balancing power between the executive and legislative branches. This principle has remained unchallenged throughout American history, influencing legislation and maintaining a strong and capable military to protect civil society. The Founding Fathers were wary of a standing military's potential to overthrow the government, leading to the principle of civilian control of the military. This principle was tested during the Revolutionary War and remains crucial in preventing tyranny or dictatorship in a democratic Republic. During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington's refusal to become a dictator prevented the emergence of a military-authoritarian government, preserving democratic principles in the new American state. The 1786 Shays Rebellion in Massachusetts was a response to high taxes and economic hardship, led by Captain Daniel Shays and other leaders. They closed local courts to prevent foreclosures and attacked a federal arsenal. The rebellion was quickly suppressed, but it sparked debates on the need for a stronger national government with a standing army. The Founding Fathers designed a system of civilian control of the military to prevent the emergence of a national military that could threaten the new Republic. The elected President was designated the Commander-in-Chief of the nation's armed forces, ensuring civilian leadership and unity of command. The President had the authority to commission military officers, appoint Secretaries for military services, and report regularly to Congress on the state of the union. The Founding Fathers established civilian control of the military to prevent a powerful national military. Congress was granted significant powers over the armed services, including the ability to declare war, raise armies, and regulate military forces. George Washington played a crucial role in shaping the norms for civilian-military relations in America. American relationships between the military and civilian leadership have been shaped by the norms established by George Washington and his successors. The nation has historically maintained a small peacetime active duty army to ensure civilian control over the military. During major conflicts like the Civil War, World War I, and World War II, the active military force was expanded through the activation of reserves, recruitment of volunteers, and conscription. After the conflicts, active force levels were significantly reduced. For example, during World War I, active duty military personnel grew from 179,000 to nearly 2.9 million, then decreased to around 250,000 after the war. Similarly, in 1939, there were fewer than 350,000 active duty personnel, which grew to over 12 million during World War II. During major conflicts like World War II, the active military force in the United States grew enormously, reaching over 12 million servicemembers on active duty by 1945. This approach to organizing for military campaigns suited the preferences of the American people and its leaders, but came at the expense of preparedness, resulting in the expenditure of more American blood and treasure during wartime. The architecture designed at the Constitutional Convention and the cultural norm of respecting civilian control of the military prevented the armed forces from becoming overly dominant within the U.S. government for the first century and a half of the country's history. After World War II, the surprise of Pearl Harbor and America's lack of preparedness led to a reconsideration of national security institutions and the military's structure. Congress began discussing restructuring in 1944, with serious proposals emerging after the war. President Truman submitted a letter to Congress on December 6, 1945, advocating for changes. President Truman proposed combining the War and Navy Departments into a single Department of National Defense to improve military coordination. This idea sparked debates among the military services, executive branch, and Congress from 1944 to 1947. The proposal eventually led to the creation of a new Department headed by a single individual, a system that has been in place for the past 60 years. Truman's proposed system of military governance faced pushback for three main reasons: the large standing military size post-1947, unease about departing from peacetime mobilization tradition, and uncertainty about the effectiveness of armies in future wars due to atomic weaponry. The new military organization proposed by Truman faced concerns about centralization of military governance, especially with the popularity of senior U.S. general and flag officers post-World War II. These officers, such as George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur, had commanded millions of men and played a key role in formulating grand strategies. They were highly respected and even considered as presidential contenders, contrasting with the outside Presidents. The debate on military organization post-World War II involved concerns about the influence of senior general and flag officers like George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur, who were highly respected and even seen as potential presidential candidates. There were disagreements between the Army and Navy on whether to reorganize under a single department, with legislators considering a ten-year gap in service to diminish their influence. As 1947 approached, debates arose over consolidating military departments under a single civilian authority, despite Navy objections. Concerns were raised about potential primacy of the Department of the Navy or War under a new Secretary of National Defense. Truman feared over-militarization of American society post-World War II. The creation of a new Department of National Defense under a single Secretary raised concerns about potential over-militarization and the balance of power within the U.S. government. Post-war developments such as Soviet aggression and the need for U.S. involvement in promoting international stability highlighted the necessity for reorganizing military institutions for peacetime operations. The 1947 National Security Act aimed to address the challenges of post-war and Cold War periods by creating a new Department of Defense to better organize national security and defense. Congress sought to establish unity of command while ensuring civilian control of the military. The 1947 National Security Act established the Department of Defense to address post-war challenges and ensure civilian control of the military. Section 202 stipulated that the Secretary of Defense must be a civilian and not have been an active duty officer in the armed services within the last ten years. Congressional negotiations led to this compromise, with the specific reasons not clearly documented. Members of Congress debated the act, highlighting the importance of a break between military and civilian leadership. The 1947 National Security Act established the Department of Defense to ensure civilian control of the military. It stipulated that the Secretary of Defense must be a civilian with no recent military service to prevent dominance by any one service branch. This was tested during the Korean War, leading to the need for a Secretary of Defense with national prestige. In 1950, President Truman asked General Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense during the Korean War crisis. General Marshall had a distinguished career in both civilian and military positions, including serving as Secretary of State for two years. Truman had previously sent Marshall to China in an attempt to mediate the civil war between Nationalists and Communists. General Marshall served as Secretary of State for two years, overseeing key policies such as the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. He later returned to active duty in the Army and was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Staff with minimal military duties. President Truman asked Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense during the Korean War crisis. President Truman nominated General George C. Marshall as Secretary of Defense with a limited tenure of six months to a year. To address restrictions preventing Marshall's nomination, a legislative proposal was forwarded to Congress, including amendments to statutes barring active Army officers from holding civil office. Truman requested the committees to consider the draft legislation allowing Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense. President Truman nominated General George C. Marshall as Secretary of Defense with a limited tenure of six months to a year. A legislative proposal was forwarded to Congress to amend statutes barring active Army officers from holding civil office, allowing Marshall to serve. The measure faced support and opposition due to the ongoing Korean War crisis and Marshall's exceptional qualifications. The legislative proposal allowed General Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense by suspending statutory provisions. Congress expressed intent that this appointment should not set a precedent for future military appointments to the position. President Truman nominated General Marshall to be Secretary of Defense in 1950, following a confirmation hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The issue of civilian control of the military was discussed during the hearing, along with other topics. General Marshall made a reference to the importance of civilian representation on the National Security Council. During his confirmation hearing for Secretary of Defense, General Marshall emphasized the need for civilian representation on the National Security Council. He objected to the imbalance of having three military representatives and suggested including civilians without portfolio. As a young lieutenant, he believed a soldier should be Secretary of War, but later realized the importance of civilian leadership. The Senate confirmed General Marshall as Secretary of Defense in 1950. A proposal in 2007 aimed to reduce the required military service for the position from 10 to 3 years. In 2007, a proposal aimed to reduce the required military service for the position of Secretary of Defense from 10 to 5 years. The compromise reached during negotiations reduced the required interval to 7 years in the FY2008 NDAA. The public debate surrounding the nomination of General Mattis for Secretary of Defense focuses on civilian-military relations rather than civilian control of the military. Observers believe General Mattis is qualified and unlikely to compromise the principle of civilian leadership over the military. The possible appointment of General Mattis has sparked a discussion on the impact of 40 years of an all-volunteer force on civilian-military relations. Observers debate whether tensions between the military and civilian leadership could challenge the principle of civilian control. Opinions on nominating a retired military officer as Secretary of Defense are divided based on perceptions of the broader civilian-military relationship. Some view overreliance on retired generals in key national security positions as dangerous for the civilian-military relationship. The focus on military experience may obscure the importance of civilian control of the military. Adherence to traditional views on civilian-military relations is seen as risky in a time of blurred boundaries between civilian and military spheres. Key questions include the impact on formulating and executing decisions. In formulating and executing national security policy, the appropriate roles and responsibilities between civilian leaders and the military are debated. During wartime, civilian leaders may have a more hands-on role, leading to concerns about civilian \"micromanagement\" of the Department of Defense. The growth of the National Security Council's size reflects the increased civilian involvement in military matters. The concerns about civilian \"micromanagement\" of the Department of Defense by the NSC led Congress to pass a provision limiting the size of its professional staff. The all-volunteer force and the appointment of a retired General as Secretary of Defense raise questions about civilian leaders' understanding of the military and the Joint Chiefs of Staff's role as principal military advisor. The Goldwater-Nichols 1986 Department of Defense Reform Act aimed to empower the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to provide quality military advice to the President. The appointment of a recently retired four-star general, like Mattis, as Secretary of Defense raises concerns about politicizing the military and potentially creating a rival source of military advice to the President. This could impact the apolitical nature of military advice and the President's perception of its integrity. The appointment of General Mattis as Secretary of Defense raises concerns about politicizing the military and the integrity of military advice to the President. Scholars argue that U.S. foreign policy has become more militarized, with the DOD's role in security cooperation growing. The question of whether military advice is apolitical is gaining resonance, as political elites view the military as a player in political debates. The militarization of foreign policy, highlighted by the growth of DOD's role in security cooperation and the dominance of defense spending, has led to concerns about the civilian-military relationship. Some worry that appointing a retired General as Secretary of Defense could further exacerbate this trend, while others point out that General Mattis advocated for more resources for the Department of State. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping this relationship. The Constitution grants key responsibilities for the military to Congress, indicating its role in civilian control of the military. The appointment process for positions like Secretary of Defense can impact civil-military relations. The 115th Congress will need to decide on General Mattis's nomination for Secretary of Defense. The appointment process for the Secretary of Defense is crucial for civil-military relations. Section 179 of the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 establishes fast-track procedures for Senate consideration of a nominee who has been retired for at least three years. Waiver legislation must be introduced within 30 days of the 115th Congress convening. The legislation for waiver of retired nominees for Secretary of Defense must be introduced within 30 days of the 115th Congress convening. Once introduced, it is referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services and if not reported within five session days, the committee is automatically discharged. A non-debatable motion can be made to proceed with the legislation on the Senate Calendar of Business, with all points of order waived. If the motion is adopted, the Senate considers the measure until it is disposed of. The Senate would consider pending legislation for waiver of retired nominees for Secretary of Defense, with up to 10 hours of debate controlled by party leaders. Amendments and dilatory motions are not allowed. Passage of the waiver legislation requires a three-fifths majority vote. Expedited procedures in Section 179 allow for a final vote without extensive floor time. The Section 179 procedures in the Senate provide a time-saving process for considering waiver legislation. If vetoed, Senate consideration of a veto message would be limited to 10 hours. The Senate can adjust these procedures by unanimous consent. House consideration of waiver legislation would follow special rules or the Suspension of the Rules procedure. If enacted, 10 U.S.C. 113(a) would no longer apply to General. If waiver legislation is enacted, 10 U.S.C. 113(a) would no longer apply to General Mattis, but the Senate would still need to confirm his nomination. Congress may choose to suspend, eliminate, or take no action regarding the statutory limitation on recently retired officers serving as Secretary of Defense. This would require legislation similar to P.L. 81-788, which allowed a one-time suspension for General Marshall. Proponents of waiving the statutory requirement for a seven-year gap between active duty and appointment as Secretary of Defense argue it would allow for General Mattis' confirmation while upholding civilian control of the military. Opponents fear politicization of the military if this provision is removed. Proponents argue for waiving the statutory requirement for General Mattis to become Secretary of Defense, citing his qualifications. Opponents fear politicization of the military if the provision is removed. Congress may choose to allow Mattis's nomination to proceed without passing relevant legislation, raising legal uncertainties. The legislative history of P.L. 81-788, enacted in 1950, authorized the appointment of General of the Army George C. Marshall as Secretary of Defense, suspending certain statutory requirements. Introduced at President Truman's request, the bill faced opposition but ultimately passed after four days of consideration by Congress. President Truman approached General Marshall in September 1950 to ask him to serve as Secretary of Defense during the Korean War crisis. Marshall accepted with the condition of a limited tenure. Truman informally requested Johnson's resignation on September 11. Johnson resigned on September 11 after President Truman urged him to do so immediately and recommended General Marshall as his successor. Despite Johnson's reluctance, Truman insisted that he sign the resignation letter recommending Marshall as the new Secretary of Defense. General George Marshall is recommended by President Truman to be the new Secretary of Defense, despite the need for an amendment to the National Security Act to allow a General to hold the position. Congress is expected to amend the law for Marshall's appointment. General George Marshall, born in 1880, had extensive military experience and served as Army Chief of Staff during World War II. He is recommended by President Truman to be the new Secretary of Defense, pending an amendment to the National Security Act. General George Marshall, appointed Army Chief of Staff during World War II, played a crucial role in building up U.S. defenses. President Truman later hailed him as the 'architect of victory' in the war. Marshall also served as Secretary of State, where he implemented key policies such as the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Additionally, he was president of the American Red Cross and held the status of a Five-Star General of the Army. General Marshall, a Five-Star General of the Army, was appointed in 1944 and made permanent in 1946. Upon retirement, he was entitled to the same pay and allowances as when he was on active duty. General Marshall, a Five-Star General of the Army, retired in the grade of General of the Army on February 28, 1947. He was returned to active duty on March 1, 1949, through P.L. 80-804, which allowed officers appointed in the grade of General of the Army to request to be restored to active duty. General Marshall, a retired Five-Star General of the Army, was appointed in the grade of General of the Army in 1946. He was returned to active duty in 1949 and was asked by President Truman to serve as Secretary of Defense in 1950, to which he immediately accepted. President Truman forwarded a legislative proposal to Representative Carl Vinson and Senator Millard Tydings, requesting early and favorable action by Congress to permit General George C. Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense. President Truman requested Congress to allow General Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense, despite the usual civilian leadership principle. Details of the draft legislation were not available, and a House Armed Services Committee meeting on the matter was held in executive session with no public record. During the House session on September 13, 1950, Representative Kilday clarified that all committee members had the opportunity to discuss the matter of General Marshall's nomination. Representative McSweeney expressed general support, while Representative Rankin criticized Marshall's wartime and Secretary of Defense record. During a House session in 1950, Representative Rankin criticized General Marshall's record during World War II and as Secretary of State, calling his appointment as Secretary of Defense a \"serious mistake\" and urging for the nomination to be withdrawn. Representative Vinson introduced a bill to appoint General Marshall as Secretary of Defense, which waived certain requirements specifically for his nomination. General Marshall's appointment as Secretary of Defense faced statutory requirements that would force him to relinquish his commission as an active duty Army officer. H.R. 9646 allowed him to retain his rank, grade, pay, and allowances while serving as Secretary of Defense. H.R. 9646 allowed General Marshall to retain his rank, pay, and allowances while serving as Secretary of Defense, with no military supervision or control. Senate Armed Services Committee met to discuss President Truman's letter regarding Marshall's appointment. Following a press Q&A session, the Senate Armed Services Committee went into a closed executive session where Senator Tydings discussed potential legislative options regarding General Marshall's nomination for Secretary of Defense. Senator Tydings presented two potential legislative options to the committee regarding General Marshall's nomination for Secretary of Defense. The first proposal to modify the existing statute received little attention, while the second proposal focused on making a specific exception for General Marshall due to the present \"time of great crisis\" and his exceptional qualifications for the role. General Marshall's nomination for Secretary of Defense was seen as crucial during wartime, with some Senators believing it would boost confidence among allies and deter enemies. However, concerns were raised about the implications for civilian control of the military due to Marshall's active duty status. Senator Knowland objected to Truman's proposed nomination of General Marshall for Secretary of Defense, citing concerns about rushing the committee to waive a section of the National Security Act of 1947 without proper consultation. He warned that this could set a precedent for future waivers and emphasized the seriousness of the decision. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 2 to proceed with reporting the committee's decision on General Marshall's nomination for Secretary of Defense. Senator Knowland and Senator Cain raised concerns about the rushed process and potential implications for future appointments. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted to proceed with reporting the committee's original bill to the Senate, despite Senator Knowland and Senator Cain refusing to support the measure. Senator Tydings emphasized the need to expedite passage of the bill to confirm General Marshall's appointment before the September 23 congressional recess. The bill, S. 4147, was reported during the afternoon Senate session, with legislative provisions identical to H.R. 9646. The House Armed Services Committee conducted a hearing on pending legislation related to General Omar N. Bradley and the Coast Guard. Representative Vinson mentioned the upcoming vote on the bill regarding General Marshall. During the House session, Representative Clare E. Hoffman criticized General Marshall's nomination as Secretary of Defense, questioning his WWII service record and views on China. Representative Jacob K. Javits briefly mentioned Marshall in relation to the Korean War. During the Senate session, Senator Javits expressed support for General Marshall's nomination but raised concerns about civilian control of the military. The Senate briefly considered a motion related to the Revenue Act of 1950, with Senator Byrd managing S. 4147 in Senator Tydings' absence. On September 15, 1950, the Senate's consideration of the motion to reconsider consumed more time than anticipated, leading to a recess until the next day. S. 4147 was left as pending business. In a House Armed Services Committee meeting, H.R. 9646 was discussed in an executive session, with Representative Vinson noting the unique opportunity for the House to confirm an executive appointment. Representative Dewey Short made an extended statement during the session. During the House Armed Services Committee meeting, Representative Dewey Short objected to General Marshall's nomination as Secretary of Defense, citing concerns about his physical capability and advocating for civilian control of the military. The committee voted 18 to 7 to proceed with reporting H.R. 9646 to the House. The ensuing floor debate on the bill was contentious, with varying levels of support and criticism towards General Marshall. Opposition to General Marshall's nomination as Secretary of Defense centered on doubts about his physical capability and concerns about his ability to lead the Department of Defense effectively. Critics argued that prioritizing civilian control of the military was more important than Marshall's personal qualifications, with some fearing a potential shift towards a military state. Supporters of General Marshall's nomination as Secretary of Defense argued that his record of service and leadership would allow him to efficiently lead the Department of Defense without delay, citing the critical international situation and the need for confidence in military leadership. They believed that Marshall was the best candidate for the job and that the nation could not afford to spend time educating a new Secretary of Defense. Representative Vinson supported General Marshall's nomination as Secretary of Defense, emphasizing that his military background did not pose a threat to civilian control. He highlighted the existing checks and balances in place, such as the National Security Council and Congress, to ensure oversight and balance in decision-making. The Senate, House of Representatives, and Supreme Court exercise civilian control over the Armed Forces and Secretary of Defense. The temporary suspension of the Unification Act will not impact governmental processes. The question remains whether to resort to a draft of General Marshall. Amendments were proposed, including one to appoint Representative Vinson as Secretary of Defense instead of General Marshall. Representative Vinson proposed an amendment expressing Congress's intent and sense that military men should not be appointed as Secretary of Defense in the future after General Marshall. The amendment was dismissed as not germane to the bill. Representative Vinson emphasized the need for civilian control in the appointment of military men, rejecting a substitute amendment by Representative Javits. A sunset clause proposed by Representative Short was also rejected. Short's amendment for a sunset clause in the legislation was defeated by a vote of 136 to 61. H.R. 9646 passed the House with a vote of 220-105 and was sent to the Senate. Senator Byrd advocated for the passage of the bill in light of the Korean War crisis and General Marshall's qualifications as Secretary of Defense. The Senate debate on the confirmation of General Marshall as Secretary of Defense was contentious and focused on the principle of civilian control of the military. H.R. 9646 was passed by the Senate with a vote of 47-21 and signed into law by President Truman on September 18, 1950. General Marshall was confirmed as Secretary of Defense on September 20, 1950, by a Senate vote of 57-11. He took office on September 21, 1950, serving until September 12, 1951."
