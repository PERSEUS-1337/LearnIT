    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act of 2018 requires the development of a data framework to integrate existing DHS datasets and systems for authorized personnel, ensuring compliance with legal authorities and privacy policies. The Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act of 2018 mandates the creation of a data framework accessible to authorized DHS personnel with appropriate security clearance for sharing homeland security, terrorism, and intelligence information relevant to priority mission needs. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to issue guidance and enforce a duty to share information between offices and components of the Department when accessing or contributing to the data framework for mission needs. Additionally, data standards must be promulgated and components of the Department instructed to make information available in a machine-readable format to the greatest extent practicable. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure data sharing between offices and components, with information in a machine-readable format. Exclusion of certain information is allowed if it jeopardizes protection, compromises investigations, conflicts with laws, or serves no operational purpose. Safeguards include mechanisms for identifying insider threats and security risks. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure data sharing with safeguards for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. A deadline of 2 years is set for implementing the data framework, with regular updates to Congress until fully operational. The Secretary of Homeland Security must notify Congress when the data framework is fully operational. Congress will be briefed annually on how the framework is used to disrupt terrorist activities. Definitions for key terms like \"appropriate congressional committee\" and \"homeland security information\" are provided. National intelligence and terrorism information are defined in specific sections of relevant acts. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
