    "content": "The \"Family Act of 2013\" is the short title of this Act. Congress recognizes infertility as a disease, with approximately 3,000,000 Americans affected. Cancer survivors and military families are among those impacted by infertility due to various reasons. Infertility due to lower extremity war injuries from modern warfare poses challenges for active duty individuals and veterans accessing fertility treatments. Military health insurance does not cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), costing approximately $12,500 per cycle. Many couples face financial barriers in pursuing IVF treatment, impacting their ability to start a family. Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments is limited at the State level, with only 8 States requiring comprehensive coverage. IVF is only covered by 19% of large employer-sponsored health plans and 11% of small plans. Out-of-pocket expenses for treatments are significant, especially for African-American and Hispanic women according to the latest National Survey of Family Growth. African-American and Hispanic women have higher infertility rates compared to Caucasian women but are less likely to use infertility services. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN INFERTILITY TREATMENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section providing a credit for certain infertility treatments. A new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows eligible individuals a tax credit of 50% of qualified infertility treatment expenses paid during the taxable year, with limitations on the dollar amount and income for the credit. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses is subject to reduction based on adjusted gross income, without considering certain sections. No double benefit is allowed for the credit. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited if a deduction or credit is taken elsewhere, if reimbursement is received from a program, or if payment is made through insurance. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited if reimbursement is received from a program or if payment is made through insurance. For taxable years where section 26(a)(2) does not apply, the credit allowed under subsection (a) cannot exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under this subpart and section 27. Carryforwards of unused credit are subject to specific rules. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited if reimbursement is received from a program or if payment is made through insurance. Excess credits can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under subsection (a). No credit may be carried forward beyond the 5th taxable year after the credit arose. Qualified infertility treatment expenses are defined as amounts paid for in vitro fertilization treatment by a licensed medical practitioner for infertility diagnosed by a US licensed physician. Expenses for fertility preservation procedures conducted before infertility diagnosis are also eligible. Fertility preservation procedures conducted before medical procedures that may cause infertility are considered qualified infertility treatment expenses, regardless of subsequent infertility diagnosis. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to live birth, including infertility caused by medical treatments like chemotherapy or surgery. The text discusses eligibility criteria for individuals seeking infertility treatment expenses as a tax deduction, requiring a diagnosis by a licensed physician. Married taxpayers must file joint returns, and there are conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include new eligibility criteria for tax deductions on infertility treatment expenses. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include new eligibility criteria for tax deductions on infertility treatment expenses, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. The amendments involve changes to sections 23A, 25D, and 1400C(d) of the Code."
