The UC system is governed by the Social Security Act, with various accounts in the U.S. Treasury and state accounts. Federal unemployment taxes go into the Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA), Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA), and Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), while state unemployment taxes go into respective state accounts. The Reed Act, part of the Employment Security Financing Act of 1954, amended Titles IX and XII of the Social Security Act to establish the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Reed Act distributions include regular and special distributions, with the latter being used from 1998-2002. States are restricted by federal law to use Reed Act funds only for specific purposes. Federal law restricts states to using Reed Act distributions for state benefits, employment services, labor market information, and administration of state UC and ES programs. Department of Labor suggests using funds for UC and ES automation, performance improvement, reducing fraud, and improving claims filing and payment methods. State legislature approval is needed for using funds for administrative expenses. Funds cannot be used for temporary benefits like EUC08. FUTA taxes finance states' administrative costs and loans for insolvent UC programs, while state UC payroll taxes cover regular UC benefits. Payroll taxes fund regular UC benefits, with the extended benefits program temporarily fully funded by the federal government. Employers pay a 6.0% federal tax on wages up to $7,000 per worker, with a credit of up to 5.4% for timely state tax payments. States meeting requirements have an effective federal tax of 0.6%. Any excess balance in the ESAA is transferred to the EUCA at the end of the federal fiscal year. Excess balance from ESAA is transferred to EUCA and then to FUA. Any remaining excess balance is distributed to states in the UTF based on covered wages. Reed Act distributions occurred in 1956-1958 and 1998-2002. The most recent regular distribution was $15.9 million in 1998. BBA of 1997 limited distributions to $100 million annually. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 provided a special Reed Act distribution of up to $8 billion to state accounts in the UTF. This distribution differed from traditional Reed Act distributions as it was a set dollar amount not determined by statutory ceilings and was distributed before the end of a fiscal year. No Reed Act distribution occurred in 2003, and none is projected through FY2021. The $8 billion Reed Act distribution in 2002 reduced unemployment taxes in 22 states and UC administration costs in 17 states. A study found that half of the distribution was used to lower state unemployment taxes in 2003 and 2004, while the rest went towards UC benefits, administration, and employment services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a special distribution of UTF funds to states as incentive payments for changing UC laws. This included transferring $7 billion from FUA and $500 million from ESAA to state accounts within the UTF. The distribution was based on states' share of federal unemployment taxes paid by employers."
