The characteristics vary, with some regulators having more independence in certain areas while less in others. Financial regulators set policy, conduct rulemaking, and supervise financial institutions. Some agencies have additional responsibilities beyond regulation. The Federal Reserve System (Fed), FDIC, and NCUA are federal financial regulators with regulatory responsibilities. Recent Congresses have debated structural and oversight changes for these agencies, highlighting the importance of their structure. This report discusses the importance of structuring financial regulators independently, highlighting the history and rationale behind it. It explores the characteristics that contribute to independence and how they vary among regulators. Independent agencies are defined as executive branch organizations with autonomy from the President and insulation from partisan politics. Some executive branch agencies have varying degrees of independence from presidential or congressional direction, leading to confusion. Independence refers to autonomy from political influence, with agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission having more autonomy than others like the Small Business Administration. This autonomy is often constrained by a statutory framework. Independent agencies have varying levels of discretion in implementing laws, with their actions constrained by statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act, oversight mechanisms, and judicial review. The relationship between Congress and these agencies is similar to that with other agencies, with goals and mandates laid out. Independent agencies, including independent agencies, have goals, principles, missions, and mandates set by Congress in statutes. They have discretion in policy implementation and oversight similar to other agencies. The President does not directly influence policy at independent agencies, raising normative questions about presidential involvement. The removal of presidential direction from agency policymaking raises a normative question about better policy outcomes. Federal financial regulators may align with the President's priorities, but independence can also be viewed relative to Congress. Agencies more independent from the Administration can sometimes become more congressionally influenced. Some agency characteristics can shield an agency from congressional and presidential influence, such as funding outside the appropriations process. This insulation may limit agency accountability and control. The development of independent agencies in the American national government began in 1887 with the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate the railroad industry. Decisions about agency independence involve tradeoffs among values and goals, with potential for limited accountability and increased stakeholder influence. The ICC, established in 1887, was the first independent regulatory commission at the national level. Initially located in the Department of the Interior, it later became a freestanding agency with regulatory and quasi-legislative functions. The ICC was initially weak but gained power with the Hepburn Act of 1906. It served as a model for other federal regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve System, Federal Trade Commission, and Securities and Exchange Commission. Congress continued to establish independent financial regulatory agencies, such as the FHFA in 2008 and the CFPB in 2010. The CFPB was established in 2010 as an independent agency with quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial, and executive functions. The rationale for such agencies includes insulating powers from executive direction and facilitating better decision-making. An independent agency structure with an administrative law framework allows subject matter experts to use their technical knowledge to address complex issues, partially insulated from political concerns. However, complete insulation from political considerations is impossible due to the discretion involved in delegated activities. The independent regulatory agency model aims to ensure nonpartisan decision-making by incorporating a range of views. However, appointees may still align closely with the President's wishes or act in a partisan manner for political reasons. Some agencies have been granted independence from the executive to avoid presidential domination, especially in quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions. Some proponents argue that independent agencies are like arms of Congress, reducing presidential influence and preventing partisan interference in decision-making. Agency independence can also reflect interbranch rivalries over control of the federal bureaucracy and national policies. Congressional attempts to deviate from the bureau model often stem from disagreements between Congress and the President. The president and Congress have differing views on the administrative state, leading to disagreements on its organization. Independent federal agencies have idealized models but often have unique features. There are no general laws defining the structure and powers of these agencies. Independent federal agencies do not have a general statutory or judicial definition, with their attributes being shaped by precedent and various factors. The Paperwork Reduction Act lists some independent regulatory agencies but does not provide a clear definition of independence. Key traits that differentiate independent agencies from executive agencies include organizational features related to agency location, leadership selection, appointment, and tenure. The curr_chunk discusses the characteristics of agency leadership, presidential oversight, rulemaking, and information collection. It mentions leadership structure, term of office, protection from removal, and qualifications for office-holding. It also highlights the ability of agencies to submit reports and budget requests independently to congressional committees. Additionally, it mentions the review process of rules by the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The curr_chunk discusses the oversight of independent regulatory agencies by regulatory agencies specified as independent in the PRA. It highlights the differences in review processes between OIRA and the PRA, as well as the various forms of congressional oversight over independent agencies. The chunk also touches on the factors influencing an agency's functional independence, such as funding sources. The President's authority over most agencies is highlighted, with the exception of the OCC. Financial regulators, not part of an executive department, do not report to a member of the President's Cabinet. Agency independence varies, with some agencies outside departments adhering to the President's policies, while the OCC is considered independent despite being within the Treasury department. The OCC, located within the Treasury Department, is considered independent despite being part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Comptroller of the Currency has specific duties and powers that are not subject to the Secretary of the Treasury's control. The OCC, within the Treasury, is independent with its budget separate. Leadership structure varies among federal financial regulators. Table 2 shows collegial vs. unitary heads, and Table 3 outlines statutory requirements for leadership. The leadership structure of federal financial regulators varies, with some agencies having a collegial board while others have a single administrator. Differences in agency structures have led to proposals for more uniform leadership across agencies. The leadership structures of federal financial regulators vary, with some agencies having a collegial board and others a single administrator. A board structure encourages diverse views, while a single administrator promotes unified leadership and accountability. Chairmen on boards may have greater administrative authority. Chairmen on boards may have greater administrative authority than other board members, but policymaking powers are vested in the board as a whole. The chairman's dominance does not necessarily come from statutory powers. Senate confirmation is required for agency heads, and subordinate officers may be appointed by the President with or without Senate confirmation. Senate confirmation is required for agency heads, ensuring political balance in collegial bodies to exercise expert judgment. Public administration research suggests it's challenging to remove all political considerations from administrative activity. The party balance requirements for agency heads aim to introduce a broader array of opinions into the consensus-building process. Qualifications for nominees vary, with some needing specialized knowledge or experience in the industry of jurisdiction, while others encourage diversity of experience and expertise. For example, the Federal Reserve Board selection process aims for fair representation across different districts. The President must consider a fair representation of various interests and geographical divisions when appointing officials. Overly specific qualifications may limit the candidate pool and raise constitutional issues. Conflicts over qualifications are typically resolved through the political process, and it is unclear if statutory qualifications legally bind the appointment process. The legal consequences of ignoring provisions regarding agency heads' activities and post-service restrictions vary. Terms for positions covered in the report have fixed lengths, with some having staggered terms. Five-year terms are common, but some positions have longer terms. Chair terms may be shorter than board members' terms in some cases. The length of an official's term may influence their independence and susceptibility to presidential direction. Fixed terms promote independence from political influence and may limit the President's ability to remove an incumbent. Shorter terms may make an official more susceptible to presidential direction, while longer terms may reduce their allegiance to a new President. A fixed term for officials may promote independence and limit presidential influence, as incumbents often step down before their term ends. This can lead to longer tenure and greater continuity in positions, potentially inhibiting but not preventing removal by the President. Establishes a fixed term for appointees, allowing for potential reappointment for financial regulators except Fed governors and NCUA board members. Non-renewable terms may enhance independence by removing leverage over appointees, while renewable terms could lead to aligning with future administrations. The terms of agency members are staggered to promote continuity and diversity of opinion. Holdover provisions may allow members to stay past their terms, potentially circumventing the need for new appointments. Some agencies have no holdover provisions, like the National Labor Relations Board. Congress may place time limits on holdover provisions to prevent indefinite stays. Some agencies, like the National Labor Relations Board, have no holdover provisions, so members must leave when their term expires. Others, like the Fed, allow members to continue serving after their term until a successor is appointed. Different agencies have various holdover provisions, such as allowing incumbents to stay for a specified period linked to the end of their term or congressional sessions. The post-term period for commissioners of financial regulators is tied to congressional sessions. Most regulators cannot be removed by the President at will, but only for cause. The OCC's Comptroller of the Currency can be removed by the President with reasons communicated to the Senate. This limits the President's ability to remove appointees for political reasons. The ability of a President to remove appointees for political reasons is limited when agency heads can only be removed for cause. This independence allows regulators to pursue initiatives that may not align with the Administration's agenda without fear of removal. Financial regulators, such as the director of the CFPB, can only be removed for specific reasons like inefficiency or neglect of duty. The for cause removal standard for independent agency heads is not always explicitly stated by Congress but is generally understood to exist. Commissioners of the SEC cannot be summarily removed from office according to legal precedent. Tradition and lack of statutory for cause protection may also influence a President's decision to allow a full term for board members of financial regulators. The removal of financial regulators, such as the chairman of the OCC, can be influenced by the President, potentially increasing presidential influence. The distinction between removing a commissioner and a chairman is possible due to separate roles defined in statute. If a commissioner loses the chairmanship, they may choose to resign from the commission. Legislative proposals and congressional testimony by executive agencies require approval. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approves legislative proposals and congressional testimony by executive agencies. Agency budget requests are vetted and integrated with the President's annual budget request. The President's budget includes proposals for agency programs. Some agencies have restrictions on OMB's influence on their submissions to Congress. An unmediated relationship between agencies and Congress is important for appropriations requests. Since 1974, agencies like the SEC, Fed, FDIC, FHFA, and NCUA are prohibited from requiring approval on legislative recommendations or budget submissions before submitting them to Congress. The OCC was added to this statute in 1994, and the Dodd-Frank Act includes similar language for the CFPB. The CFTC follows different statutory requirements, submitting budget estimates to congressional committees concurrently. The CFTC must submit budget estimates and legislative recommendations to Congress concurrently, without needing pre-submission approval. This allows the agency greater freedom to express its views to Congress compared to other financial regulators. The FDIC is required to provide financial reports to Treasury and OMB regularly. Federal agencies like the FDIC are required to provide financial reports to Treasury and OMB, but they are not obligated to obtain consent or approval. Rulemaking is a key tool for agencies to implement public policy, with the APA of 1946 setting out requirements for rulemaking and agency adjudications. This includes procedures for setting standards and details for federal policies and programs, with judicial review available. The APA sets requirements for agency adjudications and judicial review of rulemaking and agency actions. Presidents have added procedures through executive orders, such as OIRA review of rules, to give more control over agency rulemaking. The independent regulatory agencies are exempt from OIRA review, preserving their independence from presidential oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act allows FSOC to nullify CFPB regulations deemed risky to the banking system. FSOC has the authority to nullify CFPB regulations that pose a risk to the banking system. The Treasury Secretary can issue a temporary stay on a regulation, which can then be set aside by a two-thirds vote of FSOC members. Independent regulatory agencies must seek OIRA approval for information collections involving 10 or more nonfederal persons. Collegially headed independent agencies can overturn OIRA disapprovals of proposed information collections by majority vote. Recently, policymakers have debated the extent to which cost-benefit analysis should be mandated as part of the independent agency rulemaking process. Proponents argue it is a reasonable check on arbitrary rulemaking, while opponents find it too onerous and time-consuming. Cost-benefit requirements can increase executive or judicial influence over rulemaking. The rulemaking process allows for greater executive or judiciary influence, with recent court challenges on cost-benefit grounds. Financial regulators provide some information on costs and benefits but lack quantitative estimates. Current law requires cost-benefit analysis for federal financial regulators, including consideration of impacts on small entities and banks. Financial regulators must consider costs and benefits when promulgating regulations, with specific statutory provisions applying to individual agencies. The SEC and CFPB have additional considerations such as promoting efficiency, competition, and consumer protection. Some propose extending cost-benefit analysis requirements. Some propose extending cost-benefit analysis requirements to additional agencies, with variations including enumerating factors to consider, implementing rules only if benefits outweigh costs, and subjecting analysis to OIRA review. Federal financial regulators have greater independence from the President and Congress, potentially resulting in reduced influence if agency funds are not appropriated. Federal financial regulators have reduced influence when agency funds are not appropriated, agency leaders serve for long periods without reconfirmation, or the Administration is unable to influence agency action on behalf of Members. Despite this, regulators are still subject to normal congressional oversight, including requirements to testify and report, Senate confirmation, audits by GAO and inspectors general, and congressional authorization and appropriation of funds. Congress can request agency heads to testify, submit reports, and investigate their activities. Federal financial regulators are required to submit annual or semi-annual reports to Congress, covering agency finances and activities. Agency heads like the Fed and CFPB must appear before committees, while regulators like the SEC and CFTC testify before House and Senate appropriations committees. Congress can request ad hoc testimony or reports, and may pass legislation to alter agency policies. The Congressional Review Act of 1996 allows Congress to overturn agency rules with a joint resolution of disapproval, subject to presidential veto. This process is rarely used, but has been successful in the past. Congress is considering expanding its role in the rulemaking process by requiring affirmation via an act of Congress before regulations can take effect. Additionally, the Senate can influence agencies through its advice and consent role in appointing top agency officials. The Senate plays a crucial role in confirming top agency leaders, allowing Senators to influence nominee selection, evaluate qualifications, and assess views on agency relationships. Confirmation by the Senate may require nominees acceptable to both parties, leading to appointees representing a broader range of views. The Senate plays a crucial role in confirming top agency leaders, allowing Senators to influence nominee selection, evaluate qualifications, and assess views on agency relationships. Confirmation by the Senate may require nominees acceptable to both parties, leading to appointees representing a broader range of views. Congress employs GAO and inspectors general to enhance oversight of agencies with greater independence. Federal financial regulators are audited by GAO and have inspectors general conducting investigations. GAO audits and investigations can be required by statute or ad hoc at the request of Congress. Congress may request GAO investigations to raise awareness of regulator decisions. The GAO can access agency records and report findings, with more restrictive statutes for auditing banking regulators to protect confidential information. The Federal Reserve has additional restrictions on its monetary policymaking. Since the Dodd-Frank Act, GAO can audit the Fed for waste, fraud, and abuse but not evaluate policy decisions. Congress has debated removing these restrictions to enhance oversight of agencies with greater independence. The annual appropriation processes and periodic reauthorization legislation in politics allow Congress to influence agency size, scope, and activities. Different funding structures for regulators with similar missions have led to proposals for more uniform funding. The CFTC and SEC are financial regulators subject to congressional appropriation and authorization processes. CFTC's funding comes from the Treasury's general fund, while the SEC is funded by collected fees. The SEC's budget is largely determined by Congress, with fees adjusted to meet funding levels. During the appropriations process, funding for the CFTC can be redirected to other agencies, creating competition for resources within the bill. Congress evaluates agency performance and can influence activities by reallocating resources or placing limitations on funds to reflect priorities. During the appropriations process, Congress can influence agency activities by reallocating resources or placing limitations on funds to better reflect priorities. Control over funding reduces independence from Congress and increases accountability. Financial regulators like the OCC have more autonomy in determining their budgets, while the CFPB's funding is determined by the Director for carrying out its authorities. The CFPB's funding is capped at a fixed amount, with the possibility of supplemental appropriations authorized through 2014. Financial regulators generate income from fees or assessments on entities they oversee, with the Federal Reserve unique in deriving income from securities and loans. The CFPB's funding is capped at a fixed amount, with the possibility of supplemental appropriations authorized through 2014. Financial regulators generate income from fees or assessments on entities they oversee, with the Federal Reserve unique in deriving income from securities and loans. Some financial regulators raise their own revenues through fees and assessments, while others rely on funding from Treasury's general revenues or the Federal Reserve. Surpluses collected by regulators can be invested in Treasury bonds for future budgetary shortfalls. The Fed generates surpluses from investment income, remitting most to the Treasury and keeping the rest in its surplus account. Congress established independent federal agencies like the Fed, FDIC, and SEC with financial regulatory responsibilities. Some agencies have gained independence from presidential and congressional direction over time. Several rationales for establishing independent financial regulatory agencies include insulating officials from presidential direction, avoiding partisan influence for better decision-making, and resolving institutional rivalries between Congress and the President. The establishment of agencies like FHFA in 2008 and CFPB in 2010 indicates Congress's ongoing support for agency independence. Legislative proposals show Congress is still considering the appropriate regulatory framework. Congress is deliberating on the regulatory structure for independent financial regulatory agencies, considering the level of independence, its effects on agency functioning, and the consequences of greater independence from the President and Congress. Various agencies have different levels of independence granted by Congress, making it challenging to assess based on specific characteristics. The level of independence among financial regulatory agencies varies based on different characteristics established by Congress. These differences in independence can be attributed to the diverse roles and responsibilities of regulators, as well as historical factors. For example, the OCC has greater budgetary independence compared to the SEC or CFTC, despite not having for cause protection. The Federal Reserve is considered the most independent regulator across all measures. The level of independence among financial regulatory agencies varies based on different characteristics established by Congress. The culture, traditions, and relationships within an agency can also influence its independence. Congress may investigate the impact of agency independence on relationships with the President, Congress, and the regulated industry, as well as the policymaking allowed by this independence. Congress could assess the agency's operations for governmental checks. The degree of agency independence from governmental checks and balances, including the President and Congress, can impact the policymaking process and democratic accountability. Structural features can either increase or decrease independence, leading to potential dependencies on different branches of government for resources and power. Decisions about agency independence involve tradeoffs among values and goals, with constraints from statutory frameworks and oversight mechanisms. Insulation from partisan influence may limit accountability and control by elected officials."
