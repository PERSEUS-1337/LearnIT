    "content": "In the last 30 years, the United States has invested billions of dollars in restoring large ecosystems like the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, Florida Everglades, and California Bay-Delta. These initiatives involve multiple states and millions of people, aiming to improve water supply, manage natural resources, and restore endangered species. Various stakeholders, including federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private and nongovernmental organizations, are involved in these ongoing large-scale ecosystem restoration projects. Congress plays a crucial role in authorizing and overseeing large-scale ecosystem restoration projects funded by federal appropriations. Congressional oversight focuses on the progress, efficiency, and goals of these initiatives. Some ecosystem restoration initiatives face criticism for lack of coordination and comprehensive plans. To address concerns, agencies have proposed crosscut budgets authorized by federal laws for initiatives like CALFED and the Great Lakes restoration initiative. Crosscut budgets organize and report activities and funding of entities within the same initiative. A crosscut budget organizes and characterizes funding for an initiative across organizational boundaries. It can be detailed or presented in a table format, listing funding and activities contributing to the initiative. Characteristics of a comprehensive crosscut budget include spending details, accomplishments, remaining implementation, and costs. A crosscut budget tracks funding, implementation progress, costs, and proposed milestones for ecosystem restoration initiatives. It provides transparency and coordination among stakeholders but may not address all criticisms. Stakeholders can use it for organizing and planning initiatives, although it may require additional analysis. A crosscut budget is used to present budget information from multiple agencies targeting a common policy goal. It helps in making data more understandable and can be a tool for oversight committees and stakeholders implementing ecosystem restoration programs. Creating a crosscut budget for ecosystem restoration programs involves challenges in coordinating multiple agencies with competing demands and limited resources. Stakeholders' diverse needs add complexity to generating useful crosscut budget information. Creating a crosscut budget involves deciding its purpose and audience, balancing brevity with sufficient project data, and ensuring analytical capacity within agencies. There is no standard design for a crosscut budget, as it depends on the questions to be answered and the desired coordination among agencies. Crosscut budgets track funding and can also help organize and track progress of complex program elements. When designing a crosscut budget, questions to consider include the level of activity relation to program goals, tracking funds for ecosystem restoration, funding tracking methods, inclusion of non-budgetary efforts, and the duration of the budget coverage. A crosscut budget for ecosystem restoration initiatives aims to track funding across various federal, state, and local agencies. Criteria are essential to determine which projects and programs the budget will monitor. The budget should align with program goals and include evaluation techniques to measure progress. Congress may need to decide on the frequency of submitting crosscut budgets and the responsible entity for their production. Criteria for inclusion in a crosscut budget for ecosystem restoration projects can be challenging to determine due to varying definitions and perspectives. The criteria used will dictate whether the budget captures funding directly or indirectly related to restoration goals. Consistent definitions are crucial for reliable comparison of projects, programs, and funding from year to year. Tracking funding for ecosystem restoration projects can be done at various levels of aggregation or disaggregation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Funding can be tracked by program goal to show effort dedicated to each goal over time, but this method may be imprecise due to activities impacting multiple goals. Tracking at the individual project level may be more useful for some stakeholders but can become unwieldy with a large number of projects or complexity. Comparing funding from year to year can be difficult when activities are reorganized or packaged differently. Funding can be tracked in terms of appropriations, obligations, and outlays, representing different stages in the expenditure of federal funds. Appropriations provide budget authority that limits agency spending; obligations occur when agencies are legally liable to pay for goods and services; outlays happen when funds are expended to fulfill obligations. Stakeholders may need to track the fiscal year in which funds were authorized, especially for multi-year and no-year funds. Obligations and outlays may not occur in the same fiscal year as the appropriation. Tracking obligations and outlays can be challenging, especially for multi-year projects that may not fully utilize annual appropriations. Different programs in various agencies may expend funds at different rates, making it necessary to define the years of funding for accurate measurement. The process of tracking obligations and outlays for multi-year projects across different agencies can be complex. It is important to define the years of funding included in the crosscut budget, considering historical information and the need for consistency in categorizing programs. Annual crosscut budgets can provide a consolidated view of funding, especially in years with consolidated appropriations laws. Congress may determine the requirements for submitting crosscut budgets. Requiring periodic updates, such as quarterly submissions, for crosscut budgets can address complications related to agency data adjustments, differing fiscal years, and late releases. This ensures accuracy and currency of data for Congress as it considers federal appropriations bills. Requiring quarterly updates for crosscut budgets can improve coordination among agencies but comes with increased reporting costs. Accurate budget data linking state and federal accounts is essential. Assigning a single federal agency responsibility for the crosscut budget may enhance data consistency and accuracy, but challenges include timely data submission and access to non-federal sources. Placing responsibility for a crosscut budget with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) can bring greater White House control, but OMB may not have access to non-federal data. Alternatively, involving an intergovernmental task force may facilitate access to more data sources but could result in less authority and technical budget knowledge compared to a single federal agency or OMB. The progress of ecosystem restoration initiatives is assessed from two perspectives: implementation of projects and activities, and accomplishment of overall restoration goals. In the Everglades, progress is judged based on the implementation of component restoration projects, with delays in authorizing additional projects seen as a lack of progress. Progress in ecosystem restoration initiatives is measured by assessing the implementation of projects and activities and achieving overall restoration goals. The CALFED restoration initiative focuses on reaching objectives like levee integrity and storage capacity, with progress mandated to proceed in a balanced manner. Indicators representing restoration goals can be used to estimate progress, and improvements in these indicators signal positive progress. Crosscut budgets for restoration efforts often lack progress tracking information, but discussions on incorporating progress measures are ongoing. The Everglades and CALFED ecosystem restoration initiatives submit crosscut budgets annually, providing Congress with ideas on tailoring such budgets. The Everglades crosscut budget describes funded activities and is produced by the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. Authorization for the crosscut budget is in the Water Resources Development Act of 1996. The Everglades crosscut budget tracks annual appropriations for programs within various government agencies but lacks information on milestones and progress towards ecosystem restoration. It does not include county and local funding or overall linkage between funding and milestones. The Everglades crosscut budget lacks tracking of progress and funding milestones for ecosystem restoration initiatives. It includes programs authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and separate projects that impact restoration goals. The Everglades crosscut budget includes detailed funding information for projects, such as funding from the USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program for the Everglades ecosystem. Discussions have arisen regarding the budget's utility. The crosscut budget, released annually at the beginning of the fiscal year, has sparked debates on its usefulness. Some find it beneficial for organizing and reporting federal and state funding totals, while others criticize its timing, as it is often released after funding deliberations in Congress. The California Bay-Delta Program, initiated in 1995 to address water resource conflicts, was reauthorized in 2004 with provisions for a crosscut budget. The CALFED crosscut budget, produced annually, includes federal and state agency funding by program element. It contains the Administration's request for federal funds for the upcoming fiscal year and previous fiscal year funding. The budget lacks evaluations of progress towards restoration goals or linkages between funding and milestones. A separate annual report tracks the progress and status of CALFED components. The CALFED crosscut budget tracks funding for Category A and Category B programs, with Category A directly addressing CALFED elements and Category B programs indirectly benefiting them. Funding information and project descriptions are found in the crosscut budget, while the annual report summarizes accomplishments and future activities within each program component. The crosscut budget, submitted to Congress by OMB, reflects collaboration between EPA, DOI, Corps, and USDA. It states that the information is the best available but numbers could change due to incomplete data. Few comments have been made on the CALFED crosscut budget. Some suggest its length may become an issue. The CALFED crosscut budget, submitted to Congress by OMB, reflects collaboration between EPA, DOI, Corps, and USDA. Concerns have been raised about its potential unwieldy length in the future. Congressional oversight of large-scale restoration initiatives raises questions about agency responsibility and accountability. Most crosscut budgets connect specific projects to accountable agencies, but few relate projects to overall objectives, making it difficult to assign accountability. Some suggest creating a directory within a crosscut budget to assign lead agencies to each objective of a restoration initiative, linking individual projects to specific goals. This would require a comprehensive restoration plan, currently lacking in some initiatives, to ensure accountability and agency responsibility. Without sophisticated program evaluation techniques, estimating the impact of restoration activities on multiple goals is challenging. It is difficult to determine the proportion of changes in outcomes attributable to specific activities and funding may not be easily divided between different goals. Some suggest evaluating restoration initiatives based on a suite of activities or evaluating each activity based on achieving multiple goals. Tracking progress is important for stakeholders to determine the most effective projects. Methods for evaluating and monitoring programs are being implemented at the federal level, such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. In 1993, the Government Performance and Results Act directed agencies to use evaluations and performance information for strategic planning beyond a single year. Annual performance plans and program performance reports are required to track progress and funding simultaneously. The CALFED Program's annual report includes project schedules and milestones for tracking progress within the crosscut budget. One option to track progress is to link funding to planned milestones within a project management framework. This allows for monitoring project outputs and assessing if goals are on schedule. Alternatively, progress can be rated based on implementation delays, with ratings like \"red\" for serious delays, \"yellow\" for slight delays, and \"green\" for projects on schedule. Some may find it challenging to link funding with project milestones for a large-scale ecosystem restoration initiative due to the complexity of coordinating multiple agencies and their budgets. Tracking progress can involve assessing if goals are being achieved, but measuring the direct impact of restoration activities on end outcomes can be difficult. Factors beyond the activities being assessed, such as modernizing wastewater treatment plants, may also contribute to achieving restoration goals. To estimate the impact of restoration activities, sophisticated evaluations are often necessary, as stakeholders may have differing opinions on defining success. Disagreements on goals and priorities can affect progress tracking in a crosscut budget effort. An alternative approach is to measure overall ecosystem change, including indicators of ecosystem components over time. The state of the ecosystem can be tracked over time using indicators like water clarity, population size of species, and seagrass acres. The Chesapeake Bay ecosystem is assessed annually on a point scale, with indicators graded from 0 to 100. The overall health of the bay is represented by an average of all indicators, with the 2008 grade being 28. These indicators reflect ecosystem components, not restoration goals. The use of indicators to measure progress in ecosystem restoration efforts can be influenced by various factors beyond the program itself. Some evaluation methods focus on outputs and intermediate outcomes, such as direct project-related activities and consequences of those activities. Outputs and intermediate outcomes are key components in measuring progress in ecosystem restoration efforts. Outputs like acres of water storage can directly relate to outcomes like increased water storage, while outcomes like raising breeding pairs of birds can lead to desired end outcomes like improved ecosystem health. Evaluating the impact of restoration initiatives on intermediate outcomes may require more sophisticated methods to account for other influencing factors. Funding can also serve as a proxy indicator of progress in restoration efforts if linked to proven effective activities. Funding levels can indicate progress in restoration efforts, with consistent funding presumed to lead to consistent progress. Different types of projects may require varying funding levels at different stages. Controversy exists in defining which programs should be included in assessments of restoration activities and their funding. The controversy surrounding funding for restoration initiatives includes debates on the sufficiency of funding, especially when considering nationwide programs that indirectly support ecosystem restoration. For instance, the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force reported that a significant portion of the $524 million spent in FY2004 on Great Lakes water quality restoration came from programs not specifically focused on Great Lakes restoration. Identifying specific ecosystem funding within nationwide programs remains challenging due to unclear criteria and methodologies. Some restoration initiatives face challenges in determining funding allocation due to discrepancies in geographical boundaries and funding sources. Defining the ecosystem area and restoration activities can help in deciding what to include in a crosscut budget. Understanding restoration activities is crucial for determining budget inclusions, with a focus on programs directly or indirectly supporting restoration goals. The distinction between direct and indirect funding for restoration programs is crucial for determining budget allocations. Direct funding targets specific ecosystems, while indirect funding may apply to multiple ecosystems. The CALFED crosscut budget uses this approach to organize and report activities. The CALFED crosscut budget organizes activities by including only programs limited to the defined ecosystem area. Indirect funding is classified as existing without restoration efforts, while direct funding is specific to restoration initiatives. Coordination among stakeholders is crucial for the success of ecosystem restoration initiatives. The success of ecosystem restoration initiatives relies on coordination among stakeholders. Problems with coordination include accountability, funding gaps, and overlapping activities. A crosscut budget could help address these issues by listing responsible agencies, identifying funding gaps, and preventing project overlap. However, implementing a crosscut budget may incur additional costs for administrative and analytical work. Some critics of large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives argue that many lack comprehensive plans, tools for measuring progress, and defined methods for assessing funding. They suggest using crosscut budgets to address these concerns, like those used for the Everglades and California Bay-Delta. However, current crosscut budgets do not define restoration activities or measure progress related to funding goals. Expanding crosscut budgets to include these functions could help alleviate criticisms of ecosystem restoration initiatives. Some believe that large crosscuts in ecosystem restoration initiatives may not effectively communicate information to specific audiences and stakeholders, leading to a wasted investment of resources."
