    "content": "Several legal and regulatory regimes impact intellectual property (IP) rights in pharmaceutical products, with patents and regulatory exclusivities being the main forms of protection. The FDA regulates pharmaceuticals differently based on whether they are derived from natural sources, requiring approval under the FD&C Act for nonbiological drugs and licensing under the PHSA for biologics. Specialized patent dispute resolution procedures can affect a manufacturer's ability to introduce generic drugs or biosimilars to the market. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) govern FDA approval and patent disputes for generic drugs and biosimilars. Understanding IP rights in pharmaceuticals, their impact on drug prices, and proposed reforms in Congress requires background on patent law and FDA approval requirements. The Hatch-Waxman Act and BPCIA govern FDA approval and patent disputes for generic drugs and biosimilars. Congress's authority to grant patents derives from the IP Clause of the U.S. Constitution, creating a national law governing IP rights. To obtain patent protection, inventors must file a patent application with the PTO, which must meet statutory requirements for a patent to be issued. The legal rights granted to patent holders and the federal government's authority to grant compulsory licenses are important aspects of patent law. Patents are available for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements. To obtain a patent, inventors must file an application with the PTO, starting patent prosecution. A patent examiner evaluates the application to ensure it meets legal requirements for patentability. Patents expire after twenty years and cover processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements. Patents cover processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements in various technological areas. The Supreme Court has established a two-step test for patentable subject matter, known as the Alice test, to determine eligibility for patents. The Alice test determines patent eligibility by assessing if the invention is directed at ineligible subject matter and if it contains an \"inventive concept.\" The claimed invention must be new to be patentable, and the PTO will not issue a patent if it has been previously patented or publicly disclosed. The claimed invention must be new and non-obvious to be patentable. If every element is already disclosed in the prior art, no valid patent may issue. Inventions must not be obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant technology. Factors like commercial success and unsolved needs may be considered in determining obviousness. The utility requirement for a patentable invention is derived from the constitutional purpose of patent law to promote the progress of useful arts. The invention must have specific and substantial utility, with a benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility. The standard for utility is relatively low, requiring only that the claimed invention is useful. The Patent Act requires that patents must contain a \"specification\" with a written description of the invention, the process of making and using it, in clear terms enabling anyone skilled in the art to do the same. This ensures the public can use the invention after the patent expires. The Patent Act requires patents to include a specification that meets three disclosure requirements: written description, enablement, and best mode. The written description must convey possession of the invention, the enablement requirement ensures enough information for others to make and use the invention, and the best mode requirement demonstrates the inventor's preferred way of practicing the invention. The legal scope of the patent is defined by the patent claims. The legal scope of a patent is defined by the patent claims, which must be sufficiently definite to inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention. The claims set forth the exclusive rights of the patent holder to make, use, sell, or import the invention in the United States until the patent expires. Infringement occurs when someone practices the invention without permission from the patent holder. A patent holder has the exclusive rights to make, use, sell, or import the invention until the patent expires. Infringement occurs when someone practices the invention without permission, leading to monetary damages and possible injunctive relief. Patents can be sold, assigned, or licensed to third parties, granting them permission to practice the invention in exchange for consideration. Patents provide a negative right to exclude others from practicing the invention but do not grant the patentee an affirmative right to practice it themselves. Patents can be extended up to five years in the pharmaceutical context to account for delays in regulatory approval, with relief from infringement requiring a court lawsuit in federal district court. The forum for most patent disputes is federal district court, with appeals heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. If infringement is proven, the patent holder may obtain monetary damages (lost profits or reasonable royalty) and injunctive relief. Damages can be increased up to three times the amount found. Courts have discretion to increase damages up to three times the amount found for infringement. Enhanced damages are reserved for egregious cases of culpable behavior. Attorneys' fees can be awarded in exceptional cases. Patent holders can seek injunctive relief, such as preliminary and permanent injunctions, in successful patent infringement lawsuits. The defendant in a patent infringement case may defend by claiming the patent is invalid or by asserting noninfringement. Invalidity can be proven by showing the patent fails to meet requirements for patentability. Noninfringement can be claimed if the accused activities do not fall within the scope of the patent claims. The accused infringer may argue that the patent is unenforceable due to fraudulent activities of the patent holder. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) has become a key forum for patent disputes after the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) introduced new procedures for challenging patent validity. These include post-grant review (PGR) and inter partes review (IPR) for challenging patent validity based on various grounds. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) is a key forum for patent disputes after the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act introduced new procedures for challenging patent validity, including post-grant review (PGR) and inter partes review (IPR). IPR is the most widely used procedure for challenging patents based on prior art. Patents on pharmaceutical products' active ingredients are valuable as they are difficult to invent around. Pharmaceutical patents cover various aspects beyond the active ingredient, including drug formulation, method of use, administration technologies, manufacturing methods, and related chemicals. Active ingredient patents are valuable but not the only important patents for pharmaceutical manufacturers, especially for biological products with naturally occurring active ingredients that may not be patentable. Pharmaceutical patents cover various aspects beyond the active ingredient, including drug formulation, method of use, administration technologies, manufacturing methods, and related chemicals. Inventions related to the active ingredient, such as crystalline forms, polymorphs, intermediaries, salts, and metabolites, must be new, useful, and nonobvious to be patentable. Improvements on these technologies can also be patented if they are new and nonobvious, requiring permission from both the original patent holder and the improvement patent holder. Pharmaceutical patents cover various aspects beyond the active ingredient, including drug formulation, method of use, administration technologies, and manufacturing methods. Improvements on these technologies can also be patented if they are new and nonobvious, requiring permission from both the original patent holder and the improvement patent holder. Pharmaceutical products may be protected by multiple patents, with some drugs having an average of 71 patents each. AbbVie, the maker of Humira, filed 247 patent applications for the product, resulting in 132 issued patents. In 132 issued patents, pharmaceutical manufacturers have been criticized for obtaining secondary patents to extend patent protection beyond the term set by Congress, deterring competition and keeping prices high. Critics argue that many of these secondary pharmaceutical patents are of questionable value and validity. Many secondary pharmaceutical patents are of questionable value and validity, leading to concerns about patent thickets. This term refers to situations where multiple parties have overlapping patent rights on one product, increasing transaction costs and creating coordination challenges. It can also describe an incumbent manufacturer's practice of amassing a large volume of patents to intimidate competitors from entering the market. AbbVie's Humira patent portfolio is cited as an example of a patent thicket used to deter competitors from entering the market. While some criticize patent thickets and evergreening, others argue that they incentivize innovation and improvements in drug formulations and treatments. Secondary pharmaceutical patents, even if controversial, may offer genuine medical benefits to patients. Defenders of evergreening point out that existing laws support these practices. Existing laws already provide mechanisms to challenge the validity of patents, with the patent holder typically having exclusive rights to the invention. However, compulsory licenses may allow others to use the invention without prior consent, requiring approval from a governmental entity and compensation to the patent holder. Current federal law includes compulsory license provisions for patents, such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, allowing the U.S. government to use any patented invention without permission. The patent holder can seek compensation through legal action but cannot stop the government's use of the invention. Compulsory licensing under federal law, including 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, allows the government to use patented inventions without permission, providing reasonable compensation. The Bayh-Dole Act also allows for compulsory licensing of federally funded inventions under specific circumstances. The federal government can use patented inventions under reasonable terms, with some compensation to the patentee. FDA law aims to protect public health by regulating the approval of new drugs and biologics. Balancing innovation and competition is important in both patent and FDA law, with regulatory exclusivities provided for approved pharmaceutical products meeting criteria. The approval processes for new pharmaceutical products involve exclusivities created by Congress to encourage research and development. New drugs require FDA approval if they are not recognized as safe and effective for their intended use. To obtain FDA approval for a new drug, a sponsor must conduct costly and time-consuming studies demonstrating its safety and effectiveness in human subjects through clinical trials. The sponsor submits an investigational new drug (IND) application to FDA, providing information about the drug, its intended use, data from animal studies, and a proposed clinical study design. The FDA requires a proposed clinical study design and approval from an Institutional Review Board for an IND application. Clinical testing involves three phases: Phase I focuses on safety, Phase II and III evaluate efficacy and effectiveness. Results are submitted in an NDA to FDA's CDER for review. The company submits results in an NDA to FDA's CDER, including a list of drug components, composition, manufacturing details, labeling, pediatric assessments, and patient information. The NDA also contains product description, indications, manufacturing process, labeling, and may include a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Two types of NDAs are 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2) with different relationships to underlying studies. The 505(b)(2) pathway for NDAs involves using studies not conducted by the company or for which they do not have the right of reference. This includes published literature where the applicant has no right to the underlying studies or FDA findings on safety and effectiveness for approved drugs. This pathway is used for modifications of approved drugs that are not entirely new or simply generic versions of branded drugs. FDA regulations allow NDA holders to make changes to the drug or label after approval. Minor changes require notice, but changes to the label, dosage, strength, or manufacturing methods require a supplemental NDA (sNDA). sNDAs must include post-market information and clinical study analyses. FDA reviews the NDA for safety and effectiveness, labeling, and manufacturing controls before sending a determination letter to the company. If the NDA meets requirements, FDA approves it. Before the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, new drugs required a complete application under Section 505(b) with clinical trial data for FDA approval. The Act established abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for generic manufacturers to rely on prior FDA approvals. FDA may impose conditions on NDA approvals, including post-market clinical studies. If an NDA doesn't meet requirements, FDA issues a \"complete response letter\" outlining deficiencies. The ANDA pathway allows generic manufacturers to rely on FDA's prior approval of a reference listed drug (RLD) to establish the safety and effectiveness of their generic drug. This process involves conducting studies to demonstrate pharmaceutical and bioequivalence to the RLD, along with submitting proposed labeling and patent certifications to FDA for approval. Biological products, such as viruses, toxins, vaccines, blood components, or proteins, are large, complex molecules produced through biotechnology in living systems. Variability between batches is normal. FDA's approval process for biological products and generics accounts for these challenges, requiring a valid biologics license and proper product labeling. A biologics license is required for biological products, which must be properly labeled with key details like the manufacturer's information and expiration date. To obtain a biologics license, a manufacturer must submit a biologics license application (BLA) to FDA for approval, including data from studies, manufacturing methods, stability data, samples, proposed labels, and compliance with standards. To approve a BLA, FDA must ensure the biological product is safe, pure, and potent, meeting standards for safety and quality. After approval, BLA holders must notify FDA of any changes. An abbreviated approval process exists for biosimilar or interchangeable biological products under the BPCIA. To obtain a BLA for a biosimilar, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the product is highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. The biosimilar must have the same mechanism of action, route of administration, dosage form, and strength as the reference product, and the production facilities must meet quality standards. The production and distribution facilities must meet standards to ensure the biological product's safety, purity, and potency. For an interchangeable product, data must show it is biosimilar to the reference product and produces the same clinical result. Interchangeable products can be substituted without the healthcare provider's intervention. The manufacturer must demonstrate that alternating between the biosimilar and reference product does not pose a greater risk in terms of safety or efficacy. Federal law establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity to balance interests in competition and innovation. This exclusivity encourages new drug applicants to generate clinical data and supports follow-on product manufacturers to submit abbreviated applications promptly. There are two categories of regulatory exclusivity: data exclusivity, which prevents reliance on FDA's findings for the reference product, and marketing exclusivity, which prohibits FDA from approving other products. Federal law provides regulatory exclusivities for new drug and biological products based on factors like innovation and treatment population. For new drugs with a new chemical entity, the NDA filer can get five years of data exclusivity from NDA approval, preventing approval of other applications for the same product and use. During the five-year data exclusivity period after NDA approval, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applications for the same active ingredient can be submitted to the FDA, except with a paragraph (IV) certification for patent invalidity or non-infringement. Significant changes to approved chemical entities may qualify for three years of data exclusivity. The FDA may accept ANDA and 505(b)(2) submissions referencing changes meriting exclusivity during a three-year period. To obtain three-year exclusivity, the NDA or sNDA must include reports of new clinical investigations essential for approval. Brand-name biological products have two periods of exclusivity: four years before biosimilar applications can be submitted, and approval of biosimilar applications cannot become effective. The FDA does not accept biosimilar applications for the first four years after a reference biological product is licensed. For the next eight years, FDA accepts biosimilar applications but does not approve them until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. Regulatory exclusivities do not apply to supplemental BLAs for changes in indication, dosing, or strength. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides 180 days of exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant that successfully challenges an active patent listed for the RLD using a paragraph (IV) certification that the patent is invalid. This exclusivity period prevents FDA from approving another ANDA for the same RLD during this time. The BPCIA awards regulatory exclusivity to the first interchangeable biological product for a reference product, preventing FDA from making an interchangeability determination for subsequent biologics using the same reference product until the exclusivity expires. The timing of the exclusivity period depends on various factors such as commercial marketing, patent disputes, and litigation status. The FD&C Act provides regulatory exclusivities to encourage market entry for drugs serving smaller populations or with limited competition. For example, a 180-day exclusivity is granted to an ANDA filer for a \"competitive generic therapy\" if there is inadequate generic competition. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizes the development of drugs for rare diseases, known as \"orphan drugs,\" which may have fewer financial incentives due to small patient populations. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizes the development of drugs for rare diseases by providing a seven-year marketing exclusivity for approved drugs. This exclusivity prevents FDA approval of another drug for the same disease during this period. Additionally, pediatric exclusivity can be obtained by conducting pediatric studies if the drug may benefit the pediatric population. Pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity obtained by NDA or BLA filers. It incentivizes pharmaceutical manufacturers to complete FDA approval process and bring new drugs to market. Patents and regulatory exclusivities serve similar purposes of encouraging innovation and investment in novel inventions. The FDA approval process for new drugs can be affected by patent rights, which may delay the entry of generic or biosimilar products to the market. The Hatch-Waxman Act aims to address patent disputes and challenges that can impact the approval of generic drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act corrected distortions in patent terms caused by FDA requirements for new drug approval. It granted patent term extensions for delays in regulatory approval, benefiting new drug manufacturers. It also addressed the availability of patented inventions for generic manufacturers after patent expiration. The Hatch-Waxman Act created a \"safe harbor\" for generic manufacturers to conduct tests on patented drugs necessary for FDA approval without infringing on patents, preventing an effective extension of patent terms. The Hatch-Waxman Act established a safe harbor for generic manufacturers to conduct FDA approval tests without infringing patents, potentially delaying patent litigation until the generic product is marketed. This can provide legal certainty but may also delay resolution of patent disputes. The Hatch-Waxman Act and the BPCIA both have provisions that consider the filing of follow-on applications as artificial acts of patent infringement, allowing for early resolution of patent disputes before the marketing of the follow-on product. These laws aim to facilitate specialized patent dispute resolution procedures. The Orange Book contains information on listed patents related to drug applications. Generic drug manufacturers filing an ANDA must provide certifications for each patent listed, including expiration dates or validity. Different certifications affect FDA approval differently, with paragraph (III) certifications delaying approval until the patent expires, and paragraph (IV) certifications triggering patent dispute procedures. The patent dispute procedures for generic drug applicants involve notifying the patent holder and NDA holder, followed by potential litigation. If the patent holder does not file a lawsuit within 45 days of notification, the generic applicant can seek a declaratory judgment on patent validity. A lawsuit by the patent holder triggers a 30-month stay on FDA approval, during which the parties resolve their patent dispute. If the court finds the patent invalid or not infringed before the 30-month period ends, FDA can approve the generic drug. FDA may approve the ANDA based on court judgment or settlement order regarding patent infringement, with the effective date not earlier than the patent expiration. Generic drug approval can be delayed by NDA holder's patent rights. Only certain patents related to drug substance, product, and method of use must be listed with an NDA. The FDA does not actively police the patent information listed in the Orange Book, allowing NDA holders to potentially list irrelevant patents to deter generic competition. While it is generally in the interest of NDA holders to list all relevant patents to benefit from the 30-month stay, there is no statutory provision requiring them to do so. Only certain types of patents related to a drug may be included in the Orange Book. The Orange Book includes only certain types of patents related to a drug, leading to patent litigation outside the Hatch-Waxman Act. Biological products and biosimilars follow a different patent dispute resolution scheme under the BPCIA, where regulatory approval is not contingent on patent resolution. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman process, BLAs for biologics do not need to list patent information, resulting in no patents listed in the Purple Book. The BPCIA provides a unique patent dispute resolution process for biosimilars, known as the \"patent dance.\" This process involves information exchanges between the biosimilar applicant and the reference product sponsor to evaluate patent infringement. The BPCIA provides a patent dispute resolution process for biosimilars called the \"patent dance,\" involving information exchanges on relevant patents and positions on validity and infringement. Parties can litigate patents after the dance or when the biosimilar plans to market. BLA holders can't force biosimilar applicants to participate. If the biosimilar applicant opts out, the reference product sponsor can bring a declaratory judgment action for patent infringement. The BPCIA allows for a patent dispute resolution process for biosimilars known as the \"patent dance,\" where information on relevant patents is exchanged. If the biosimilar applicant chooses not to participate, they may face immediate legal action for patent infringement. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, the BPCIA includes penalties for not disclosing relevant patents during the patent dance. The reference product sponsor must provide a list of patents they believe could be infringed upon if the biosimilar product is made without permission. Failure to list these patents may result in the patent holder losing the right to sue. The \"list it or lose it\" requirement in the BPCIA states that the patent holder may lose the right to sue if they fail to submit a complete list of patents during the patent dance. Legislative proposals in Congress aim to reduce drug prices by reforming IP laws and promoting competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers. These proposals are reviewed as examples of potential legal changes, without evaluating their merits. Congressional proposals related to IP rights are being considered as a potential means to reduce drug prices. Other legislative proposals, such as allowing drug price negotiation for Medicare Part D and importing cheaper pharmaceuticals from Canada, are also being discussed. These proposals indirectly relate to IP rights in pharmaceuticals but are outside the scope of this report due to the complexity of legal regimes governing IP rights. Efforts to reduce drug prices through legislative proposals include facilitating generic and biosimilar market entry, curbing anticompetitive practices, limiting IP rights based on pricing behavior, and increasing patent transparency. One specific proposal is the CREATES Act of 2019, which aims to address barriers to follow-on product entry. Some brand manufacturers restrict distribution of products, hindering access to samples for generic product testing. This delay in obtaining samples can impede the entry of generic products. Brand samples can be purchased from licensed wholesalers, but restricted distribution limits sales. Restrictions can be voluntary or mandated for high-risk drugs under FDA regulations. Under the FD&C Act, drugs with safety concerns may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) plan, which can include medication guides and communication plans. More restrictive REMS programs may involve elements to assure safe use (ETASU) like prescriber certification or controlled distribution. Some brand manufacturers have implemented restricted distribution to limit sales to generic manufacturers, potentially prolonging access to samples for generic products. Generic manufacturers have complained about being denied access to samples through restricted distribution, leading to challenges in entering the market. Some brand manufacturers have restricted distribution to limit sales to generic manufacturers, causing delays in obtaining samples. Generic manufacturers face challenges in entering the market due to these restrictions, with limited legal recourse available to them. FDA lacks explicit authority to enforce provisions preventing brand manufacturers from using REMS to block competition. The FDA lacks authority to compel the sale of samples for comparative testing, leading generic manufacturers to sue brand manufacturers for antitrust violations. The uncertainty lies in whether a refusal to sell samples constitutes anticompetitive behavior under existing law. The CREATES Act aims to address this issue. The CREATES Act aims to address uncertainties in antitrust law by creating a private cause of action for follow-on product developers to obtain brand samples through expedited litigation. This allows developers to sue for sample provision if specific statutory elements are met, without asserting an antitrust claim. The CREATES Act allows follow-on product developers to request FDA authorization to obtain samples if they cannot obtain them on market-based terms. Developers must show that the brand manufacturer failed to provide samples within 31 days of the request or FDA's authorization. The CREATES Act allows follow-on product developers to request FDA authorization to obtain samples if they cannot obtain them on market-based terms. If the developer prevails, the court can compel the brand manufacturer to provide samples, award attorney's fees, costs, and potentially monetary damages not exceeding the brand manufacturer's product revenue during the delay period. The bill also gives FDA more flexibility in approving requests. The bill aims to provide FDA more flexibility in approving REMS systems for follow-on products, allowing for different but comparable systems as alternative options. It also includes provisions to limit brand manufacturer's liability for follow-on product developer's failures during development and testing. The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act of 2018 (ADMA) aims to have the government manufacture certain pharmaceuticals to promote competition in the market for pharmaceutical products. It would establish an Office of Drug Manufacturing within HHS to oversee the production of \"applicable drugs,\" defined as FDA-approved drugs with expired patents and regulatory exclusivity. The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act of 2018 establishes criteria for an \"applicable drug,\" including not being currently marketed in the US or being marketed by fewer than three manufacturers. The drug must also meet additional criteria such as a recent price increase or being on the FDA's drug shortage list. Another condition is the existence of a license or authorization for \"patent use\" under federal law provisions like eminent domain authority and march-in rights. The \"applicable drug\" definition under the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act of 2018 limits the Office of Drug Manufacturing to producing drugs with expired patents or regulatory exclusivities, or with a government patent license. The Office is required to submit FDA applications, acquire manufacturing rights, sell drugs at a fair price, and use the proceeds for its activities. It may also manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients under specified conditions. The bill sets criteria for manufacturing drugs, prioritizing those that lower costs, increase competition, improve public health, and reduce costs for health programs. The Office must produce at least 15 drugs in the first year, including insulin, and gradually increase production over time. The Office must manufacture at least 25 drugs within three years of enactment. The Secretary must make approved FDA applications available for sale, and revoke them if the drug is not marketed or price is increased unfairly. The Office must report annually to the President and Congress on drug manufacturing status. The bill authorizes necessary appropriations for the Office. Reverse payment settlements, also known as pay-for-delay settlements, allow brand-name companies to avoid the risk of patent invalidation and delay generic competition by paying generic manufacturers to wait before entering the market. This practice effectively extends the brand-name company's exclusive rights to market the drug. Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name companies paying generic manufacturers to delay market entry, potentially violating antitrust laws. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act aims to limit these agreements to promote competition. Pay-for-delay agreements may violate antitrust laws by creating anticompetitive effects. The Sherman Act and Federal Trade Commission Act prohibit contracts that restrain trade or competition. The court evaluates agreements for antitrust violations based on their competitive impact. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that reverse payment settlements can sometimes breach antitrust laws, allowing litigation challenging these settlements to proceed. Courts assess the reasonableness of trade restraints, applying a rule of reason analysis or a quick look in certain cases. While no definitive analytical framework exists, courts consider the totality of circumstances in antitrust evaluations. In antitrust cases, courts use a rule of reason analysis to evaluate trade restraints. The plaintiff must show anticompetitive effects in a defined market, shifting the burden to the defendant to justify the practice. If the defendant fails to provide a procompetitive justification, the plaintiff prevails. If the defendant rebuts the evidence, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the anticompetitive effects outweigh the procompetitive effects. Certain agreements are considered per se illegal \"without regard to a consideration of their reasonableness\" due to their high probability of being anticompetitive. The most common categories include horizontal price fixing, market allocation, or output limitation. Liability attaches without the need for proof of power, intent, or impact. Additionally, a \"quick look\" analysis serves as an abbreviated rule of reason evaluation in antitrust cases. The Court has established an intermediate standard of review for anticompetitive agreements, where proof required varies with circumstances. In cases where no elaborate industry analysis is needed, plaintiffs can establish a prima facie case without traditional market power evidence. Some courts use a \"quick look\" approach endorsed by the FTC, where if a challenged restraint is likely to harm consumers, it is considered anticompetitive. When a challenged restraint is likely to harm consumers, it is considered \"inherently suspect\" and presumptively anticompetitive. The defendant can rebut this presumption by providing \"plausible reasons\" why the practice may not have adverse consequences or could benefit consumers. If no reasons are given, the plaintiff prevails. If reasons are provided, the plaintiff must show either why the restraint likely harmed consumers or provide evidence of anticompetitive effects. If successful, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove the restraint does not harm competition. In Actavis v. FTC, the Supreme Court determined that pay-for-delay agreements are subject to the rule of reason analysis. The burden of proof lies with the FTC to demonstrate the anticompetitive effects of such agreements before shifting to the defendant to justify any procompetitive virtues. The FTC must fully establish the harm to competition before the defendant can provide justifications such as avoided litigation costs or fair value for services. PAAGBA aims to prevent brand-name manufacturers from compensating follow-on companies. The proposed legislation, PAAGBA, aims to prohibit brand-name manufacturers from compensating follow-on product manufacturers to delay market entry. It would create a presumption of illegality for agreements where the brand-name company provides the generic with anything of value in exchange for limiting research, development, or sales of the generic product. The FTC would be authorized to enforce proceedings against such agreements. The proposed legislation, PAAGBA, aims to prohibit brand-name manufacturers from compensating follow-on product manufacturers to delay market entry. Agreements where the brand-name company provides the generic with anything of value in exchange for limiting research, development, or sales of the generic product would be presumed illegal. Parties can overcome this presumption with clear evidence showing compensation for other goods/services or procompetitive benefits outweigh anticompetitive effects. The fact-finder cannot assume entry wouldn't occur without the agreement or that early market entry is harmful. The proposed legislation aims to prohibit brand-name manufacturers from compensating follow-on product manufacturers to delay market entry. If the FTC proves violations, a civil penalty will be assessed against each violating party, not exceeding three times the value gained from the agreement. Factors considered in calculating the penalty include the nature of the violation, impact on commerce, culpability, and profits gained by all parties involved. The proposed legislation aims to prevent brand-name manufacturers from paying generic manufacturers to delay market entry. The FTC could impose civil penalties on violators, seek injunctions, and revoke exclusivity rights. Some suggest using compulsory licenses to lower drug prices, such as the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019. The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019 (PDPRA) aims to review brand-name drug pricing to determine excessiveness. If a drug's price is deemed excessive, the Secretary can waive exclusivities and issue compulsory licenses. Holders must submit pricing information annually to HHS. The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019 requires drug manufacturers to submit detailed pricing information annually to HHS for brand-name drugs. The Secretary will determine if a drug's price is excessive by comparing the average manufacturer price in the U.S. to the median price in reference countries. If deemed excessive, the Secretary can take actions such as waiving exclusivities and issuing compulsory licenses. The Secretary will determine if a drug's price is excessive by comparing it to the median price in reference countries. If deemed excessive, actions such as waiving exclusivities and issuing compulsory licenses can be taken. The bill proposes a compulsory patent license, called an \"excessive drug price license,\" allowing third parties to produce and use overpriced drugs despite existing patents. These parties can also use regulatory test data for the drug but must pay a reasonable royalty to the patent holder and NDA holder. The royalty rate will be determined by the IRS or the Secretary. The bill proposes a compulsory patent license for overpriced drugs, allowing third parties to produce and use them. FDA approval is still required for marketing. The FDA must expedite review of applications within 8 months. The brand-name manufacturer is prohibited from increasing prices during this period. The Secretary will establish a database of brand-name drugs and excessive price determinations, submitting an annual report to Congress. The bill proposes compulsory licensing for overpriced drugs, with the Secretary required to report excessive price determinations online. This may raise constitutional concerns regarding the Takings Clause and the compensation for private property rights. The FLAT Prices Act aims to limit FDA regulatory exclusivities based on pricing behavior by shortening the exclusivity period for pharmaceutical products if the manufacturer increases prices by certain percentages within specified time periods. The FLAT Prices Act aims to shorten exclusivity periods for pharmaceutical products if manufacturers increase prices by certain percentages within specified time periods. Manufacturers must report price increases to the Secretary within 30 days, or face additional reductions in exclusivity. The Secretary can waive or decrease the reduction if the price increase is deemed necessary for drug production and does not restrict patient access. The Biologic Patent Transparency Act (BPTA) aims to increase transparency in patent listings for biologics by requiring BLA applicants to provide patent information to the FDA and publishing a searchable list in the Purple Book. This reform seeks to reduce patent thickets and limit enforcement of late-listed biologic patents. The Biologic Patent Transparency Act (BPTA) aims to increase transparency by requiring BLA holders to submit a list of relevant patents to the FDA within 30 days. It also changes the \"patent dance\" process and enforces patent listing requirements. The Biologic Patent Transparency Act (BPTA) would enforce patent listing requirements by implementing a \"list it or lose it\" provision for patents not timely included in the list given to the FDA. It also mandates the publication of the Purple Book with more detailed information on licensed biological products, including official and brand names, licensure dates, marketing status, dosage, route of administration, reference products, and determinations related to biosimilarity or interchangeability. The Biologic Patent Transparency Act (BPTA) would require the FDA to publish a more detailed Purple Book with patent information, regulatory exclusivity details, and make it easily searchable. This addresses concerns about high pharmaceutical prices and involves patent law, FDA regulations, and public policy debates. The balance between creating innovative medicines and public costs is a key aspect of public policy regarding pharmaceutical prices. Understanding IP rights in pharmaceutical products is crucial to grasp the implications of legislative approaches to lower drug prices."
