    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sex Offender Registration Tips Program Act of 2009\" or the \"SORT Act of 2009\". Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., a nonprofit organization based in New York, has been educating and supporting the community, law enforcement, and government agencies on sex offender issues since 1998. They operate the National Megan's Law Helpline, offering information, support, and referrals on sex offender management nationally and internationally. The National Megan's Law Helpline provides support to victims of sexual abuse and violent crime, generating over 70,000 requests for assistance. Victims who receive counseling support are more likely to report their attack and participate in the prosecution of the offender. The helpline coordinates with various resources for assistance and referrals. Parents for Megan's Law, Inc. operates a website that serves as a national resource for information on sex offender registration, notification, abuse prevention, and victim support. The website also allows for anonymous reporting of child pornography and sex tourism. The National Megan's Law Helpline provides a resource for reporting registered sex offenders who fail to comply with limited resources. The National Megan's Law Helpline allows for confidential reporting of registered sex offenders who do not comply with registration requirements or are in positions where they can access potential child victims. Tips are triaged, victim support is provided, and referrals are made to the appropriate authorities for follow-up action. Anonymous tips to the Helpline have led to actions such as sending a sex offender back to prison and preventing a former teacher, required to register as a sex offender, from accessing potential victims. A registered sex offender, including a former teacher, was prevented from gaining employment as a children's tutor and using an Internet dating service to target potential victims. Another offender on parole for weapons charges was sent back to prison for entering school grounds and drug possession. A national survey in 2003 found that 24% of registered sex offenders were not complying with registration laws, posing a risk to children and communities. Access to National Criminal Information databases is crucial for Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., to verify tips, research noncompliant registrants, and provide accurate information to law enforcement. The SORT Program aims to reduce sexual victimization and increase offender registration compliance through community tips and proactive measures. Federal funding for the SORT Program is essential. Authorizing federal funds for the SORT Program will reduce criminal sexual victimization by supporting crime victims seeking assistance, sex offender registration, notification, prevention education, and providing interactive resources for the public to report noncompliant sex offenders in positions of trust. The SORT program aims to support communities, crime victims, and law enforcement in combating sexual victimization. It provides sexual abuse prevention information, advocacy for victims, and infrastructure for enforcement and support. The SORT program maximizes law enforcement resources by promptly screening anonymous tips through trained investigators with access to databases. Grants are provided for the implementation of the Sex Offender Registration Tips Program. The Attorney General provides grants and resources to implement the Sex Offender Registration Tips Program, which aims to reduce sexual victimization and support victims of violent crime by providing sex offender registry information to law enforcement and enabling community coordination. The Sex Offender Registration Tips Program aims to reduce sexual victimization by enabling community coordination, analyzing sex offender data, providing support to crime victims, and identifying high-risk offenders for follow-up action by law enforcement. The Attorney General ensures access to National Crime Information Center databases for Parents for Megan's Law, Inc. for assisting law enforcement. $1,000,000 is authorized for grants for fiscal years 2010-2014."
