The act delegated various responsibilities to OIRA, including information policy, paperwork control, privacy, and data processing. Agencies were required to obtain approval from OIRA before conducting or sponsoring information collections. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 established OIRA within OMB, giving it responsibilities for information policy, paperwork control, privacy, and data processing. OIRA approved agencies' information collection requests, with a focus on paperwork review actions, involving about half of its 77 staff members. Since 1981, OIRA has handled between 4,000 and 6,000 paperwork clearance actions annually. In 1980, President Reagan established a \"Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief\" to monitor OMB's coordination of new rules and develop legislative changes to regulatory statutes. The Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief was responsible for reviewing and recommending changes to regulations. They identified 119 rules for alteration or cancellation, with potential savings of over $150 billion in the next 10 years. However, critics argued that the estimated savings did not consider the benefits of the rules. The task force's legislative efforts were not as successful, failing to enact revisions to clean air and water laws or broad regulatory reform legislation. President Reagan's Executive Order 12291 in February 1981 expanded OIRA's role by requiring agencies to justify regulations based on societal benefits outweighing costs. It mandated regulatory impact analyses for major rules with significant economic effects. Executive Order 12291 required regulatory impact analyses for major rules with significant economic effects. The order gave OMB the authority to determine if a rule was \"major\" and required submission of draft proposed and final rules to OMB before publication in the Federal Register. OMB was authorized to review any regulatory impact analysis, notice of proposed rulemaking, or final rule based on the requirements of the order. Non-major rules had to be submitted at least 10 days before publication, while major rules had to be submitted up to 60 days in advance. Executive Order 12291 authorized the director of OMB to review draft proposed or final rules based on the order's requirements. The review should be completed within 60 days, with the possibility of extension. The director could exempt classes of regulations and agencies were required to respond to OMB's comments before publishing final rules. OMB's authority was subject to the presidential task force on regulatory relief, and the Reagan Administration integrated OMB's regulatory review responsibilities with those of OIRA under the PRA. In 1981, OIRA reviewed nearly 2,800 rules under Executive Order 12291, along with 5,000 paperwork review actions. President Reagan extended OIRA's influence with Executive Order 12498, requiring agencies to submit a \"regulatory program\" to OMB covering all significant regulatory actions. The new executive order expanded OIRA's authority to review agency regulations and return them for reconsideration if they were not in the agency's regulatory program for that year or were materially different from what was described. This allowed OIRA to be aware of forthcoming agency actions well in advance. The establishment of regulatory review function within OIRA was a significant development in the overall movement to reform the federal regulatory process. Executive Orders 12291 and 12498 allowed OIRA to be aware of forthcoming agency actions in advance and stop objectionable rules before they gained momentum. Critics noted that the regulatory process lacked final approval by Congress, unlike the President's budget process. Centralized review of agencies' regulations within the Executive Office of the President has been part of the rulemaking process for some time. The Executive Office of the President has been involved in the rulemaking process since the early 1970s. President Nixon established a \"Quality of Life Review\" program in 1971, requiring agencies to submit draft proposed and final rules related to environmental quality, consumer protection, and health and safety to OMB for review. President Ford's Executive Order 11821 in 1974 mandated agencies to prepare an \"inflation impact statement\" for major proposed rules. President Ford's Executive Order 11821 in 1974 mandated agencies to prepare an \"inflation impact statement\" for major proposed rules. The statement certified that the inflationary impact of the rule had been evaluated according to OMB criteria. OMB was directed to develop criteria for identifying major rules with significant inflation impact, considering costs, productivity, competition, and supplies. Agencies had to submit impact statements to the Council on Wage and Price Stability before publishing major rules in the Federal Register. President Carter's Executive Order 12291 required agencies to publish semiannual agendas of significant rules and prepare regulatory analyses for rules with a $100 million impact on the economy. The order established a Regulatory Analysis Review Group and a Regulatory Council to coordinate agencies' actions. The analytical and review requirements in this order differed significantly from previous efforts under President Ford's Executive Order 11821. The requirements in Executive Order 12291 differed significantly from previous efforts. For example, agencies were now required to choose the least costly approach to a regulatory objective, unlike before where they only had to consider alternative approaches. Additionally, Executive Order 12291 consolidated regulatory oversight functions within OIRA, giving it more influence compared to its predecessors. OIRA could now overrule agency determinations on whether a rule was \"major\" and delay its implementation. OIRA's significant influence on rulemaking was highlighted by its position within OMB, which reviews and approves rulemaking agencies' budget requests. Under Executive Order 12291, OIRA could delay regulations if it believed agencies had not considered all alternatives or if the analysis was flawed. The review process was more transparent, with RARG and CWPS providing comments during the public comment period. The draft comments were shared with all RARG members and made public at the end of the comment period. OIRA's reviews happened before rules were open for comment, and Executive Order 12291 did not mandate disclosure of OIRA's comments. This process differed from previous regulatory reviews and sparked controversy over the expansion of OIRA's authority. Some felt it didn't go far enough, while others raised concerns about potential violations of the separation of powers. Some believed OIRA's expanded authority violated separation of powers and hindered public participation in rulemaking. Concerns included displacing agency decision makers' authority, lack of technical expertise, and OIRA's ability to fulfill its responsibilities. GAO found in 1983 that OIRA's increased responsibilities under Executive Order 12291 impacted its ability to carry out PRA duties, recommending Congress consider amending the act to limit OIRA's regulatory review role. Many early concerns about OIRA focused on lack of transparency in regulatory reviews and potential outside influence. OMB Director issued a memorandum in 1981 requiring factual material provided to OIRA to also be sent to relevant agencies. Controversy surrounding OIRA's role in rulemaking process persisted for years. In 1983, Congress allowed OIRA's appropriation authority to expire due to dissatisfaction with its regulatory and paperwork review performance. In 1985, House committee chairmen criticized OMB's interference in a Department of Labor decision regarding a proposed standard on ethylene oxide exposure. OIRA was reauthorized in 1986 with the administrator subject to Senate confirmation. In an attempt to address concerns about OIRA's regulatory review role, the administrator issued new procedures in 1986 to improve transparency. This included limiting communication with outside parties to the administrator or deputy administrator, making all written materials public, and providing written correspondence between OIRA and agency heads upon request after a rule was published. In 1987, the National Academy of Public Administration published a report on presidential management of agency rulemaking, summarizing criticisms and recommendations for improvement. The report suggested accepting regulatory management as essential for presidential management and including all communications in the rulemaking record. Additionally, in 1988, the Administrative Conference of the United States found that presidential reviews could enhance coordination among agencies. The Administrative Conference recommended public disclosure of proposed and final agency rules submitted to OIRA under the executive order, as well as timely completion of reviews. President George H. W. Bush continued implementing Executive Orders 12291 and 12498, but external events affected OIRA's operation. In 1989, his nominee to head OIRA was not confirmed, and later, President Bush established the President's \"Council on.\" President Bush established the President's \"Council on Competitiveness\" to review regulations issued by agencies, chaired by Vice President Quayle and supported by OIRA. The council oversaw rules with significant economic impact, sparking controversy for rolling back environmental requirements and operating in secrecy. The Council on Competitiveness operated in secrecy, facing criticism for \"backdoor rulemaking.\" It continued until the end of the Bush Administration in 1993. President Clinton then revoked previous executive orders and abolished the council, replacing them with Executive Order 12866 for regulatory planning and review. This order maintained the framework of presidential review of rulemaking. Executive Order 12866 established new regulatory principles, requiring agencies to submit proposed and final rules to OMB for review before publication. OIRA was designated as the expert on regulatory issues, with the Vice President serving as the President's main advisor on regulatory policy. The Executive Order 12866 established regulatory principles, designating the Vice President as the President's main advisor on regulatory policy. It requires agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives, prioritize risk, justify regulations based on benefits, and minimize societal burden. The Executive Order 12866 aims to reduce the burden on society to achieve regulatory objectives by giving more control to regulatory agencies and setting a lower threshold for cost-benefit analysis compared to previous orders. It establishes agency and OIRA responsibilities in the centralized review of regulations. The new order limited OIRA reviews to actions identified as \"significant\" regulatory actions, defined as those likely to have a major economic impact, create inconsistencies with other agencies, alter budgetary impacts, or raise novel legal or policy issues. The Executive Order 12866 limited OIRA reviews to significant rules, reducing the number of rules examined annually. It requires OIRA to complete reviews within 90 days and mandates disclosure of changes made to rules based on OIRA recommendations. The Executive Order 12866 limits OIRA reviews to significant rules, reducing the number of rules examined annually. OIRA is required to provide agencies with written communications and maintain a public log of regulatory actions under review. OIRA reviews agencies' draft rules at proposed and final stages, starting when the rulemaking agency submits a regulatory review package. During the review period, OIRA evaluates draft rules from agencies and may return them for reconsideration or deem them consistent with the executive order. Rules are coded as \"consistent with change\" if modified, and \"consistent with no change\" if unchanged. If a proposed rule is approved, the agency can proceed with publishing a notice in the Federal Register for public comments and make necessary adjustments based on feedback. The agency may make changes to draft rules based on OIRA's evaluation during the review period. Most rules reviewed by OIRA are either \"consistent with change\" or \"consistent without change.\" Only a small percentage of rules are withdrawn or returned to the agencies. The proportion of rules coded as \"changed\" has varied over time. The data shows a significant number of rules were withdrawn and returned in 2001 at the start of the George W. Bush Administration. This was in response to a memorandum issued by Andrew H. Card, directing Cabinet departments and agencies to delay the publication and effective dates of rules. Similar actions were taken at the beginning of the Obama Administration in 2009. OIRA returned rules for reconsideration after a new administrator was appointed in 2001. The type of review conducted depends on the draft rule submitted, including compliance with the PRA for information collections and economic analysis for \"economically significant\" rules. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) provides guidance on preparing regulatory analyses under Executive Order 12866. This includes evaluating risk assessments, giving deference to peer-reviewed technical documents, ensuring compliance with other executive orders, and consulting with the Small Business Administration. During the review process, OIRA consults with the Small Business Administration and evaluates the impact of draft rules on other federal programs. Communication is typically done via email or telephone, with briefings and meetings held between OIRA and the agency. Desk officers consult with resource management officers and government economists before finalizing reviews of economically significant draft rules. OIRA consults with government economists and other staff on various issues related to draft rules. They may also circulate drafts to other parts of the Executive Office of the President or other agencies for review. Executive Order 12866 sets time frames for completing regulatory reviews. OIRA reviews draft rules and may ask agencies to withdraw and resubmit them, restarting the review period. The agency decides whether to proceed with publication or accept OIRA's suggested changes. Agencies rarely publish rules that OIRA returns or ignore suggestions. Some officials may appeal OIRA determinations to the White House. The OIRA review process includes an informal phase before rules are officially submitted. OIRA suggests promoting its analytic perspective earlier in the process to avoid agency entrenchment. Agencies often share drafts with OIRA desk officers before formal decision-making. The OIRA review process includes an informal phase where agencies share drafts with OIRA desk officers before formal decision-making. This practice allows for early identification of serious problems and corrections before the agency's position becomes irreversible. OIRA cannot informally review every proposed and final rule due to the volume, focusing on rules with statutory deadlines or those requiring input from multiple federal agencies like EPA and Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Transportation. Transportation rules are more likely to be informally reviewed by OIRA before formal submission. OIRA has been informally reviewing agencies' draft rules since 1981, but informal reviews became more common after Executive Order 12866 in 1993. There are indications that OIRA has increased its use of informal reviews in recent years, with agencies inviting OIRA staff into earlier phases of regulatory development to improve the quality of regulatory analyses and rules. In 2002, the OIRA administrator noted agencies' increasing receptivity to early discussions with OMB on significant rulemakings. OIRA aims to incentivize agencies to seek early review to avoid last-minute uncertainties. Limited studies have examined the impact of OIRA reviews on substantive rule changes. One study found that OIRA's reviews led to the rejection of some economically inefficient regulations but did not necessarily improve cost-effectiveness. Other studies analyzed OIRA's database to assess the impact on agencies' rules, noting challenges in interpreting codes like \"consistent with change\" and \"returns.\" Researchers should carefully interpret data on rule withdrawals in OIRA's database, as they may not always indicate substantive objections. Withdrawals could be for administrative reasons or initiated by OIRA. To effectively use this data, researchers should review documentation in agencies' and OIRA's rulemaking dockets. GAO's analysis in 2003 supplemented OMB's database with docket information and interviews with agency officials. It found that OIRA completed 642 reviews from July 2001 to June 2002, with 33% coded as \"consistent with no change\" and 50% as \"consistent with change.\" In 2003, GAO analyzed OIRA's database on rule reviews, finding that 8% were withdrawn, 3% were returned, and 5% had other dispositions. The focus was on 85 rules that were changed, withdrawn, or returned by nine selected agencies. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) were among the agencies affected by OIRA's suggested changes to draft rules. Out of 85 rules analyzed, 71 were coded as \"consistent with change,\" nine as \"returned,\" and five as \"withdrawn.\" OIRA's influence was significant on at least 25 rules, with suggested changes impacting scope, impact, costs, and benefits. The focus of OIRA's changes was mainly on reducing regulatory burden, particularly in rules from EPA's office. OIRA significantly influenced 25 out of 85 rules analyzed, mainly focusing on reducing regulatory burden. Changes included removing manganese from hazardous waste lists, adjusting emissions standards, and adding explanatory language to rule preambles. Minor editorial changes were suggested for some rules, while others were returned due to improper submission or agency concerns. OIRA influenced the withdrawal of seven rules due to concerns about regulatory analyses and coordination between agencies. Five rules were returned for substantive reasons, with the FAA submitting the majority. GAO found that only one rule was withdrawn at OIRA's suggestion, while the others were withdrawn by the agencies themselves. OIRA's influence on agencies' rules may be greater than reported by GAO due to limited documentation availability. OIRA's influence on agencies' rules may be greater than reported by GAO due to limited documentation availability. Some agencies do not propose certain regulatory provisions because they anticipate OIRA objections. Regulated entities have directly contacted OIRA regarding rules that were significantly affected, particularly in cases involving EPA rules. OIRA's influence on agencies' rules may be greater than reported by GAO due to limited documentation availability. Regulated entities have directly contacted OIRA regarding rules that were significantly affected, particularly in cases involving EPA rules. GAO found that in 7 out of 11 cases, OIRA's recommendations to rulemaking agencies aligned with suggestions made by regulated parties, such as industry representatives opposing the listing of manganese as a hazardous waste constituent. Despite similarities in comments, the extent of influence remains unclear. OIRA's reviews often led to changes in draft rules, with 10 out of 12 rules examined by GAO being altered at OIRA's suggestion. Agencies used various methods to document OIRA's reviews, but there was inconsistent interpretation of which changes required documentation. The formal process for OIRA's review of draft rules has seen subtle changes since 1993, particularly after Dr. John D. Graham became OIRA administrator in 2001. During Dr. John D. Graham's tenure as OIRA administrator, changes were made to pursue smarter regulation without headline-grabbing initiatives. OIRA's role as a regulatory gatekeeper has shifted over the years, with criticisms during the Reagan and Clinton administrations for being too involved or not aggressive enough in overseeing agencies' rulemaking actions. During Dr. John D. Graham's tenure, OIRA's relationship with rulemaking agencies became more collegial and constructive. OIRA functioned as a counselor rather than an enforcer, returning to its gatekeeper role during the George W. Bush Administration. The office aimed to protect people from poorly designed rules and combat regulatory tunnel vision, similar to OMB's role in reviewing budget requests. This shift had implications for OIRA's functions. During Dr. John D. Graham's tenure, OIRA's relationship with rulemaking agencies became more collegial and constructive. OIRA functioned as a counselor rather than an enforcer, returning to its gatekeeper role during the George W. Bush Administration. This shift had implications for OIRA's functions, including the use of return letters as a way to make clear the seriousness of the review process. During Dr. John D. Graham's tenure, OIRA returned 21 draft rules to agencies for reconsideration, citing concerns about their analyses. The number of returned rules decreased significantly after the initial period, with only seven returned from March 2002 to January 2008. This decline was attributed to the improved quality of agencies' work. OIRA officials noted a decrease in return letters due to better quality of agencies' submissions. OIRA under Graham became more proactive, sending prompt letters to suggest regulatory topics to agencies publicly. For example, NHTSA was encouraged to prioritize modifying its protection standard, and OSHA to focus on promoting automatic external heart defibrillators. Between September 2001 and December 2003, OIRA sent 13 prompt letters to regulatory agencies, prompting action. However, the number of prompt letters decreased significantly after 2003. Administrator Graham showed a greater interest in well-developed economic analyses for draft rules. OIRA began requiring quantified regulatory benefits and cost-benefit analyses for every regulatory option. In September 2003, OIRA published revised guidelines for economic analysis under the executive order, emphasizing the need for quantified regulatory benefits and cost-benefit analyses for all regulatory options considered by agencies. The new guidelines encouraged agencies to perform both cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses, use multiple discount rates, and conduct formal probability analysis for rules with significant economic impacts. In November 2005, OIRA Administrator Graham highlighted challenges in quantifying benefits for homeland security regulations and suggested a more practical approach for analysis. Questions have been raised about treating homeland security rules differently from other regulations. Concerns about transparency in OIRA's rulemaking process have been ongoing, with Executive Order 12866 aiming to address some of these issues by requiring agencies to disclose information after rule publication. The executive order requires OIRA to disclose changes made to rules during review, maintain a public log of regulatory actions, and disclose oral communications with outside parties. Despite these requirements, concerns about transparency persisted, leading to an extension of disclosure requirements in October 2001. The executive order extended disclosure requirements for OIRA, including disclosing meetings, contacts, and telephone calls with outside parties. OIRA has improved transparency by posting lists of regulations under review and contacts with outside parties. Despite these changes, the effects of OIRA's reviews are not always clear. OIRA's staff allocation decreased from 90 to 47 FTEs by 1997. OIRA's staffing allocation decreased from 90 to 47 FTEs by 1997, a nearly 50% reduction. Despite this decline, OIRA was given new statutory responsibilities under various acts. From 2001 onwards, OIRA's staffing authorization began to increase, reaching 55 FTEs by 2002. Between 2001 and 2003, OIRA hired new staff members in fields like epidemiology, risk assessment, engineering, and health economics. OIRA's staffing allocation decreased significantly from 90 to 47 FTEs by 1997, but new hires in fields like epidemiology, risk assessment, engineering, and health economics were made between 2001 and 2003. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13422 on January 18, 2007, amending Executive Order 12866. The changes made by this new executive order were controversial, with some viewing it as a \"power grab\" by the White House and others as \"a paragon of common sense and good government.\" Key changes included a requirement for agencies to identify specific market failures justifying new regulations. The new executive order issued by President George W. Bush in 2007 introduced several key changes, including the requirement for agencies to identify market failures justifying new regulations, appointing regulatory policy officers within agencies, estimating regulatory costs and benefits, expanding OIRA review to include guidance documents, and allowing agencies to consider formal rulemaking procedures in certain cases. Congressional efforts to block the implementation of the order were noted in a separate CRS report. The changes made by Executive Order 13422 expanded presidential authority over rulemaking agencies. President Obama revoked this order and reassigned roles to the President's chief of staff. Despite this, federal agencies were instructed to continue sending guidance documents for review. President Obama instructed federal agencies to send guidance documents to OIRA for review, leading to recommendations for a new Executive Order on Federal regulatory review. The recommendations included clarifying the relationship between OIRA and agencies, promoting transparency, public participation, cost-benefit analysis, and addressing distributional considerations and future generations' interests. The goal was to ensure regulatory review without undue delay and incorporate behavioral sciences in the process. The Director of OMB requested public comments to improve the regulatory review process due to high public interest. The comment period was extended, and OMB received 183 comments from the public. OMB received 183 comments from the public in response to its request for feedback on regulatory review. Comments varied, with some advocating for a reduced role for OIRA and others pushing for a stronger role. President Obama issued Executive Order 13563 on \"Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review\" on January 18, 2011, which restated principles from previous orders. Executive Order 13563 requires federal agencies to submit a plan for reviewing existing regulations within 120 days to make their regulatory programs more effective. This new requirement builds upon previous orders and was issued by OIRA administrator Cass R. Sunstein on February 2, 2011. On February 2, 2011, OIRA administrator Cass R. Sunstein issued a memorandum to federal agencies detailing aspects of Executive Order 13563, emphasizing retrospective reviews' key elements like public participation, prioritization, and costs and benefits. Independent regulatory agencies were encouraged to consider the provisions of the executive order, especially regarding retrospective analysis. However, OIRA's regulatory review responsibilities remained unchanged, alongside its various duties under Executive Order 12866 and the Paperwork Reduction Act. OIRA, in addition to its regulatory review responsibilities, has specific functions related to rulemaking and regulatory processes. These include collecting written statements from agencies under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and convening advocacy review panels under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA) requires a review panel to include full-time employees from OIRA and other agencies. It also includes provisions known as the \"Congressional Review Act\" which delays major rules and requires a report from GAO. The Data Quality Act directed OMB to issue guidelines for federal agencies. The OMB issued governmentwide guidelines in 2002 to ensure quality and integrity of information disseminated by Federal agencies. Agencies were required to develop their own guidelines and report complaints to OMB. The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act mandates OMB to submit an annual report on the costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork. The OMB issued guidelines in 2002 for federal agencies to ensure information quality. The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act mandates OMB to report on the costs and benefits of federal rules. OIRA solicited public suggestions for rule reforms in 2002 and 2004. OIRA focuses on manufacturing sector regulations and compliance assistance for small businesses. The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act and E-Government Act mandate OMB and OIRA to streamline paperwork requirements and oversee e-government programs. OIRA oversees the governmentwide e-government program and is active in the Administration's e-rulemaking initiative. Congress allocates funding for OIRA in the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, with stipulations on reporting requirements. Congress also limits OIRA's actions through riders on OMB's appropriation. Since 1983, Congress has restricted OMB's use of funds to review agricultural marketing orders issued by the Department of Agriculture, asserting the Department's statutory authority in this area. OIRA has also taken on additional responsibilities based on previous authorities, such as establishing a final bulletin in December 2004. In December 2004, OIRA published a final bulletin providing government-wide guidance on peer review of government science documents, giving agencies more discretion in deciding when peer review is needed. OMB later proposed \"Good Guidance Practices\" in November 2005 to ensure careful consideration of agency guidance documents. The OMB issued a bulletin in 2006 requiring agencies to develop procedures for approval of guidance documents and publish significant documents in the Federal Register for public comment. A proposed bulletin on agency risk assessment practices was criticized by the National Academy of Sciences in 2007, leading OMB to withdraw it and reinforce principles for risk assessment from 1995. OIRA has been central in federal rulemaking for 30 years. While some initially questioned its constitutionality, this view is no longer widely held. The D.C. Circuit in 1981 acknowledged the President's need to monitor agency regulations for consistency with Administration policy. OIRA, located within the Executive Office of the President, plays a crucial role in this process. OIRA, located within the Executive Office of the President, serves as the President's direct representative in the governmentwide rulemaking process. It is described as the \"repository of expertise on regulatory issues\" within the Executive Branch and has the ability to exert significant influence due to its position within OMB and the federal rulemaking process. The variations in how OIRA operates, either as a gatekeeper or counselor, depend on the President's preferences. For example, President Reagan used OIRA's review function to control the policy agenda in an anti-regulatory manner, similar to how President Clinton utilized the office. President Clinton utilized directive authority to achieve pro-regulatory objectives, leading to the \"presidentialization of administration.\" OIRA, while created by Congress, is part of the Executive Office of the President and plays a significant role in the regulatory process. OIRA, part of the Executive Office of the President, holds significant influence in the regulatory process. Despite differing opinions on its role, agencies rarely challenge OIRA's feedback, and regulated entities see it as a final authority. Congress also acknowledges OIRA's impact. Congress recognizes the importance of OIRA in the regulatory process and has considered proposals to enhance its authority and transparency. Legislation has been enacted to expand OIRA's responsibilities, with discussions on providing a statutory basis for its regulatory review function. In the 106th and 107th Congress, proposed legislation aimed to enhance OIRA's authority and transparency by establishing a process for regulatory review and coordination within the Executive Office of the President. Funding for OIRA is part of OMB's budget. OIRA's funding is part of OMB's appropriation, with staffing levels allocated from OMB's totals. Despite some increase in staffing during the Bush Administration, OIRA still has fewer staff than in 1981. Currently, 30 to 40 desk officers and branch chiefs review agency requests and significant rules annually. Some Members of Congress have tried to reduce OIRA's funding, while others argue for increased funding for potential benefits. Proposed legislation has been introduced to designate OIRA staff responsibilities. In the 108th Congress, proposed legislation aimed to allocate OIRA staff to review the Federal information collection burden imposed by the IRS. However, the Bush Administration objected to this directive, leading to its removal before approval by the House of Representatives in May 2004. Some suggest expanding OIRA's duties to include rules from independent regulatory agencies, citing their significant economic impact but lack of quantitative information on costs and benefits. Opponents argue that including these rules would go against the agencies' independence from the President. Some observers are concerned about the lack of transparency in the OIRA review process for independent regulatory agencies' rules. The documentation provided by agencies on changes suggested by OIRA is not always clear or consistent, making it difficult for the public to know the details of the review process. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended improvements to the transparency requirements for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). OIRA's impact on agencies' rules during informal reviews should be disclosed, and the database should differentiate between OIRA- or agency-initiated changes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended changes to improve transparency requirements for OIRA, including clearly indicating rule changes and affiliations in meetings. OIRA's administrator plans to review transparency implementation but does not believe informal review changes need to be disclosed, despite their significant influence. In April 2009, GAO examined changes made during OIRA's reviews and found that only one of the eight recommendations from a 2003 report had been implemented. GAO recommended defining what changes are substantive, instructing agencies to identify OIRA's suggestions, directing agencies to disclose substantive changes, and standardizing how changes are labeled in rulemaking dockets. OMB acknowledged the recommendations in the 112th Congress. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 214 proposed establishing a \"Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis\" to provide information to relevant committees for oversight and jurisdiction matters."
