    "content": "The \"Legislative Oversight of Significant Regulations Act of 2003\" aims to enhance oversight of significant rules by subjecting them to congressional review and approval before taking effect. This Act ensures that Congress has the opportunity to review and approve significant rules in accordance with established procedures. Chapter 8 outlines the Congressional review process for agency rulemaking, including the review of significant rules, approval procedures, existing rules, and definitions. Monetary policy is exempt from this process. Chapter 8 outlines the Congressional review process for agency rulemaking, including the review of significant rules. A significant rule cannot take effect before Congress enacts a joint resolution containing the rule's text. Before a proposed significant rule becomes final, the agency must submit a report to Congress with the rule, a summary, cost-benefit analysis, and statutory interpretation explanation. The agency must provide a report to Congress with a proposed rule, summary, cost-benefit analysis, and statutory interpretation explanation. Congress will then review the report and provide a copy to the chairman and ranking member of each House. Congress shall provide a copy of the report to the chairman and ranking minority party member of each committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter of the report. If Congress fails to enact a joint resolution approving a proposed significant rule, no court or agency may infer any intent of Congress from any action or inaction with regard to such rule or related statute. The majority leader of each House of Congress must introduce a joint resolution containing the text of any proposed significant rule within 3 legislative days of the agency submitting the report. If not introduced, any Member of that House may introduce the joint resolution. The joint resolution introduced by any Member of the House shall be referred to the appropriate committee for consideration. The committee may report the resolution with or without recommendation, or choose not to report it. If reported, it must be done within 45 legislative days. Failure to report the resolution within this period will result in automatic discharge from consideration. The joint resolution must be considered and placed on the calendar. A vote on final passage must occur within 90 legislative days. Motion to proceed is privileged and not debatable in the House. Debate is limited to 4 hours with equal time for both sides. No amendments or reconsideration allowed. The joint resolution under this section shall be considered and placed on the calendar. Appeals on Rules of the House decisions shall be decided without debate. Senate motion to proceed is privileged and not debatable, with no amendments allowed. Debate in the Senate on a joint resolution under this section is limited to 10 hours, divided between the majority and minority leaders. Debates on motions or appeals are limited to 1 hour, divided between the mover and the manager of the resolution. Control of time may vary based on positions held. The Senate can allot additional time to Senators during the consideration of a joint resolution. Limiting debate on a joint resolution is not debatable, and no amendments are allowed in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other House, debate is limited to 10 hours. The joint resolution process in Congress involves both Houses following the same procedure and voting on the resolution from the other House. This section is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House, applicable only in the case of a joint resolution and superseding other rules if inconsistent. Sec. 803 allows for the revision or revocation of existing rules in Congress if a petition for review is filed, with the majority leader required to introduce a joint resolution within 3 legislative days if the petition meets the requirements. Sec. 803 allows for the revision or revocation of existing rules in Congress through a petition for review. A joint resolution must be introduced within 3 legislative days if the petition meets the requirements, or any Member of the House may introduce it. The joint resolution will be considered in both the House of Representatives and the Senate following specific procedures. The petition for review must include the affected rule and its contents if revised or revoked, along with the required signatures from Senators or Representatives. Sec. 804 defines key terms for this chapter, including 'agency' and 'rule.' The term 'rule' excludes specific types of rules, such as those related to future rates, corporate structures, and accounting practices. The term 'final rule' refers to any final or interim rule. A 'significant rule' is a rule proposed by an agency specified as such in the authorizing Act. Monetary policy rules by the Federal Reserve are exempt from this chapter. The amendment made by this Act will be effective 90 days after enactment. The previous chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, will still apply to rules submitted to Congress as if the amendment had not been enacted."
