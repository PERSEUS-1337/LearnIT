    "content": "Several western states are facing severe to exceptional drought conditions, with California experiencing its third consecutive dry year. Despite recent rains, reservoir levels are abnormally low, and groundwater levels are also affected. Congressional interest in drought and its impact on water supplies, agriculture, and ecosystems has led to the introduction of several bills in the 113th Congress. One of these bills, S. 2198, the \"Emergency Drought Relief Act,\" was introduced on April 2, 2014, and may proceed quickly to the Senate floor under an expedited rule. S. 2198, a revision of the \"California Emergency Drought Relief Act,\" aims to address emergency drought impacts in California and other states by increasing water supplies, expanding program funding for drought mitigation, streamlining environmental reviews, and providing drought planning assistance. Certain provisions remain focused on California water project development. S. 2198, titled \"Emergency Drought Relief,\" addresses California and other states' drought impacts by increasing water supplies, streamlining environmental reviews, and providing drought planning assistance. It also expands federal emergency disaster assistance and reauthorizes water resource management programs. S. 2198, titled \"Emergency Drought Relief,\" broadens assistance available under the Stafford Act for drought emergencies, focusing on drought-related aid for states like California. It aims to maximize water supplies, streamline environmental reviews, and address long-standing issues with the Central Valley Project. Title I of S. 2198 focuses on emergency drought relief, specifically addressing California water supply management and implementing changes to water resource and quality programs for the federal Central Valley Project and State Water Project. Title I of S. 2198 addresses emergency drought relief in California, including funding for water supply projects in Colorado River Storage Project reservoirs and federal drought planning assistance for Reclamation project contractors. It also reauthorizes funding for CALFED activities and the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act. The bill aims to increase funding for water supply projects in Colorado River Storage Project reservoirs, reauthorize funding for CALFED activities and the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act, and expand the Secure Water Act to include Hawaii. It focuses on maximizing water supplies for agricultural and municipal/industrial demand during emergency drought declarations. The bill aims to provide maximum water supplies to various contractors in California by approving projects and operations that increase water availability efficiently and quickly, especially during emergency conditions. This broad authority allows for the approval of any project that enhances water supplies, unless it is highly inefficient or violates applicable laws. The bill aims to provide flexibility for federal participation in state-driven projects to address drought in California, allowing for the approval of projects that increase water supplies efficiently. This includes small conservation projects to large-scale expansions of storage facilities. The intent is to increase water supplies during periods of increased precipitation and address drought issues. The bill aims to provide flexibility for federal participation in state-driven projects to address drought in California by approving projects that increase water supplies efficiently. Implementation of Section 103(a) raises questions on how agencies can provide maximum water supplies while complying with laws and regulations, which could lead to disagreements between agencies and water users. Some believe agencies are already maximizing water supplies to the detriment of species, while others advocate for relaxing laws and regulations. The lack of specificity in S. 2198 raises questions about the definition of \"additional water supplies\" and the scope of projects authorized under this section. Projects must be consistent with applicable laws and not highly inefficient, but the term \"highly inefficient\" is not defined. Compliance with state and federal endangered species laws is required for projects and operational changes. The provision in S. 2198 requires projects to comply with state and federal endangered species laws, NEPA, CEQA, and water quality laws. The interpretation of \"consistent with the law\" versus other phrases like \"pursuant to\" or \"in compliance with\" is questioned. The authority granted in this section is limited by the duration of the drought emergency declaration. The provision in S. 2198 allows for projects to be implemented quickly under the state drought emergency declaration, but it is unclear if they would have permanent authorization or funding after the emergency funding expires. This provision could streamline permit processes or feasibility studies, potentially reducing the time for projects to become operational. However, the long-term impact on species and the environment is uncertain. Section 103(b) of S. 2198 directs specific project-related actions in California, including limitations on water deliveries due to endangered species and water quality regulations. These limitations are controversial and lead to management disputes among various stakeholders. Section 103(b) of S. 2198 directs specific project-related actions in California to maximize water supplies for users, address species viability, and water quality. This includes modifying water conveyance infrastructure, adjusting water flows, meeting NEPA and ESA requirements, addressing water transfers, and implementing projects to offset any effects on species viability. Scientific tools are used to assess changes in water conveyance and flow operations for additional water supplies. The actions specified in Section 103(b) of S. 2198 aim to maximize water supplies in California while complying with laws and regulations. These actions will be in effect until the state of drought emergency declaration is suspended. Questions arise regarding the difference between these actions and existing ones, and whether agencies have the flexibility to do more under current laws. Some may argue that agency actions under Section 103(b) of S. 2198 aim to prioritize maximizing water supplies, potentially conflicting with existing laws. Agencies must balance new directives with current regulations, making it challenging to predict the impact on projects and operations. Concerns are raised about the potential unintended consequences on species in the Bay-Delta region. The section also includes monitoring actions' effects on species and recommending regulatory changes. Section 103 of the bill directs federal agencies to use expedited procedures to make final decisions related to federal projects providing additional water or addressing emergency drought conditions in California. This applies to all agencies involved in approving projects under Sections 103(a) and 103(b), potentially impacting the Corps of Engineers and other agencies with permitting roles. The focus is on short-term effects like species entrainment at project pumps, raising concerns about long-term impacts on species in the Bay-Delta region. The bill directs federal agencies to use expedited procedures for making final decisions on projects providing water or addressing drought conditions in California. The Secretary of the Interior must convene a meeting with relevant agency heads to decide on project approval within seven days of a request for resolution. The final decision must be issued within 10 days after the meeting. The Secretary is authorized to convene a final project decision meeting at any time, regardless of whether a request for resolution is requested by the state. The provisions aim to expedite the federal agency process for deciding project approval, ensuring consistency with current laws and regulations. This subsection applies to a broad set of projects and operations requested for final approval by the state or agency heads, potentially superseding regular processes under various laws. The provision in S. 2198 may supersede regular processes for final project decisions under laws like NEPA and ESA, but it is unclear how this would be implemented. The short timeframe for project approval raises questions about how decisions will be made, as the bill does not provide a specific process for approval. Final decisions would be subject to meetings convened by the Secretary instead of traditional agency processes. The provision in S. 2198 raises questions about how final project decisions would be made within a 10-day timeframe. Section 104 authorizes funds for financial assistance under various acts to assist drought-affected areas in the West, potentially limiting eligibility to the 17 Reclamation states. Section 104 expands financial assistance eligibility to organizations engaged in collaborative processes for environmental restoration, water rights settlements, and restoration settlements. It identifies eligible projects such as water diversion, pumping, conservation, irrigation, and dust management for public health purposes. Funding under Section 104 can be used to increase available water supplies and mitigate drought impacts. Section 103 allows funding from Section 104 to be used for Central Valley Project refuge water supply needs. Section 114 sets a deadline for the authority under Section 104. Section 105 introduces emergency environmental review provisions that impact federal drought projects in California. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before making decisions on federal actions. Section 105 of the bill directs agencies to consult with the Council on Environmental Quality to develop alternative arrangements for compliance with NEPA during emergencies such as drought or natural disasters. It is unclear which projects would require review under these alternative arrangements. There is uncertainty regarding whether projects mandated in Section 103(b) would need NEPA review. Courts have ruled that if a law leaves no agency discretion, NEPA may not apply. The specificity of some Section 103(b) mandates could lead to a court deciding that NEPA review is not necessary. The agency may not need NEPA review for projects mandated in Section 103(b), but compliance with other federal and state environmental laws is still required. The burden of demonstrating consistency with these laws, such as the ESA or water quality laws, falls on the agency. S. 2198 directs the EPA Administrator to prioritize water supply projects in California under the SRF programs, without adding new funding or project eligibility. The state's priorities for awarding assistance among SRF-eligible projects in California include water recycling, conservation, source water, and storage projects. The SRF programs have established procedures for project identification and prioritization, with annual Intended Use Plans open to public participation. It is unclear how quickly funds could be provided under S. 2198, which aims to expedite assistance for projects awarded under Section 106. The bill aims to expedite review of Buy American waiver requests and authorize 40-year loan repayments to State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for projects awarded under Section 106. Loan repayment terms may be extended to 30 years for economically disadvantaged communities or states with drought or agricultural disasters declared by the Secretary of Agriculture. The legislation also ensures that existing state-by-state funding allocations and criteria for SRF programs are not modified, except for California or states with drought or disaster declarations. The bill includes provisions for expedited review of Buy American waiver requests and authorizes 40-year loan repayments to State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for projects awarded under Section 106. Loan repayment terms may be extended to 30 years for economically disadvantaged communities or states with drought or agricultural disasters declared by the Secretary of Agriculture. Additionally, the legislation extends the authorization of appropriations for the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act through FY2019 and reauthorizes the CALFED Bay-Delta Act through 2018. The bill extends the authorization of appropriations for the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act through FY2019, increasing the total authorized amount to $190 million. It also expands eligibility for water and energy efficiency grants, allowing the Commissioner of Reclamation to waive nonfederal cost-share requirements in emergency situations. Section 111 of the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize pilot projects in the Colorado River Basin to increase water supply in Lake Mead and other reservoirs. Funding for these projects would come from grants to public entities using Colorado River Basin water for municipal purposes. The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize pilot projects in the Colorado River Basin to increase water supply in Lake Mead and other reservoirs. Funding for these projects would come from grants to public entities using Colorado River Basin water for municipal purposes or implementing water conservation agreements. The provision does not allow the use of Upper Colorado River Basin Fund moneys for these projects. The Secretary is directed to provide Colorado River Basin grants promptly, unlike other laws that authorize funding for various projects without a specific directive. The funding source for these projects is not specified, but it cannot come from the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund. Section 112 of S. 2198 clarifies that the bill would not override any existing California state laws, including water rights protections. Section 113 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct ecosystem restoration and water conservation activities in the Klamath Basin watershed, aiming to decrease water demand and increase resilience of fish species affected by drought. These activities align with the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement. The Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) is a controversial water rights settlement that has not been authorized by Congress yet. Section 113 of S. 2198 allows for programs to purchase and retire water rights, restore fish habitat, and reintroduce fish populations. The authority under Sections 104, 105, and 106 expires when the drought emergency declaration is withdrawn or when the national disaster declaration for drought is suspended. Title II of S. 2198 would amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. S. 2198 would amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to include disaster unemployment assistance, emergency nutrition assistance, and crisis counseling under emergency declarations. This provision applies broadly and is not limited to drought declarations. If a drought overwhelms state or local resources, the President can declare a state of emergency under the Stafford Act. Since the 1980s, requests for Stafford Act drought-related declarations have been denied, leading to uncertainty about when such declarations will be made. The Secretary of Agriculture is typically responsible for declaring eligibility for federal agricultural disaster assistance, triggering various aid programs. The Farm Services Agency (FSA) programs may trigger availability of federal programs like Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the Small Business Administration. FEMA defers to USDA for drought events, not covered by Stafford Act. Governors can request emergency declarations for immediate assistance. Title II of S. 2198 expands the programs available under an emergency declaration to include disaster unemployment assistance, emergency nutrition assistance, and crisis counseling assistance. These programs offer targeted assistance for unique problems caused by a disaster event. The DUA program provides targeted assistance for unique problems caused by a disaster event. For example, during a winter freeze in 2007, DUA was provided to farmworkers unemployed by the weather event. Proposed changes to emergency declarations could allow the President to offer similar assistance without meeting the criteria for a disaster declaration."
