    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that conveying the Properties to Lessees for fair market value would reduce project debt, provide funding for public recreation projects, decrease federal payments, increase local tax revenues, and resolve disputes while ensuring fair value for the acquisition. The Act aims to convey certain Properties around Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana, to Lessees for fair market value. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nCFRA - Canyon Ferry Recreation Association, Incorporated\nLessee - Leaseholder of a property described in section 4(b)\nProperty - One of the properties described in section 4(b)\nPurchaser - Person or entity buying the 265 leaseholds under section 4\nReservoir - Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana\nSecretary - Secretary of the Interior\n\nSEC. 4. SALE OF LEASEHOLDS. The Secretary is authorized to sell all leaseholds at fair market value, including easements for vehicular access, dock usage, and other improvements. The leaseholds to be conveyed consist of 265 cabin sites. The Secretary is authorized to sell 265 cabin sites of the Bureau of Reclamation located along the northern portion of the Reservoir, plus any small parcels contiguous to the leaseholds determined by the Secretary. The acreage and legal description of each property will be agreed upon by the Secretary and CFRA. The purchase process will be overseen by the Secretary. The Secretary is authorized to sell 265 cabin sites of the Bureau of Reclamation along the Reservoir's northern portion. The purchase process involves soliciting sealed bids, setting a minimum bid based on fair market value, and selling to the highest bidder for all leaseholds. The highest bidder, if not CFRA, can be matched by CFRA to purchase leaseholds at the same price. Purchasers must offer leaseholders an option to buy at fair market value or continue leasing. Non-purchasing lessees can lease at fair market value rent. The Purchaser must offer leaseholders the option to buy at fair market value or continue leasing. If a Lessee declines to purchase, the Purchaser must compensate the Lessee for the full market value of improvements made to the leasehold. The Purchaser must honor existing property descriptions and historical use restrictions for leaseholds. Lessees who do not purchase a leasehold can continue leasing under the terms of the existing lease. Rental payments during the lease continuation must be paid to the Purchaser. Lessees are limited in their ability to transfer the lease without valid existing rights. The Secretary will incur administrative costs for the conveyance, to be reimbursed by the Purchaser or CFRA. The conveyance should be completed within 1 year of the Act's enactment, with staggered real estate closings if needed. Lessees can request conveyance documents in their name if purchasing the leasehold from the Purchaser or CFRA. The Lessee should have conveyance documents prepared in their name to expedite leasehold closings. Lessees are responsible for reimbursing CFRA for costs incurred in completing transactions."
