    "content": "The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) is used to determine annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS) to control spending on physicians' services. Initially, expenditures stayed within targets, but in 2002, actual spending exceeded limits, leading to significant cuts under the formula. The Medicare fee schedule, based on the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, has seen yearly cuts overridden by Congress, except in 2002. Payments for Part B services are determined by a fee schedule listing over 7,000 tasks. The RB-RVS fee schedule was introduced in 1992, replacing the previous payment method. The RB-RVS-based Medicare fee schedule, implemented in 1992, assigns relative value units (RVUs) reflecting physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice costs. Medicare pays providers based on these values multiplied by a conversion factor. Expenditure targets influence physician payment updates, with different conversion factors used for surgical and non-surgical services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 replaced the Medicare Volume Performance Standard with the Sustainable Growth Rate method to control Part B expenditures. It introduced consequences for failing to meet expenditure targets and compared actual program expenditures to growth targets for annual updates. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, incorporated the rate of growth in GDP per capita into the calculation to control Medicare physician expenditures. It aimed to prevent Medicare physician spending from consuming an increasing share of national income by setting expenditure targets tied to GDP growth. The SGR system served as a restraint on aggregate spending, providing a sustainable trajectory for cumulative spending on Medicare physician services. The Medicare physician fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting expenditure targets set by the Sustainable Growth Rate system. The annual update to the conversion factor calculation determines reimbursement changes, aiming to align spending with targets. The Medicare conversion factor converts RVUs into dollar payment amounts, with adjustments based on the MEI. The factor calculation for Medicare physician fee schedule updates is based on the MEI, SGR, and UAF. The MEI measures price changes in inputs for physician services, with a projected 0.6% increase in 2013. The SGR determines cumulative and allowed expenditures, including changes in physician fees, fee-for-service beneficiaries, real GDP per capita, and laws. The SGR formula for Medicare physician fee schedule updates is tied to changes in fee-for-service beneficiaries and managed care enrollment. Prior to 2003, it also included economic growth as a component. Per capita GDP outpaced Part B expenditures from 1997 to 2000, but Part B expenditures started to rise in 1999 and 2000 as economic growth slowed. The SGR system for Medicare physician fee schedule updates was affected by changes in economic growth and Part B expenditures. The Medicare Modernization Act changed the measure to a 10-year moving average real GDP per capita growth rate to reduce volatility. A technical adjustment in CY2010 excluded physician-administered drugs from the calculation of expenditures subject to the SGR. CMS changed the measurement of physician services in CY2010 to exclude physician-administered drugs from the calculation of allowed and actual expenditures under the SGR. This adjustment aims to reduce the difference between actual and targeted spending, as spending on physician-administered drugs has historically grown faster than physician services. The update adjustment sets the conversion factor to align projected spending with allowed spending. The adjustment factor for projected spending aims to align with allowed spending by the end of the year. It consists of the prior year adjustment component and the cumulative adjustment component, with limits set by the Social Security Act. Despite potential larger reductions, the adjustment factor has been capped at minus 7% for several years. The gap between actual and allowed spending widens each year, especially when Congress overrides reductions. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system grows larger each year and is exacerbated when Congress overrides reductions. Actual expenditures exceeding target expenditures would result in increased payments for services under the fee schedule. Cumulative actual expenditures exceeded target expenditures for the first time in 2005 due to physician-administered drugs. Expenditures exceeded target for the first time in 2005 when physician-administered drugs were excluded. Updates to physician fee schedule were close to MEI in early years but exceeded it in later years. Discrepancy between actual and targeted expenditures has grown each year since 2002. Excluding physician-administered drugs reduced the difference between actual and targeted expenditures. The discrepancy between actual and targeted expenditures has been growing since 2002. Legislation has been passed to override cuts in physician fee schedules due to exceeding targets. Recent acts have prevented a projected reduction in the conversion factor. Congress will need to address the situation again before March 2015. Congress has overridden payment reductions and increased Medicare physician payments through various laws, including altering the geographic adjustment factor for physician work. The floor on the work geographic adjustment index has been extended multiple times, most recently through the Pathway for SGR Reform Act. Some bills have also modified the cap on the conversion factor, leading to the current situation. The SGR system has faced overrides of payment reductions and increases in Medicare physician payments through various laws. There is a consensus that the SGR system is flawed and causing instability in the Medicare program for providers and beneficiaries. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, designed to control Medicare physician service growth, has led to rapid growth in services provided to beneficiaries. Spending per beneficiary has outpaced updates to the fee schedule, requiring frequent Congressional interventions. Critics argue that the SGR treats all services and physicians equally, penalizing some unfairly. There is no direct link between individual behavior and payment updates, leading to concerns about the system's fairness. The SGR system controls Medicare physician service growth but has led to increased services provided to beneficiaries. Concerns arise from the lack of a direct link between individual behavior and payment updates, potentially penalizing some unfairly. There is a worry that declining physician payment rates, especially in primary care specialties, could impact access to services. The survey found that Medicare beneficiaries and privately insured individuals have difficulty finding new primary care physicians compared to specialists. Primary care physicians are less likely to accept new patients. The SGR system is a key issue, with proposed modifications but no consensus on a long-term solution. Any permanent change would be costly, impacting federal outlays and beneficiary premiums. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 required a study on the sustainable growth rate formula for Part B beneficiary premiums. Proposed modifications include changing the formula or linking updates to payment adequacy and quality measures. GAO categorized alternative options into two themes: ending spending targets for stable fee updates or modifying the current SGR system to address shortcomings. The GAO discussed two approaches to modifying the sustainable growth rate formula for Medicare. One approach focuses on stable fee updates, while the other adjusts fees based on spending growth deviations. The choice between the two approaches depends on whether stable fee increases or fiscal discipline is prioritized. The second approach eliminates targets for spending growth moderation and bases updates on cost increases, with a focus on high volume service categories like medical imaging. Several legislative proposals have been introduced to change the SGR calculation method, with the key difference being the number of targets used. The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007 introduced six expenditure targets to address criticisms of the current update calculation penalizing all physicians equally. Some physicians can increase volume to offset declining reimbursement rates, while others cannot. Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of having too many expenditure targets. Some critics argue that having too many expenditure targets may not be suitable as they do not differentiate between the appropriateness of certain services. For instance, an increase in imaging services could lead to earlier detection of diseases like cancer, potentially saving costs in other specialties. The Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act of 2009 proposed two expenditure categories: evaluation, management, and preventive services, and all other services, aiming to improve access to primary care providers. The proposed changes to the SGR could increase overall physician expenditures allowed in the baseline, impacting various parts of the Medicare program, TRICARE, and Medicare Part B beneficiaries. This could also lead to an increase in physician reimbursements and Medicare Advantage program expenditures. The bill would raise Medicare benchmarks, impacting capitation payments for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and TRICARE physician reimbursements. Changes in physician reimbursements could lead to higher Medicare Part B premiums. MedPAC recommended alternatives to replace the SGR system in a 2007 report. In a report, MedPAC outlined two paths to address the SGR issue: one focusing on improving incentives for providers and the other adding expenditure targets. Recommendations included updating physician payments based on input prices and productivity adjustments. MedPAC has sent specific suggestions to Congress regarding the SGR and Medicare payments. MedPAC recommended freezing Medicare physician fee schedule rates for primary care services for 10 years, reducing non-primary care reimbursements by 5.9% annually for three years, then freezing them for 7 more years, and offsetting costs through other Medicare program modifications. The MedPAC proposal suggests freezing Medicare physician fee schedule rates for primary care services for 10 years, with eligibility criteria similar to the ACA primary care bonus. Providers must specialize in primary care and furnish 60% of their services in primary care codes. This freeze applies only to specific service codes. MedPAC proposes freezing reimbursement rates for certain services, with some facing rate reductions. Despite these changes, total Medicare expenditures per beneficiary for fee schedule services are expected to increase over the next decade. MedPAC has recommended collecting data for payment accuracy, identifying overpriced services, and promoting alternative payment models. The key question is what payment system should replace the SGR system to drive improvements. The best payment system to replace the SGR system for Medicare should focus on improving quality, efficiency, and care coordination, especially for chronic conditions. MedPAC recommends exploring Medicare ACOs and bundled payments. The ACA includes demonstrations for alternative payment models like the CMS Innovation Center and the PCORI. These aim to change how physicians deliver care, with programs like the National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling and the Medicare-shared savings program. The PCORI, in conjunction with alternative payment models like ACOs, could provide new insights on treatment outcomes and payment methods for providers. The Innovation Center has the flexibility to implement new payment alternatives that meet quality and cost criteria. While these initiatives have the potential to impact physician behavior and payments, concrete findings or recommendations for fundamental changes in Medicare physician payments are still pending. Repealing or fixing the SGR may have budgetary implications, as per recent CBO analysis. The cost estimates for fixing the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) issue vary, with a one-year fix estimated at $11.1 billion in FY2013 and $18.5 billion over 10 years. Longer-term fixes could be more expensive, with freezing payments for 10 years costing approximately $273.3 billion and increasing payments by the MEI each year through 2022 adding about $362 billion in federal spending. Coupling these options with a provision to exclude changes from beneficiary premium calculations would further increase federal spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on February 5, 2013, stating that the cost of overriding the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) with a 10-year freeze in payments had decreased by over $100 billion compared to previous estimates. Holding payment rates through 2023 at current levels would raise Medicare outlays by $14 billion in 2014 and $138 billion between 2014 and 2023. This reduced cost is attributed to lower spending for physicians' services in recent years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that actual spending has been lower than projected, leading to an estimated increase in payment rates starting in 2015. The cost of a 10-year freeze in Medicare physician fee schedule payments was estimated at $124 billion in April 2014, down from previous estimates. The CBO reported lower spending than projected, leading to increased payment rates starting in 2015. Congressional actions have overridden the SGR update in previous years, including a 10-year freeze in Medicare physician fee schedule payments. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act extended the SGR payment reduction override through December 2012, maintaining Medicare physician fee schedule payments. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 averted the SGR reduction and kept fee schedule payments at current rates through December 2013. The Energy and Commerce Committee, Senate Finance Committee, and Ways and Means Committee passed bills in 2013 to repeal the SGR system and provide payment stability for Medicare physician fee schedule payments. The bills aim to increase payments by 0.5% each year from 2014 to 2018 or freeze payments for 10 years. The Senate Finance Committee bill would freeze Medicare physician fee schedule payments for 10 years from 2014 to 2023, while the Ways and Means bill would increase payments by 0.5% in 2015 and 2016. Both bills establish new payment systems and create incentives for physicians to transition to these systems over time. The bills also include various non-SGR provisions, with S. 1871 including health care program extenders and H.R. 2810 including provisions related to medical malpractice claims. No budgetary offsets are included in these bills. The CBO scores for three bills on Medicare physician fee schedule payments show varying costs, with the Senate bill adding $111.5 billion and H.R. 2810 adding $121 billion. H.J.Res. 59, signed into law on December 26, 2013, included the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013, which provided for a 0.5% increase in MPFS payments for three months. On February 6, 2014, H.R. 4015 and S. 2000 were introduced in the House and Senate, proposing a 0.5% increase in MPFS payments for three months. The bills suggest five years of payment increases before freezing payments at that level for an additional five years. Changes in payment levels would be based on factors like participation in alternative payment models and provider performance in the new Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). The House passed H.R. 4015 with an amendment to delay the individual mandate penalty under the ACA for five years, reducing direct federal spending by $31.1 billion over 11 years. The CBO scored the bill as adding $138.4 billion to direct spending from 2014 to 2024. The SGR repeal and replace provisions under P.L. 113-82 created a new fund for Sustainable Growth Rate Reform, funded by the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA, P.L. 113-93) provided a 12-month override of the SGR-directed payment reduction. The PAMA, signed into law, delayed payment reductions and maintained fee schedule reimbursements at 2009 levels until March 31, 2015. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 delayed the update to the conversion factor and reduced funds in the Medicare Improvement Fund. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-139) provides exceptions to the PAYGO rules for addressing the Medicare physician payment situation under the SGR system. The maximum exception amount is based on the difference between estimated net outlays if 2009 Medicare fee schedule payment rates were in effect for five years and payments under the SGR system. Future legislation changing the SGR system would only be scored for PAYGO purposes if it costs more than a five-year freeze at 2009 levels. The Temporary Extension Act of 2010 extended various expiring programs, including Medicare physician payment cuts, unemployment insurance benefits, and premium assistance for COBRA benefits. The provision exempts a five-year freeze of Medicare reimbursement at 2009 levels from PAYGO, estimated at $88.5 billion. Congress would need to pass legislation to override the cuts directed by the SGR system. The Temporary Extension Act of 2010 delayed Medicare physician payment cuts and extended various expiring programs. It also exempted a five-year freeze of Medicare reimbursement at 2009 levels from PAYGO, estimated at $88.5 billion. The bill eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 78-19 and was signed into law on March 2, 2010. The Continuing Extension Act of 2010 aimed to prevent deficit increases from spending and revenue legislation, with exceptions for changes to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system. No bills satisfying the act's conditions were passed into law. The Extension Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-157) was passed by the House on March 17, 2010, and signed into law on April 15, 2010. It extended unemployment insurance, COBRA benefits, Medicare therapy caps exceptions, and delayed physician payment reductions until June 1, 2010. The Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 3962 on June 18, 2010, to avert payment reductions for Medicare beneficiaries. The conversion factor was increased by 2.2% retroactively from June 1, 2010, to November 30, 2010, adding $6.3 billion to direct spending. This cost was offset by imposing a three-day prohibition on hospital claims adjustments and pension fund obligation modifications. The House passed a bill allowing firms to spread out pension fund obligations, resulting in fewer tax-preferred contributions. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 111-192), increasing Medicare physician fee schedule payments by 2.2% for six months. The Senate later passed H.R. 5712 to extend the increase for an additional month. The House passed a bill (P.L. 111-192) increasing Medicare physician fee schedule payments by 2.2% for six months. The bill was later amended to extend the increase for an additional month through December 31, 2010. The cost of the override was offset by reductions to payments to providers for multiple therapy procedures on the same day. The Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-309) extended many Medicare provisions set to expire on December 31, 2010, and made other changes to the programs. The Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 extended Medicare provisions and made changes to the programs. It included a one-year override of payment reductions under the SGR system, with a 0% update adjustment factor in 2011. The legislation stated that the conversion factor for 2012 and subsequent years would be computed as if the override had never applied. In 2012, a 27.4% reduction was estimated without further legislative action. The Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 provided a two-month override through February 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended physician fee schedule payments through December 31, 2012, maintaining current levels. Without the override, payments would have been reduced by 27% starting January 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed on January 2, 2013, further addressed tax issues. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended physician fee schedule payments through December 31, 2012, maintaining current levels. The Act was passed by the Senate on January 1, 2013, and by the House later that day. Title VI of the act extends expiring provisions in Medicare and Medicaid programs, including overriding a 26.5% reduction in Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payments. Summary Division B of H.J.Res. 59 increased MPFS payments by 0.5% from January 1 through March 31, 2014, averting a 20.1% reduction. The CBO score for the 3-month override was $7.1 billion over 5 years and $7.3 billion over 10 years. S. 25 was signed into law on February 15, 2014, ensuring reduced cost-of-living adjustments for retired members of the Armed Forces. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 exempts certain members of the Armed Forces from age-related requirements. It establishes a Transitional Fund for Sustainable Growth Rate Reform and allocates $2.3 billion from the Part B Trust Fund for physician services. The SGR repeal bills in Congress have not been considered yet. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA, P.L. 113-93) was signed into law on April 1, 2014, maintaining Medicare physician fee schedule payments at the existing level for an additional 12 months. It also contains health program extenders and overrides the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) for a full year until March 31, 2015. A nine-month patch was proposed to address reduced Medicare physician payments in 2015, preserving the advantage of existing SGR repeal bills. A full-year override extends the expiration until March 2015, requiring new bills in the 114th Congress. Congress may still pass an SGR repeal bill in the 113th Congress, but the pressure is reduced with the PAMA extending the current override."
