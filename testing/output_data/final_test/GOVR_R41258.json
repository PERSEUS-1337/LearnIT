    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for Department of the Interior agencies, the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, arts and cultural agencies, and numerous other entities. The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill funds various entities and agencies, including the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, Indian Health Service, and Environmental Protection Agency. Congress debates funding and policy issues such as energy development, wildland fire fighting, Indian trust fund management, climate change, DOI science programs, and more. The DOE programs were transferred to House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water, consolidating jurisdiction over DOE. EPA and smaller entities were moved to House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees covering Interior and Related Agencies. This change resulted from the abolition of the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. Appropriations laws for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies have contained three primary titles since FY2006. The report discusses major agencies and cross-cutting issues funded in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Key funding changes and policy issues of interest to Congress are highlighted, although not all complexities are covered due to the extensive nature of appropriations laws. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations laws, funding sources, and key policy staff contacts for additional information. It highlights the term appropriations and sources of funding figures used in the report. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of funding information. The FY2011 appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $29.67 billion, a reduction of $2.65 billion (8%) from the FY2010 level. The FY2011 funding was included in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. The enacted level was $2.76 billion (8%) lower than the Obama Administration's request. The FY2011 appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $29.67 billion, a reduction of $2.65 billion (8%) from the FY2010 level. The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act provided funding for accounts in the bill through the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2011), with many accounts funded at less than the FY2010 account level. The FY2011 law continued provisions from FY2010, with agencies required to submit spending plans below the account level. Hearings were held, but no appropriations bill was enacted before the fiscal year started on October 1, 2011. The FY2011 appropriations law for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was enacted before the fiscal year started on October 1, 2010. A series of interim continuing appropriations laws provided funding at FY2010 levels with exceptions, such as increased funding for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) under P.L. 111-322. The law authorized reorganization actions for BOEMRE. P.L. 111-322 altered funding distribution for geothermal leasing on federal lands, directing 25% to counties. P.L. 112-4 eliminated funding for the Smithsonian's Legacy Fund, while P.L. 112-6 made reductions to various agencies in FY2011 compared to FY2010 levels. On February 19, 2011, the House passed H.R. 1, a full-year continuing appropriations bill for FY2011. However, the Senate defeated the bill on March 9, 2011. A different full-year appropriations measure, H.R. 1473, was passed by both the House and Senate on April 14, 2011, and signed into law on April 15, 2011 as P.L. 112-10. References to the House-passed bill are to H.R. 1 and to the Senate amendment as Senate Amendment 149 to H.R. 1. Senate Amendment 149 to H.R. 1 refers to the FY2011 law, P.L. 112-10, and the FY2010 law, P.L. 111-88. Table 1 shows funding levels for agencies under the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY2010, FY2011, and the enacted amounts. The FY2011 enacted amounts do not include the 0.2% rescission. The report addresses funding at different stages of action but does not cover appropriations below the account level. Agencies were required to submit within 30 days of enactment. The FY2011 law required agencies to submit spending plans to the Appropriations Committees within 30 days of enactment. Funding for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies increased by $2.35 billion in current dollars but decreased by $1.83 billion in constant dollars compared to FY2004. The Bureau of Land Management manages diverse uses on public land. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages conflicting land uses such as energy development, grazing, recreation, and preservation on federal land. In FY2011, BLM received $1.12 billion in funding, which was slightly less than the previous year. The agency also oversees mineral operations on Indian Trust lands. Funding details were not specified below the account level, but BLM was directed to submit spending plans to Congress. The FY2011 budget for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was $952.7 million, a $5.9 million reduction from the previous year. The Administration sought changes in funding for various programs, including increased funding for wild horse and burro management and reduced funding for energy and minerals. The FY2011 budget for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) included reduced funding for energy and minerals, the Alaska conveyance program, and resource management planning, as well as the elimination of funding for the Challenge Cost Share program. Anticipated fee collections for mining law administration were expected to exceed program costs, reducing the need for discretionary appropriations. Additionally, the law provided for offsetting fees for oil and gas development, with an appropriation of $45.5 million for processing permits to drill. The FY2011 law included provisions for processing permits to drill oil and gas wells, with fees of $6,500 per application. It also prohibited funds for the slaughter of wild horses and burros under BLM management. The Administration sought $75.7 million for wild horse and burro management, an increase from the FY2010 level of $64.0 million. The FY2011 law included provisions for processing permits to drill oil and gas wells, with fees of $6,500 per application. It also prohibited funds for the slaughter of wild horses and burros under BLM management. Construction appropriations for FY2011 were $4.6 million, the lowest level in at least a decade. The FY2011 law allocated $22.0 million for land acquisition by the BLM, a reduction from previous years. The Administration had requested $83.7 million for land acquisition, including funds for a new wild horse preserve. Funding for BLM acquisitions had fluctuated over the years, from $49.9 million in FY2002 to $8.9 million in FY2008. Acquisitions funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) decreased from $49.9 million in FY2002 to $8.9 million in FY2008, before rising to $29.7 million in FY2010. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated $1.51 billion for FWS, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2011 request for the Fish and Wildlife Service was $1.64 billion, $238.9 million more than the House-passed level and $90.7 million less than the Senate amendment. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is the Resource Management account, which includes various programs. The FY2011 appropriation law provided $1.25 billion, down $22.1 million from the previous year. Wolves in the Northern Rockies were removed from the protections of the Endangered Species Act. The gray wolves in the Northern Rockies were delisted as the 49th species, the only one delisted through legislative action. The delisting rule excluded wolves in Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Utah from ESA protections. Wyoming's wolf population remained protected due to concerns about their management plan. A federal court overturned the delisting rule in August 2010, and FWS was ordered to reconsider Wyoming's management plan in December 2010. Section 1713 mandated FWS to reissue the delisting rule and shielded it from judicial review. In 2011, FWS reissued the delisting rule for gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, excluding wolves in certain states from ESA protections. The provision allows for potential relisting in the future. The delisting was unique as FWS had previously attempted delisting based on scientific evidence and the species had met recovery goals. Funding for the Endangered Species program is a contentious issue within the FWS budget. The FY2011 appropriation for the Endangered Species Program was $60.0 million, a decrease from the previous year's $85.0 million. The allocation to the Refuge System and Law Enforcement was not specified in the appropriation law. The request for refuge operations and maintenance was $499.5 million, a 1% decrease from the previous year. The Administration proposed increasing programs for wildlife and habitat management. The Administration proposed increasing programs for wildlife and habitat management in FY2010, while cutting conservation planning, visitor services, and refuge-based law enforcement. The FY2011 request for nationwide law enforcement was $63.3 million, down 4% from the previous year. Climate change programs were not specified in the FY2011 appropriations law, but the Administration proposed $28.8 million for climate change initiatives, a 44% increase from FY2010. This funding was intended for developing strategies to address climate impacts on wildlife and supporting cooperative scientific research. The FY2011 law allocated $55.0 million for land acquisition by the FWS, a decrease from the previous year. The President's proposal aimed to increase the number of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) from 9 to 12, with a goal of 21 LCCs in the future. The program is funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Migratory Bird Conservation Account (MBCA) under FWS has mandatory spending for land acquisition, funded by the sale of duck stamps and import duties. Increasing duck stamp prices could generate additional revenue. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands within the NWRS. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands within the NWRS, with funding supported by receipts from various activities. The FY2011 appropriations law maintained funding at $14.5 million, increasing the payment from 36% to 39% of the authorized level. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund benefits endangered species like elephants, tigers, and marine turtles. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated $10.0 million for the conservation of endangered species such as Asian and African elephants, tigers, rhinoceroses, great apes, and marine turtles. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund received $4.0 million, a decrease from the previous year. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants support conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The Interior appropriations laws allocate funds for state conservation plans and practical projects, with a portion set aside for tribal grants. State allocations are determined by formula. The FY2011 appropriation was $62.0 million, a decrease from the previous year. The National Park Service administers the National Park System. The National Park System, consisting of 394 units across 84 million acres, received $2.62 billion in FY2011 appropriations, a decrease from the previous year. The largest portion of funding goes towards the Operation of the National Park System Account. The FY2011 appropriations for the National Park System included $2.25 billion for the Operation of the National Park System Account. Funding decreased by $7.0 million from FY2010 and the Senate amendment level. The enacted level was higher than the House-passed level and lower than the Administration's request. Increases were requested for visitor services and resource stewardship, while funding for \"park partnership project grants\" was eliminated. The National Park System received funding for its 100th anniversary in 2016 to leverage private donations for park projects. The FY2011 budget included $57.4 million for the National Recreation and Preservation account, a reduction from the previous year. The Administration had requested $5.0 million for park projects, with a total FY2010 funding of $15.0 million. The FY2011 budget for the National Recreation and Preservation account was reduced to $51.0 million. The \"Preserve America\" program, funded at $4.6 million in FY2010, was not funded in FY2011 as the Administration sought to discontinue or reduce funding for park partnership programs. The Administration proposed to eliminate funding for the \"Preserve America\" program, which was deemed effective by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Additionally, funding for statutory and contractual aid was also proposed to be discontinued. This program provides financial assistance through partnerships to support areas not managed by the NPS, promoting systems of parks and open space nationwide. The Administration also requested a reduction in funding for heritage partnership programs, including national heritage areas, to address concerns about expanding numbers of programs. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), administered by the NPS, provides grants for restoring historic districts, sites, buildings, and objects significant in American history. Funding for statutory and contractual aid, heritage areas, and partnership programs will be determined by the NPS. The FY2011 appropriations for the HPF were $54.5 million, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2011 appropriations for the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) were $54.5 million, a decrease from the previous year. In FY2011, funding for Save America's Treasures was eliminated, and the appropriation for construction was $185.1 million, which was less than the FY2010 appropriations and the Administration's FY2011 request. The Construction line item in the FY2011 budget for the National Park Service received $184.8 million, which is less than the Senate amendment but more than the House-passed level. This funding covers new construction projects, repairs, rehabilitation, replacement of park facilities, general management planning, and road construction and repair. The NPS is concerned about addressing deferred maintenance, with estimates ranging from $8.23 billion to $12.11 billion for FY2009. In FY2011, Land Acquisition and State Assistance appropriations totaled $95.0 million, a decrease from FY2010. State assistance remained at $40.0 million, while NPS land acquisition received $55.0 million, a reduction from the previous year. The FY2011 law provided $55.0 million for land acquisition funds, a reduction of $31.3 million from FY2010. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is a science agency that provides information on climate change, geological resources, and water resources. The FY2011 enacted level for the USGS was $1.09 billion, $25.9 million below the FY2010 level. The FY2011 budget was also below the Administration request and Senate amendment, but nearly level with the House-passed bill. Funding for eight activities under the USGS was not specified in the appropriations law for FY2011. The Administration request for USGS was $1.13 billion, $21.6 million above the FY2010 level. The FY2011 budget for USGS had more funding than FY2010 for various research areas, but less funding for other specific activities. The National Geospatial Program aims to provide access to geospatial information through data and maps, supporting the Landsat satellite series for environmental monitoring. The Landsat program provides earth science information for environmental monitoring, funded at $24.1 million in FY2010. It supports Geologic Hazard Assessment programs for monitoring and warnings of hazards like earthquakes and landslides. This initiative aims to increase resilience to natural hazards. The initiative aims to enhance hazard mitigation and planning activities in the Pacific Northwest, build resilience in Alaskan communities, and improve USGS disaster response capabilities. The Water Resources activity supports water research and monitoring addressing water availability, quality, and flood and drought hazards through various programs funded by federal appropriations. The USGS program NAWQA provides status and trends on water quality nationwide. The National Streamgage Network, funded by NSIP and the Cooperative Water Program, monitors water flow in rivers and streams with 7,500 gages. The WaterSMART Program aims to determine water quantity, quality, and use in the US, generating critical information for water management and conservation. The USGS program focuses on studying species at risk in changing arctic ecosystems due to climate change. The National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center seeks to provide information on climate change effects on the United States' resources and landscape. Funding for climate change research did not see specific changes in FY2011 under the USGS, but increased funding was requested for DOI Climate Science Centers. The Department of the Interior Climate Science Centers (DOI CSCs) support research, assessment, and synthesis of global change data at regional levels. Three CSCs were established in FY2010, with funding requested for two more in FY2011 and the final three expected in FY2012. The USGS contributes to the DOI Climate Effects Network (CEN) to understand and forecast the effects of climate change on ecosystems and society, providing decision-support tools for adaptation. The USGS conducts a national assessment of biological carbon sequestration and consolidates funding for information needs. Science Support focuses on modernizing infrastructure for managing scientific information. BOEMRE manages federal mineral revenues and offshore renewable resources. The USGS conducts a national assessment of biological carbon sequestration and consolidates funding for information needs. BOEMRE manages federal mineral revenues and offshore renewable resources. In response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced a plan to separate the safety and environmental functions of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) from its leasing and revenue collection function. This led to the establishment of three new entities: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The transition to the new framework of BOEM, BSEE, and ONRR functions is expected to be completed by October 1, 2011, as per the Administration's FY2012 budget request. ONRR disbursed $9.2 billion in FY2010 from mineral leases on federal and Indian lands, fluctuating annually based on oil and gas prices. Oil royalties accounted for 39% of ONRR receipts in FY2007, a shift from previous years where natural gas royalties dominated. In FY2007, oil royalties accounted for 39% of ONRR receipts. In FY2010, royalties from natural gas and oil leases contributed 28% and 51%, respectively, of total ONRR receipts. Other sources of ONRR receipts include bonus bids and rents for all leasable minerals and royalties from coal and other minerals. The FY2011 appropriations included funding for the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management (OEMM) Program and the Royalty Management Program, which collect and disburse bonuses, rents, and royalties from federal onshore and OCS leases and Indian mineral leases. Revenues from onshore leases are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs, while revenues from offshore leases are allocated among coastal areas. The FY2011 appropriations provided funding for BOEMRE/ONRR, with a net funding of $209.2 million, an increase of 53% from FY2010. The gross funding level was $416.1 million, including appropriations for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management and Oil Spill Research. This funding was offset by inspection fees, receipts, and cost recovery fees. BOEMRE has been retaining a portion of OCS revenues since 1994. The FY2011 gross funding for BOEMRE/ONRR increased by $67.9 million (19%) from FY2010, totaling $416.1 million. This included a significant increase in funding for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management and Oil Spill Research. An amended budget request for FY2011 added $100 million (27%) to the initial funding level, with additional appropriations and fees. The amended FY2011 request included $449.9 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management and $14.9 million for Oil Spill Research, with additional fees and collections. The Administration proposed increasing inspection fees and introducing new fees on nonproducing leases, but these were not included in the FY2011 appropriations law. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) established a new Office of Offshore Alternative Energy Programs to oversee renewable energy projects. They issued leases for site testing and data collection in New Jersey and Delaware. A commercial lease was granted to Cape Wind Associates, LLC for a wind energy project in Nantucket Sound. The FY2011 funding request for offshore renewable energy development was $23.6 million. Controversial issues like leasing moratoria, royalty relief, and audits are debated during the annual Interior appropriations bills. The focus of debates has been on moratoria, royalty relief, and audit and compliance programs for oil and gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Moratoria in place since 1982 were lifted by President Bush in 2008, potentially opening areas for leasing activity. The Obama Administration's Revised Program in 2010 eliminated five Alaskan lease sales and postponed Lease Sale 219 in the Cook Inlet. The Obama Administration has made changes to the lease program, including cancelling Lease Sale 219 in the Cook Inlet due to lack of industry interest. The North Aleutian Basin Planning Area was withdrawn from leasing activity until June 30, 2017. Public hearings were held on the scope of the 2012-2017 OCS oil and gas leasing program, excluding Atlantic and Pacific Coast planning areas. President Obama cancelled lease sales after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the current BOEMRE five-year leasing program remains in effect despite court orders. The court decision affects only Alaska lease sales in the 2007-2012 program. The debate continues on whether to lift the moratorium in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under GOMESA, with some supporting increased domestic oil and gas supply while others are concerned about economic and environmental impacts. The 2010 oil spill off the Louisiana coast is a factor in the decision-making process. The 2010 oil spill off the Louisiana coast is a factor in the debate over oil and natural gas exploration in the Atlantic OCS. DOI studied resource data gaps and directed BOEMRE to complete a programmatic environmental impact statement. Royalty relief for OCS oil and gas producers has been a topic of discussion during Interior appropriations bills. The BOEMRE/ONRR has not been collecting royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 due to the exclusion of price thresholds in the lease agreements. The authority of the Secretary of the Interior to impose price thresholds was challenged by Kerr-McGee, with a court ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee. The Administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision on price threshold levels in leases under the DWRRA. The Supreme Court rejected the petition, impacting future OCS royalties. The GAO estimated a loss of $21-$53 billion in royalty revenue over 25 years. The Administration has repaid $2 billion to companies based on the court decision, while BOEMRE/ONRR faces challenges in ensuring audit and compliance effectiveness. Critics argue that a focus on compliance review over auditing has weakened the royalty collection system, leading to revenue loss for the federal Treasury. Recommendations have been made to strengthen the Compliance and Asset Management Program, including adopting a risk-based compliance approach. The FY2011 budget request reflects a commitment to this approach, with funding unspecified in the appropriations law. The Royalty Policy Committee (RPC) provided over 100 recommendations to improve the leasing program and auditing function, including a review of the Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program. The Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program, which involved payments in fuel rather than cash, grew significantly from 41.5 million BOE in 2004 to 112 million BOE in 2007. A report by the GAO in 2008 suggested improvements to the RIK Program, leading to its phased-in termination by the Secretary of the Interior. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 aimed to ensure reclamation of coal-mined land, but due to the large inventory of abandoned mine sites, accountability for reclamation was lacking. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) established the Abandoned Mine Reclamation (AML) Fund to address the large inventory of abandoned mine sites. Monies for reclaiming hazardous sites come from fees on coal production. Funding for state and tribal grants now includes both annual appropriations from the AML fund and mandatory appropriations from the U.S. Treasury. Other activities like federal AML programs in states without approved reclamation programs, emergency reclamation, OSM administrative expenses, and the Clean Streams program receive annual appropriations. The AML fund, established by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, addresses abandoned mine sites with fees on coal production. Western states sought increased AML appropriations to address the disproportionate share of reclamation expenses. The unappropriated balance in the AML fund exceeded $2.3 billion in 2009, with efforts to return unappropriated balances to state and tribal accounts. The AML fund, funded by fees on coal production, is being returned to certified states and tribes in annual installments. The FY2011 appropriations law maintained OSM funding at $162.9 million, above the Administration's request of $146.1 million. The Administration proposed increasing user fees on coal producers to offset the reduction, citing other energy industries that pay fees for regulation costs. The Administration proposed increasing user fees on coal producers to contribute to the cost of coal mine regulation, treating similar industries more comparably. They also expressed their intention to seek an end of payments to certified states and tribes, citing inconsistency with the purpose of the AML program. This proposal would require a change in law, strongly opposed by affected states and tribes. The Administration expected mandatory appropriations to cover the costs of state and tribal emergency grants, reflecting a total decrease for the AML Fund. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to insular areas and freely associated states in the Western Pacific. OIA staff work to build local government capacities and support infrastructure projects, including those for the increased U.S. military presence on Guam. OIA funding includes permanent and indefinite appropriations for emergency grants and projects. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to insular areas and freely associated states in the Western Pacific through permanent and indefinite appropriations and annual discretionary funds from Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts. These funds support various initiatives, with the majority of the budget coming from permanent and indefinite funds. In FY2011, the total OIA funding was $472.4 million, with approximately $370.8 million required by existing statute. In FY2011, the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) had a total budget of $472.4 million, with $370.8 million required by existing statute. This included $224.8 million from Compacts of Free Association and $146.0 million in fiscal assistance for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The remaining 22% of the budget, $101.6 million, came from discretionary funds. The AT funds, providing technical assistance to territories, made up the bulk of the appropriated OIA funds, with $84.3 million specified in the FY2011 law. The FY2011 law allocated $84.3 million in AT funds for technical assistance to territories, the same amount as the Senate amendment and 1% less than FY2010. Additionally, $17.3 million was designated for CFA funding, the same as FY2010, with the House approving $5.4 million. EPA's responsibilities include enforcing federal regulations on air and water quality, pesticides, waste management, and pollution control grants to states and local governments. The FY2011 appropriations law provided $8.70 billion for EPA, a decrease from the previous year. Funding levels for FY2011 were compared to appropriations enacted in FY2010 for various accounts. Spending plans must be submitted below the account level within 30 days of enactment. The FY2011 appropriations law decreased funding for EPA to $8.70 billion. Reductions were seen in five of the eight EPA regular accounts, mainly in the Environmental Programs and Management and State and Tribal Assistance Grants accounts. The Office of Inspector General, Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Program, and Oil Spill Response accounts maintained FY2010 funding levels. The focus was on federal financial assistance for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds and Special Project Grants. The EPA's FY2011 funding focused on federal financial assistance for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, Superfund site cleanup, air pollution control grants, climate change research, water quality initiatives like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and Chesapeake Bay restoration. Several EPA regulatory actions were also a focus, with provisions in the House-passed bill. Over 20 provisions restricting funds for regulatory activities were not retained in the FY2011 law. The House-passed bill restricted EPA's use of funds for various regulatory activities, including addressing greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous air pollutants, mountaintop mining, coal ash management, particulate matter emissions, and water quality management. The Senate amendment did not include these provisions. The FY2011 decrease in EPA appropriations was mainly due to a reduction in State and Tribal Assistance Grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. In FY2011, the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds received a total of $2.49 billion, down from $3.49 billion in FY2010. These funds support local wastewater and drinking water projects to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. Grants are allocated to states based on statutory formulas for Clean Water SRF and administratively for Drinking Water SRF. $1.53 billion was allocated for Clean Water SRF and $965.0 million for Drinking Water SRF in FY2011. In FY2011, Clean Water SRF and Drinking Water SRF received $2.49 billion in total funding, with $1.53 billion allocated for Clean Water SRF and $965.0 million for Drinking Water SRF. Some Members objected to reductions in appropriations, citing the need for federal assistance to help states maintain sufficient capital for local water infrastructure needs. In FY2011, funding for water infrastructure programs like the Clean Water SRF and Drinking Water SRF totaled $2.49 billion. Some stakeholders advocated for increased federal assistance, while others emphasized self-reliance among state and local governments. The EPA's EPM account also supports programs addressing water quality and ecosystem restoration, with a focus on initiatives like the Great Lakes Restoration and Chesapeake Bay Program. Despite opposition to reduced funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the FY2011 law allocated $300.0 million, lower than the previous year's $475.0 million. The proposed reduction in funding for the Chesapeake Bay program in FY2011 was attributed to timing of funds and the contention that less funding was needed because EPA had not obligated all funds from FY2010. The House-passed bill would have reduced the FY2010 appropriation by $10.0 million, with the President requesting $63.0 million. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account received $1.28 billion in FY2011, less than the previous year. In FY2011, funding for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account was less than the previous year, with ongoing debate over the adequacy of funding for cleanup at sites on the National Priorities List. There was interest in reinstating Superfund taxes on industry to support the program. The President's FY2011 budget proposed reinstating Superfund taxes to support EPA's Superfund program, but no legislation has been enacted. Concerns were raised in hearings about EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other actions under the Clean Air Act. The House-passed bill included provisions restricting the use of agency funds for certain CAA regulations. The House-passed bill included provisions to restrict funding for specific EPA actions under the Clean Air Act, which were not included in the Senate amendment or FY2011 law. The FY2011 law specified no funding for certain grants, such as the Targeted Airshed Grants Program and Climate Change Grants to Local Governments, while allocating $50.0 million for the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants Program, a reduction from previous years. The FY2011 law did not specify funding for the Diesel Emission Reductions Grant Program, but EPA's role in climate change activities has been significant. EPA's response to a 2007 Supreme Court decision on greenhouse gas emissions has sparked debate, leading to regulatory actions to limit emissions. EPA's regulatory actions in response to a Supreme Court decision on greenhouse gas emissions led to debates among Members of Congress regarding funding for the Forest Service in FY2011 appropriations. The enacted level for the Forest Service was $602.0 million less than the FY2010 appropriation. The FY2011 Forest Service appropriations totaled $5.30 billion, with funding allocated to various major accounts including FS Research, State and Private Forestry, National Forest System, Capital Improvement and Maintenance, Land Acquisition, Wildland Fire Management, and Other programs. The enacted amount for FS Research was $307.3 million, $4.8 million less than FY2010. State and Private Forestry received $278.2 million, $29.9 million less than FY2010. The FY2011 enacted amount for State and Private Forestry (S&PF) was $45.5 million more than the House-passed level and $23.5 million less than the Senate amendment. Funding for the Forest Legacy program was controversial, with a specified decline to $53.0 million in FY2011 from $76.5 million in FY2010. The National Forest System (NFS) received $1.55 billion in FY2011, $6.0 million less than the previous year. The FY2011 appropriation for NFS was $1.55 billion, $6.0 million less than FY2010. It included $15.0 million for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund and $336.7 million for forest products. The Administration had requested $40.0 million for the Fund. The FY2011 appropriation for NFS was $1.55 billion, $6.0 million less than FY2010. It included $336.7 million for forest products (timber sales) and funding for construction, maintenance of facilities, roads, and trails, as well as deferred maintenance. The appropriations law for FY2011 included $460.6 million, $77.5 million less than FY2010, with a proposed reduction to $438.4 million by the Administration. The agency's backlog of deferred maintenance was estimated at $5.3 billion as of September 30, 2009. The agency's backlog of deferred maintenance was estimated at $5.3 billion as of September 30, 2009. In FY2011, the enacted amount for legacy road remediation was $45.0 million, lower than the previous year. For FS land acquisition, the appropriations law allocated $34.3 million, significantly less than the Administration's request of $75.0 million. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical and environmental health services for 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of facilities and programs. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, and health stations, while tribes and tribal groups also operate healthcare facilities through contracts and compacts. Urban Indian organizations run ambulatory programs. In addition to village clinics, urban Indian organizations operate ambulatory programs. IHS, tribes, and tribal groups run residential youth substance abuse treatment centers. IHS received a $4.08 billion appropriation for FY2011, which was $25.0 million higher than FY2010. The appropriation was $329.1 million less than the Administration's request and $62.0 million less than the House-passed level. IHS also receives funding from third-party reimbursements, diabetes programs, and rents on personnel quarters. The FY2011 appropriations law increased funding for the Indian Health Services account by $15.0 million to a total of $3.67 billion. The funding is separated into Health Services and Facilities categories, with specific allocations for various programs. The House-passed bill increased funding for IHS accounts and specified funding levels for certain activities. The Senate amendment maintained funding levels specified in the FY2010 law. The FY2011 appropriations law increased funding for the Indian Health Services account by $15.0 million to a total of $3.67 billion. This funding includes Contract Health Services (CHS) at the FY2010 level of $779.3 million. CHS funds essential health services from local providers when IHS cannot provide care, but funding constraints lead to prioritization based on medical need. The House-passed bill and Administration sought to increase CHS funding by $83.4 million to $862.8 million in FY2011. The FY2011 appropriations law maintained funding levels for the Contract Health Services (CHS) program, including the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) at $48.0 million. The Administration and House-passed bill had proposed an increase to $53.0 million for CHEF, allowing for funding of 200 more high-cost cases. Additionally, Contract Support Costs (CSC) remained at $398.5 million in FY2011. The Contract Support Costs (CSC) program funding remained at $398.5 million for FY2011, with a proposed increase of $45.8 million to $443.0 million. CSC funds are provided to tribes for administering IHS-funded programs under self-determination contracts or compacts. The program has faced shortfalls, leading to reduced services for tribes. The proposed increase aims to address these issues by supporting current and new tribes entering into contracts and compacts. The FY2011 appropriations law included $404.8 million for the Indian Health facilities account, an increase of $10.0 million (3%) from the level enacted for FY2010. The Administration proposed funding increases for programs contracted and compacted, with a proposed increase of $50.5 million (13%) for the facilities account. Indian health organizations emphasize the need for increased appropriations for health care facility construction due to old and poorly maintained IHS facilities. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex with 19 museums, the National Zoo, and nine research facilities. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a complex of 19 museums, the National Zoo, and research facilities funded by federal appropriations and a private trust. In FY2011, it received $761.2 million in funding, a slight decrease from the previous year. For FY2011, the Smithsonian Institution received $636.2 million for Salaries and Expenses, which was $1.5 million less than the House-passed bill and $24.7 million less than the Administration request. Additionally, $125.0 million was allocated for Facilities Capital, $11.8 million less than the requested amount. Studies suggest a $2.5 billion investment over 10 years is needed for facility maintenance. An investment of $2.5 billion over 10 years is needed to address advanced facilities deterioration. The FY2011 requested amount of $136.8 million included $106.2 million for baseline revitalization requirements and $30.6 million for facilities planning and design. The Legacy Fund, established by Congress in 2008, was intended to address the backlog of facilities capital repairs but did not receive funding for FY2011. The Smithsonian Institution also receives income from trust funds to support various projects and operations. In FY2009, the Smithsonian Institution's net assets increased by 3.3 percent to almost $2.5 billion. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including the NEA and NEH, provide federal support for the arts. The NEA awarded over 130,000 grants since 1965. In FY2011, the NEA received $155.0 million, a decrease of $12.5 million from the previous year. The NEA funding was reduced by $20.6 million in the House-passed bill, totaling $124.4 million. The FY2011 enacted amount was $6.3 million less than the Administration's request of $161.3 million, with allocations for various grant programs. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) supports various humanities programs, including education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs. NEH has awarded over 61,000 grants since 1965 and also offers a \"Challenge Grant\" program to match private donations. In FY2011, NEH received $155.0 million in funding, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2011 enacted amount was $6.3 million less than the Administration's request. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) received a decrease in funding for its \"We the People\" grants and a new initiative called \"Bridging Cultures.\" The funds support various programs such as exhibitions, films, library programs, and collection preservation. Additionally, the Department of Interior (DOI) has previously received funds for restoration projects in the Florida Everglades authorized under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). DOI conducts activities in southern Florida through various agencies. The Administration's FY2011 request for Everglades restoration included $74.5 million for the Department of the Interior and approximately $180 million within the Corps of Engineers budget, totaling $255 million in federal funding. The federal government's commitment to Everglades restoration is a topic of concern. Some observers worry that the commitment is decreasing due to the limited number of authorized projects since WRDA 2000. However, others argue that the commitment has actually increased, citing projects moving into construction phases and additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Notably, the first CERP project broke ground in January 2010 at Picayune Strand in South Florida, and the Mod Waters construction project also began recently. The federal government recently broke ground on the Mod Waters construction project, a prerequisite for funding CERP projects in the eastern Everglades. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 but requires appropriations for spending. It is used for acquiring lands by federal agencies, state and local governments, and funding related activities. Approximately $34 billion was credited to the LWCF from FY1965 through FY2011. The LWCF received about $34 billion from FY1965 to FY2011, with roughly $16 billion appropriated. Funding for LWCF has varied over time, with the FY2011 appropriation being $301.1 million, a decrease from the previous year. Land acquisition in FY2011 received $165.0 million, lower than the previous year's $265.8 million. The enacted level was below the Administration's request of $619.2 million and the Senate amendment amount. The FY2011 funding for LWCF was $204.9 million lower than the Administration's request and $27.6 million less than the Senate amendment. However, it was $124.0 million higher than the House-passed level. The funding variability reflects tension over federal land ownership. The FY2011 law did not specify which land units would receive funding for acquisition projects. DOI agencies used consistent, merit-based criteria for acquisition projects for the first time in FY2011. The FY2011 FS budget justification highlighted changes to the LWCF program, including the use of selection criteria for ranking land acquisition projects to address congressional concerns. Conferees directed agencies to prioritize acquiring high-threat lands, streamline land appraisals, and aim for a unified policy approach among agencies. The FY2011 budget directed the DOI and Agriculture Secretaries to review land acquisition policies and report findings to Congress. Concerns were raised about LWCF-funded lands being used inconsistently with their intended purposes. State grants remained at $40.0 million, with a proposed increase to $50.0 million. Since FY2000, funding for state grants from LWCF has varied, ranging from $19.0 million in FY2009 to $143.9 million in FY2002. In FY2011, $84.0 million was allocated for FWS Cooperative Endangered Species grants and the FS Forest Legacy program, lower than previous years but higher than the House-passed appropriation. Other programs have also been funded from LWCF in recent years. Since FY2000, LWCF funding for state grants has varied. In FY2011, $84.0 million was allocated for FWS Cooperative Endangered Species grants and the FS Forest Legacy program. The largest portion of the LWCF appropriation has been for land acquisition since FY2008. Wildfire protection programs and funding remain controversial, with ongoing discussions about high costs, locations for treatments, and challenges hindering fuel reduction and post-fire rehabilitation. The FY2011 law provided $3.09 billion for Wildland Fire Management, a decrease from FY2010. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated $2.84 billion for Wildland Fire Management, a decrease from FY2010. This funding was lower than the Administration's request and previous proposals for FY2011. The traditional approach to funding wildfire suppression was modified in the FY2010 Interior appropriations law. The FLAME Act of 2009 established funds for wildfire suppression when Wildland Fire Management accounts are exhausted. Secretaries can transfer funds for suppression activities upon declaration of a large or complex fire. The FLAME Act of 2009 established funds for wildfire suppression when Wildland Fire Management accounts are exhausted. The FY2011 appropriations law provided $352.0 million for the FLAME funds, $122.0 million less than FY2010 enacted levels. The FY2011 enacted FLAME funds were $392.0 million less than requested, with differences in regular suppression appropriations and specific rescissions of fire funds. The FY2011 law included a rescission of $600.0 million and the use of $200.0 million in prior-year funds. The Administration did not include a rescission or the use of prior-year funds in its FY2011 request. The FY2011 law specified decreases in funding for FS post-fire rehabilitation and FS state fire assistance. The President proposed shifts in funding among sub-accounts, including a decrease in FS fire suppression and an increase in FS preparedness. Funds may be shifted among activities within the enacted level that closely matches the FY2010 appropriations."
