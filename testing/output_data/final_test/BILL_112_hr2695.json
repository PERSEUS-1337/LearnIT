    "content": "The Act titled \"Trisomy 21 Research Centers of Excellence Act of 2011\" is introduced. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include Down Syndrome research activities under Section 409K. The Director of NIH will expand and intensify research programs on Down syndrome in coordination with a working group. A research plan on Down syndrome will be published and updated every 5 years. The Director of NIH will award grants to establish centers of excellence for translational research on Down syndrome, with a focus on basic, translational, and clinical research. At least 6 centers will be established to contribute to a comprehensive research portfolio based on the NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome. The NIH will establish centers of excellence for translational research on Down syndrome, focusing on basic, clinical, and translational research. Research areas include early detection, biological mechanisms of anomalies in cells and tissues, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, and interventions to enhance cognition and daily activities. The NIH will establish centers of excellence for translational research on Down syndrome, focusing on various aspects such as co-occurrence of medical disorders, genetic contributions to clinical presentation, biomarker identification, and therapies for common features including Alzheimer's. The NIH will establish centers of excellence for translational research on Down syndrome, focusing on common features like Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, improving quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome, and training programs for scientists. Services for patients include raising awareness for research participation opportunities. The NIH will establish centers of excellence for translational research on Down syndrome, focusing on common features like Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, improving quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome, and training programs for scientists. The program will provide referrals for health services, patient care costs, and access to medical services for research subjects. The NIH will establish centers of excellence for translational research on Down syndrome, focusing on common features like Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, improving quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome, and expanding training programs for medical and allied health clinicians and scientists in research relevant to Down syndrome. The Director of NIH will coordinate information sharing among the centers, ensure regular communication, require periodic reports on activities, and specify the organization of centers using facilities of a single institution or a virtual consortium. The Director of NIH may provide support to a center for up to 5 years, with the possibility of extension for additional periods not exceeding 5 years if recommended by a peer review group. In carrying out subsection (a)(1), the NIH will establish a Down Syndrome Consortium. The Director of NIH may establish a Down Syndrome Consortium to enhance research efficiency and communication. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress annually on the implementation of this section. $6,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2017."
