    "content": "The \"Safe Overseas Human Testing Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings of the Act are also included. Before a new drug or device can be marketed, the FDA requires laboratory and clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. Institutional Review Boards review research plans to protect human participants, especially vulnerable populations like women and children. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) protect vulnerable populations like women, children, the elderly, and the disabled by ensuring they are informed of risks and benefits in clinical trials. The FDA may accept foreign clinical trial results that do not meet US IRB requirements for supporting the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices. Foreign clinical trials conducted in other countries may not meet the stringent requirements of the United States, leaving participants vulnerable to unethical practices. The number of countries where drug research is conducted for FDA approval has significantly increased, with concerns raised about inadequate legal protections for participants in these trials. Some researchers exploit developing countries' regulatory systems, illiteracy rates, and public health failures to test experimental drugs on uninformed participants. The Washington Post exposed unethical practices of US pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials overseas, including lack of informed consent and falsified results. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) presented a report on ethical issues in international research, highlighting inadequate regulatory protections for human participants in developing countries. In September 2001, the Office of the Inspector General within HHS released a report on the globalization of clinical trials. The Inspector General within HHS released a report on the globalization of clinical trials, noting concerns about foreign IRBs' lack of experience and monitoring practices. Recommendations included collecting more information on foreign IRBs' performance and the location of clinical investigations. Federal regulation should expedite the delivery of new drugs to patients while ensuring proper oversight. Existing law allows manufacturers to profit from treating devastating illnesses in developing countries, exploiting uniformed, misinformed, and unwilling patients. The policy of Congress is to control the export of test articles for clinical investigations involving human participants to promote public health and safety, prevent harm to US foreign policy, and maintain credibility as a responsible trading partner. Measures are in place to protect public health. To carry out the policy of controlling the export of test articles for clinical investigations, an export license approved by the President is required. The President can use the authorities of the Export Administration Act of 1979 for this purpose. Criteria for the export license include identifying each clinical investigation and submitting protocols for approval. The President must approve export licenses for clinical investigations of test articles, following the standards for human subject protection. A report on approved export licenses must be submitted to congressional committees annually. The President approves export licenses for clinical investigations of test articles, ensuring human subject protection. A report on approved licenses is submitted annually to congressional committees, including applicant names and destination countries. Definitions for terms like \"application for research or marketing permit\" and \"appropriate congressional committees\" are provided in this section. The term \"clinical investigation\" refers to experiments involving a test article and human subjects, which may require submission to the FDA or have results intended for FDA inspection as part of a permit application. The term \"clinical investigation\" excludes experiments that must meet specific regulations for nonclinical laboratory studies. Definitions include \"destination country\" as the country where test articles are exported, \"human subject\" as an individual participating in research, and \"institution\" as any public or private entity involved in research. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a group designated by an institution to review and approve biomedical research involving human subjects to protect their rights and welfare. IRB approval is the determination made by the IRB that a clinical investigation can be conducted within set constraints. A test article refers to any drug, biological product, medical device, human food additive, color additive, electronic product, or any other article subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if introduced into interstate commerce."
