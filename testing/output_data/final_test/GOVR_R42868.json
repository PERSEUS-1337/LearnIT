    "content": "A \"dirty bomb\" or radiological dispersal device (RDD) could contaminate densely populated or economically critical areas, like a key port or city center. The radioactive material used in an RDD is widely available and could render an area off-limits for many years, requiring a costly cleanup effort. An RDD attack could result in billions of dollars in economic losses, societal disruption, and cleanup expenses. Congress has taken steps to protect against terrorists obtaining radioactive material. The United States is taking steps to protect against terrorists seizing radioactive material to make a dirty bomb. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 mandated scanning cargo containers for radiation at certain ports and established the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to coordinate efforts to detect and protect against nuclear threats. Congress has funded these efforts. The United States has funded various initiatives to secure nuclear and radioactive materials domestically and internationally. Agencies like the NRC play a role in regulating and increasing security measures for these materials. Orders have been issued post-9/11 to enhance security against RDD attacks. The NRC has issued security orders for radioactive materials, but a new rule, 10 C.F.R. 37, is being developed with stakeholder input to regulate all licensees. This rule will impact industries using radioactive materials and focus on those posing the greatest threat for use in RDD attacks. The NRC is developing a new rule, 10 C.F.R. 37, to regulate all licensees using radioactive materials. This rule will impact industries and activities nationwide, affecting many constituents and raising cost-benefit issues. Congress is interested in protecting against terrorist threats and regulating radiation. The NRC is developing a new rule, 10 C.F.R. 37, to regulate all licensees using radioactive materials. CRS conducted telephone interviews with radiation industry professionals to analyze the rule's impact, revealing divergent views among professionals on its effects. One interviewee described the rule as sweeping and high-impact, affecting the entire industry. The new rule 10 C.F.R. 37 is described as sweeping and high-impact, affecting the entire industry. Concerns about CBRN attacks, especially by non-state actors like terrorists, have increased since September 11, 2001. One worry is the possibility of a terrorist group using a radiological dispersal device (RDD) to contaminate key sections of a city or critical infrastructure with radioactive material, potentially causing long-term cancer fatalities. The use of radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) poses a significant threat to key infrastructure and societal well-being. RDDs, such as \"dirty bombs,\" could lead to economic disruption, relocation of people, and costly cleanup efforts. Different means of dispersal, like dropping material from tall buildings, are possible. Radionuclides with short half-lives decay quickly, reducing cleanup costs, while those with long half-lives emit minimal radiation per unit mass, requiring large quantities for effective dispersal. Radionuclides with long half-lives emit minimal radiation per unit mass, requiring large quantities for effective dispersal. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) identified 16 radionuclides of concern and established a Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources in 2004. This code applies to specified quantities of these radionuclides, categorized based on the amount of material present. Most category 2 quantities of these radionuclides weigh a few grams or less. The IAEA categorizes harmful quantities of radionuclides into category 1 and 2. Cesium-137 chloride is a major concern due to its dispersibility, solubility, and presence in various facilities across the US. The lack of permanent disposal options for high-activity cesium sources exacerbates this concern. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for regulating the use and protection of special nuclear material in civilian uses, such as uranium enriched in isotope 235 and plutonium. Cesium-137 chloride poses unique risks due to its dispersibility and solubility, with 1,000 curies capable of contaminating a significant area in an RDD attack. The lack of permanent disposal options for high-activity cesium sources is a concern. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the use of special nuclear material, fuel in nuclear reactors, and byproduct material used in medicine, industry, and research. NRC issues licenses for facilities and organizations to possess radioactive material, with Agreement States playing a key role in the regulatory framework. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) can delegate regulatory authority to Agreement States for certain types of radioactive material, except for matters related to common defense and security. Agreement States regulate radioactive materials for medical, academic, and industrial uses within their borders, excluding commercial nuclear power plants and facilities in the nuclear fuel cycle. NRC issued orders to enhance security measures after the 9/11 attacks. The NRC issued orders to enhance security measures for radioactive materials after the 9/11 attacks. A proposed rule for the \"Physical Protection of Byproduct Material\" was approved by the NRC in March 2012 and sent to OMB for review in July. The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register in early 2013. The NRC issued orders to enhance security measures for radioactive materials after the 9/11 attacks. A proposed rule for the \"Physical Protection of Byproduct Material\" was approved by the NRC in March 2012 and sent to OMB for review in July. The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register in early 2013. The rule will become effective one year after publication for NRC-regulated states and two years later for Agreement States. NRC and Agreement States will rescind previous orders once the rule is implemented. The rulemaking process involves feedback and approval, unlike orders which can be effective immediately. The NRC issued orders to enhance security measures for radioactive materials after 9/11. Orders apply only to current licensees, while rules apply to current and future licensees. NRC wanted to replace orders with rules because orders could stay indefinitely without reflecting current policy. Imposing long-term requirements through orders is not preferred. Orders do not apply prospectively to new license applicants, requiring periodic issuance of new orders. Security-related requirements need to be placed in rules to be generally applicable to all present and future licensees. The NRC issued orders after 9/11 to enhance security measures for radioactive materials. Orders apply only to current licensees, while rules apply to current and future licensees. Security-related requirements need to be placed in regulations for all present and future licensees. The rule makes changes such as requiring security training for trustworthy individuals, personal history disclosure, and annual review of access program content. NRC provides a detailed comparison table between the rule and orders. Implementation guidance documents are published to assist licensees in implementing the rule. The NRC issued draft guidance in June 2010 for 10 C.F.R. 37, which has undergone many changes since then. The rule is divided into six Subparts and an Appendix, with comments on selected sections of Subparts A, B, C, and D based on interviews with radiation professionals. The interviews revealed diverse views on various issues and highlighted the rule's impact on the radioactive-materials industry. Section 37.1 of the rule outlines the purpose of providing requirements for the physical protection program for licensees possessing certain quantities of radioactive material to ensure security. The cost vs. benefit of imposing a higher standard is questioned, especially in the event of an RDD attack. Section 37.5 includes definitions, such as a technical definition of \"byproduct material.\" The rule defines \"byproduct material\" as various categories of radioactive material. Trustworthiness and reliability (T&R) are subjective characteristics determining access to radioactive material. The rule defines \"byproduct material\" as various categories of radioactive material. Trustworthiness and reliability (T&R) are subjective characteristics determining access to radioactive material. An issue arises regarding the varied criteria for adjudicating T&R status among licensees, questioning the reliability of individuals like radiation safety officers or human resources personnel in making security risk determinations. The firm conducts background checks for individuals seeking T&R status, providing findings to university HR personnel for review. Licensees are seen as best suited to adjudicate T&R due to their knowledge of employees. Some suggest federal agencies should handle adjudications to eliminate bias. The rule imposes various information collection requirements. The rule imposes extensive information collection requirements, including record-keeping, security plans, and annual reviews. Concerns were raised about the vulnerability of detailed security plans to potential threats if accessed by terrorists. The RSO at a large university finds 10 CFR 37 too burdensome and urges researchers to switch to x-ray based irradiators to avoid compliance difficulties. The blood bank plans to replace a cobalt-60 irradiator with two x-ray irradiators due to operational reliability issues. An Agreement State regulatory official believes that the burden of implementing Part 37 regulations is not too great, citing the need for personnel access authorization requirements for radioactive material. The objective of the access authorization program is to ensure individuals with unescorted access to radioactive material are T&R. Licensees must approve only those with job duties requiring such access. Reviewing officials must also be T&R. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires fingerprinting for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive material or safeguards information. Some organizations have granted HR staff unescorted access to radioactive material to enable them to be fingerprinted, even though they do not require such access for their job. One university addressed this by giving HR staff unescorted access without providing them with the necessary key card for physical access. There is a call for the law to be changed to avoid this dilemma. Limited funds should be prioritized for enhancing physical security, especially internally to devices, rather than on T&R. Increased investment in physical security can reduce concerns about theft of radioactive material. NRC staff discussed the requirement for fingerprinting individuals with unescorted access to certain regulated materials under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NRC requires fingerprinting and background checks for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials to ensure trustworthiness and reliability. This is necessary for those approved for access to certain regulated materials or safeguards information. The reviewing official, designated by the licensee, must have unescorted access to radioactive materials for security reasons. If not fingerprinted, a security gap could be exploited, allowing individuals with criminal or terrorist ties access to materials. The official is crucial for defense-in-depth of the security program. The licensee must have a reviewing official with unescorted access to radioactive materials for security reasons. The official's trustworthiness is important, but there are concerns about how the licensee determines this and the lack of uniform standards for adjudicating someone as trustworthy and reliable. The Nuclear Energy Institute and a company official expressed frustration with the lack of clear guidelines from the NRC on adjudicating Trustworthiness and Reliability (T&R) for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials. The T&R requirement imposes burdens on companies, such as actively seeking references for T&R applicants not listed in paperwork. An Agreement State regulator may help resolve the discrepancy by stating that T&R adjudications are best done by employers, but NRC has not provided adequate guidelines. The Nuclear Energy Institute and a company official expressed frustration with the lack of clear guidelines from the NRC on adjudicating Trustworthiness and Reliability (T&R) for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials. Section 37.25 sets minimum requirements for background investigations, including fingerprinting and FBI checks, but lacks clarity on T&R criteria. Employers have extensive experience in adjudicating T&R, making NRC guidelines potentially redundant. The NRC lacks clear guidelines on adjudicating Trustworthiness and Reliability (T&R) for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials. Section 37.25 requires background investigations, including fingerprinting and FBI checks, but lacks clarity on T&R criteria. Stakeholders opposed a credit check requirement, arguing that credit history does not determine T&R. NRC dropped this provision from the final rule. It is challenging to find references not listed by the applicant for verification. The final rule requires licensees to fingerprint individuals for unescorted access to radioactive material, with the FBI conducting criminal history checks. Some radiation professionals find the process cumbersome and prefer to send fingerprints directly to the FBI electronically. The final rule requires licensees to fingerprint individuals for unescorted access to radioactive material, with the FBI conducting criminal history checks. A university RSO mentioned the high cost of using NRC fingerprint cards for FBI background checks, questioning why they couldn't send electronic fingerprints directly to the FBI. The NRC process for fingerprinting individuals for unescorted access to radioactive material is questioned for its cost and efficiency, with suggestions to streamline the process by directly sending electronic fingerprints to the FBI. The NRC cites 42 USC 2169 as the legal basis for their current process. The NRC process for fingerprinting individuals for unescorted access to radioactive material is questioned for its cost and efficiency. Electronic fingerprinting may be used with approval from the Attorney General and the Commission. However, criminal history record information can only be provided to the NRC, licensee, or the individual. Certain individuals are exempt from fingerprinting and criminal history checks for unescorted access. Certain individuals, such as Members of Congress and law enforcement personnel, are exempt from fingerprinting and criminal history checks for unescorted access to radioactive material. Licensees must protect personal information obtained through background investigations according to Section 37.31 of the regulations. Some interviewees expressed concern about the administrative burden of requirements in 10 C.F.R. 37 for creating and protecting written procedures. One interviewee questioned the transfer of T&R adjudication and personal information between companies. Section 37.33 requires licensees to review their access authorization program for effectiveness and objectivity. The section requires licensees to review their access authorization program for effectiveness and objectivity, document results, and make recommendations. Licensees must establish, implement, and maintain a security program to monitor and respond to unauthorized access to radioactive material. Specific requirements are detailed in following sections, including the need for a security plan, procedures, and training. The section mandates licensees to have a written security plan tailored to their facilities, detailing measures and resources for implementation. The plan must be approved by the individual responsible for the security program. Training is required to ensure personnel possess the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively carry out security duties. The section mandates licensees to have a written security plan tailored to their facilities, detailing measures and resources for implementation. This plan must include instruction in the licensee's security program, reporting responsibilities, prompt reporting to law enforcement of threats to material, and how to respond to security alarms. Licensees are also required to protect security-related information and have written policies for controlling access to and protecting the security plan and procedures. Interviewees had differing opinions on the new rule's impact on licensees. The new rule in 10 CFR 37 is seen as a one size fits all approach by the RSO, leading to concerns about increased time for compliance, varying interpretations among states and NRC, and challenges with paperwork and document security on a university campus. The requirement for a detailed security plan is viewed as creating vulnerabilities. The concern on a university campus is that a detailed security plan could create vulnerabilities if accessed by a terrorist. NRC finds it easier to inspect a written plan than to discuss it orally, putting the burden on the licensee. There is a new requirement for annual security training, which is time-consuming for individuals with access. Online refresher courses are allowed for health and safety but not for security training due to the sensitive nature of the material. Multiple training sessions are needed to cover all individuals with unescorted access to material every year. The concern about information security in various industries, such as steel mills and hospitals, arises due to the challenge of limiting access to sensitive information. There is a disparity in regulations between the nuclear industry and other industries posing health and safety risks. For example, tanker trucks carrying dangerous chemicals are less regulated than nuclear materials. Tanker trucks carrying dangerous chemicals can go through large cities. Licensees must coordinate with local law enforcement agencies for armed response to threats. Cooperation between licensees and LLEAs is reported to be excellent. Security orders have promoted working relationships between parties. The security orders have led to improved relationships between licensees and local law enforcement agencies (LLEAs). Training and partnerships formed under the orders prepare everyone for the implementation of 10 CFR 37. LLEAs with homeland security grants are more aware of potential threats from radioactive materials. Improved relationships between licensees and local law enforcement agencies (LLEAs) have led to increased awareness of potential threats from radioactive materials post-9/11. LLEAs now work closely with licensees, conduct security inspections, have alarms linked to police headquarters, and provide armed escort of radioactive material within their jurisdictions. Some police departments, including those in large cities, prioritize Advanced Radiological Response Techniques training at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee. However, some LLEAs may not cooperate fully due to budget constraints and distance issues. An Agreement State official noted the lack of mechanisms to enforce cooperation with NRC requirements. Local law enforcement agencies want to cooperate but are hesitant to commit to specific obligations. Local law enforcement agencies are willing to cooperate but are hesitant to commit to specific obligations. NRC wants theft of radioactive sources to be a priority for law enforcement, but it may not happen due to other emergency situations taking precedence. Licensees try to involve law enforcement in security measures, but ultimately have no control over their actions. The licensee must ensure that category 1 and 2 materials are within security zones, allowing unescorted access through physical barriers or direct control. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the isolation approach due to vague requirements for control at access points. The industrial radiographer expressed concerns about the burdensome requirements of 10 CFR 37, particularly regarding security zones for industries using radioactive sources. He believes existing security measures in steel mills are sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to radioactive sources, making additional security zones excessive and burdensome for licensees. The industrial radiographer is concerned about the burdensome requirements of 10 CFR 37, especially regarding security zones for industries using radioactive sources. An Agreement State official mentioned confusion about where security zones should be established, while another official appreciates the rule's flexibility. Section 37.49 mandates continuous monitoring and detection of unauthorized entries into security zones. The section of 10 C.F.R. 37 discussed in the curr_chunk outlines detailed methods for monitoring and detecting unauthorized access to security zones containing radioactive material. This includes using intrusion detection systems, video surveillance, electronic sensors, and physical checks. Immediate assessment of unauthorized entry, communication maintenance, and requesting armed response by law enforcement in case of theft or sabotage are also required. Some interviewees were uncertain about the security features needed for compliance with regulations on radioactive material. NNSA's Global Threat Reduction Initiative was seen as helpful in setting up security systems. Concerns were raised about the requirement for a weekly inventory of category 2 sources, especially for companies with sources spread across multiple locations. The requirement for weekly verification of category 2 sources in 10 C.F.R. 37.49(a)(3)(ii) is a logistical burden for companies with numerous sources. Concerns were raised about the impracticality of weekly checks for companies with thousands of sources, leading to excessive radiation exposure for employees. Some suggest adopting the British model for evaluating physical protection measures. The British model involves centrally reviewing hospital security plans before purchasing new equipment or installations to ensure agreement on necessary security measures. In contrast, the U.S. procedure involves rules printed in the Federal Register, with guidance documents providing detailed compliance information. Regulatory authorities do not approve licensee's security measures. Regulatory authorities like the NRC or an Agreement State do not pre-approve licensee's security measures. Instead, they inspect the facility after the measures are in place to ensure compliance with the rules. Licensees can choose their own approaches to meet the requirements. Section 37.51 mandates maintenance and testing of security systems, with testing frequency recommended by the manufacturer or at least once every 12 months. The RSO at a large university found the testing frequency problematic. The final rule mandates maintenance and testing of security systems, with testing frequency recommended by the manufacturer or at least once every 12 months. Quarterly testing was deemed too frequent due to the risk of damaging items like magnetic door switches and plastic access controls. Some systems require minimal maintenance but still need weekly testing. The change in the final rule is seen as not an improvement. The final rule mandates maintenance and testing of security systems, with testing frequency recommended by the manufacturer or at least once every 12 months. The change in the final rule is not seen as an improvement, as it may require more frequent testing than before. Licensees with mobile devices containing radioactive material must have two independent physical controls. Security of mobile sources has not been a problem, with only a recent incident of a stolen radiography camera in Texas. The stolen radiography camera in Texas had small radioactive sources, but since the material was iridium-192 with a short half-life, it is unlikely to be used for terrorist purposes. Security program reviews are required annually, with some licensees finding the requirements excessive while others find them necessary. The university police department mandated periodic security system reviews two years ago, which have proven valuable. Licensees must immediately report theft or sabotage of material and notify authorities within four hours. An RSO at a large university had an experience related to this provision. An RSO at a large university had an experience where a State Police Officer in uniform drove up to their reactor, prompting notification to the LLEA. The officer, a State Police captain, promised to not repeat the incident. The RSO suggests flexibility in reporting incidents to the NRC, especially if they turn out to be non-threatening. The NRC clarifies that notification is only necessary if the situation warrants contacting an LLEA. The licensee only needs to contact NRC about suspicious activities if it has contacted an LLEA. A key assertion is that Subpart D should have been placed in Title 49 of the U.S. Code for flexibility in implementation by Agreement States. This was exemplified by a State of Washington regulation preempted by the DOT in the early 1990s. The regulation of radioactive material transportation could be preempted by the DOT, raising concerns about restrictions on routing, unreasonable fees, and compliance complexities. This could lead to burdens on shippers and carriers of category 1 and 2 materials. Licensees transferring radioactive material must verify the recipient's license. In emergencies, a written certification by the transferee can be accepted temporarily. The shipper found it easy to verify licenses and noted that the emergency provision was rarely needed. \u00a737.71(c) offers an alternative method for permission in emergencies. Section 37.71(c) provides an alternative method for obtaining permission in emergency situations, which has rarely been needed according to a shipper. Advanced planning is crucial for category 1 and category 2 shipments. Compliance with the provisions of Subpart D may be complex due to the numerous referenced provisions. A shipper mentioned that his company had already implemented many of these provisions due to previous NRC orders, particularly for radioactive material quantities of concern. Subpart D was not seen as burdensome. The Subpart D requirements for transportation of radioactive material quantities of concern (RAMQC) do not add significant burdens beyond existing NRC orders. Compliance involves updating transportation security plans and developing procedures for route notifications and delivery times. Licensees must conduct detailed preplanning and coordination for category 1 material shipments, including identifying safe havens along the route. The NRC requires licensees to identify safe havens along the planned route for category 1 shipments of radioactive material. Safe havens are sites with security where the transport crew can notify and wait for emergency response. Licensees must provide advance notification of category 1 shipments to NRC and state governors. The NRC requires licensees to identify safe havens along the planned route for category 1 shipments of radioactive material. Safe havens are sites with security where the transport crew can notify and wait for emergency response. Licensees must provide advance notification of category 1 shipments to NRC and state governors. Shipments must adhere to detailed requirements for physical protection during shipment, including continuous monitoring by telemetric systems for road and rail transport. The NRC requires licensees to identify safe havens along the planned route for category 1 shipments of radioactive material, with detailed requirements for physical protection during shipment. Shipments by rail are considered secure, although air shipments are not addressed in Section 37.79. Imports and exports by sea pose challenges due to coordination with ship schedules and potential delays. The NRC requires licensees to identify safe havens along the planned route for category 1 shipments of radioactive material. Shipments by rail are considered secure, but imports and exports by sea face challenges due to potential delays in ship schedules. Delays in ship departures can lead to compliance issues with NRC orders, as seen in a case where a ship from Baltimore was delayed for 48 hours, causing material to be stuck at a truck stop instead of a secure port. Reporting requirements for lost or missing materials are outlined in Section 37.81, with notifications to LLEA and NRC within specified timeframes. The transition from security orders to a rule is a topic of debate among radiation professionals. Some believe the orders should have been codified into a rule, while others question the need for fundamental changes in 10 CFR 37 if the orders were already adequate. The Nuclear Energy Institute representative suggests that NRC should have codified the security orders. The NEI representative believes NRC should have codified security orders and conducted vulnerability assessments. An industrial radiographer mentioned the financial burden and retraining required to comply with the new rule. Agreement State officials initially preferred codifying the security orders but the new rule reflects a consensus of ideas from both Agreement States and USNRC. The new rule combines all security rules into one regulation, making it more efficient for regulators and the regulated community. A university RSO appreciates that 10 CFR 37 consolidates multiple orders into one new part of 10 CFR, simplifying compliance. An Agreement State official also supports having a rule over orders for easier enforcement. The legal staff believes it is easier to enforce a rule than an order. NRC's rulemaking process received mixed feedback from radiation professionals. Some felt NRC was responsive, while others did not. An industrial radiographer mentioned that provisions in the Increased Controls order were removed due to opposition. NRC incorporated these provisions into a draft of Part 37, which faced strong opposition. Testimonies were given to NRC, leading to acceptance of some feedback. However, many in the industry were unaware of the draft Part 37 until late, suggesting NRC could have improved communication with licensees. The NRC received mixed feedback on its rulemaking process from radiation professionals. Some felt the NRC was responsive, while others did not. A Nuclear Energy Institute representative mentioned that security orders lacked vulnerability assessments, leading to unclear justification for enhancements. NRC issued security orders for specific licensees and increased security requirements based on vulnerability assessments. The NRC merged separate security requirements for different licensees into a complex rule applicable to all, including nuclear power plants. Feedback from the CRCPD raised concerns about certain aspects of the draft rule, such as the removal of credit history checks in favor of other tools deemed sufficient. The NRC merged security requirements for all licensees, including nuclear power plants. Feedback from the CRCPD raised concerns about the draft rule, particularly the removal of credit history checks in favor of other tools deemed sufficient. Agreement State officials worked closely with NRC to develop the rule, expressing satisfaction with the level of security provided. The NRC conducted outreach activities for the rule, including public meetings and comment periods lasting over six months. Stakeholder comments were used to develop guidance documents accompanying the ICs. The NRC conducted outreach activities for the rule, including public meetings and comment periods lasting over six months. The proposed rule was made available for public comment, along with information on guidance documents and public meetings. The NRC did not perform a new vulnerability assessment for the rule, but the original assessment provided security enhancements applicable to both the ICs and Part 37. All Orders contained requirements for access control, detection of unauthorized access, and transportation security. Licensees can tailor their security measures based on the performance-based nature of the Orders and 10 CFR Part 37. The Orders and 10 CFR Part 37 allow licensees to customize their security plans. The main difference is the removal of specific timelines, now requiring actions to be taken \"immediately\" and \"without delay.\" The NRC does not have specific threat information but acknowledges a general threat of groups interested in using radioactive material for terrorism. Some radiation professionals have mixed views on the need for a design basis threat for radioactive materials. Some professionals have concerns about the need for a design basis threat (DBT) for radioactive materials. One industrial radiographer questions the necessity of specifying a DBT, citing past incidents of theft. Another professional raises practical challenges in implementing a DBT, such as the difficulty in guarding against different threats for each Category 1 or 2 device. The issue of requiring armed guards at every source is also highlighted as a potential financial burden. Requiring armed guards at every irradiator or source for Category 1 or 2 devices could put research and medical licensees out of business. The lack of a design basis threat (DBT) could lead to varying security levels and practices at different facilities, as each site develops security based on their own understanding of regulations and potential threats. An Agreement State official believes a tailored DBT for each facility may not be feasible. The need for a design basis threat (DBT) for each facility is questioned, as security measures are tailored to specific vulnerabilities. The [city] Police Department conducts security inspections, and organizations consult with security professionals to address specific threats. NRC does not require a DBT but has communicated security program requirements clearly. The NRC has clearly communicated security program requirements without the need for a Design Basis Threat (DBT) for most licensees. An Agreement State official also found a DBT inappropriate for many licensees, questioning the necessity for one for most radioactive sources. Design Basis Threats are more applicable to nuclear power plants and facilities with large amounts of radioactive material. The difficulty in formulating 10 C.F.R. 37 was finding the right balance between a performance-based vs. a prescriptive rule for security programs. The former specifies desired results, like detecting theft of radioactive material, while the latter details how security should be achieved. The rule for adequate security in handling radioactive material includes specific requirements like iris scanners and direct links to police alarm stations. There are concerns about whether the rule is too generic and does not account for varying security needs among different licensees. The implementation document will provide more details on compliance. The NRC's security order and guidance are broadly written, allowing licensees to determine specific security measures needed for their facilities. Tailoring security to fit a facility's needs is crucial, especially for commercial facilities with limited resources. Implementing costly security requirements like cameras and surveillance equipment could impact smaller medical facilities' operations. The NRC acknowledges the need for a flexible approach due to diverse economic conditions, facility types, layouts, and operations. The NRC's security order allows facilities to tailor security measures to their specific needs. Some facilities have implemented significant security upgrades, while others have minimal security measures. The diversity in organizations using radioactive materials makes a one-size-fits-all approach impractical. The implementation document will clarify compliance with performance-based regulations. Some feel the rule is too rigid, while others appreciate the flexibility of a performance-based approach. The new rule on performance-based regulation allows flexibility for diverse organizations using radioactive materials, addressing differing business models and compliance methods. Both industrial radiographers and Agreement State officials support the rule's flexibility, despite some concerns about wording. The rule builds on over a decade of experience with performance-based regulation in the industry. The new rule on performance-based regulation provides flexibility for diverse organizations using radioactive materials. It tightens some initial orders with prescriptive requirements while allowing performance-based implementation. Stakeholders, including Agreement State officials and a university RSO, feel the balance between prescriptive and performance-based aspects is appropriate. Many have lobbied for more performance-based requirements from the NRC. Some stakeholders are now complaining that they would like the new rule to be more prescriptive, despite NRC's efforts to provide detailed guidance on implementation. NRC intends to publish supplemental guidance documents based on experiences from the increased controls program to assist with implementation. Compared to previous orders, the final rule is seen as more prescriptive and a one-size-fits-all set of regulations. The new rule mandates a one-size-fits-all approach to security regulations for licensees, regardless of their specific needs. Some stakeholders feel that security measures should be tailored to the level of risk posed by different types of radioactive materials and facilities. The new rule mandates a one-size-fits-all approach to security regulations for licensees, regardless of their specific needs. There are concerns about the impact of this rule, as it will require significant time for compliance and result in 38 different interpretations due to the involvement of 37 Agreement States plus NRC. The Advisory Council on the Medical Uses of Isotopes has expressed concerns about the expansion of requirements under the proposed Part 37, citing the scarcity of resources affecting radiation security programs. Radiation professionals are facing challenges due to scarcity of resources, impacting inspections and verification processes. Budget cuts have reduced the number of inspectors, leading to delays in compliance with security regulations. Contacting licensees' jurisdictions for verification is hindered by understaffing and lack of resources, causing difficulties in ensuring compliance with 10 CFR Part 30. The NRC requires licensees to verify recipients' authorization to possess radioactive material under 10 CFR Part 30. To prevent counterfeit licenses, verification must be done through the License Verification System. Some officials express concerns about the ability to promulgate new rules due to economic challenges. The implementation of new NRC rules poses financial challenges for licensees, with estimated costs of $23,375 one-time and $21,736 annually per licensee. States can face heightened oversight if inadequate in public safety, as seen in [my state] which improved after budget cuts. The NRC rule imposes minimum requirements to protect public health and safety. The GTRI program provides security upgrades to facilities with radioactive material on a voluntary basis. This includes assessments and recommendations for security upgrades such as iris scanners and infrared cameras. GTRI provides security upgrades to facilities with radioactive material, including iris scanners, infrared cameras, backup power supply, and communication links. They also offer training for law enforcement personnel and conduct exercises nationwide. NRC sets minimum standards for security, while GTRI provides a higher level of security, particularly focusing on threats posed by insiders. Licensees must grant unescorted access only to trustworthy personnel. GTRI provides enhanced security measures for facilities with radioactive material, focusing on preventing theft by insiders. Licensees must only allow access to trustworthy personnel. Despite not being under NRC jurisdiction, GTRI's security measures are valued by radiation professionals. The NNSA's Global Threat Reduction Initiative installed valuable security equipment at a university reactor building. Despite some concerns about cost and complexity, most found the system to be effective. An industrial radiographer is interested in GTRI's approach to security and hopes for assistance in enhancing their facility's security measures. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) has enhanced security at various facilities, including a university reactor building. GTRI provided security devices and conducted tabletop exercises involving multiple stakeholders. This collaborative effort led to significant security improvements. GTRI enhances security through relationships with stakeholders at different levels, offering training programs for security forces. Partnerships are strengthened through coordinated response plans and real-world exercises. Police departments voluntarily send officers to GTRI's training courses at the Y-12 National Security Complex. The NNSA has conducted tabletop exercises in various states to prepare emergency responders for scenarios like evacuating a city due to a dirty bomb. These exercises help identify available resources and address potential challenges. Additionally, the Global Threat Reduction Initiative has worked with states to enhance security measures and install security systems. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative has worked with states to enhance security measures and install security systems. Some organizations have declined to use GTRI due to concerns about complexity, lack of personnel time, and uncertainty of funds for maintenance. Should trustworthiness and reliability screening be enhanced for individuals with unescorted access to radiation sources? Some radiation professionals are comfortable with their organizations' trust and reliability procedures, while others have concerns about determining who should adjudicate decisions, varying standards, potential lawsuits, lack of clear standards, and difficulty in decision-making based on incomplete information. The current system for trust and reliability decisions may be inadequate due to incomplete information and lack of training. While there has been only one case of theft of radioactive material since 9/11, the potential consequences of an error in trust and reliability determination could be severe. To improve adjudication, clearer standards could be set by the NRC, similar to the State Department's guidelines for access to classified information. The guidelines for granting security clearance are detailed and require a common sense judgment based on thirteen specific criteria. These standards can also be applied outside of security clearance contexts. The Federal Select Agents Program, operated by the CDC, follows similar guidelines for trust and reliability decisions. The Federal Select Agents Program, operated by the CDC and APHIS, oversees possession of biological agents and toxins with potential threats. An alternative approach for trust and reliability decisions involves a bioterrorism security risk assessment process for vetting individuals for access to select agents or toxins. The FBI and APHIS or CDC make decisions on access to select agents after a background check. The FBI's CJIS performs a Security Risk Assessment based on criminal history records. The CDC then sends an authorization or denial letter to the Responsible Official. The Responsible Official is responsible for controlling access to select agents. NRC could provide training for personnel making access decisions. Difficult cases could be resolved by denying access to certain materials. Background investigations of foreign nationals may be challenging. Federal agencies could adjudicate difficult cases for a more thorough investigation. The NRC proposed that a federal agency could adjudicate cases for a more thorough background investigation and reduce the risk of lawsuits. Individuals granted T&R status may need a Secret clearance, defined as information that could cause serious damage to national security if disclosed. NRC highlighted the potential risks of deliberate malevolent acts with unescorted access to radioactive materials. The NRC proposed additional fingerprint requirements to protect public health and safety and the common defense and security. The release of certain radioactive material could cause serious damage to national security. This recommendation would result in changes to regulations and regulatory burden, requiring additional analysis. The NRC proposed additional fingerprint requirements to protect public health and safety and the common defense and security, which would result in changes to regulations and regulatory burden. Additional analysis and possibly legislative changes would be needed to implement such a recommendation, aiming to ensure individuals granted T&R status are trustworthy and reliable. The rule imposes requirements on licensees, with a larger burden on small licensees compared to larger ones, regardless of facility size. The rule imposes a layered defense approach to enhance security post-9/11, with a focus on personnel reliability, intrusion detection, and police response. Vulnerabilities are inevitable, but the offsetting strengths of each layer can improve security over time. As monitoring equipment increases and law enforcement becomes more familiar with rapid response needs, security is expected to increase gradually. The gradual accretion of security measures post-9/11 has made the United States safer but cannot guarantee safety. Further steps like a more rapid rollout of GTRI or federal adjudication of T&R applications could increase security. Radiation professionals have varying views on rule changes, with further changes potentially being desirable. Appendix A of 10 C.F.R. 37 defines \"byproduct material\" as any radioactive material produced or made radioactive during the process of producing special nuclear material. It also includes radium-226 sources and materials made radioactive by particle accelerators for commercial, medical, or research purposes. Further consultation with radiation professionals may be beneficial for any changes related to this definition. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines \"byproduct material\" as radioactive material produced during the production of special nuclear material, including radium-226 sources and materials made radioactive by particle accelerators for commercial, medical, or research purposes. Additionally, the Commission regulates certain naturally occurring radioactive materials that pose a similar threat to public health and safety as radium-226. In response to the 9/11 attacks, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued security orders to licensees to enhance the security of radioactive materials. These orders apply to licensees of panoramic and underwater irradiators with more than 10,000 curies of material, manufacturers and distributors of radioactive material, and licensees transporting radioactive materials in quantities of concern. More details can be found on the NRC website. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued an Increased Controls order for licensees possessing certain radioactive materials above specified quantities of concern to enhance security measures. Licensees were required to implement additional controls such as restricting access to trustworthy personnel, monitoring unauthorized access, following specific shipping procedures, and obtaining approval for added security measures for shipping category 1 material. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued an Increased Controls order for licensees possessing radioactive materials to enhance security measures, including fingerprinting and background checks for individuals with unescorted access to certain materials. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued fingerprinting orders to licensees for enhanced security measures, including background checks for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials. This requirement was also imposed by Agreement States on their licensees. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued fingerprinting orders for enhanced security, requiring background checks for individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials. Non-M&D service provider Licensees were not required to undergo background investigations, leading to unequal access control at facilities. NRC is now imposing trustworthiness requirements to ensure equal access for all service providers. NRC is imposing trustworthiness and reliability requirements for unescorted access to radionuclides of concern, as set forth in this Order, to ensure equal access for all service providers."
