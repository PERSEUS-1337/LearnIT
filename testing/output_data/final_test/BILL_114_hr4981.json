    "content": "The Act titled \"Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act\" aims to address the public health epidemic of opioid use disorder by increasing awareness and access to treatment options, overdose reversal, and relapse prevention. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to require practitioners to have the capacity to provide drugs for opioid use disorder treatment, including maintenance, detoxification, and overdose reversal. Practitioners must have the capacity to provide opioid use disorder treatment, including maintenance, detoxification, overdose reversal, and relapse prevention. The total number of patients a practitioner can treat at one time is initially 30, but can increase to 100 with approval from the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to adjust the total number of patients allowed. The Secretary may exclude patients directly administered drugs by the practitioner in the office setting. If the total number of patients a practitioner can treat is increased, written agreements with patients are required for assessments, treatment plans, medication adherence, and understanding of treatment options. The practitioner must understand treatment options for opioid use disorder, including FDA-approved drugs and the importance of counseling for recovery. They must also comply with reporting requirements to the Secretary. In subparagraph (G), the practitioner must comply with reporting requirements to the Secretary. The practitioner must complete 8 hours of training provided by specific organizations for the treatment of opiate-dependent patients. The training for opioid treatment must cover opioid maintenance, detoxification, clinical use of FDA-approved drugs, patient assessments, treatment planning, overdose reversal, counseling, staffing roles, diversion control, and other best practices. The term 'qualifying practitioner' refers to a qualifying physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant who meets specific criteria. The nurse practitioner or physician assistant must be licensed to prescribe certain medications for pain treatment and complete 24 hours of training on addiction medicine topics provided by specific organizations. The nurse practitioner or physician assistant must have specific training and experience determined by the Secretary to treat opiate-dependent patients. They must also be supervised or work in collaboration with a qualified healthcare provider. The nurse practitioner or physician assistant must have specific training and experience determined by the Secretary to treat opiate-dependent patients. They must also be supervised or work in collaboration with a qualified healthcare provider. The Secretary may review and update the requirements for being a qualifying other practitioner under this clause. The Secretary will update treatment guidelines for opioid-dependent patients in office-based settings within a year of the Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act. The Secretary may recommend revoking or suspending a practitioner's registration for noncompliance with Controlled Substances Act requirements. The Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review opioid treatment services in the US every 5 years and submit reports to Congress. The Act also amends the definition of opioids in the Controlled Substances Act. The Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review opioid treatment services every 5 years and report findings to Congress. The report must assess compliance with Controlled Substances Act requirements, measures taken to ensure compliance, the need to adjust patient limits for waivered practitioners, and the FDA's involvement. The Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review opioid treatment services every 5 years. This includes assessing the use of FDA-approved treatments, access to counseling and recovery support services, changes in state or local policies, and the use of prescription drug monitoring programs by practitioners with waivers. The Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act mandates the review of opioid treatment services every 5 years, including assessing FDA-approved treatments, access to counseling, state policies, and collaboration between Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration for effective opioid use disorder treatment expansion. The Sense of Congress is to consider raising the total number of patients a qualifying physician can treat to 250 after submitting a third notification, following previous notifications to treat up to 100 patients. Additionally, there is a provision for partial fills of Schedule II controlled substances. The Controlled Substances Act allows for partial fills of Schedule II controlled substances under certain conditions, including compliance with state laws and regulations. The Controlled Substances Act allows partial fills of Schedule II controlled substances, with restrictions on total quantity dispensed and time limits for filling remaining portions. In emergency situations, partially filled prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances must be filled within 72 hours of issuance. This does not affect the Attorney General's authority to allow partial fills for Schedule III, IV, or V substances. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 11, 2016. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
