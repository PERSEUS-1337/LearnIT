    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Accelerating Kids' Access to Care Act\" and aims to streamline the screening and enrollment process for eligible out-of-state Medicaid providers and suppliers. The \"Accelerating Kids' Access to Care Act\" amends the Social Security Act to implement a streamlined screening and enrollment process for eligible out-of-state providers and suppliers in Medicaid. The State plan must be simplified and streamlined according to specific requirements. An eligible out-of-state provider or supplier is defined as one located in another state with limited risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. The requirements for this process are outlined in subparagraph (D). An eligible out-of-State provider or supplier enrolled in the program established under this title is enrolled in the State plan without additional screening. The streamlined screening and enrollment process allows eligible out-of-State providers to be enrolled for 5 years without revalidation. They can order necessary follow-up care, including prescribing medications. The Secretary will establish a process for coordination with Medicare enrollment. The Secretary will establish a streamlined screening and enrollment process for providers to enroll in both Medicare and Medicaid programs simultaneously. Conforming amendments will be made to the Social Security Act to facilitate this process. The amendments made to the Social Security Act will streamline the enrollment process for providers to enroll in both Medicare and Medicaid programs simultaneously. The effective date for these amendments is January 1, 2019, with exceptions for state legislation. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments to the Social Security Act, but failure to meet these requirements before the specified deadline will not result in non-compliance with the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
